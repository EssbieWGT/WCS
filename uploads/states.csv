Free.,"Trump’s DEI ban in K-12 schools, higher ed ruled ‘unlawful’ by federal judge",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trumps-dei-ban-k-12-schools-higher-ed-ruled-unlawful-federal-judge,,"WASHINGTON —  A federal judge in Maryland has struck down the U.S. Education Department’s attempts to do away with diversity, equity and inclusion practices in schools.The Thursday ruling marks a blow to President Donald Trump’s administration as it continues to take significant strides to try to crack down on DEI efforts across the federal government.U.S. District Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher found both an agency Dear Colleague letter threatening to yank federal funds for schools from K-12 through colleges and universities that use race-conscious practices in aspects of student life and a memo ordering state education leaders to certify compliance to be “unlawful,” vacating the two.Gallagher’s ruling follows a lawsuit from the American Federation of Teachers union and its affiliate, AFT-Maryland, as well as the American Sociological Association and a public school district in Oregon.She noted that both the letter and certification requirement are “unconstitutionally vague.”Gallagher is one of three federal judges who blocked different parts of the agency’s initiatives back in April, which brought enforcement of the letter and the memo on certifying compliance to a halt.“The administration is entitled to express its viewpoints and to promulgate policies aligned with those viewpoints,” wrote Gallagher, who was appointed by Trump. “But it must do so within the procedural bounds Congress has outlined. And it may not do so at the expense of constitutional rights.”Feb. 14 letter to statesThe department drew swift legal action after sending a Feb. 14 letter to school districts that threatened to rescind federal funds for schools that use race-conscious practices in programming, admissions, scholarships and other aspects of student life.The letter gave a sweeping interpretation of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2023, which struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions.The four-page letter raised a myriad of questions for schools over what exactly fell within the requirements. The department in March issued a Frequently Asked Questions document on the letter in an attempt to provide more guidance.Adding fuel to the fire, the department in April gave state education leaders just days to certify all K-12 schools in their states were complying with the letter in order to keep receiving federal financial assistance.Reaction from department, union“While the Department is disappointed in the judge’s ruling, judicial action enjoining or setting aside this guidance has not stopped our ability to enforce Title VI protections for students at an unprecedented level,” a spokesperson for the department said in a statement shared with States Newsroom on Friday.“The Department remains committed to its responsibility to uphold students’ anti-discrimination protections under the law,” the spokesperson added.Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said “the court agreed that this vague and clearly unconstitutional requirement is a grave attack on students, our profession, honest history, and knowledge itself,” in a Thursday statement.Weingarten added that “it would hamper efforts to extend access to education, and dash the promise of equal opportunity for all, a central tenet of the United States since its founding.”",,,,2025-08-15 11:59:30.344018

A total of 60% of respondents support the use of tariffs as part of U.S. trade policy, and 34% oppose, with most opposition coming from Democrats and just under half of self-described independents. 
Slightly less approve of the Trump administration’s handling of trade policy, with 57% approving and 39% disapproving, with opposition again coming from Democrats and nearly half of independents. 
A total of 33% of respondents said their own financial situation would be better off because of the Trump trade policies, 32% said they’d be worse off, and another 35% said their situation would be about the same. 
Data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Aug. 12 showed a slight 0.2% rise in the Consumer Price Index in July over the previous month. Other CPI figures excluding food and energy prices rose 0.3%, or 3.1% higher than the past year, signaling that inflationary pressure is growing. 
The bureau also released Producer Price Index data on Aug. 14, showing a 0.9% increase over June with the wholesale inflation rate up from 2.4% to 3.3% between June and July, another indication of higher inflation. 
“The economy is slowing down and I think we’re going to have slow growth for a while, and I think people are going to see some of the effects of the tariffs maybe coming up more so than they have already,” said John Bitzan, Menard Family Director of the Sheila and Robert Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth at North Dakota State University. 
Bitzan said the on-again, off-again nature of the Trump administration trade negotiations and tariff policies has businesses in a state of uncertainty, even with recent reprieves of 90 days for further negotiations with China and Mexico. 
“That uncertainty makes businesses less willing to invest in capital equipment, but it also makes them less willing to invest in employees and hiring,” Bitzan said. 
Arik Spencer, CEO of the Greater North Dakota Chamber of Commerce, said support for tariffs appears to track in general with support for Trump’s trade and other policies. 
“In terms of how it’s going to impact people, I think the verdict is still out on a lot of that,” Spencer said. “From a business perspective, a variety of inputs have seen impacts but that hasn’t quite trickled down to the consumer.” 
On the Fourth of July, Trump signs his ‘big, beautiful bill’ into law

Spencer said he felt there was broad support for fair trade, but that business people also want certainty going forward. 
“With the volatile scenario we’re in related to tariffs and 90-day extensions, that kind of makes it hard to plan out,” he said. “Everyone supports reindustrializing the United States, but those conversations take a long time, from site selection to where you’re going to make investments.” 
Of Trump’s handling of the economy since he took office, 45% said they were better off, 33% worse off, and 21% about the same. Support for Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” was also strong, but with most Democrats and a large segment of independents dissenting. Overall, 55% of all respondents support and 36% oppose the bill. 
Asked if the country was on the right or wrong track, 58% believe it is on the right track and 38% said it was on the wrong track. 
 Solid support for Trump on immigration

The poll also showed strong support for Trump administration immigration policies, with 65% approving of mass deportations and 32% opposed. 
  (Graphic by Troy Becker/The Forum

Asked if mass deportations of undocumented immigrants would do significant harm to North Dakota’s agricultural industry, 64% said it would not harm the industry, tracking closely with support for the deportation policies. 
Longer term, however, the U.S. will need to address workforce challenges due to demographic shifts, analysts said. 
“While we have to have an immigration policy that respects our borders, we’re not really talking about overhauling our immigration system in the US,” Spencer said. “There’s not enough babies being born to replace the baby boomers leaving the workforce.” 
Bitzan said, like tariffs, the impacts of the current immigration policies would likely be felt down the road. 
“We know that we don’t have enough workers in our economy to sustain growth, and so we need more immigration, not less immigration, and I think that the effects of that are going to become apparent later as well,” Bitzan said. 
 Optimism on North Dakota economy

Overall, of the 625 regular voters polled, most are rosy on North Dakota’s economic and overall prospects. 
A total of 74% felt the economy in the state was either excellent or good, while only 26% said it was fair or poor. 
Those numbers match closely with whether people believe the state is on the right or wrong track, with 72% saying it is on the right track and 24% more negative on the future trajectory.

“I think by and large, people do have confidence in our state economy and the U.S. economy,” Spencer said. “I think there is some concern that as inflation is trickling a little bit higher, the impact that has on our national outlook.” 
Most respondents didn’t believe recent geopolitical events in the Middle East related to Israel and Iran would have an impact on North Dakota’s energy industry. A total of 40% said it would likely improve because of those events, with 46% saying it would remain the same. 
The North Dakota Poll, initiated by the North Dakota News Cooperative, was conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy, Inc. of Jacksonville, Florida. From Aug. 4 through Aug. 6, a total of 625 adult regular voters were interviewed statewide by phone. The margin of error is no more than plus or minus 4%, according to the polling firm. 
The final story on the latest poll data will look at attitudes toward spending from the Legacy Fund and property taxes. 
A total of 155 respondents were in Fargo-Cass County, 155 in eastern North Dakota, 120 in the Bismarck-Mandan region, and another 195 in western North Dakota. Quotas were assigned to reflect voter turnout by county.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)EDITOR’S NOTE: The Arkansas Times first reported on the court documents used in this story.
 
One of the Arkansas attorneys who led a paternity suit against Hunter Biden has been accused of domestic violence and abusing alcohol and prescription drugs by his attorney wife in court papers filed Wednesday.
Saline County lawyer and Republican activist Clint Lancaster “has a long history of prescription drug and alcohol abuse, unresolved anger issues, and unstable mental health,” Jennifer Lancaster said in an affidavit filed along with a petition for separate maintenance and support in Saline County Circuit Court. She also seeks immediate, emergency custody of the couple’s two minor children.
Clint Lancaster earlier this month represented Searcy County election commissioners and election workers before the State Board of Election Commissioners who were accused of election law violations.
Jennifer Lancaster has also been a Republican activist and worked alongside her husband in the Hunter Biden paternity case. The Republican Party of Arkansas last December barred her from holding any party office for 20 years after she and the Saline County Republican Committee engaged in several disputes with state party leadership.
In a separate case in Pope County, Clint Lancaster filed a name-change petition on Aug. 5 on behalf of a 19-year-old woman in which he said the woman recently learned she is his biological daughter and “desires to take on the last name of her father and his family.” A judge granted the name change in an order filed Wednesday.
The paternity matter appears unrelated to Jennifer Lancaster’s separation filing, as Clint Lancaster’s adult daughter was born in 2006 and the Lancasters married in 2011, according to court records.
Jennifer Lancaster’s affidavit alleges that she has repeatedly arranged rehabilitation treatment for her husband — as recently as June — and covered “for his impairment” in their law practice by drafting and filing pleadings on his behalf.

JEN LANCASTER AFFIDAVIT-081325 
She stated she needs the court to intervene to “protect the children from immediate danger and preserve marital and professional assets.”
She alleges Clint Lancaster has abused alcohol and prescription medications for 10 years and has physically assaulted her in the presence of their children, causing them distress. She alleges he has left alcohol and drugs accessible to their children, including an unwrapped cannabis gummy on the youngest child’s desk.
Her husband went on a nearly two-week alcohol- and drug-fueled binge in June, “during which he threatened multiple times, in front of the children, to ‘kick my ass’ and to kill me,” Jennifer Lancaster’s affidavit alleges.
She also claims Clint Lancaster often displays an “unhealthy fixation on firearms” while intoxicated.
Her affidavit asserts that in late June she arranged for him to travel to Madison, Wisconsin, for rehab, but that during a layover in Chicago, he became combative with airline staff and was denied boarding. He then disappeared, the court filing says, only disclosing where he was after she cut off access to their bank account.
Clint Lancaster was involuntarily admitted to a Wisconsin hospital’s psychiatric ward around June 28 but left after two and a half weeks upon learning insurance wouldn’t cover the full stay, according to the affidavit. He promised to complete treatment in Arkansas, a pledge he immediately broke, Jennifer Lancaster alleges.
She says her husband has talked about taking the children to stay with associates of his in Florida, including someone “who is currently under investigation by the FBI and connected to known dangerous persons.”
The children have frequently witnessed their father passed out, acting erratically and unable to function, according to the affidavit. The children fear him, she says. She has allowed interaction with them only when she believed he was actively engaged in recovery; she says she often required him to submit to alcohol and drug tests.
Since July 20, according to the affidavit, Clint Lancaster has opened new bank accounts, obtained multiple tattoos, bought a new car and said he plans to move to Florida to live with people “who pose safety risks to the children.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lancaster-8.5.25-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-15 11:59:30.344018

Jared Polis visited the Incident Command Post for the Turner Gulch Fire in Mesa County on Aug. 14, 2025. (Gov. Jared Polis)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis on Thursday issued a broad emergency declaration covering multiple wildfires currently burning on the Western Slope and the risk of new fires as dangerous weather conditions persist in the coming weeks.
More than 2,000 local, state and federal personnel are currently battling nine large fires in Colorado, including the Lee Fire in Rio Blanco County, which as of Friday ranked as the fifth-largest fire in state history at an estimated size of 133,602 acres. Polis said in a press release that Thursday’s executive order declaring an emergency would “bolster our ability to jump on fires early” as elevated fire risk continues.
“Continuing throughout July and into August, and as part of the same prolonged weather pattern, parts of Colorado have experienced continued high temperatures, high winds, severe to extreme drought conditions, and near record level fire indices,” the order says. “Elevated fire weather and fire risk is forecast for the coming weeks.”

Drought conditions classified as “severe” or “extreme” have extended across the majority of the Western Slope for much of the summer, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. As of this week, a large area covering most of Garfield and Rio Blanco counties is now considered to be in “exceptional” drought, the monitor’s most severe classification.
Polis’ order authorizes the Colorado National Guard to assist in fire suppression efforts when requested by the state Department of Public Safety. It also directs additional state funds to replenish the Wildfire Emergency Response Fund, which reimburses local agencies for early firefighting efforts and has been nearly depleted by the active 2025 fire season.
“The state benefits from early engagement of fires with resources and operational support immediately following detection of new fire starts when possible and appropriate,” says Polis’ order. “Early attack on fires can keep those fires from becoming costlier and more dangerous events.”
Separately on Thursday, Polis visited Mesa County, where the Turner Gulch Fire has burned an estimated 31,695 acres since it was started by lightning on July 10. The governor met with firefighters at the fire’s incident command post in Grand Junction. More than 600 personnel are assigned to the fire which is estimated at 75% containment.
“Colorado is no stranger to devastating wildfires, but our experienced and dedicated emergency management staff always step up to protect Coloradans and our communities,” Polis said. “Today I was briefed on the response and containment efforts of the Turner Gulch Fire and I thanked the command center staff, emergency response staff, and firefighters on the ground running towards flames to protect us and our communities. I expressed the state’s profound gratitude for their bravery.”

,DC,2025-08-15 15:17:50+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,District of Columbia sues Trump administration over 'hostile takeover' of police force,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/district-columbia-sues-trump-administration-over-hostile-takeover-police-force,,"WASHINGTON — District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb Friday filed a suit in federal court over the Trump administration's move to take control of the Metropolitan Police Department’s 3,400 officers.The suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia argues that President Donald Trump’s Monday executive order to federalize the district’s police force “far exceeded” the president’s authority under the Home Rule Act of 1973 that allows Washingtonians to elect their local leaders, but gives Congress control over local laws and the district's budget.Trump has warned he may pursue similar action in other Democratic-led cities that he sees as having “totally out of control” crime, though experts have questioned the legality and mayors already have raised objections.“This is the gravest threat to Home Rule DC has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it,” Schwalb, a Democrat elected in 2022, wrote on social media. “The Administration's actions are brazenly unlawful. They go well beyond the bounds of the President's limited authority and instead seek a hostile takeover of MPD.”The suit also argues that Attorney General Pam Bondi’s late Thursday order that placed Drug Enforcement Administrator Terry Cole as head of the MPD is a “brazen usurpation of the district’s authority.”District Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back on Bondi’s order, and wrote on social media that “there is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.”“Let us be clear about what the law requires during a Presidential declared emergency: it requires the mayor of Washington, DC to provide the services of the Metropolitan Police Department for federal purposes at the request of the President,” she said. “We have followed the law.”The suit asks for a judge to vacate Bondi’s order and an order to prevent the Trump administration from “from issuing any future orders or directives or taking any other action that attempts to place MPD under the control of anyone other than the Mayor and the Chief of Police, otherwise assert operational control over MPD, or otherwise attempt to direct local law enforcement activities.”A hearing for a temporary restraining order is set for Friday at 2 p.m. Eastern before Judge Ana C. Reyes, who was nominated by former President Joe Biden.The suit does not challenge Trump’s decision to deploy 800 National Guard members to the district. Because the district, home to more than 700,000 residents, is not a state, the president has the sole authority over the National Guard members.Carjacking preceded Trump orderTrump earlier this week declared a “crime emergency” after a former U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, official was injured on Aug. 3 in an attempted carjacking incident around 3 a.m. Eastern near the Logan Circle neighborhood. Two Maryland teenagers were arrested on charges of unarmed carjacking in connection with the incident.Violent crime in the district is at a historic 30-year low.The suit notes Trump’s previous comments about his plans for the district, from his time as a 2024 presidential candidate to his most recent remarks about taking over control of the district while at a February press conference.“I think that we should govern the District of Columbia … I think that we should run it strong, run it with law and order, make it absolutely flawless … And I think we should take over Washington, D.C. … We should govern D.C. The federal government should take over the governance of D.C.,” Trump said in the court document.Advocates and local leaders have criticized the president’s decision, arguing that the move is nothing more than an extension of the administration’s immigration crackdown. Checkpoints have popped up all over the city in communities with a high immigrant population. Additionally, the district's police chief Thursday issued a new executive order to allow local police to aid federal officials in immigration enforcement for immigrants not in police custody.Trump praised Thursday’s executive order, calling it “a very positive thing,” especially at checkpoints in the district.“When they stop people, they find they're illegal, they report them, they give them to us,” he said.",,,,2025-08-15 11:59:30.344018
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-15 15:07:25+00:00,CT Mirror,Moms and teachers are mad about school supplies again,Chabeli Carrazana | The 19th,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/15/school-supplies-tariffs-trump/,"This year, though, it's political as tariffs drive prices up and the Trump administration makes historic cuts to public education funding.","This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.  Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Ah, a new school year. Crisp backpacks, gleaming sneakers, pressed uniforms and, of course, the collective rage of parents and teachers over school supply lists. How long they are. What’s on them. And who should foot the bill for pencils and paper, but also Clorox wipes and Kleenex. 
This year, though, those conversations, which typically clog up social media feeds as summer rolls to a close, have a new dimension. At a time when prices are creeping back up and public education is witnessing some of the steepest funding cuts in American history, the school supplies debate is a window into how families and workers are faring. 
“It’s not our job to supply all other students’ school supplies,” one mom said in a video on TikTok. “We pay taxes for that. The school should be funded to supply pencils and erasers and construction paper.” The video was then stitched together by another creator who added flashing headlines over the mom’s words: “Trump signs executive order to begin dismantling Education Department, raising questions for students and parents.” 
“I don’t have money to help Sally, John, Lucy,” another mom chimed in on TikTok. “Baby, my money, what I spend on for my kids is just for my kids. We don’t have the money to be trying to help other households…I feel like people who are in a position to help, I’m pretty sure they don’t mind helping, but it’s a lot of us that can only do for our kids.”
Teachers have spent the past couple of weeks countering. A middle school teacher in Memphis has gone viral for her response to frustrated parents: “Just so we’re clear, I’m expected to take a bullet for little Johnny and his classmates, but little Johnny’s mother does not see it fit to provide for the community with some Clorox wipes, some tissues, maybe an extra pack of pencils — that’s what we’re going with right now? I have to make the ultimate sacrifice for the community — the school — but little Johnny’s mother does not think that she has to make any sacrifices for the community.” 
Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said the debate is “exhibit A of the defunding of public schools and as a result the creation of a divisiveness that shouldn’t be there.” 
Of course parents are upset, she said. “They pay taxes, they’re like, ‘Why doesn’t the funding cover it?’” Meanwhile for teachers, the pressure is on them to fill in the gaps. “What other employee is told to basically fund their own job?” Weingarten said.
President Donald Trump has made it a priority to dismantle the Department of Education, a move Republicans as far back as Ronald Reagan have been calling for as part of an effort to remove the federal government from education, leaving curriculum and funding decisions to states and local school districts. 
Already, the Education Department’s role isn’t to dictate what is taught in schools but to dole out financial aid to college students, conduct research on education, enforce anti-discrimination laws and fund Title I K-12 schools in communities with the most need. Cutting the department will have direct consequences on discretionary funding at those Title I schools. How much schools spend on school supplies varies by district, but some don’t cover them at all. 
Since the start of the year, the Trump administration has cut about half of the staff at the Education Department. Then in June, it announced it would withhold $6 billion in funding for the upcoming school year, money that had already been allocated by Congress to go out July 1 for summer and after-school programs, as well as reading and math support and other assistance for migrant students. Then, at the end of July, following significant pressure from numerous groups, the administration reversed its decision and released the funds. 
The political ping-pong forced school districts to take money from their discretionary spending budgets to ensure summer school stayed open. That meant dipping into funding for supplies, Weingarten said. 
Meanwhile, teachers, particularly at Title I schools, are going into the year with less support, facing potentially larger class sizes, limited counseling support for students and other challenges. About 90 percent of teachers already use their own money to cover school supplies and other classroom needs — and those expenses are only going up. 
“Think about those educators who are taking money out of their own pockets, trying to stretch their own family’s budget, and at the same time how they’re feeling about the reality that their students are coming back to school and the schools have fewer resources,” said Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, the country’s largest teachers’ union. 
It’s an “affordability crisis,” Weingarten added — and that’s what’s playing out on social media. 
Inflation has started to pick back up and Trump’s tariffs of 10 percent or more on nearly all countries went into effect on August 1, raising the cost of everyday goods, particularly electronics and clothing. In July, a key measure that looks at inflation without volatile food and energy costs accelerated, indicating companies are starting to pass tariff increases on to consumers. Big-box retailers such as Walmart have indicated they will start to raise prices, and economists are warning that larger increases are on the horizon. 
All of it is affecting how parents approach back-to-school shopping this year. 
Data from the National Retail Federation found that families planned to shrink their back-to-school budgets to an average of about $858 from $874 last year. About half of shoppers were starting their shopping earlier this year, specifically to avoid markups from tariffs. During Amazon’s Prime Day event July 8 to 11, sales of school supplies (backpacks, lunchboxes, binders, calculators and kids’ apparel) were up 175 percent over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. One U.S. News survey from late July found 85 percent of parents are concerned about rising back-to-school prices due to tariffs. 
“A lot of these more or less low-cost, mass-produced items are just simply not made in the U.S. so there are necessarily going to be price hikes on things like pencils and crayons and backpacks and things we just don’t make here anymore,” said Alex Jacquez, the chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning think tank. “We are not going to move pencil factories back to the United States.”
The debate over school supplies is not all happening in a vacuum, either. Recent cuts to food assistance and Medicaid passed by Congress will reshape family budgets and require families to put more money into health care and groceries — and away from things like school supplies.
“When all of us are feeling squeezed at the grocery store, at the bank, at day care — it’s no wonder that frustrations are boiling over,” said Sondra Goldschein, the executive director of the Campaign for a Family Friendly Economy, in a statement to The 19th. “With school starting in the fall, can you blame teachers and parents — neither of whom should be on the hook for such expensive school supplies — for looking at each other and wondering who can possibly afford another hit to their family’s budget?”
Low-income families, predominantly families of color, will feel the squeeze the most both in their own budgets and cuts to school budgets. Wage growth has slowed for the poorest families and Black workers, who have faced the brunt of cuts to government jobs, including many diversity, equity and inclusion positions, have seen unemployment rates rise sharply in the past four months. 
Ailen Arreaza, the executive director of ParentsTogether, a national nonprofit that works to engage parents politically, said all of it is leading to a sense of uncertainty and instability among parents as the school year begins. 
This, Arreaza said, is what shouldn’t get lost in the discourse: “What we hear from parents time and time again is that they love their teachers. The issue here is not teachers versus parents. The real problem is the slashing of education budgets and the rising costs.” 
This year, many parents are also recognizing that. Now, alongside the angry videos are dozens others like this one that a mother posted on TikTok at the end of July:
“As a parent of an upcoming third grader, nothing has pissed me off more recently than watching all of these parents have to make videos about these mile-long school lists: five boxes of Kleenex, three bottles of hand sanitizers, two the three-bottle Clorox wipes. Y’all want loose leaf paper, pens, pencils, markers, crayons, construction paper, and then have the nerve to say, ‘Don’t put your kid’s name on none of the supplies,’” the mom begins. 
“But what really takes my anger over the edge is the fact that you did not ask for nothing for yourself, baby. What do you want? As a teacher that is about to have my children from August to May for seven, eight hours a day you can have whatever you like. I’m [the rapper] T.I. You can have whatever you like.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25223804355147-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 11:59:30.344018

The two leaders then plan to hold a joint news conference following the meeting, which was confirmed by both the White House and the Kremlin, according to the political news outlet The Hill.
At least 16 protest events are scheduled to take place across Alaska from Thursday through Saturday, protesting the meeting and demonstrating solidarity with Ukraine, from Fairbanks to Kodiak to Ketchikan.

Nicole Collins is an organizer with the group Ketchikan Mayday for Democracy, which is planning a vigil on Thursday evening to show support for Ukraine.
“First and foremost, our goal is to communicate solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Ukraine, to let them know that we all watched in horror as Ukraine was invaded over three years ago now,”  she said in an interview. “Even though we’re on this island in Southeast Alaska, we are members of the human race, and we’re all part of this world, and we want them to know that we see them and we stand with them.”
Collins said the group started monthly protests in the spring, when members watched a meeting between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
“The majority of us felt like something wasn’t right,” she said, and community members have come together since to show support for Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine.
The Thursday event is also to express outrage for the president’s invitation and welcome to Putin, she said. “Our secondary goal would be to show that we just have this utter disgust in a war criminal stepping foot on our precious Alaskan soil, our U.S. soil, and that we have great concerns over the fact that our president shows every sign of admiration towards this war criminal dictator that’s coming from Russia,” she said.
Putin has been widely condemned internationally for the invasion of Ukraine, where tens of thousands of people have been killed since 2022. More than 6.9 million Ukrainians have been displaced, and more than 13,000 civilians killed, according to the United Nations, which says the true number is likely far higher. Over 1 million Russians have been killed or injured.
The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin related to war crimes. He risks being arrested if he travels to any of the 125 member states, which has impacted his ability to travel.
“This is far beyond left and right now, it’s about right and wrong,” Collins said. “And we feel like we have to speak out. We have to show our support for democracy and for decency, for honesty, for unity, not division.”
This will be the first in-person meeting between Trump and Putin since the war began.
Trump announced the meeting in Alaska last Friday, amid high-stakes negotiations around a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, but the president has not provided details on what a long-term deal would look like. Zelenskyy was not invited.
Riza Smith, an organizer based in Anchorage who served in the Air Force at JBER, said it feels like an about face for Alaska to welcome Putin.
“If Russia decides to, you know, escalate things against the U.S., we’re right nearby. If Russia decided, ‘Hey, we want this portion of land,’ or, ‘Hey, we want these resources,’ or something, we’re right nearby. So I think it impacts a lot of people a lot more strongly, especially for the military,” they said.
Various branches of the U.S. military in Alaska conduct regular exercises, as part of homeland security efforts, including patrols of the airspace and maritime border with Russia. Currently the U.S. Northern Command is conducting military drills known as Arctic Edge throughout the state.
“(For) the past 20 years, we’ve been dealing with intercept flights,” Smith said. “That’s affected our military for years. So it’s a little confusing, since about like 2015, when that kind of escalated, to see like a complete nonrecognition of them.”
In addition to protesting Putin, Smith said the planned protest actions are also condemning the Trump administration.
“I think we’re fed up with corruption. We’re fed up with people trying to take something that isn’t theirs. And I think the prime example of that is Russia and Ukraine. … Vladimir Putin has overstepped his bounds repeatedly with Ukraine. Donald Trump has overstepped his bounds repeatedly with Alaska … making these different claims, like offering to sell resources, or whatever he wants to offer people,” they said. “I think people are just kind of done with people, you know, doing something without their input.”
Smith also helped coordinate a calendar of solidarity events taking place across the state, from vigils to protest actions to a plan to unfurl a Ukrainian flag at the Delaney Park Strip in Anchorage on Friday.
“So if you just want to visit an office, that’s an option. If you want to rally hard on the side of the building, that’s an option. If you want to do sign making, if you just want to do a local community thing, or a barbecue, like, people are just kind of coming together. So it’s every kind of opportunity to just kind of build that community in Alaska.”

In a social media post, the Traverse City Democrat  shared that she had been diagnosed in the spring with a recurrence of the benign brain tumor she had removed in 2020. 
“While it is thankfully not back to the level of 2020, it still required medical intervention,” Coffia wrote in the post. “More recently, unrelated to the tumor, I received a diagnosis of a very rare form of cancer which we are fortunately catching at stage one.”
Coffia, who was treated at the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor, said she had a “positive prognosis” and was hoping to make a full recovery.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I’m incredibly thankful that advances in medical science since my craniotomy in 2020 have meant a more targeted and localized surgery was possible. I am also so thankful to share that everything went smoothly, and my doctors tell me I am on a good path to heal,” Coffia wrote.
In reaction to the news, Coffia’s colleagues have offered their support, including state Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids).
“While I have only worked with Rep. Coffia for a few months now, if there’s one thing I know about her is she’s a fighter and cancer has no idea who they picked a fight with. Give ’em Hell, Betsy. Heal up and see you on the floor soon enough,” Wooden posted.
The well wishes were bipartisan, with state Sen. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs) commenting on Coffia’s post that he was “shaken by this news” and prayed that this would be the last chapter of her illness. 
“Get well, my friend, and I look forward to both our future battles and even more to continued collaboration! Stay tough,” Damoose said.
Coffia said that while she takes time to recuperate and “may not be as visible in the state house, and in the community here in northern Michigan,” she said her legislative team would continue to serve constituents and that she would continue to contribute where she could.
“I love Northern Michigan and its residents and I’ll never stop fighting for you. You’d better believe I will work even harder to support scientific research that allowed surgeries like mine, and fight like hell for access to quality healthcare for ALL, because that is what we deserve,” Coffia concluded.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-4-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-15 11:59:30.344018
,Mississippi Today,2025-08-15 14:40:10+00:00,Mississippi Today,Thad Cochran valued constituent feedback. Roger Wicker tells Mississippians to ‘get a life.’,Adam Ganucheau,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/15/thad-cochran-wicker-constituent/,"Column: Former U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran deeply respected and valued all feedback from Mississippi voters. Current U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker tells them, ""Get a life.""","When 34-year-old Thad Cochran arrived in Washington after his first election in 1972, the Republican felt it important to document what he’d heard and learned from Mississippians on the campaign trail and share it with his young staff.
He sat down at a typewriter and wrote a memo titled “General Responsiveness” and dated March 14, 1973:

During the campaign I detected a very strong animosity among the people toward government and those associated with government bureaus and agencies. This included elected officials and those associated with them. Part of the cause of this attitude was due to a lack of feeling or understanding by government people for the needs and opinions of the average citizen. We are all in a job to represent all our constituents. We are not the bureaucracy. A constituent who asks us for help should be assured to be in need of help with our office as his last resort. A constituent who writes a letter should be made to feel by our response that he is glad he wrote us. A constituent who claims to have been wronged by the government should be assumed to be correct. Everyone should guard against developing the attitude that we are better than, smarter than or more important than any constituent. We do not hold a position of authority over any constituent. We are truly servants of the people who selected us for this job.

Every year from 1973 through 2018, over his three U.S. House terms and six U.S. Senate terms, Cochran shared that memo with every staffer who worked in his offices. The guidance, he said all those years, was a necessary reminder to show respect to the people who offer feedback or need help. He never wanted his staff or himself to forget who sent them to Washington.
The memo, like so many other things, serves as a stark reminder that Cochran was among the last in a bygone era of American politics. The perspective he wrote and shared is a far cry from what Mississippians have been getting recently from our current U.S. senators.
“Surely everybody else has better things to do with their time,” senior U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker said to a room full of constituents earlier this month when asked about calls and emails his office has been getting. After half-heartedly explaining that he does see a list of names of people who reach out to his office, he quipped: “Get a life.”
Wicker, who typically chooses his words a little more carefully, perhaps was trying to match his junior colleague’s energy.
“Why is everyone’s head exploding?” U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith said in April to Mississippi constituents who had expressed concerns over slashing federal Medicaid spending. “I can’t understand why everyone’s head is exploding.”
There are many kind staffers working for Republicans Wicker and Hyde-Smith who are helpful to Mississippi constituents in any number of ways privately or behind the scenes. These people care deeply about serving their home state and they do it well, and they cannot help how their bosses address the public. But, boy, their phones must be blowing up more than ever since the senators made these comments.
Consider, for a moment, what it means that we have devolved from having a leader who believed that “a constituent who claims to have been wronged by the government should be assumed to be correct” to one who thinks telling constituents to “get a life” is appropriate. Think about the fact that we replaced a leader who regularly reminded his staff that “we are truly servants of the people who selected us for this job” with one whose gut response to legitimate concerns from constituents is that their “heads are exploding.”
Just … wow. To call it alarming doesn’t fully encapsulate the gravity of their behavior. It’s enough to discourage even the most optimistic among us about the present and future of our state and our nation.
It’s enough to inspire you to ponder, in this intense political climate when unprecedented and harrowing federal government decisions are being made and going largely unchecked every day, whether our current U.S. senators even remember why they’re in Washington, why we sent them there.
It is necessary, in the shortest possible order, to ask and answer for ourselves what we should expect of our elected officials and whether we should feel OK about being dismissed or ignored outright like this.
You don’t have to be a Democrat to think that this behavior is out of line. Plenty of Republicans — some publicly and many privately — are increasingly disturbed by what’s happening in Washington. Regardless of your own personal political beliefs, be honest with yourself about whether you can read these comments from our senators and still feel that your best interests are being represented.
Sadly, we can no longer ask Cochran to help us answer these questions, but it sure seems clear where he’d stand. What about you?

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.
New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

Mike Kehoe announced on May 27 that he will call a special legislative session to consider disaster relief, stadium funding and spending items (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe still hasn’t confirmed whether he’ll call a special session to change the state’s congressional map, but Republican lawmakers who’ve spoken to the governor say it’s very possible.
State lawmakers and officials gathered in Sedalia on Thursday morning for the annual Governor’s Ham Breakfast. Planned remarks from the podium focused on celebrating the Missouri State Fair and local agriculture. But, as it has in previous years, politics dominated breakfast-table conversations.
The issue at hand was the effort being pushed by President Donald Trump to change the congressional map of Missouri to increase the Republican delegation by one seat, therefore decreasing the number of Democratic-held seats to just one.
Similar efforts in Texas are underway, sparking counter-efforts by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in California.
Kehoe has stopped short of confirming that he’ll call the legislature into a special session to redraw Missouri’s congressional map.
“You got to make sure on any time you call a special session, or even a regular piece of legislation during the normal process, you want to make sure that what you’re doing is in the right direction and that you have as many people on board as possible,” Kehoe told reporters at the breakfast. “And I’m not saying we are at that point or not at that point, but it’s a process.”
However, Republicans who have spoken to Kehoe about the issue say they think he will call lawmakers back to Jefferson City.
The Kansas City Star reported that Kehoe discussed redistricting with multiple top Republicans in an early August meeting. House Majority Leader Alex Riley, a Springfield Republican, was in that meeting and said he thinks it’s “pretty likely” Kehoe will call a special session.
“I’m supportive of it,” he said. “Right now, Missouri is a solidly Republican state. When you look around the rest of the country, you’ve seen Democrat states, for very long periods of time, draw their lines in such a way that they have no Republican representation or very minimal.”
Missouri House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Lee’s Summit Republican, was also in the meeting but declined to comment.
The recent push to redistrict was ignited by U.S. Rep. Bob Onder from Missouri. He told Punchbowl News that the White House wants Missouri to redraw the map and send more Republicans to the House of Representatives.
As a state senator, Onder was supportive of a 2022 effort to draw Missouri’s congressional map in such a way to give Republicans seven seats, instead of the six they currently control.
“I wasn’t successful in that effort in 2022, but it looks like we will very likely be doing that shortly,” Onder said, before adding that he’d spoken to Kehoe about the issue recently and thinks he will be calling a special session.
Onder represents the 3rd Congressional District, which nearly entirely encircles the state’s 1st and 2nd Districts.
Lt. Gov. David Wasinger, who also supports redistricting, criticized the shape of the current congressional map and blamed state lawmakers for not creating one more favorable to Republicans in 2022.
“If you look at the map that’s currently drawn in Congressman Bob Onder’s district … it looks like a Pac-Man — you know, the old video game Pac-Man,” he said. “It looks like a Pac-Man with its mouth open.”
While he has not confirmed whether he’d call a special session, Kehoe said he shares Trump’s vision for a Republican-led House of Representatives following the midterms.
“My personal preference is just keep Speaker (Mike) Johnson in control in D.C.,” he said. “His values align much better with Missourians than Congressman (Hakeem) Jeffries does, and I think that would be the goal.”

Santiago/Getty Images).BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.
Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.
Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
 GOP pressure

Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
 Unreliable data?

But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.
Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A group seeking to decriminalize Alaskans’ use of certain medicinal mushrooms and other psychedelics can start collecting signatures to try to put the question before voters.
Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom, who oversees the Alaska Division of Elections, said Thursday she has certified a statewide initiative application that proposes legal but regulated use of certain natural medicines for therapeutic and traditional purposes. The sponsors may now start gathering the petition signatures they need to place their initiative on a statewide ballot.
The proposed initiative, titled the Alaska Natural Medicine Act, is modeled after an initiative in Colorado that voters in that state passed in 2022.
Sponsors of the initiative are with Natural Alaska Medicine Inc., a nonprofit organization “dedicated to fostering charitable, educational, and social welfare initiatives that promote the safe and responsible use of natural medicines,” according to its website.

	The president of Natural Alaska Medicine Inc. and other team members are Indigenous Alaskans. The proposed ballot initiative includes provisions for Alaska Native traditional healers.
While the initiative would decriminalize adults’ personal use or home cultivation of psychedelic mushrooms and other psychedelics, it also proposes a regulatory system. It would establish a Natural Medicine Control Board in the state Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development. And it would establish an advisory Traditional Use Council.
Certain psychedelics are excluded and their use would not be allowed, under the initiative’s wording.
To qualify the initiative for the ballot, the petition sponsors must gather signatures equal in number to 10% of the voters in the state’s last general election, according to the Alaska Constitution. Additionally, signatures must come from at least 30 of the state’s 40 legislative House districts. Sponsors have a year in which to gather those signatures.
In her announcement Thursday, Dahlstrom did not indicate a position on the proposed initiative.
“This certification reflects the constitutional and statutory requirements for citizen-led initiatives in Alaska,” she said in a statement. “While voters will ultimately decide the merits of the proposal, the application meets all legal criteria for form and content.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC04312-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 10:57:41.838973

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

(Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer) A construction worker who pleaded guilty in February to raping a coworker on an apartment development years earlier skipped his sentencing hearing in July and is once again a wanted fugitive.
Juan Diego Medina Cisneros was charged in 2022 in Dakota County with raping Norma Izaguirre the year before while working for Absolute Drywall on the Viking Lakes development in Eagan, a sprawling multiuse development built around the Minnesota Vikings’ headquarters and training facilities.
Medina Cisneros, a 33-year-old Mexican citizen, wasn’t apprehended until two years later, in June 2024, while crossing into the United States at the Gateway International Bridge in Texas. After the Dakota County Sheriff’s Office brought him back to Minnesota, he was released the next day on $100,000 bail.
Nearly six months later, he pleaded guilty to third-degree criminal sexual conduct and agreed to serve 36 months in prison followed by 10 years conditional release as part of a settlement agreement with the Dakota County Attorney’s Office. The sentence is five months shorter than the sentencing guidelines, which the prosecutor justified because Medina Cisneros expressed remorse. Izaguirre agreed to the deal.
At the plea hearing in February, Dakota County District Court Judge Luis Morales told Medina Cisneros he would likely be deported and barred from entering the United States following his prison term if he’s not a U.S. citizen.
Medina Cisneros wasn’t taken into custody after pleading guilty. The judge delayed accepting his guilty plea until July, pending a pre-sentence investigation and psychosexual evaluation.
The Dakota County Attorney’s Office did not provide an explanation for why there was such a large gap in time between Medina Cisneros’ guilty plea and formal sentencing as stipulated by the plea agreement.
In May, an arrest warrant was issued for Medina Cisneros’ arrest for allegedly failing to remain in contact with Dakota County Community Corrections as required as part of his pre-sentencing release. He didn’t show up to his sentencing hearing on July 8.
Reached for comment, Medina Cisneros’ attorney William McKibbin said he doesn’t know where his client is.
Izaguirre, who first shared her story publicly with the Reformer in 2022, filed a civil lawsuit in February against Absolute Drywall for sex discrimination and retaliation. The Minnesota Department of Human Rights joined the lawsuit to force the company to adopt policies to prevent sexual abuse, while seeking oversight of the company.
Izaguirre says she reported Medina Cisneros to her supervisors for making unwanted advances and inappropriately touching her, but the company told her it determined it was a consensual relationship.
In court filings, company owner Dan Ortega says Izaguirre reported harassment but not rape.
Izaguirre says when she met with Ortega, he told her she was a good worker but he was advised to fire her for giving them trouble. After their meeting, the company reduced her hours and then stopped giving her work.
In response to a discrimination charge by the Department of Human Rights, the company’s attorney said Izaguirre was terminated because she declined cleaning work and demanded other types of work.
Absolute Drywall also faced allegations of wage theft on the Viking Lakes project, as the Reformer first reported in 2022. The state Department of Labor and Industry investigated the allegations but did not cite the company for violations.
In 2016, the state Department of Labor and Industry found Absolute Drywall misclassified workers and was fined $1,000.
That same year, the U.S. Department of Labor found the company employed a 14-year-old hanging drywall, in violation of child labor laws. The teenager sometimes worked more than 50 hours a week. This child labor case prompted a second investigation, and the U.S. Department of Labor determined the company misclassified workers, which allowed it to avoid paying overtime, health insurance and payroll taxes. The company was ordered to pay some 27 workers over $100,000 in unpaid wages.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P1218603-1024x737.jpg,,,2025-08-15 09:56:37.134547

This concept was previously expressed by Kirill Dmitriev, Russian envoy and head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund. Following the U.S.-Russia summit regarding Ukraine conducted in Riyadh, on Feb. 18 Dmitriev made clear that the Kremlin’s priority is energy development in the Arctic. 
While the official purpose of this Alaska meeting involves Ukraine “security issues,” the geography of the Alaska setting and the state’s position in a resource-rich oil, gas and mineral region offers a background narrative to ease sanctions in Russia’s strategic Arctic domain. The bilateral negotiation space that offers diplomatic legitimacy to discuss joint resource development is an opportune moment to discuss joint energy development in the Arctic region.
The meeting appears to be part of Russia’s ongoing hybrid war, with Putin controlling the agenda. Hybrid war is a strategy that uses cyber, economic, legal and political tactics to influence, disrupt or control a civilian population while avoiding open, declared war. As Trump reflects a preference for personal diplomacy over cooperation with alliances, he is susceptible to Putin’s focus on the acquisition of energy resources.
In March, a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was broadcast globally. During the encounter, Trump and Vice President JD Vance demanded expressions of gratitude, while pressuring Zelenskyy to sell critical minerals to the U.S., including resources located in Russian-occupied regions. The exchange revealed a more concerning strategic realignment: one rooted in coercion over cooperation, transactions over treaties, and, promoting the idea of “land swaps,” the subordination of sovereignty to invasion.
Trump’s focus on critical minerals has been codified through executive orders. He directed the secretary of commerce to initiate an investigation, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, on the national security implications of critical mineral imports. Invoking the Defense Production Act, Trump issued orders accelerating domestic mining and processing, framing mineral extraction, an admittedly decades-long process to implement, as essential to national security.
His strategy, combining executive action at home with coercive negotiations abroad, in locations including Ukraine, Greenland and Canada to resource-rich, unstable regions such as the Democratic Republic of Congo. In a Jan. 20 executive order, Trump reversed environmental protections enacted by the Biden administration, calling them an “assault on Alaskan sovereignty,” calling the largest and northernmost state, a “true energy warehouse.”
 Putin’s engagement with Trump has been described as a “calculated interplay of conciliation and coercion,” where Putin maintains strategic control, while Trump secures, mainly, symbolic wins. As Russia escalates hybrid attacks — cyber intrusions, undersea cable disruptions, and disinformation in Europe — it also probes air and sea space, as well as Western defenses along Alaska’s coastline, with its network of forward-operating bases, nuclear icebreakers, air defenses and deepwater ports.
Stars and Stripes has reported ongoing “close encounters” with Russian fighter jets and naval vessels in the Bering Sea, including operations inside the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. In 2024, the North American Air Defense Command, or NORAD, and the U.S. Coast Guard tracked four separate incursions by Russian aircraft into Alaska’s Air Defense Identification Zone. Sen. Dan Sullivan warned that “Alaska is on the frontlines of authoritarian aggression.”
The upcoming Alaska meeting, without Ukraine or European allies, could be a prelude to joint ventures in energy production that exemplifies Putin’s hybrid strategy: offers of partnership underpinned by intended dominance. Similarly, Putin seeks dominance over Ukraine with his refusal to accept Ukraine’s membership in NATO or the European Union, leaving Ukraine without security guarantees, potentially setting the stage for a second invasion.
As the emerging world order is being reshaped, in part, by resource control, the three globally dominant partners — Russia, China and the United States — appear to function, as during a century ago, where “might makes right,” by force of will rather than law. In such a system, Alaska risks becoming both a bargaining chip and a political battleground.
Hosting Ukraine talks in the Arctic could offer the possibility for Russian and American cooperation in what Mikhail Gorbachev once called “a zone of peace,” along with the affirmative caution of Gen. Mark Milley that the U.S. must “up its game” in the Arctic. In the meantime, Trump must provide Zelenskyy with the weapons that he needs to drive out Russia and prevent a repeat.
However, to achieve such goals, Alaska and Europe must be more deeply involved.

Renee Erickson, R-Wichita, was unsuccessful in pressuring Kansas State Board of Education member Jim Porter to reveal which members of a Kansas Legislature task force on education that he thought were campaigning to promote the idea K-12 public schools were failing. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Sen. Renee Erickson challenged a Kansas State Board of Education member Thursday to identify who he was referring to when criticizing individuals serving on the Legislature’s school finance reform task force.
Erickson, a Wichita Republican who chairs the task force, brought a discussion on special education to a halt by insisting Board of Education member Jim Porter, who serves on the task force, identify task force members he claimed were biased against public schools.
She read as evidence portions of the transcript of Porter’s statements during a June meeting of the state Board of Education in which he warned colleagues that two members of the school finance task force were promoting negative opinions about K-12 education in Kansas.
“You say you’ll name names. I’m giving you the opportunity,” Erickson said.
Porter, a retired school superintendent from Fredonia, declined to specify which task force members he thought were campaigning to vilify public schools.
“I stand by everything I said,” Porter told the senator. “I think you made my point, thank you very much.”
During Porter’s commentary to the state Board of Education in June, he had reported that some members of the Legislature’s task force on education had spoken about schools in Kansas as if they were failing to educate students. He said some on the task force would likely argue the state Board of Education lowered academic standards to make it appear students were doing better.
“I believe that words matter and whenever we question the integrity of the people making decisions in schools, I think we need to be very careful about what we say,” Porter said.
Erickson indicated she was disappointed Porter wouldn’t reveal the identity of task force members that he thought were striving to undermine public education.
“I think that’s sad,” said Erickson, who is a former teacher. “Regardless of where we stand in education, I have never impugned the motives of those working in education.”
She said she took offense that Porter implied the Legislature’s task force hadn’t been working in the best interest of Kansas students. She characterized Porter’s remarks as “cowardly.”
On Thursday, the fracas erupted when Porter took a moment to praise the ability of virtual school educators to increase graduation rates among high school students statewide. Porter also said he regretted not responding to comments by task force members in June questioning the state Board of Education’s emphasis on raising the Kansas high school graduation rate. In the past four years, the rate has ranged from 86% to 89%.
Skepticism about relevance of high school graduation statistics as a measure of student learning has most aggressively been advanced by task force member Rep. Kristey Williams, R-Augusta. She asserted the graduation rate at Wichita Southeast High School had been distorted by manipulation of student academic records. The high school’s principal was replaced amid reports of grade fixing to help students graduate.
Williams said that in her opinion there was no correlation between graduation rate and student success. She implied a school that focused on graduation rates could “babysit” students, but that wouldn’t translate into student learning.
Erickson said employers had told her a high school diploma didn’t equate to a quality employee and college officials said a high school diploma didn’t guarantee success in post-secondary education.
Sen. Pat Pettey, a Kansas City Democrat on the task force, offered support for Porter’s critique of attitudes among some on the Legislature’s task force.
“I also believe we have underplayed our graduate rates, and I find that offensive,” Pettey said.
Rep. Susan Estes, a Republican from Wichita who serves as vice chair of the task force, said retention of graduation rate as a evaluation tool might require adoption of a uniform grade point scale. In some districts, a student’s performance in a class would elicit an F grade and no credit toward graduation. But, in another district, the same work would receive a D grade and apply toward graduation requirements, she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3310740-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-15 09:56:37.134547

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday parodied some of President Donald Trump’s greatest hits as he attempted to drum up support to counter potential Republican gains in the next midterm election by redrawing California’s own congressional districts.
The maps? They’re “beautiful,” according to the Governor’s Office. We’re supposed to see them later today when Newsom releases them.
Newsom’s rally? It was a “big beautiful press conference.”
The redistricting plan? It’s California’s “liberation day” and voters will see it on their ballots as the “Election Rigging Response Act,” according to Newsom. 
The imitation highlights the political warfare waging between both parties, as California Democrats push for a mid-cycle redistricting campaign that would mirror and offset Republicans’ efforts in Texas.

Newsom: “(Trump) doesn’t believe in the rules. And as a consequence, we need to disabuse ourselves of the way things have been done.”

California relies on an independent redistricting commission that meets every decade to draw electoral boundaries. Newsom’s plan would sidestep the commission temporarily through the 2026, 2028 and 2030 election cycles by allowing voters to approve or reject new maps at a Nov. 4 special election. California would then revert to the commission’s authority after the 2030 census.
The Legislature will need a two-thirds vote to place the measure on the ballot. State lawmakers will take up the matter when they return from break on Aug. 18.
California Republicans are in lockstep against it, calling it a Democratic power grab that will drain taxpayers of a quarter billion dollars.
Common Cause, a good governance watchdog group that opposes gerrymandering and initially criticized California’s redistricting efforts, eased its stance earlier this week. Arguing that there are “authoritarian efforts to undermine fair representation,” the group said it now neither endorses nor condemns California’s countermeasures.
It was a dilemma Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, a Culver City Democrat, remarked upon during Thursday’s event, when he said that California and American voters should generally oppose gerrymandering.

Bryan: “We absolutely should. That’s not what this is about. This is about whether we will let the authoritarian in the White House break our democracy — while we sit silent, while we take a high road that doesn’t exist anymore.”

More CA job losses after ICE raids

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
California’s labor market is showing more signs of stress after high-profile immigration raids in Los Angeles earlier this summer.
Californians — citizens and noncitizens alike — reported a decline in work for the second month in a row since the Trump administration’s immigration raids in the state began in June, according to UC Merced researchers. 
The researchers found a 4.9% drop in the number of Californians reporting work from May to July, the period of the most intense immigration sweeps.
The number of Latinos who reported work during this period fell 8%, followed by Blacks (5.6%), Asians (5.2%) and whites (3.4%). The state’s U.S. citizens saw a bigger drop in the number of workers (equivalent to a loss of 414,832) than noncitizens (327,659), but noncitizens saw a bigger percentage drop (12.3% vs. 3.3%). 
Last month, the researchers released their first analysis of U.S. Census Bureau survey data to show the effects of the immigration sweeps on the state’s private sector employment. The 3.1% drop in employment from May to June was second only to the surge in job loss during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.The analysis is based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly survey that asks members of a sampling of households about whether they worked the week before. That’s different from monthly unemployment numbers, which is a percentage that’s also based on the survey but does not include people who have not looked for work in the past four weeks. 



Slow progress for women in STEM

Despite the millions of dollars state and federal leaders poured over the last 10 years into increasing the number of women pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering and math, the rate of women who attain degrees in certain STEM fields did not improve much, writes CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.
Data comparing California’s four-year colleges from the 2009-10 school year to 2022-23 — analyzed by the Public Policy Institute of California on behalf of CalMatters — found that while the percentages of women who received bachelor’s degrees in engineering and computer science increased, women graduating with a degree in math and statistics has decreased in the last five years. 
A separate study by Mount Saint Mary’s University also found that although women compose about 42% of California’s workforce, they make up just a quarter of those working in STEM careers.
The situation isn’t likely to improve: Since Trump’s return to the White House, the federal government has made deep cuts to scientific research at California universities, including suspending hundreds of grants to UCLA, and has curbed federal efforts that advanced diversity, equity and inclusion.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
Trump administration requested voter data. Secretary Bellows says, ‘Go jump in the Gulf of Maine’

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

,California,2025-08-15 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Covered California health insurance will cost more in 2026. Here’s what’s behind the double-digit increase,Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/08/covered-california-2026-rate-increase/,"Millions of consumers will feel the pinch when rates already expected to rise will jump even further. Federal subsidies, set to expire at year’s end, are partly to blame.","In summary
Millions of consumers will feel the pinch when rates already expected to rise will jump even further. Federal subsidies, set to expire at year’s end, are partly to blame. 


Californians who get their health insurance through the state’s marketplace will see premiums increase by an average of 10.3% next year. 
Covered California officials on Thursday announced the first double-digit rate increase since 2018, saying it represents a “confluence” of factors putting upward pressure on the market. 
Rising health care costs, the expiration of enhanced federal subsidies and policy-driven market uncertainty together are fueling the hike, Covered California Director Jessica Altman said. 
Insurers in recent years have expected health care costs to increase by about 8% each year. That makes up the bulk of next year’s increase. But Altman said about 2% of the rate increase in the state’s version of the Affordable Care Act marketplace is based on federal financial assistance that expires at the end of the year.
President Donald Trump’s signature spending and tax reform bill — the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — left out funding for enhanced premium tax credits used by more than 90% of Affordable Care Act enrollees nationwide. Congress enacted these subsidies during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure people had health insurance. Since then, Affordable Care Act enrollment has nearly doubled nationwide from 12 million to 24 million people.
“We’ve never been through a loss in affordability like the expiration of the enhanced tax credits,” Altman said.
Congress could still decide to re-up the subsidies in September. If it doesn’t, California will lose about $2.1 billion in enhanced tax credits for consumers. 
Double whammy for consumers
Ariana Brill, a certified health insurance agent who helps people enroll in Covered California, said if the enhanced subsidies aren’t renewed, consumers’ pocketbooks will be hit twice next year.
“We’ll see rates go up. We’ll see assistance go down. And the net premium, the consumer’s take home price, is going to go up considerably,” Brill said.
Open enrollment typically starts on Nov. 1, but Brill said clients are already calling her with concerns about increases. A majority of her clients, about 2,600 of them, will have to pay significantly more for health care if Congress doesn’t extend the enhanced subsidies, she said.
If that happens, Brill said she expects some people to switch to less comprehensive, lower-cost plans to make ends meet. Others will drop coverage altogether. 
“For most people, affordability is a huge part of their decision making. Very few of us have the luxury of buying things without looking at the price,” Brill said.
State officials recently took steps to ease the potential loss of federal subsidies for the lowest-income Covered California members. The state will spend $190 million to maintain subsidies for people earning up to 150% of the federal poverty level (individuals earning about $23,000 or families of four earning about $48,000).
Still, that investment is far short of the $2.1 billion the state stands to lose. 
Covered California’s previous estimates indicate that 600,000 people could drop coverage as a result of lost subsidies and rising costs. That, in turn, could make health care even more expensive, experts say. That’s because younger and healthier people tend to forego coverage first, leaving sicker and more costly people behind. To meet their needs, insurers have to charge more.
“With those lower utilization people leaving the marketplace, which leaves only the high cost users in the pool, it drives up premiums for those who are left,” said Matthew McGough, a policy analyst for KFF’s Affordable Care Act program who co-authored a recent study looking at 2026 premium increases. 
More people seeking health care and higher prices are already the primary factor driving annual rate increases, McGough said. Some of that can be attributed to the aging population and widespread use of costly pharmaceuticals like Ozempic and Wegovy to treat diabetes and other chronic health conditions.
But insurers nationally and in California have pointed out other factors contributing significantly to increased costs. These include tariffs on drugs and medical devices, enrollment and eligibility changes included in Trump’s budget package, and inflation. Most insurers are assuming Congress won’t extend the enhanced premium tax credits.
Nationally, the median premium increase for next year is 18%, according to the KFF analysis. Loss of subsidies accounts for 4%, McGough said. 
“It’s definitely a significant factor this year and that along with the general environment of uncertainty are what is pushing these rates above what we’ve seen in the past few years,” McGough said.

,California,2025-08-15 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California invested millions pushing these careers for women. The results are disappointing,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/08/women-in-stem-california/,"Women continue to lag behind men in certain science, technology, engineering and math programs.","In summary
Women continue to lag behind men in certain science, technology, engineering and math programs.


Ten years ago, it seemed everyone was talking about women in science. 
As the economy improved in the years after the Great Recession, women were slower to return to the workforce, causing alarm, especially in vital fields like computing. State and federal leaders turned their attention to women in science, technology, engineering and math, known by the acronym STEM. 
Over the next few years, they poured millions of dollars into increasing the number of women pursuing STEM degrees. But the rate of women who attain those degrees has hardly improved, according to an analysis of colleges’ data by the Public Policy Institute of California on behalf of CalMatters.
“The unfortunate news is that the numbers haven’t changed much at all,” said Hans Johnson, a senior fellow at the institute who conducted the analysis of California’s four-year colleges using data from the 2009-10 school year and comparing it to the most recent numbers, from 2022-23. The share of women who received a bachelor’s degree increased from roughly 19% to about 25% in engineering and from nearly 16% to about 23% in computer science. In math and statistics, the percentage of women who graduate with a degree has gone down in the last five years. 
“It’s not nothing, but at this pace it would take a very long time to reach parity,” Johnson said.
Girls are also underrepresented in certain high school classes, such as AP computer science, and while women make up about 42% of California’s workforce, they comprise just a quarter of those working in STEM careers, according to a study by Mount Saint Mary’s University. Fewer women were working in math careers in 2023 than in the five or 10 years before that, the study found.
“It’s a cultural phenomenon, not a biological phenomenon,” said Mayya Tokman, a professor of applied mathematics at UC Merced. She said underrepresentation is a result of perceptions about women, the quality of their education, and a lack of role models in a given field.
Science and technology spurs innovation and economic growth while promoting national security, and these jobs are often lucrative and stable. Gender parity is critical, especially as U.S. science and technology industries struggle to find qualified workers, said Sue Rosser, provost emerita at San Francisco State and a longtime advocate for women in science. “We need more people in STEM. More people means immigrants, women, people of color as well as white men. There’s no point in excluding anyone.”

She said that recent cuts by the Trump administration to California’s research and education programs will stymie progress in science, technology and engineering — and hurt countless careers, including the women who aspire to join these fields. 
Over the last eight months, the federal government has made extensive cuts to scientific research at California’s universities, affecting work on dementia, vaccines, women’s issues and on health problems affecting the LGBTQ+ community. The administration also ended programs that support undergraduate students in science. In June a federal judge ruled that the administration needs to restore some of those grants, but a Supreme Court decision could reverse that ruling. 
More recently, the administration halted hundreds of grants to UCLA — representing hundreds of millions in research funding — in response to a U.S. Justice Department investigation into allegations of antisemitism. Now the Trump administration is asking for a $1 billion settlement in return for the grants. A California district judge ruled on Tuesday that at least some of those grants need to be restored. 
‘The cultural conversation has changed’
In the past five years, attention has shifted away from women in science. Nonprofit leaders and researchers across the state say that many lawmakers and philanthropists turned away from women in STEM during the COVID-19 pandemic and focused more on racial justice following the police killing of George Floyd. 

Since 1995, women have been outpacing men in college, and women are now much more likely to attain a bachelor’s degree. The unemployment rate for men is higher, too, and men without college degrees are opting out of the labor force at unprecedented rates.
On July 30 Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order saying the state needs to do more to address the “growing crisis of connection and opportunity for men and boys.” It’s not a “zero-sum” game, he wrote: the state can, and should, support everyone. 
But some state investments for women’s education are lagging.
In 2018, the Legislature agreed to put $10 million each year into a new initiative, the California Education Learning Laboratory, to “close equity and achievement gaps,” including the underrepresentation of girls and women in science and technology. But two years later, the state imposed large-scale cuts to the initiative due to the pandemic. As the state faced more fiscal challenges in 2024, lawmakers cut its budget to about half its former size. 
This year, Newsom proposed cutting the Education Learning Laboratory altogether. After negotiations with the Legislature, Newsom agreed to fund the initiative through next year, at which point it’s set to close unless new funding is secured.

“While I think women are faring better in college generally, I would be skeptical that we can say ‘mission accomplished’ in terms of achieving parity for women in STEM undergraduate degrees,” said Lark Park, the director of the Education Learning Laboratory, which uses public money to provide grants to schools and nonprofits. “I think we’ve just gotten distracted and the cultural conversation has changed.”
Private and corporate foundations fund numerous nonprofit organizations that support girls and women in STEM, but grant recipients say some money has moved toward other, more popular topics or less controversial ones. “Funders focus on trends and they’re very trendy in how they give,” said Dawn Brown, president of the EmpowHer Institute, which offers education programs to girls and women across Los Angeles County. 
One of her programs provides a free, five-week summer camp to girls, including a trip to Catalina Island, where they learn about environmental science and climate change. Since Trump took office, some corporate funders have pulled back support for the organization’s programs, which may be perceived as supporting “DEI,” she said. “The words ‘women,’ ‘girls,’ ‘climate change’ — those are banned words.”
Supporting women in math
When Chloe Lynn, a rising junior at UC Berkeley and a double major in applied math and management science, started taking higher-level courses, she noticed a trend in her math classes: fewer women. “I’ll be one of three girls in a 30, 40-person class,” she said during an interview at the university’s division of equity and inclusion. 
UC Berkeley has a center dedicated to promoting diversity in STEM, known as Cal NERDS, which features cozy study spots, a high-tech makerspace and various multi-purpose meeting rooms. The center receives much of its funding from the state but has a few grants from the federal government, some of which are currently on hold.
On a Thursday last month, Lynn was one of 10 students who came to present their summer research in one of the multi-purpose rooms. More than half of the presenters were women or non-binary, and the rest were part of other underrepresented groups in STEM, including Hispanic, Black and LGBTQ+ students. She stood in front of a large poster, waiting for people to stop by and ask about her work. 
“Say you’re at an auction, and say there’s n bidders and k identical items,” she said as another student approached. Over the next two hours, fellow mathematicians, classmates, friends and family stopped by, listening as she explained her formula for allocating resources in an optimal way. Some understood her work and asked questions about her variables, formulas or 3-D models. The rest nodded in admiration.

By the end of the event, many students had abandoned their own posters in order to learn about their friends’ research. In her free time, as the vice president of UC Berkeley’s undergraduate math association, Lynn has been trying to build this kind of community among other female math majors by organizing events where students can meet each other. Her end goal is graduate school, either in applied math or industrial engineering. Women are also underrepresented in those graduate programs. 
“Creating an inclusive and uplifting community is so important for anyone that’s underrepresented,” she said after finishing her presentation.
How STEM helps people
The lack of women in STEM has nothing to do with their abilities. In fact, women who major in STEM at California State University campuses are more likely than men to graduate, according to data from the college system, and in biology, women are overrepresented. Over 64% of biology bachelor’s degrees awarded in California during the 2022-23 school year went to women, according to the analysis from the Public Policy Institute of California. 
Brown said some female alumni of EmpowHer have said that college advisers push biology over other science, engineering or math courses, claiming that it’s “easier.” Better advising could create more parity, she said.
Rosser, who trained as a zoologist before becoming a college administrator, said women’s shift toward biology was a slow process, beginning in the 1970s. “Women are particularly attracted to STEM when they can see its usefulness, particularly to help people,” she said. Biology is often “an entryway to the health care professions,” she added, many of which are predominately female. She recommends that professors promote the application of their research as a way to increase the percentage of women in these fields. 
In her studies at UC Berkeley, Lynn said she’s struggled with the relevance of her research. “There’s a lot going on in the world right now and I feel called to help,” she said. “Even though I did theory research this summer, I’ve been thinking about ways to apply this theory to real-world applications I care about.” In particular, she wants her research to help her community in the Bay Area, where she grew up. 
“Say you’re an architect and you’re in charge of reinforcing San Francisco’s concrete structures in the event of an earthquake,” she said. “You want to minimize cost in San Francisco, and that’s going to help you choose which building you’re going to reinforce.” 
It’s just another resource allocation problem, she said, so it could be solved with a similar formula.
“It does hit close to home,” she said. In fact, the UC Berkeley campus lies on a fault line.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080525_WomenInStem_FM_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-15 08:56:45.385609
,California,2025-08-15 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,It’s not just Trump. Much of deep-blue California stokes crime fears and distorts reality,Robert Greene,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/crime-fear-trump-california-political-gain/,"Stoking crime fear for political gain is commonplace in American politics. In California, Democrats made a show of retail theft hearings in recent years and championed tough-on-crime bills geared more toward pumping turnout than affecting crime rates.","The critique of President Trump’s power play in Washington, D.C., this week was immediate and intense because it was so obvious: Last year the District of Columbia’s violent crime rate dropped to its lowest point in the 21st century. Trump can’t honestly use crime trends to justify his seizure of the district’s Metropolitan Police Department or the deployment of National Guard troops and federal agents.
But he did it anyway, because he can. As a federal district excluded from any state, D.C. enjoys home rule only to the extent that the U.S. government permits it. Trump’s references to bands of “bloodthirsty criminals” roaming D.C. streets were not merely false, but unnecessary.
Trump also said he’d consider sending troops into cities that don’t have Washington’s special status, calling out Oakland, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Baltimore. Whether he can do that depends in part on the outcome of a trial this week over Trump’s use of National Guard troops in L.A. earlier this summer. A ruling is expected shortly.
Of the cities Trump cited, only Baltimore is among the nation’s top 10 for violent crime, according to FBI statistics, although Oakland is included in some analyses. But it’s probably more than coincidence that all four of Trump’s named cities are in so-called blue states that voted against him in three presidential elections.
Besides Baltimore, Trump didn’t mention the American cities most plagued by violent crime, including murder, perhaps because they are in states that supported him in 2024: Memphis, Tenn. St. Louis. Kansas City, Mo. Cleveland. Detroit. Little Rock, Ark. Milwaukee. New Orleans. Birmingham, Ala.
Dishonesty about urban crime, and using it to score political points, is a Trump specialty. During his 2016 campaign, he burrowed directly into the American psyche by dredging up images from the violent 1980s and 1990s. The worst crime of that era had long passed, having peaked in 1991, followed by a historic plunge that continues today despite occasional spikes. 
Still, Trump rode ancient crime fears to victory and spoke at his first inaugural as if the nation were still locked in an era of “American carnage.” So, yes, Trump is a maestro at uttering crime falsehoods and tapping latent crime fears to enhance his power.
But he’s not alone. 
Stoking crime fear for political gain is commonplace in American politics and is a tactic used freely by Democrats, Republicans, police, prosecutors, prison guards, and in fact pretty much anyone running for public office or pushing (or opposing) a ballot measure that could redirect public spending toward or away from law enforcement.
News outlets are in on the game. Programs that ordinarily wouldn’t report on anything as mundane as a committee hearing on a bill to lengthen criminal sentences often air stock footage of crooks ransacking store shelves. The constant replays turn an otherwise boring story into a fear-driven special report.
Newspapers sometimes present “true crime” features, replaying old stories of long-ago murders to keep the fear-fueled clicks coming.
Failing drug store chains blame their poor performance on exaggerated or purely imagined waves of shoplifting. Mayors and police chiefs feel pressure to respond by deploying more police, prosecutors promise longer sentences, lawmakers approve tough-on-crime bills — even if shoplifting has not, in fact, jumped, and even if it’s revealed that bad business decisions are the true reasons for the chains’ failures.
In California, where post-lockdown crime rose and fell variously in different cities but did not amount to a sustained statewide uptick, Democrats made a show of several “retail theft” hearings last year and the year before, and championed a package of tougher-on-crime bills that were geared more toward winning a strong turnout in congressional elections than in actually affecting crime rates. Voters passed Proposition 36, which chips away at historic reforms by turning repeat low-level property misdemeanors into felonies.

Yes, property crime is real and has serious negative consequences. Violent crime remains an ongoing problem not only in Oakland but in almost every California city, even though they’re not even close to the same category as high-crime Memphis or Little Rock. 
Those who argue that there is no crime, or that the crime that exists is no big deal, are playing as fast and loose with the facts as Trump. But calling crime one important urban challenge among many just doesn’t have the same cachet as calling it an emergency of historic proportions, or calling it a figment of the imagination. It neither defunds the police nor justifies more police hiring.
In his remarks on Washington, D.C., Trump cited several other falsehoods widely embraced across jurisdictions.
On bail, for example. Trump threatened to somehow override Illinois’ successful no-money-bail law on the argument that “somebody murders somebody and they’re out on no cash bail before the day is out.” The clueless statement repeats false tropes in California about no-cash bail. In fact, accused murderers are almost never released before trial — and when they are, it’s generally because they had money to bail out. No-cash-bail jurisdictions use a defendant’s risk to the community, rather than wealth or poverty, to make pretrial release decisions.
The Illinois law has had no effect on crime rates. Nor has the Los Angeles County Superior Court’s program of eliminating money bail between arrest and arraignment for people accused of lower-level crimes, although people accused of violent and other serious crimes in L.A. can often still bail out if they have money.
But that hasn’t stopped critics from complaining, despite the numbers, that no-cash-bail increases crime. In a contest between numbers and fear, numbers rarely prevail — as Trump knows well. His solution to numbers that don’t support his positions is to claim they are rigged, and to fire the people who calculated them, as he recently did with the chief of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Or to just cite random numbers, as he did when he claimed his program to reduce drug prices will bring costs down by 1,500% — which would mean that instead of paying for medication, Americans will get cash whenever they get their prescriptions filled.
Or to just ignore them, as he is doing with D.C.’s falling crime rate.
No one does it quite so brazenly, or with such swagger, as Trump. But many do it. Americans who don’t want their criminal justice policies and budgets to be guided by deception should be cautious and skeptical when they hear claims from any of their elected or law enforcement leaders, not just their president.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825-SEIU-ICE-Protest-TS-27.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-15 08:56:45.385609

I read Habib Meiloud’s recent commentary in VTDigger opposing H.310, and I felt the need to respond to clarify some serious misunderstandings about the bill and what it actually sets out to do.
Let’s start with the core claim that this bill is designed to shut down political speech about Israel. That is simply not true. The word “Israel” does not appear once in the bill. H.310 does not ban anyone from criticizing Israeli policy or discussing global issues. What it does is make sure that no student is targeted or demeaned for being Jewish.
H.310 updates Vermont’s harassment law to include antisemitic harassment, just as our laws already address racial, ethnic and sexual harassment. It also ensures that educators have access to training and curriculum support to prevent antisemitism from being normalized or ignored in schools.

This bill was written in response to a documented rise in antisemitic incidents across Vermont since Oct. 7, 2023. Swastikas have appeared in school bathrooms and houses of worship have been graffitied with “Free Palestine.” Many families — like my own — have been blamed for the war and are feeling isolated and unsafe. 
H.310 is not about silencing anyone. It is about protecting students from harassment.
If we are going to debate this bill, let’s at least start with the facts. That means reading the actual text, not reacting to misrepresentations of what it says. Don’t take my word for it. Read it yourself on the Vermont General Assembly website.

(Courtesy of the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources)Utah Department of Natural Resources data shows the number of hunting and fishing license suspensions have been trending downward in recent years — but wildlife officials say that’s not because they’re being lenient.
Instead, DNR Sgt. Devin Christensen said it’s because state wildlife officers are focused on “blatant” offenders, rather than Utahns making honest mistakes.
“We’re trying to more vigorously pursue those who blatantly are breaking the law,” he said. “If it’s maybe an accident or a mistake (we’re) trying to give the benefit of the doubt. … We’re trying to be a little bit more understanding and make sure we’re really pursuing those who are blatantly breaking the law.” 
 Here is a breakdown of hunting and fishing license suspensions in Utah from the last few years, according to DNR:

2017: 83
2018: 88
2019: 84
2020: 41
2021: 55
2022: 77
2023: 42 
2024: 54
2025: 35 (so far, mid year)

Christensen said the number of hunting and fishing license suspensions are trending down, but he also noted some license suspensions can span multiple years, depending on the violation’s severity. For example, in 2024, he said those 54 license suspensions totaled 261 years of cumulative suspended years, because suspension terms can range between one to seven years, depending on the offense.
The lengths of various suspensions are established by the Utah Legislature and are based on the designated class of crime: 

For a class C misdemeanor, the suspension is one year. 
For a class B, it’s three years. 
For a class A misdemeanor, it’s five years.
For a felony, it’s a seven-year suspension. 

However, those suspension terms can be doubled for two reasons: if a license was already suspended at the time of a crime or if the crime involved a trophy animal.
Utah is a member state of the Interstate Wildlife Violator Compact. License suspensions in Utah are also recognized in all the other states in the U.S., except for Hawaii. 
Egregious violations, Christensen said, are hunters shooting multiple animals they’re not permitted to take, or those trying to hide or sneak an illegal carcass. 
However, he said wildlife officials also recognize mistakes happen. For example, maybe a hunter shoots a spike elk, but later discovers it was actually a cow elk. Or maybe an angler catches six rainbow trout before realizing the catch limit at the reservoir was actually four. 
If that happens, Christensen urged hunters or anglers to call the DNR and to notify them of the issue rather than trying to ignore or hide it. 
“If you make a mistake, call us. We understand. We’ll work with you. We’re not out there to get you,” he said. “That’s our main goal, is to protect the resource and the people out there, to make sure everybody’s safe and we can manage the (protected) species.” 
When hunters or anglers are “opportunistic” and knowingly break the law, DNR said in a news release issued this week that “in most of these instances, the person will be criminally prosecuted and will pay a fine.” But for their hunting or fishing license to also be suspended, the person has to “intentionally, knowingly or recklessly violate the law.”
However, DNR Lt. Casey Mickelsen said in a prepared statement that if someone “self-reports a wildlife violation, it often reduces the severity of the punishment and the likelihood that their license will be suspended.”

“We understand that people get scared or embarrassed, but we really appreciate those hunters and anglers who call and tell us about their mishaps,” he said. “This shows a lot of goodwill and says a lot about you if you take responsibility for your actions.”  
For those who intentionally break the law, Christensen said DNR relies “very heavily” on the state’s poaching hotline and the public’s tips and observations in the field. 
“The entire purpose of wildlife law enforcement is to encourage people to comply with the laws that help manage fish and wildlife species in the state,” Mickelsen said. “Those laws are made to benefit wildlife and the public. We wish that everyone would just comply with the law so that we didn’t have to do suspensions. That is our goal. But unfortunately, people do break the law, and we believe that a license suspension is the best deterrent we have for people who intentionally commit wildlife crimes.”
Mickelsen said the “best way to stay out of trouble” is to make sure you stay up-to-date on current regulations and carefully check your permit before hunting or fishing.

“Every year, our officers encounter hunters who go hunting without even opening their envelope to see what permit they drew,” he said. “They wait to look at their permit until after they have harvested an animal and then finally discover that they hunted in the wrong unit or season, or sometimes for the wrong species entirely. These situations often result in citations and the illegally harvested wildlife being confiscated.”
If you’re planning a fishing trip, DNR officials urge you to make sure you have a current fishing license and take time to read the current fishing guidebook so that you know the requirements for the waterbody you’re visiting. “You should understand which species must be released, what the daily limit is for each species and if bait is allowed at the waterbody where you are fishing,” DNR officials said.  
“There are hunting unit boundaries and fish limits for a reason,” Mickelsen said. “These regulations help us manage various wildlife species according to specific management plans and also help us maintain healthy populations for each area or waterbody. If these regulations are not enforced by our officers, the management plans don’t work as well as intended.”   
They also urged Utahns to check the Department of Wildlife Resource’s website, including the Utah Hunting and Fishing app, maps to the hunting boundaries and popular fishing spots, and guidebooks that detail the current hunting and fishing laws in Utah.
“If people have additional questions or concerns about a hunting or fishing regulation, they can also call a Utah Division of Wildlife Resources office or contact the Utah Division of Law Enforcement and talk to a conservation officer,” Mickelsen said. “Our officers will be able to assist with any questions from the public.”

Summer reading programs helped some third graders advance to fourth grade, according to data Mackey presented.(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The state’s summer reading programs appear to have improved reading results for the children who attended them, though the full scope isn’t fully clear. 
In May, 55,930 third graders took the Alabama Comprehensive Assessment of Progress (ACAP) test, according to data released Thursday from the Alabama State Department of Education.
 Of those, 6,470 students scored below the “cut score,” or a score below what the state considers “proficient” in reading. The state increased the cut score from 435 to 444 in October. After summer reading programs, available to those that scored below the cut score for a second chance at a promotion to fourth grade, 4,007 of those students took the ACAP reading test again and 2,264 scored below the cut score. However, students who turned in portfolios, an alternative measure of reading proficiency — which will be evaluated through October — could advance without taking the test a second time.
State Superintendent Eric Mackey said at the Alabama State Board of Education work session that the 2,400 students who did not take the test again could have had many reasons for that. 
“They could have gone to summer camp and just opted not to take the test, or parents opted not to test, to just keep them in third grade. That is an option that parents have,” Mackey said. “Some of those students probably have more severe special needs… but they decided that summer reading camp was not the best for that person.”
Among the students that retook the test, 8.5% scored below the cut score, an improvement from the 13% that scored below the cut score in the 2023-24 test. Students that score below the cut score are held back in the third grade.
Mackey said the 8.5% will continue to drop as the state assesses reading portfolios.
“We’re still getting that now from the districts, so they have a few more weeks to turn into us, how many of your fourth graders were promoted in some way other than by state test,” Mackey said. 

Paid parental leave

The board also unanimously approved a permanent rule for paid parental leave, unchanged from a temporary rule passed in June in compliance with the law’s effective date on July 1.
The rule, as outlined by SB 199, sponsored by Sen. Vivian Figures, D-Mobile, allows public education employees to take eight weeks of paid leave after giving birth, having a stillbirth or experiencing a miscarriage after 12 weeks. It also allows a father to take two weeks of paid leave under those circumstances. If a couple adopts a child under 3, either parent may have eight weeks of leave if they are both eligible employees.
Mackey told reporters after the board meeting that advocacy groups may ask the Legislature for some tweaks to the law.
“Most of those things were around adoptions. There’s obviously some things that may have to be cleared up around adoptions, but really it’s a great bill,” Mackey said. 
Dev Wakeley, a worker policy advocate for Alabama Arise, spoke at the meeting in support of the rule.
“This bill is not just going to improve the quality of life and economic security for the folks who are eligible under its provisions now,” Wakeley said. “There’s going to come a time, not too far in the future, where a mother and a child is going to survive who would not have otherwise.”

(Photo courtesy Erin Hanan)Six years ago a massive wildfire blackened one of Nevada’s most popular recreation areas in Elko’s Ruby Mountains. Much of it has recovered since then, but the fire caused lasting harm to water quality and aquatic habitat in the area.
That’s according to a recent study published in the International Journal of Wildland Fire by researchers at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
The massive 2018 wildfire broke out near a shooting range on private land before quickly spreading into the Ruby Mountains’ Lamoille Canyon where it burned through about 5,000 acres of wilderness, leaving behind large amounts of nitrogen-rich wildfire ash that can act as a pollutant in water. 
Researchers spent two years analyzing the wildfire’s impacts on the glacier-carved canyon and surrounding watershed. They chose the area due to its rugged topography, which makes water runoff from burned slopes a major threat to stream water quality.
The study found that in Nevada’s semiarid shrublands a combination of severe wildfire and drought gutted plant growth in the years after the fire, limiting the amount of nitrogen-rich wildfire ash the environment could absorb. Without plants to absorb excess nitrogen from wildfire, the pollutant is released into streams and lakes where it can cause several adverse health and ecological effects.
Doctoral student Maxwell Kay Strain led the UNR study under the supervision of Erin Hanan, an associate professor in the Department of Natural Resources & Environmental Science and principal investigator of the Fire and Dryland Ecosystems Lab.
“What we found is that actually two factors are likely to deteriorate water quality: the severity of the burn and increasingly dry conditions after fire,” Hanan said. 
In the study area, nitrogen absorption by plants was reduced in the most severely burned areas, while nitrogen absorption by both plants and soil microbes was muted in the dry conditions following the fire. 
“The vegetation plays a really important role in determining how the system recovers, how well it takes up available nitrogen, and the extent to which nitrogen gets flushed to streams,” Hanan said. 
A parched landscape of chokecherry, wheatgrass and mountain mahogany fueled the Lamoille Canyon fire, which saw flames reach up to 100 feet. 
In the aftermath of the wildfire, leaves and branches on mountain mahogany were completely burned off in severely burned areas while small shrubs were fully burned away, leaving white ash behind. Moderately burned areas on the canyon lost all grasses and charred smaller shrubs, leaving a surface covered in mostly black or gray ash.
Researchers found the more intense the fire the less plant regrowth was seen in the following years. Both moderately burned and severely burned areas saw less growth than areas that were not burned. The study also found lower plant diversity in areas that were severely burned compared to other areas.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/lamoille-creek.jpeg,,,2025-08-15 08:56:45.385609

Many lawmakers attending the National Conference of State Legislatures annual summit said they were still grappling with how to respond to President Donald Trump’s major tax and spending law (Kevin Hardy/Stateline).BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Missouri struggles to administer safety net programs. Congress is proposing more red tape

Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.
One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
 States in a ‘very, very strong position’

Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
 A ‘substantial headache’

Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.
New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

,California,2025-08-15 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California Legislature’s final weeks could decide fate of Delta water tunnel,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/california-delta-water-tunnel/,Gov. Gavin Newsom failed to fasttrack the Delta tunnel proposal in the June budget bill. Now he hopes lawmakers approve it before the legislative session ends.,"Tanned, rested and presumably ready after a summer vacation break, state legislators will return to the Capitol next week for the final month of their 2025 session.
The session’s final weeks will be dominated by bills aimed at registering blue California’s dislike of and opposition to President Donald Trump. The most prominent will be Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to redraw boundaries of California’s 52 congressional districts, giving Democrats five more seats to counter efforts in Texas to create five more Republican seats.
Despite the Capitol’s fixation on national political maneuvering — tinged by Newsom’s likely bid for the White House  — there are pending matters that hit closer to home. None is more important than what’s been kicking around for at least six decades, a project to bolster California’s north-to-south shipments of water by bypassing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
The project has gone by several names and morphed from a “peripheral canal” carrying water around the Delta to twin tunnels beneath the Delta and, most recently, to a single tunnel called the Delta Conveyance Project.
Newsom’s administration believes it needs just one more thing to get the greenlight, legislation to exempt the project from the California Environmental Quality Act’s ponderous process, thereby denying critics the legal tools to delay the work.
Newsom had hoped he could clear the CEQA hurdle with a “trailer bill” attached to the state budget approved in June, taking advantage of the bulletproof and expedited budget process.
“For too long, attempts to modernize our critical water infrastructure have stalled in endless red tape, burdened with unnecessary delay,” Newsom said. “We’re done with barriers. Our state needs to complete this project as soon as possible, so that we can better store and manage water to prepare for a hotter, drier future. Let’s get this built.”
Northern California legislators opposed to the tunnel persuaded their leaders to stall on using a trailer bill, but Newsom and tunnel advocates, such as the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, will try again during the session’s final weeks.
Tunnel backers contend that it would make California’s vast water system, which taps Northern California rivers to supply water to relatively arid Southern California via the California Aqueduct, more reliable by bypassing the environmentally fragile Delta.
That’s true as far as it goes. But opponents say the diversions of Sacramento River water into the tunnel would deprive the Delta of the water it needs to be a healthy habitat for fish and other wildlife.
The debate has essentially raged along those lines since the State Water Project was first constructed in the 1960s. During his first governorship a half-century ago, Jerry Brown won legislative approval for what was then a canal, only to have it overturned by voters via a 1982 referendum. Since then versions of the project have proliferated and been debated but none has advanced to the current stage.
Newsom is trying to sweeten the deal by offering the Delta $200 million to offset the project’s impacts. But whether Newsom can get what he wants from the Legislature remains uncertain, because Democratic legislators, who are a supermajority, are divided roughly along geographic lines.
“The Legislature rightly rejected the governor’s ill-conceived plan to fast-track the Delta Tunnel Project in June and should reject it again,” the Legislature’s Delta Caucus declared last week. “Delta communities that will be devastated by this unaffordable and unnecessary project cannot be bought off with $200 million. In fact, no amount of money can compensate for the destruction of thousands of acres of prime farmland and the loss of fisheries and historic tribal resources.”
The division is so sharp that Republicans, although small in number, could be decisive.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/052024_Delta_LE_CM_16.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-15 08:56:45.385609

A state board Thursday voted to raise premiums in a health insurance program for local government employees by 4.75%. (Will McLelland for Alabama Reflector)The board for the Local Government Health Insurance Program (LGHIP) Thursday voted to increase premiums by 4.75% for calendar year 2026.
Local government employees will see their out-of-pocket health insurance costs rise slightly, with the exact amount depending on their local government’s specific cost-sharing policies. On average, an individual employee’s monthly health insurance cost could increase from about $51 to $53.40, while an employee with one dependent might see their monthly premium rise from approximately $417.40 to $437.20. 
“That’s a very rich benefit for employers to be providing to their members,” said David Hilyer, CEO of the LGHIP. “(A) very small amount is required by the member to pay for single premiums. That differs from different employer to different employers.”

The cost of the increase, recommended by an executive committee of the board last week, is expected to fall largely on local governments, which on average cover about 92% of premiums for a single employee and 60% for an employee with dependents. The employers’ share will increase from about $586.04 to $613.88 on average for an individual employee. For an employee with one dependent, the share for the local government employers could increase from $1,135.64 to $1,189.59 monthly on average.
For 2025, active employees’ preferred premiums before cost-sharing for a single plan with dental coverage are $637, and $1,553 for employee and dependent coverage with dental. Standard plan premiums for 2025 are slightly higher, at $697 for single and $1,761 for employee and dependent with dental. A preferred plan offers the same or similar benefits at a lower premium, but it requires meeting specific criteria related to participation time, wellness engagement and payment history.
The approved increase is less than the initial recommendation of 5.05%, which was presented as the minimum increase needed to prevent a potential financial loss in the 2026 fiscal year. Hilyer  said during the meeting that the approved rate, based on projections, “would result in about $1 million loss for the fund for 2026.”
Hilyer said at the executive committee meeting last week that LGHIP, which is funded entirely by local governments, has historically tried to be predictable with its rate increases, and that LGHIP rate increases have been under the typical premium rate increases seen in the industry most years.
Hilyer added after the meeting that despite adopting a lower increase, he hopes the organization performs better than projections show.
“We want to be able to try to keep our trends as low as we can, and we have the hope that we can do that,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VaughanRegionalMedicalCenter_McLelland12867-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 08:56:45.385609

County officials teased a partnership with Kaepernick and his new AI company Lumi. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)New Prince George’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy’s (D) reception in Ocean City was star-studded already — at least by Maryland politics standards.
In attendance were the governor and first lady, the lieutenant governor, the comptroller and the state’s senior U.S. senator.
And then former NFL player Colin Kaepernick showed up and stole the show.
County officials teased a new partnership with the quarterback-turned-civil-rights-activist, focused on boosting student literacy training with artificial intelligence tools.
Kaepernick launched an AI start-up called Lumi last year, which aims to help storytellers publish and merchandise their work independently, “transforming any creator into Disney,” according to its website.
He has been busy recently coordinating with local school systems. Earlier Thursday, Kaepernick appeared in Rockville at a Montgomery County Public Schools summer meeting for administrators. Just a week ago, he unveiled a literacy partnership with the Portland public school system.
Taking the microphone at Ocean City’s Spain Wine Bar, Kaepernick praised Braveboy’s “incredible leadership” to a crowd of local officials gathered at the reception during the Maryland Association of Counties conference,
“AI is not some distant future,” Kaepernick said. “It is changing careers. It is changing the economy. It is changing industries. Now, we need to be at the forefront of it. Our students need to be at the forefront.”

Branndon Jackson, chairman of the Prince George’s County school board, said Thursday’s visit by Kaepernick began at a different gathering thousands of miles away: A California conference for Black educators, where Kaepernick spoke about using the Lumi platform to teach children to read.
“This is a great opportunity to partner with Colin Kaepernick and bring this to Prince George’s County,” Jackson told the crowd Thursday night. “I hope you all support us in this great effort, because we want to make sure that our kids can read on grade level, because we have some of the brightest scholars in Prince George’s County.”
Kaepernick played in six seasons for the San Francisco 49ers, but he is perhaps best known for taking a stance against racism and police brutality in the United States, by kneeling during the national anthem during games in 2016. Kaepernick’s actions spurred a larger protest movement, but after he became an NFL free agent the next season, he was never re-signed by another team.
Kaepernick “decided to stand up for his people,” Braveboy said at Thursday’s event, sponsored by Employ Prince George’s, a workforce training organization, as well as Braveboy’s office.
“This man sacrificed the career that he has worked for since he was a young child. That’s sacrifice, that’s leadership. That’s who he is,” Braveboy said. “And that is why I’m so grateful that he has decided that he wants to bring his talent.”
Prince George’s County Council Chairman Ed Burroughs said further information about county programming associated with Kaepernick could be coming in the next few months.
“From the first conversation, he said: ‘What can I do to support Prince George’s County?’” Burroughs said. “The county executive and I gave him a list of things he could do to support Prince George’s County. And we thought it would be good to bring him to meet the people of Prince George’s County.”
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) invoked Kaepernick to describe Democrats’ battles against President Donald Trump (R).
“We are going on offense. You can be sure about that,” Van Hollen said. “What Donald Trump and his cronies want us to do, they want us to shut up and go away. Are we going to shut up and go away? Hell no.”
Moore offered his own pep talk.
“A lot of times people will come up to me right now and they’ll say things like: ‘Listen, things seem really crazy right now,,’” Moore said. “And they’re just like: ‘I just want it to get easier.’”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Here’s my ask, Prince George’s County: Let’s not ask for it to get easier, because it won’t,” Moore continued. “Let’s just make sure that we can show how much tougher we are.”
Kaepernick isn’t the first of Braveboy’s new teammates attracting headlines. She has stepped up to defend her pick to lead the county’s environmental department, who was fired from that same department a decade ago for “gross negligence,” a finding that the Maryland court system upheld.
At Thursday’s event, Braveboy once again struck a hopeful and defiant tone, touting a renewed litter cleanup effort and arguing that she will pilot two large redevelopment projects to increase tax revenues for the county: At the soon-to-be-vacant Six Flags site in Mitchellville and the current Washington Commanders stadium in Landover, which the team hopes to leave by 2030 for a new home in Washington, D.C.
“Six Flags, on 500 acres, generates, to us, about $3 million,” she said. “When we finish there, there will be tens of millions of dollars generated.”
And of course, there was a reminder that this will be Moore’s final MACo conference before next year’s gubernatorial primary.
“We need to ensure our governor gets reelected,” Braveboy said. “There are so many states around here who want a governor like our governor, and he is leading the way.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC00322-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 08:56:45.385609

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Pressure is mounting on Indiana Republicans as the White House invites state lawmakers for a visit, and a poll in the field assesses the political risk of a mid-cycle redistricting.
National conservative activist Charlie Kirk also called out House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray in a post on X.
The moves come after Vice President JD Vance visited the Hoosier State Aug. 7 and met with Gov. Mike Braun and legislative leaders to push for new congressional maps in Indiana. President Donald Trump hopes to pick up GOP seats in a handful of states to keep a slim Republican majority in the U.S. House in 2026.
Hoosier lawmakers redraw districts after each decennial census, as per the Indiana Constitution. They last did so in 2021. Congressional Republicans have a 7-2 advantage.
A move in Indiana would likely focus on the First District in northwest Indiana, which is held by U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan, a Democrat. But it could also include 7th District U.S. Rep. André Carson, whose district includes much of heavily Democratic Indianapolis.
Rank-and-file GOP lawmakers slowly have been coming out against the maneuver this week.
National political newsletter Punchbowl News reported Friday morning that all Indiana GOP state lawmakers have been invited to the White House Aug. 26. It is not yet known who will attend.
The White House invite coincides with Kirk’s post, which said “Are Indiana House Speaker @tmhuston and Senate President @bray_rodric going to ignore President Trump, the majority of their voters, and the GOP Grassroots across the country by REFUSING to redistrict Indiana’s Congressional Seats? Let’s hope they are better than that!”

Are Indiana House Speaker @tmhuston and Senate President @bray_rodric going to ignore President Trump, the majority of their voters, and the GOP Grassroots across the country by REFUSING to redistrict Indiana’s Congressional Seats? 
Let’s hope they are better than that!

— Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) August 14, 2025

Rep. Jim Lucas, R-Seymour, argued against the redistricting on Kirk’s post.
“I’m an Indiana State Representative. In Indiana, Republicans hold about 90% of all LOCALLY elected offices, have had a supermajority in both House and Senate since 2012, have the Governors office and every state elected position, and have 7 of 9 Congressional districts. Please help me understand the push to pick up MAYBE 1 Congressional seat while putting many good state elected officials at risk because of a political redistricting stunt!”
Kirk is closely aligned with Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, the only top Republican so far to come out publicly in favor of redistricting.
Gov. Mike Braun has said legislative leaders need to assess their members before he would call a special session. He also has indicated without a new Texas map that could pick up five seats it might not be worth Indiana stepping into the fight. That effort is at a standstill as Texas Democrats fled to take away a quorum for business.
Bray and Huston have remained mum.
Meanwhile, Republicans appear to be polling on the controversial topic.
A new survey — that was distributed via texts to some Hoosiers — has three questions on redistricting, along with the usual ratings of key statewide elected officials in Indiana.
The first question asks, “Do you support Governor Braun calling a special legislative session for the Indiana General Assembly to redraw its congressional districts, giving Republicans a better chance of winning two additional seats in Congress?”
Another question asks, “If your state representative and/or state senator voted for redistricting during a special legislative session, would you be more or less likely to support them for re-election?” It listed five answers.
But a third question in the poll appears to threaten property tax cuts delivered earlier this year for Hoosiers.
“During a special session, the General Assembly may address other issues, including property tax reforms passed earlier this year and a property tax cut for homeowners. If you knew the legislature would use a special session to reduce or eliminate this property tax cut, would you still support Governor Braun calling for a special session?”

Only Larry Hogan knows for sure. He teased both possibilities Thursday in a social media post. (File photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)What would it take to get you to drive away with Larry Hogan’s recreational vehicle today, friend?
The answer might have less to do with the finances and floormats of any potential deal and more to do with the political intentions of the two-term former governor.
While speculation abounds over Hogan’s future and a possible run for a third term, the Republican former executive showed this week that he has not lost his knack for trolling.
In a Facebook post Thursday, Hogan posted pictures of the vehicle — with and without the vinyl wrapping that included his campaign logo and stylized Maryland flag — that he used during his failed U.S. Senate bid last year.
“Slightly used 2024 RV, only 15,000 all Maryland miles. Never slept in. Could make a good deal. Or … I guess we could always rewrap it and get back out on the road again?” he teased.
The post did not include a price.
It’s worth noting that Hogan’s post came hours before Gov. Wes Moore (D) was to host a campaign fundraiser in Ocean City.
‘The Winds of War’? Or The War of Wind?
In the ongoing war over wind farms off the coast of Maryland, the Ocean City Convention Center is apparently a demilitarized zone.
Visitors headed to the second day of the Maryland Association of Counties meeting Thursday morning were greeted by opponents to the wind farm carrying signs and waving to cars on Coastal Highway, and a message on the convention center’s electronic sign that read, “Save the Ocean, Stop the Turbines.”
By the end of the day, both were gone — after complaints from pro-wind groups.
MACo officials confirmed Thursday that they asked that the signs be removed and protesters relocated offsite. Virginia White, MACo’s deputy director, said the protesters obliged, and moved in front of a neighboring business.
She said MACo was aiming to keep the convention center neutral ground. Both sides have booths on the convention floor, she noted.
In a statement, Jen Brock of the pro-wind Oceantic Network said she asked MACo offials to remove the “prominent anti-offshore wind signage” in the interest of neutrality and was grateful they acted “swiftly.”
“The MACo Conference is a neutral space for Marylanders to learn about offshore wind and other key issues shaping Maryland’s counties,” Brock said. “We invite attendees to visit our booth upstairs and learn the facts about offshore wind and the positive impact it is already delivering to local economies here in Maryland.”
A coalition of pro-wind groups, called the Offshore Wind Alliance, paid for billboards on Route 50 and ads in local papers. “Good jobs. Lower utility bills. Less flooding,” reads one of their ads. Meanwhile, some Ocean City businesses hosted anti-wind signs of their own during the conference, which came on the heels of the city’s prominent White Marlin Open billfishing tourney.
Ocean City resident Becky Howe was not initially familiar with MACo, or the slew of politicians it attracts, but volunteered to protest there Thursday because of her passionate opposition to the wind farm. She said it’s a “big lie” that wind farms are environmentally friendly, citing concerns about placing metal structures in the ocean floor, the potential for habitat contamination and harm to wildlife.
“We don’t want them. We told our government we don’t want them. We are demanding that our state representatives listen to us,” Howe said Thursday.
But Rebecca Rehr, director of climate policy and justice at the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, a member of the Offshore Wind Alliance, said she found listening ears on the convention floor. “Almost every person who stopped by our booth while I was staffing it today thanked us for being here and were glad to see the level of support,” Rehr said in a statement.
Her group is pushing for the turbines for economic as well as environmental benefits, she said. “Energy demand is increasing and our electricity bills are rising even faster. With offshore wind, there’s an opportunity to build a clean energy economy that creates jobs and lowers energy bills across the state,” Rehr said.
Meehan’s ‘David and Goliath battle’ against big wind
MACo officials may have stopped the wind wars outside the convention center — but there was no stopping Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan, a strident wind farm opponent, inside the hall Thursday.
Meehan, in remarks opening the 2026 Maryland Association of Counties summer conference, declared the fight over the wind farm a “David and Goliath battle,” for the future of the resort town.
“Everything we do in Ocean City … is dependent upon our natural resources,” Meehan told the gathering of county officials. “Those include our beautiful sunrise, our natural ecosystem, our recreational fishing, and our commercial fishing. These are all part of the fabric of Ocean City. This is what people live here to enjoy and come here to enjoy when they visit.”
But Meehan sees an existential threat on the horizon: US Wind wants to build what would be the first wind farm off the coast of Maryland. He did not mention the company by name, but said the project would cause irreparable damage.
“Our future and all of these great attributes are being threatened by an outside entity, that will industrialize our sun rise, put a halt to our commercial fishing, damage our ecosystem, and change Ocean City forever — destroy what millions of people, including all of you, enjoy each and every year,” Meehan said.
Signs of the fight — billboards, electronic message boards, and placards — are common throughout the resort town. Meehan said city leaders are building a coalition of leaders in Maryland and Delaware, as well as citizen groups and condominium associations “to fight what could destroy what we enjoy today and our future, for future generations.”
“And it’s a battle. It’s a David-and-Goliath type of battle,” a passionate Meehan told the MACo audience. “But what I can tell you is David won, and our goal is to protect our future, protect Ocean City, and continue to be an economic generator for the town, for the state of Maryland. And I hope we have your support to do that.”
COVID-19 takes Alsobrooks off the MACo board
U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) was scheduled to attend several MACo events Thursday and Friday — meeting with higher education officials, participating in an Eastern Shore townhall and hosting a fireside chat with fellow Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.).
Those plans fell by the wayside due to Alsobrooks testing positive for COVID-19 Thursday morning, according to a midday notification from her communications team.
“Out of an abundance of caution, she will not be attending the events at Chesapeake College today or the Maryland Association of Counties (MACo) conference in Ocean City on Friday,” said a statement from her office.
While she won’t be attending in person, Alsobrooks said in social media posts that she will “continue to work remotely to serve the people of Maryland.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_7059-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-15 08:56:45.385609

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears / Maryland Matters)Changes to federal tax law, coupled with recent changes to the state tax code, could create challenges in forecasting revenue at least in the short term, analysts and lawmakers said Thursday.
“We all know this is a time of transition,” Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick) told a gathering at the Maryland Association of Counties conference in Ocean City. “We have rising costs, uncertain revenue forecasts and new pressures on state and local budgets alike.
“When Washington sends mixed signals, the challenge for Maryland and our counties only grows,” said Lewis Young, a member of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee. “Predictability is critical in financial planning.”
But changes to the state tax code in this year’s legislative session, coupled with changes in the federal law that were part of President Donald Trump’s legislation, may make that predictability difficult at first.
“We have a mix,” said Chief Deputy Comptroller Andrew Schaufele. “I think we’re all still digesting that.”
A report on how the federal changes will affect state tax revenue is expected in early September.
Some effects could be significant: 40% of the state’s revenue comes from personal income tax.
State not yet feeling projected effects of federal cuts, lawmakers told

Personal income tax in Maryland — state and local — is tied to the federal adjusted gross income.
“This is meant to make it simple, anybody whose done taxes knows it isn’t simple, but this is the easiest way to get us all forward,” Schaufele said.
In general, the state tries to conform to federal tax law.
For example, tax changes made in 2017 when Trump was president increased the federal standard deduction. The change incentivized many state residents to take the standard deduction rather than itemizing.
Those same taxpayers were then required to take a standard $4,000 deduction on their state taxes even though many of them would have fared better if they could have itemized.
Schaufele said that generated an additional $450 million annually for the state.
The recently passed federal legislation increased the standard deductions again. Schaufele said increasing the state and local tax cap deductions to $40,000 and adding in other sorts of deductions including car interest loans could mean more residents return to itemizing their taxes.
“What all this means to all of us that are here to talk about budget finance is that you have a very complicated world with a lot of money flowing to individuals, to the state, to the local government, and the state law changes and the federal law changes are about to just mix it all up,” Schaufele said.
Some of those deductions could be paused automatically for one year. Making that pause permanent would require legislation.
“There’s going to be a ton of interplay here,” Schaufele said. “We’re going to be doing a lot of modeling, trying to figure out what it is, but it’s going to be very challenging.”
Adding to the uncertainty in revenue forecasting are the looming federal job cuts. Schaufele said so far the state has not experienced the effects of those cuts.
“We know it’s coming,” he said. “It’s a matter of time.”

Schaufele said the reductions and the effect on state revenues will be “significant. It’s going to play out in a crazy way.”
And when those federal employees lose their jobs, the effects could be hidden initially, as displaced workers also see bumps in taxable income related to leave that is paid out, according to Harford County Treasurer Robert Sandlass.
“It’s going to be hard to figure out what is the ongoing revenue and what is the one-time revenue,” he said. “A person could be laid off. They could get a severance package or a buyout, and for that quarter, their number is going to go up, and obviously the job is going away.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC_1094-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-08-15 07:57:25.717501

(Getty Images)A federal judge this week sided with New Jersey and Pennsylvania by striking down Trump administration regulations that allowed employers citing religious or moral grounds to opt out of contraceptive mandates under the Affordable Care Act. 
Judge Wendy Beetlestone, chief judge of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, called the rules “arbitrary and capricious,” and said the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury acted without the analysis required by law and failed to consider alternatives. 
“Indeed, in the face of prior, contradictory findings that contraception is safe and effective, and without evidence to refute said conclusions, the Agencies’ change-in-position ‘runs counter to the evidence,’” Beetlestone wrote in Wednesday’s 55-page ruling.
Those rules are now “vacated in their entirety,” she wrote. 
Attorney General Matt Platkin said in a statement that he is “gratified” by the ruling, which comes eight years after the two states first filed their complaint against the Trump administration.
“We are proud to stand up for access to contraceptive care in New Jersey, and we will continue to fight back against the federal government’s callous attempts to make it harder for women to access basic reproductive health care,” he said.
The Little Sisters of the Poor order of nuns intervened in the lawsuit as a defendant and argued that the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate is unconstitutional. Beetlestone said the nuns’ arguments “fall well outside the scope of the matter” and noted that the Little Sisters cannot raise those points without either party challenging the mandate itself. 
Mark Rienzi, lead attorney for the Little Sisters, told Catholic Standard that it would appeal.
“The district court blessed an out-of-control effort by Pennsylvania and New Jersey to attack the Little Sisters and religious liberty,” Rienzi said.
Under the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as Obamacare, most employers’ plans must provide cost-free contraceptive services for women. Employers could opt out under narrow exemptions largely meant for churches.
During President Donald Trump’s first term, his administration issued rules to expand those exemptions to include nearly any for-profit and nonprofit that cited objections, and created a new “moral exemption.” New Jersey and Pennsylvania sued the administration in 2017 to strike them down, saying they would increase costs for publicly funded contraceptive programs.
The case reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 2020. In a 7-2 decision, the justices found the Trump administration had the authority to promulgate religious and moral exemptions to the contraceptive mandate. The matter was remanded to Beetlestone for further proceedings.
In Wednesday’s ruling, Beetlestone said the moral exemption was based on a factor “Congress has not intended” the agencies to consider, and that the religious rule couldn’t be justified under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 federal law intended to protect religious minorities.
She noted that Congress rejected an amendment to the Affordable Care Act that would have allowed for moral objections, because it would not have subjected religious-based objections to the judicial scrutiny mandated by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)While Montana has done a decent job of protecting wildlife habitat through conservation easements, the same cannot be said for the chronic dewatering of hundreds of miles of our rivers and streams.
Simply put, there is no working “conservation easement” equivalent for rivers, fish and aquatic ecosystems. Due to Gov. Greg Gianforte’s dereliction of duty in our third consecutive year of extreme drought, our rivers are paying the price.
Were one to look for an indicator of how dire the situation has become, simply looking at what’s left instream would tell you a lot since you can now wade across any number of our major rivers and not get wet above your knees.
But another indication is the mounting numbers of river lawsuits being filed against the State for ignoring its constitutionally-mandated duty to protect this most precious public resource. As our Constitution clearly states, Montanans have “inalienable rights” to “a clean and healthful environment” — not hot, dry rivers in which our once abundant and world famous coldwater fisheries continue a precipitous decline.
Likewise, the Constitution is also clear about who is responsible and what their duties are. Article IX, Environment and Natural Resources: “Protection and improvement. (1) The state and each person shall maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations.”
There’s no ambiguity in that mandate. “Maintain and improve” does not mean degrade and destroy. As for “present and future generations,” at the rate we’re going there won’t be clean and healthy rivers for present generations, let alone those in the future who don’t deserve to be stuck with the results of incompetent governance.
But what happens, other than the stack of lawsuits, when the State, now under the supposed stewardship of Gianforte and his administration, simply ignores the constitutional mandates and their clear and concise duties?
We’re seeing that on a regular basis now. As instream flows diminish and rivers heat toward lethal temperatures, they’re first closed to fishing with “hoot owl” restrictions that limit angling to early morning hours. But as water levels continue to fall and temperatures continue to rise, they are closed to all angling. If our trout populations were seen as the proverbial “canary in the coal mine,” that canary is in very bad shape and getting worse every day.
Most of the lawsuits focus on the damages to fisheries and aquatic ecosystems, violations of the Endangered Species Act, and increasing degradation from miles-long algae blooms in what were once our beautiful, gin-clear streams. The problems come from many sources — nutrient loading from on-going developments, run-off from agricultural operations, sedimentation from road-building and trampled banks, and loss of riparian vegetation that shades and cools the water.
Largely unmentioned is the Department of Environmental Quality’s issuance of pollution discharge permits for municipalities and industries. Those permits are predicated upon maintaining sufficient instream flows to dilute the pollutants and nutrients that are now turning our once-healthy rivers into hot, green, algae sewers as flows drop to record lows.
Adding insult to the injuries, the governor has even prohibited state agencies from enforcing the “Murphy rights” the state holds to maintain minimal instream flows … the exact subject of the latest lawsuit.
The lawsuits may prevail, but certainly not in time to stop another year’s egregious damages to our publicly-held water resources. At this point, Gianforte alone can enact the measures so desperately needed by our rivers and streams. History is watching, Governor — and will not reflect kindly on your dereliction of duty to the Constitution, the Public Trust Doctrine, and “present and future generations” of Montanans.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_7532-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-15 07:57:25.717501

While the local health center offers limited prenatal services, pregnant women often drive 60 to 90 minutes to reach a hospital equipped for labor and delivery. That kind of loss does not just change where babies are born. It changes whether they survive.
Across rural Missouri, the health care crisis is no longer slow moving.
It is here.
Hospitals have closed. Clinics are short-staffed. Entire counties have lost access to basic services like maternity care, mental health treatment, and pediatric visits. Patients wait longer, drive farther and face greater risks for conditions that are treatable. In some communities, proximity to a hospital is now a matter of life and death.
Missouri is one of the hardest-hit states in the country. Since 2014, 18 hospitals have closed statewide, including at least 12 in rural counties, according to the Missouri Hospital Association. The vast majority of Missouri counties are now designated Health Professional Shortage Areas for primary care.
As of 2024, 95 of Missouri’s 114 counties are classified as primary care shortage areas. Some have no full-time OB-GYN, no general surgeon, no psychiatrist, and no pediatrician. And the problem does not stop with doctors. Nurses, lab techs, and mental health workers are stretched thin or missing entirely.
Many of the physicians who are serving rural areas today are international medical graduates working on J-1 visas. These doctors complete U.S. residency programs and agree to serve in underserved communities for at least three years. Without them, many critical access hospitals in Missouri could not keep basic departments open. They fill key gaps in primary care, psychiatry, internal medicine, and pediatrics.
Yet instead of supporting these physicians, our immigration system places them in punishing and unstable positions.
During their mandatory service, J-1 doctors are often unable to change jobs or move if their situation becomes unsafe or unsustainable. Many face visa paperwork delays, legal complications or green card backlogs that can drag on for years.
More than 200,000 health care workers, including many physicians, are stuck in the employment-based green card backlog. Some face decade-long waits for permanent residency, despite serving the communities with the greatest need. In the worst cases, visa complications have forced doctors to leave the communities and patients they served.
The numbers are staggering. More than 70 million Americans live in primary care shortage areas, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. The Association of American Medical Colleges projects a national shortfall of up to 86,000 physicians by 2036. No region is more vulnerable to this shortfall than rural Missouri.
We are also limiting who gets to become a doctor in the first place.
Fewer than 3% of U.S. physicians are Black men, a number that has barely changed since the 1970s. In fact, the number of Black male medical school applicants has remained virtually stagnant since 1978, despite population growth and increased awareness of diversity gaps. Black students with similar qualifications apply to medical school at comparable rates but face systemic barriers throughout the admissions process.
Rural students and students from low-income backgrounds face many of the same challenges, often without the support or networks to navigate medical school applications, entrance exams, and interview hurdles. They are the most likely to return home and serve. But they are also the most likely to be shut out.
These issues are not separate. They are connected by the same policy failures that delay immigrant physicians, exclude underrepresented students, and leave rural communities without care. In reality, the people most willing to serve rural Missouri are the ones most likely to be pushed out.
I have seen this firsthand. As a nurse, I have worked alongside J-1 physicians, Black physicians, and rural providers who stayed late, picked up weekend shifts, and cared for patients no one else could reach. When visa delays force these providers to leave, it is not just a staffing problem. It is a loss that patients feel deeply. We do not just lose physicians. We lose continuity, safety, and trust.
A hospital closure in Missouri can mean the loss of the only emergency room for 50 miles. It also means job losses, local revenue decline, and shrinking investment in the community. In many rural towns, the hospital is one of the largest employers and anchors the entire local economy. It can mean a pregnant woman goes without prenatal visits. It can mean a cancer survivor misses a follow-up appointment because there is no oncologist nearby. These are not just statistics. They are the consequences of policy choices.
This crisis is not unsolvable. It is being ignored.
While Missouri has filled all 30 available slots in recent years, most have gone to specialists in urban areas. In 2018, only 7% of Missouri’s waiver physicians practiced in rural communities, and just 7% worked in primary care. These patterns raise important questions about whether the program is achieving its intended goals.
At the same time, immigration policy continues to destabilize the very workforce rural health systems rely on. We can reduce the green card backlog that leaves essential workers trapped in legal uncertainty while hospitals go understaffed. We can protect health care providers from immigration enforcement that disrupts care and fractures communities. And we can invest in real pipeline programs that help rural and underrepresented students become the physicians their hometowns desperately need.
Missouri cannot afford to keep losing providers. And we cannot afford to make it this hard for the people who are ready to serve. This is not just about workforce numbers. It is about whether we choose a system that protects rural communities, or one that lets them quietly vanish.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/rural-hospitals.jpeg,,,2025-08-15 07:57:25.717501

(Courtesy of Miss South Dakota scholarship competition)EDITOR’S NOTE: This article, which was intended to publish in a recent edition of the Huron Plainsman, is being published here at the request of the Plainsman’s managing editor following the newspaper’s sudden closure last week. 
HURON — Before May 31, Huron native Jamee Kattner had a plan for how things were going to happen this year. She had recently graduated from South Dakota State University and had a teaching job lined up in the fall.
She had one more thing before her summer, and it altered her next year and her whole life. 
She participated for the second time in the Miss South Dakota competition in Brookings on the final weekend of May, and the music education major focused her community service initiative and her talent around music. When the final winners were announced, Kattner received the crown from reigning Miss South Dakota Joelle Simpson.
A change this year in the Miss America program meant a big change for Kattner, though, as the national competition was moved from late December to early September in Orlando, Florida, with the final award show on Sept. 7.
That means squeezing approximately seven months of fundraising into just three months, so Kattner has been busy.
“A ‘whirlwind’ is the exact word I use all the time,” she said. “One moment, you’re competing, enjoying the experience. You hope you win, of course, but you enjoy making friends and the fun of the competition.
“Then you win. Now, you have deadlines and all of these other things you need to be doing.”
Kattner is entering the home stretch of her fundraising events. She is doing a trunk show at the Huron Country Club on Aug. 23, beginning at 2:30 p.m. She will show off her wardrobe for the Miss America competition, and musical entertainment will be provided.
In the time between planned fundraisers, she will continue doing events around the state, hoping that those appearances also bring in funds toward her trip to Orlando. Her final event will be singing the national anthem for the Wednesday night bull riding event at the South Dakota State Fair before she leaves the next day for Orlando. 
Through Aug. 3, Kattner had logged 4,160 miles for appearances as Miss South Dakota. She said her best experience was being at Mount Rushmore on Independence Day, where she had the opportunity to sing the national anthem.
“I was so excited to meet everyone, but then, they’re all excited to meet me,” Kattner recalled. “I think all of the people I met that night were from a different place.”
Amid the crowds, though, there’s also been a feeling of isolation.
“I’m the only person I know who is going through this, so others can’t really relate at the same level,” she said.
To that end, Kattner has leaned on the “Forever Miss South Dakotas,” previous winners of the award who offer advice and any assistance they can in her fundraising and preparation for the September competition, not to mention a place to stay during her extensive travels. She specifically noted that Huron and the Huron area have an abundance of previous Miss South Dakota winners (Carrie Wintle, 2018, Iroquois; Miranda Mack, 2017, Redfield; Loren Vaillancourt, 2010, Huron; Callee Bauman, 2006, Huron; Sara Frankenstein, 1998, Tulare; Gwen Resick, 1973, Clark; Sandra Hart, 1952, Huron; and Myrna Clemenson, 1948, Conde).
Kattner is attempting to be the first Miss America from South Dakota. In 1950, Irene O’Connor of Burbank finished runner-up, and four other previous winners finished in the top 15, most recently Alexandra Hoffman of Eureka in 2008.
“When I called up the school where I had a job for this coming year and told them that I wouldn’t be able to be there because I won, they said, ‘This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'” Kattner said. “That’s exactly how I’ve felt throughout this experience. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I’m enjoying every minute of it.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Jamee-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 07:57:25.717501

(Photo from WHAS11)A months-long state police investigation into Dubois County Sheriff Tom Kleinhelter scrutinized his handling of jail commissary funds. But unlike a high-profile case against former Clark County Sheriff Jamey Noel, no charges were filed — and the only person disciplined was the detective who pursued the case.
Some of the information became public during a July 25 interview with conservative talk radio hosts Rob Kendall and Casey Daniels. Former Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter made explosive allegations that Gov. Mike Braun’s office was involved in squashing the investigation but provided no evidence for the claim.
The governor’s office strongly denies any involvement in the case, and special prosecutor Holly Hudelson of Orange County said that “no one from the governor’s office” influenced her decision not to seek criminal charges against Kleinhelter.
“I didn’t feel like there were criminal charges there,” she told the Indiana Capital Chronicle in a recent interview. “So I declined to file charges.”
 Dubois County Sheriff Tom Kleinhelter (Photo courtesy Dubois County Sheriff’s Office Facebook)
The criminal investigation stemmed from a 2024 audit by the Indiana State Board of Accounts, which flagged more than $16,000 in spending by Kleinhelter. State auditors forwarded the case to the Indiana Attorney General’s Office and the local prosecuting attorney, and state police opened an investigation in July 2024.
An 80-page probable cause affidavit — prepared by ISP investigator Lt. Jeff Hearon and later obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle — alleged that Kleinhelter used public funds for trips to Arizona and Florida.
Law enforcement regularly draft affidavits to provide a factual basis for charging a crime, but ultimately the decision is up to a prosecutor. 
Hearon also spearheaded the yearslong ISP investigation that ultimately landed Noel in prison. Carter replaced the original investigator in the Kleinhelter case after two months because he said it needed a closer look. 
Hearon’s affidavit, as well as search warrant requests and returns filed in Dubois County, alleged that Kleinhelter created and backdated special deputy paperwork for his wife, seemingly to “falsely legitimize inappropriate expenses” for travel through the commissary fund.
Records collected by Hearon through search warrants alleged that Kleinhelter attempted to reimburse himself for other purchases, including prepaid gift Visa gift cards and Blackstone grills the sheriff said were purchased as “gifts” for sheriff’s department employees.
Hearon wrote in his affidavit that Kleinhelter later told auditors he conducted his own “self-audit” of commissary records and voluntarily paid back additional money. But Hearon said in search warrant requests and his affidavit that Kleinhelter’s repayments only occurred after media inquiries began and the criminal investigation was opened.
Kleinhelter, who is in the second year of his second and final term as sheriff, denied those allegations. He told the Capital Chronicle he “fully cooperated” with investigators and “fully abided” by state law and Dubois County Council recommendations related to commissary fund spending.
“There was NO crime that had been committed,” he wrote in an emailed statement. 
A lengthy investigation
The trips, which Kleinhelter logged as travel for professional conferences, included numerous “leisure activities” that were “outside the bounds” of training, Hearon alleged in his affidavit.
Hearon concluded in his affidavit that receipts, travel logs and interviews showed the trips were largely personal — including charges for golf, hotels, baseball games, alcohol and meals for two — often with his wife, Angie Kleinhelter, who was not a county employee.
In one example detailed in the affidavit, Kleinhelter expensed a golf outing in Florida as “training.” Photos, receipts and other records gathered during the investigation indicate Kleinhelter spent up to five hours a day at golf courses on two separate days during scheduled sessions of the 2021 National Sheriffs’ Association Conference in Scottsdale.
Hearon alleged in search warrant documents that Kleinhelter also submitted incomplete or falsified receipts, and Hearon’s affidavit said the sheriff kept a $14,747 refund for canceled airline tickets to a conference in Dubai, rather than returning the money to the commissary fund.

SBA – Kleinhelter
 
Kleinhelter “did not make any mention of the trip being cancelled” until he was interviewed by ISP on Aug. 29, 2024, Hearon stated in search warrant documents. The SBOA audit was completed and published before that interview, on July 26.
“Kleinhelter said the trip to Dubai was canceled, but it was never mentioned to the State Board of Accounts because they never asked, and he never volunteered the information,” Hearon wrote in a Nov. 7 search warrant request. “Kleinhelter said he initially received points instead of monetary refund and later converted those points to cash.”
“Because Kleinhelter withheld information about canceling the trip, State Board of Accounts only found Kleinhelter liable for repaying costs related to his wife,” Hearon continued in the warrant request. “Had State Board Of Accounts known the trip was canceled, Kleinhelter would have been responsible for returning all the county funds used to pay for the trip.”
When questioned about the Dubai tickets, Kleinhelter told ISP investigators, “I could’ve just easily lied about that … but I told the truth and paid back money so that I wouldn’t be a liar,” according to search warrant requests. He added that his actions would have been permissible “if I would’ve just made (my wife) a special deputy.”
But records gathered by Hearon appear to show Kleinhelter did try to deputize his wife after the spending on trips, and after SBOA began auditing the commissary account.
Hearon’s affidavit and search warrant filings alleged that Kleinhelter created and backdated two special deputy forms for Angie Kleinhelter during the audit process and asked an attorney to sign one of them without dating it. 
Story continues below.
Search Warrants
 
The sheriff initially told investigators that he had not appointed Angie, but later claimed in an interview with ISP to have done so and submitted the forms to state auditors.
In a statement to the Capital Chronicle, Kleinhelter said, “A document was created at the recommendation of the State Board of Accounts,” referring to the special deputy paperwork.
But investigators found no evidence that SBOA instructed Kleinhelter to backdate or retroactively fill out the special deputy documents.
Indiana law allows sheriffs to appoint special deputies, but only under specific statutory conditions. Angie Kleinhelter did not qualify, Hearon wrote.
The affidavit also described an attempt to use a sheriff’s donation fund to repay the county.
When state auditors told Kleinhelter he was responsible for returning more than $16,000 — roughly $8,800 attributed to airfare and training conference costs for Kleinhelter’s wife, and $7,900 for Visa gift cards and grills — he asked the county auditor to transfer money from a sheriff’s donation fund to cover the debt, according to search warrant requests. 
When the auditor asked why, Kleinhelter replied, “Because that is how I want to do it.”
Hearon recommended that Kleinhelter be charged with multiple offenses, including official misconduct, forgery, theft, deception, ghost employment and obstruction of justice.
No charges filed
Despite the evidence gathered by Hearon, special prosecutor Hudelson declined to pursue charges.
After meeting with ISP investigators in September 2024, Hudelson said she was uncertain if the collected evidence amounted to criminal charges.
She said she expressed the same concerns months later during another meeting with investigators in February. 
In a Feb. 20 press release, Kleinhelter announced he had been cleared and said he “never had the intent to defraud Dubois County.”

“All monies used … had been paid back to the county in full,” the sheriff said in his statement. 
Hudelson, in a recent interview with the Capital Chronicle, said she “did not think there was enough there” to prosecute the sheriff.
“I had a real issue with any sort of criminal intent involved, and I didn’t feel like I would be able to prove the case,” Hudelson said. “Cases have elements that have to be proved, and I just did not feel like all of those elements were met.”
She added that no one pressured her not to file charges. 
Hudelson described a follow-up email Hearon sent her as “unprofessional,” though she said she did not file a formal complaint and instead forwarded the message to others within ISP.
In the Feb. 19 email, Hearon questioned Hudelson’s decision not to pursue charges against Kleinhelter and asked for a face-to-face meeting to discuss the case. 
“I have worked numerous cases and understand we each have a role … Basically, police investigate, and prosecutors prosecute,” Hearon wrote. “Unfair second-guessing on both sides can quickly erode each other’s credibility and sour future relationships.”
Hearon, a 37-year law enforcement veteran with no prior infractions, was formally disciplined by state police on July 17 in connection to his work on the Kleinhelter case, according to disciplinary records obtained by the Capital Chronicle. The internal investigation launched shortly after Hearon sent the email.
ISP’s internal findings, issued by Superintendent Anthony Scott, stated that Hearon acted “outside the bounds of professional expectations” in his communication with the prosecutor. 
He was found by ISP to be in violation of three agency policies, in total: disseminating information not disclosable to the public; conduct “unbecoming” of an officer; and “overbearing and/or oppressive conduct in the discharge of his duties.”
The disciplinary report states that Hearon improperly sent a copy of the probable cause affidavit to at least two local officials before the case had been reviewed or closed by the special prosecutor. ISP officials concluded the document sharing violated chain-of-command expectations and breached internal rules governing investigative communications.
Hearon was additionally cited for “unprofessional conduct” related to his email to Hudelson. The department’s review said the tone of the email — particularly his suggestion that the prosecutor was failing to communicate and undermining the investigation — crossed a line.

Hearon Discpline
 
In a statement to the Capital Chronicle, Hearon’s attorney, Andrew Duncan, maintained that, “Jeff Hearon is the best detective the Indiana State Police has to offer.”
“His work is as impeccable as his honesty and integrity. He undertook an investigation at the direction of former Superintendent Doug Carter and provided a thorough and more than sufficient probable cause affidavit,” Duncan wrote. “His top tier work product was set aside for unknown reasons and disciplinary charges were manufactured to make it appear as if Jeff had done something wrong. He did nothing wrong and will vigorously fight his disciplinary sanction before the Indiana State Police Board.”
Hearon was suspended without pay for two days; removed from his position as an investigative commander; reassigned to the Indiana Intelligence Fusion Center; and barred from teaching at the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy.
ISP spokesperson Ron Galaviz noted that while Hearon was reassigned, “he has not been demoted.”
Former superintendent speaks out
Carter — who assigned Hearon to the case — has since sounded alarms about how the Kleinhelter investigation was handled.
During a nearly 40-minute interview last month on WIBC’s “Kendall and Casey” show, he said ISP’s internal investigation was “targeted,” and that Hearon “got moved to a job that doesn’t matter.”
Carter, who retired from his post earlier this year when the Braun administration took over, was ISP’s longest serving superintendent, and spent nearly 40 years in law enforcement.

He oversaw the onset of the Kleinhelter investigation but retired before the probe concluded in February.
Carter said communication with state and local officials about the Kleinhelter case “went silent” after Braun, a fellow Dubois County Republican, became governor in January. Kleinhelter also endorsed Braun for governor. 
“(Hearon) found a very strong likelihood, of probable cause, to believe there had been theft, perjury, official misconduct, and conflict of interest,” Carter told WIBC. “This was after a comprehensive, three-month interview with search warrants, data reviews, personal interviews — with counsel commissioner, the matron of the jail, with the sheriff himself — and an 80-page probable cause affidavit.”
“I came to some conclusions based on what I know, and a logical conclusion … would be that there was some level of interference someplace …,” he continued.
Hearon additionally maintained in a separate letter sent to hundreds of members of the Indiana State Police Alliance earlier this year that, “I have reason to believe that current leadership within ISP may have improperly intervened to halt or suppress the progression of the investigation.” 
The Alliance is an association of Indiana state troopers with a mission of promoting better law enforcement to the citizens of Indiana and gaining statewide support for police.
But neither Carter nor Hearon have provided specific evidence proving interference.
The governor’s office has vehemently denied any involvement or obstruction in the Kleinhelter investigation.

“The special prosecutor has already made it clear that our office had no involvement,” Braun’s office said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle. “It’s a sad day when the former State Police superintendent resorts to lies in a desperate attempt to smear our brave men and women in blue.”
Hudelson additionally said she wasn’t swayed by anything — or anyone — other than the evidence presented to her by investigators. 
“I’ve never spoken with anyone from the governor’s office. I’ve never spoken with the governor. I’ve never spoken with anyone purporting to represent the governor,” she said. “There was an investigation, and I declined to file charges. And when there was more of an investigation, I didn’t change my mind. I didn’t necessarily feel like there was more uncovered. That’s how I made the decision.”
Carter told the Capital Chronicle that Hearon’s discipline “wasn’t justified,” and that ISP leadership “moved our most senior detective to a basement to take phone calls … not because that’s what they should do, but because they could.”
“Any one of seven million people in Indiana would have been in jail a long time ago based upon this evidence,” he said.
Kleinhelter pointed the Capital Chronicle to his April 6 Facebook post in which he described the nine-month investigation into his conduct as “both challenging and enlightening,” and reiterated his claim that he committed “absolutely no criminal activity.” 
“I have dedicated more than 30 years of my life to serving this county and the office, maintaining a reputation that has never been called into question — until now, when it seems that politics have begun to obscure the lines of integrity and fairness,” he said in the post. “It is disheartening to witness how personal biases can infiltrate professional settings, particularly in a role that carries the considerable responsibility of serving the public and upholding the law. My commitment to this office and the well-being of our community remains steadfast.”

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


– Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections.
And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
 Many microschools aren’t accredited

Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
New national school voucher program included in ‘big, beautiful’ law, with no cap on cost

A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators; 84% reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area.
In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards.
Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
 ‘Microschooling is not one thing’

Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
SC K-12 school voucher program hits 10,000-student cap, with thousands more rejected

Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
 Seeking choices

After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school.
Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)I certainly didn’t have Indiana embroiled in a debate over new congressional maps on my 2025 bingo card, but here we are.
My unsolicited advice to Republicans considering the likely unprecedented move: make the case. Give me population and demographic data that shows the maps must change immediately and then convince me how it will help Hoosiers.
Not how it helps President Donald Trump — Hoosiers.
At this point, no one is doing that, which makes crystal clear this is simply partisan politics.
Some politicians have called out Democrats in other states with gerrymandered maps, such as Illinois.
Gov. Mike Braun made that case in an interview with the Indiana Capital Chronicle on Tuesday:
“But the other side of the aisle, I think, have mastered gerrymandering by looking at their maps. And I think it’s a little bit maybe hypocritical that they’re now so kind of sanctimonious about it. I don’t know that they would hesitate if things were reversed.”

And, a few minutes later:
“But again, I’d like to stress that the most gerrymandered maps in the country are among blue states.”
But here’s the problem: both sides gerrymander.
This year’s discussion started in Texas, which no one would call a blue state. And I don’t care about the maps in another state. I care about Indiana’s map, the process used to create them and their impact on Hoosier voters.
My mom taught me that two wrongs don’t make a right. We’ll never get anywhere as a society if the justification for doing wrong is “they did it first.” And this can be said about a host of public policy issues.
I was heartened to see some well-respected Republicans say just that.
Speaking up
Sen. Spencer Deery, R-West Lafayette, released a statement condemning the idea.
“What we are being asked to do goes far beyond the partisan map fights that happen every 10 years across the country. Rationalizing a mid-cycle redistricting by saying, ‘Democrats gerrymander too’ is an empty and irrelevant excuse,” he said. “Instead, we are being asked to create a new culture in which it would be normal for a political party to select new voters, not once a decade — but any time it fears the consequences of an approaching election.
  Sen. Spencer Deery (Photo from Indiana Senate Republicans)
“That would clearly violate the concept of popular sovereignty by making it harder for the people to hold their elected officials accountable and the country would be an uglier place for it.”
Deery is the latest in a line of GOP lawmakers speaking out against redistricting — my running tally is seven now.
Republican House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray ran a good process in 2021 drafting maps with 14 hearings all around the state — from Sellersburg to Valparaiso. Nine of those hearings didn’t have proposed maps because the pandemic delayed data collection and analysis.
In 2011, the process was just as robust — with hearings in nine cities taking citizen input.
Now, of course, that doesn’t mean the maps are perfect. There will always be criticism. You can’t keep every community together and they do favor Republicans more than recent Democrat turnout in statewide elections would indicate.
But if you look at it, it’s a map that makes sense.
Huston and Bray generally run their chambers cleanly and try to instill respect in the institution. A mid-decade redistricting process would erode that. Best case scenario, it would likely involve a few hearings in Indianapolis only over a week or two. Worst case: they would come in with pre-ordained maps, suspend all rules and approve them in one day.
Indiana lawmakers are better than either of those options.

The developer, Manufacturing Solutions Inc., would set up a temporary quary to crush and truck 49,000 pounds of material each year for a decade. The potential exposure to silica dust is concerning news to residents.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  A rocky finding at a proposed industrial park raises more eyebrows in Morrisville.","A 12-acre hill along Route 100 in Morristown. Photo by Gordon Miller/Stowe Reporter
This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in the News & Citizen on Aug. 14, 2025.
As resident concerns linger about a proposed industrial park across from the Morrisville-Stowe Airport, a new wrinkle has drawn even more people to the opposition party — the possibility of exposure to silica, a potentially harmful rock dust, during construction.
Morrisville’s Manufacturing Solutions Inc. has been working for years to secure local and state permits to allow the development of a sprawling industrial park on an 89-acre parcel just off Route 100. According to local planning and zoning officials, it would be one of the largest developments of its kind in the region. Company management say it could help boost the local economy — if it ever comes to fruition.
Though many Morristown residents have yet to be convinced,  and a groundswell of people spoke against the project at a development review board meeting in 2023, the application cleared local approval and is currently making its way through the state’s Act 250 land-use approval process.
Many residents, particularly those who abut the property, are making last ditch efforts to block the project from state approval. For two years, they’ve said the project at all phases will have a negative effect on the area’s appearance and community’s health.
During a Morristown Selectboard meeting last week, two residents — Thea Alvin and Kristin Fogdall — gave a presentation about the project to a packed room, focusing on new application materials that have surfaced as part of the Act 250 process. The thesis focused on silica, and the possibility of exposure to the dust during construction.
The first phase of the project would involve demolition of the knoll in the center of the property, allowing MSI to flatten out the land and maximize the footprint for the industrial park.
According to application materials, MSI would set up a temporary quarry to break down the knoll over a decade, crushing and trucking 49,000 pounds of material each year. Morristown’s development review board approved the operation, but the exposure to silica comes as new information to residents.
As required by Act 250, the developer recently submitted a rock sample, which confirmed the presence of silica in the knoll. The mineral, when crushed into a fine powder, can become airborne, potentially causing lung and kidney disease and other respiratory illnesses for people who come in contact with it, according to some of those at last week’s meeting.
Following the presentation last week, several residents again spoke against the project.
“I’m very concerned about the health of our community,” Dacia Rockwood, a nurse at Copley Hospital and neighbor to the project, said. “I see patients everyday with (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) and cancer … and this is putting everybody at a huge risk for new or worsening problems.”
For Rockwood, the potential health impacts from silica exposure hits close to home. Her husband and son both have a genetic kidney disease, and last year her husband received a kidney transplant.
“To think his new kidney is at risk of failing because of our proximity to this is very upsetting,” Rockwood said. “We will probably have to move, and nobody will buy our property because of this project.”
Rockwood echoed the presenters, stating, “I didn’t move next door to this project; it moved next door to me.”
Patrick Towne, another neighbor to the project, agreed.
“There’s just no way I’m going to get away from the dust from this project,” Towne said. “I’ve been sick to my stomach over this project because of all the problems it’s going to cause.”
According to application documents, MSI plans to wet down the area during extraction to reduce the amount of dust, but everyday enforcement over 10 years could prove difficult. Selectboard member Laura Streets was sensitive to concerns about enforcement, stating there’s no way the town could always have someone on site.
MSI founder and CEO Garret Hirchak was invited to last week’s meeting, but the selectboard instead read a statement from his lawyer Chris Roy. In 2021, Hirchak purchased 437 acres behind the airport and only 89 of those acres are proposed for the industrial park. The knoll lies on an even smaller fraction of that land — 27 acres.
During an interview after last week’s meeting, Alvin, who presented at the selectboard meeting on the threat of silica exposure, questioned why demolishing the knoll is even necessary.
“How important is this one corner of that land that we need to put the entire community at risk?” Alvin said.
She also rebuked MSI’s classification of a temporary quarry operation. “How is 10 years of our lives temporary?”
Roy, MSI’s lawyer, pointed to the allowed used of MSI’s property, which was zoned as “light industrial” more than a decade ago, when new development at the airport was taking shape, a project that has since stalled.
According to Act 250 documents and Roy’s statement, MSI is interested in maximizing the footprint of the land, and extracting rock from the knoll will allow the company to generate initial revenue to fund the remainder of the project.
Although the project has advanced to Act 250 review and a hearing is still open, residents last week urged the selectboard to speak up, particularly if the developer mischaracterized the project in the initial development review board hearing.
As a stakeholder in the project, the board has interested party status and can submit testimony on behalf of the community, even to dispute previous local decisions.
The selectboard last week agreed to send a letter highlighting resident concerns. The board will draft the letter at its next regular meeting on August 18.

Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit). | Photo by Leah Craig/Michigan AdvanceAs uncertainties around tariffs and trade continue to rise, two business leaders spoke out at a town hall, with Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) facilitating the discussion on the broader impact on manufacturers, consumers, and communities.
“We are hosting this town hall to put a face to the impacts of the reckless imposing of tariffs by the Trump Administration,” said Tlaib. “Tariffs can be used as a tool to level the playing field for workers, consumers, and small businesses in the United States. However, reckless and aggressive methods in which Trump is handling tariffs have manipulated the stock market, making his friends richer, while we suffer here at home with increased costs on families and small businesses.” 
Tlaib was joined by leaders from two Livonia-based automotive suppliers: AlphaUSA and NYX Inc. Both companies are centered in the design and development of specialized automotive parts, albeit in different capacities. 
Executive Vice President & CFO for NYX Dan Laible was tasked with outlining the current situation, emphasizing the need for “conversations that are fact-based [and] data-driven.” 
“There’s just a lot of misinformation out there about this, and a lot of misconceptions out there, as if all of a sudden, this is going to fix all of the particular issues in the last 20 to 30 years of trade policy,” Laible said.

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe best course of action for citizens, he surmised, is to seek out reliable and verifiable sources of information and keep the conversation going.
Laible explained that tariff costs are absorbed by one of three avenues: foreign exporters, American companies, and American consumers. He then referred to a recent assessment from Goldman Sachs that found that 14% of tariffs were paid by foreign exporters, 64% by American companies, and 22% by American consumers. 
Furthermore, Goldman economists predicted that around 67% of the tariffs would ultimately be shouldered by U.S. consumers
“Companies can’t continue to absorb that level of additional cost indefinitely, especially when it’s hitting a quarterly loss of $800 billion based on tariffs,” said Laible. “Eventually, that has to be passed down.”
Tlaib clarified that the funds being collected through tariffs are not earmarked for any specific purpose, but are going to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

Advocates of tariffs cite trade deficits or imbalances as a rationale. But Laible highlighted that while such imbalances do exist, the context behind them is all too often overlooked. 
For example, there is a $62 billion trade imbalance between the United States and Canada. However, this imbalance is due in part to the fact that Canada has a much smaller population than the United States. Additionally, the energy infrastructure put in place—Laible cited the Keystone Pipeline in particular— has exacerbated that imbalance. 
One of the primary arguments for tariffs is that they draw consumers to domestic products instead of foreign alternatives. But Laible said the current tariff plan fails to recognize that there are certain items that aren’t produced in the United States.
Coffee, for example, is not produced domestically, and one-third of coffee consumed in the United States is sourced from Brazil, which is now facing a 50% tariff. And while the strain of tariffs haven’t yet made their way to consumers, Laible warns that it’s only a matter of time. 
AlphaUSA, which specializes in producing fasteners, nuts, and bolts specific to the automotive industry, must contend with similar constraints. 
AlphaUSA has served Livonia and the automotive industry alike for 67 years. However, as President and COO Chuck Dardas outlined in an op-ed for The Detroit News, the current tariff policies have jeopardized the livelihoods of the company and the manufacturing industry as a whole. 
At the town hall, Dardas gave the example of the nuts and bolts used in Alpha’s automotive fasteners: some are imported from Canada, others from Ohio, and the parts themselves are manufactured in Taiwan.

In 2018, the Trump Administration levied a 25% tariff on steel. Alpha was unaffected, as certain items– including the nuts and bolts used in their production–  were excluded from the tax. Now, those exclusions no longer apply, having been cancelled in March 2025. The initial 25% tariff has become a 50% tariff. Factor in the capacity constraints on the domestic steel industry and things become significantly more complex for companies like Alpha. 
“We’ve been triangulated in how this has hit our company,” Dardas told the town hall. “This is all for us buying some nuts from somebody in Mississauga, some from Ohio, and part of these bolts that we’re buying right here in Michigan.”
All in all, the costs for this small, independent business have gone up by around $250,000 per month, or an additional $3,000,000 annually.  
Moreover, he added, the rigid quality standards for the automotive industry mean that companies like Alpha can’t afford to cut corners. 
“We’re red, white, and blue. We’ve been here forever. We do all the right things. We’re community-focused. We’re not building plants all over the planet,” said Dardas. “We’ve done it right. We’ve played by the rules, and now we’re faced with this Armageddon that we seriously need help with. So I just hope we can resolve this diplomatically and politically before our company runs out of time.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_7293-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-15 06:57:00.564411

Montgomery County leaders are bracing for a possible increase in homeless residents, as President Donald Trump orders law enforcement agencies to crack down on homeless encampments across Washington, D.C.
During his regular news briefing this week, Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich said while it’s unclear exactly how the emphasis on D.C.’s homeless population will play out, he’s concerned more homeless people flowing into the county would put “further stress on our existing resources without the federal government providing the funding we would need to handle this addition.”
He noted that, regardless, shelters and drop-in centers are preparing as if there will be an increase.
The concerns came a day after Trump announced plans to take federal control of the Metropolitan Police Department in the District by invoking the Home Rule Act. Trump signed an executive order declaring crime in the city as a public emergency.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Park Service had already cleared 70 homeless encampments from parks it oversees, adding that people living in homeless encampments will be offered treatment for addiction or space in a shelter.
Those who don’t comply, Leavitt said, will face jail time or fines. Making D.C. safe and beautiful, she told reporters, involves removing “mentally disturbed individuals.”
Immigration crackdown intensifies in D.C. under Trump order for federal control

Meanwhile, Earl Stoddard, director of Montgomery County’s Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, said it’s still unclear what the clearing of homeless encampments will actually look like.
“Would this be more focused on the core of the District, and therefore they’d be pushing people to the outer limits of the District itself? Or would they be pushing them entirely out of the District of Columbia?” Stoddard asked.
The county has a large shelter at the D.C. line, in Silver Spring, where Elrich said shelter spaces are full, they serve a lot of meals, have long lines and there are still people living in encampments on Montgomery County streets.
“This is just going to magnify the problems we have to deal with, whether it’s providing additional housing or it’s feeding people,” Elrich said of a possible flow of homeless people from D.C. “We’re not going to let people starve. The nature of who we are means this is going to add additional burden to what we need to do.”
Providers who offer outreach services, drop-in centers and other county resources are preparing for a possible increase in the number of people in need of services, according to Christine Hong, chief at the county’s Services to End and Prevent Homeless agency.
Hong said she has asked providers to track the number of people coming from D.C., “so we can have a sense of the need and assess that, so that Montgomery County can be prepared with a response.”
Separately, Stoddard said Montgomery County is part of regional task forces to address stolen cars and crime.
Initially, leaders were concerned they’d be “altered dramatically” as a result of the federal takeover of D.C. police, but so far, “We have not seen dramatic shifts that have us hyper-concerned about whether we are going to be able to maintain our ongoing day-to-day operational working relationships at this state,” Stoddard said.
“So far, what we’re hearing and seeing is not a dramatic shift in policy and procedure,” he said. “That may come. I don’t want to say we’re optimistic. We’re just sort of watching with intensity what actually happens.”

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
 States in a ‘very, very strong position’

Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
 A ‘substantial headache’

Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.












We have no idea yet how we're going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw




New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

(Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images)Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office wants to vacate a 12-year-old injunction on an abortion provider state funding ban — risking Planned Parenthood’s participation in Indiana’s Medicaid program.
“That injunction’s legal foundation has entirely eroded,” the office wrote in a brief last month, more than 11 years after the most recent filing in a long-dormant lawsuit with the reproductive health care group.
It cited a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision, handed down the month prior, that Medicaid patients don’t have the right to sue to see their doctor of choice.
US Supreme Court allows South Carolina to remove Planned Parenthood from list of Medicaid providers

The ruling allows South Carolina to exclude clinics that also provide abortions from its Medicaid program, pending permission from a lower court. Indiana could draw on that new precedent.
But Planned Parenthood’s Great Northwest, Hawai’i, Alaska, Indiana, and Kentucky chapter warns that health care access is in jeopardy.
“Indiana’s extreme abortion restrictions have created a dangerous environment for patients and providers,” affiliate CEO Rebecca Gibron said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle. “Now, targeted attacks against Planned Parenthood threaten to rip away basic health care from thousands of people who already have nowhere else to turn.”
The organization provides birth control, cancer screenings, human immunodeficiency virus testing and prevention, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, vaccinations and wellness exams.
“Other safety-net providers cannot absorb all of the patients that Planned Parenthood sees,” Gibron added. “When you target us, you target the critical health care that keeps communities healthy.”
Looking at the law
Indiana’s House Enrolled Act 1210, approved in 2011, bars state agencies from contracting with or giving grants to any organization that performs abortions, or has a facility where abortions are performed. The law exempts hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers.
It was “designed to prevent the indirect subsidization of abortion and abortion providers,” the Office of Attorney General said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle.
On the day then-Gov. Mitch Daniels signed the ban into law, Planned Parenthood’s Hoosier chapter filed suit in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Indiana.
The group, and several individual plaintiffs, are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana. Rokita’s office, meanwhile, represents the state officials named as defendants.
The plaintiffs won a permanent injunction in 2013, with Judge Tanya Walton Pratt ruling that using the ban to deny Planned Parenthood Medicaid funding and reimbursement “is unlawful” because it would deny patients “a free choice of medical provider.”
  Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita speaks at an event on Tuesday, July 29, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
But the nation’s highest court overturned that logic when it agreed with attorneys arguing that federal Medicaid law didn’t spell that out.
“With that change in the law, this Court’s judgment and injunction in Planned Parenthood’s favor can no longer stand,” Rokita’s office said. 
“It is no longer equitable to continue enforcing an injunction that interferes with a law enacted by the people’s representatives to further a vital state interest in protecting prenatal life when that injunction’s legal foundation has entirely eroded,” it continued.
Other things have changed since 2011, however.
Indiana’s abortion ban
Shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court ended the federal right to an abortion in 2022, Hoosier lawmakers outlawed the procedure — with narrow exceptions — and eliminated state licensure of abortion clinics.
“The provider landscape has changed dramatically — there are fewer health care options, longer wait times, and an even more fragile safety net,” Planned Parenthood affiliate spokeswoman Nicole Irwin said.
A small number of procedures still occur in Indiana, but they are performed at hospitals or hospital-owned outpatient centers.
Planned Parenthood hasn’t provided abortions in Indiana since 2022, according to Irwin, who argued the law “should not be used to disqualify us” as a Medicaid provider.
“If for some reason the State moves to exclude us, despite us no longer being an abortion provider in Indiana, patients would not be able to use their Medicaid coverage with us,” Irwin said.
“We serve thousands of Medicaid patients each year in Indiana,” she continued. “Cutting us off would mean the loss of millions in revenue that directly fund this care, but more importantly, it would mean patients lose trusted providers and timely access to services that protect their health and lives.”
Lawsuit revived
The state has argued the Supreme Court’s decision “fundamentally changes the legal landscape” — and means the Southern District’s ruling “is no longer good law.”
“Continued enforcement of the injunction does not merely interfere with federal-state arrangements,” Rokita’s office wrote in the brief. “It also undermines a vital state policy in promoting ‘respect for and preservation of prenatal life at all stages of development.’”
“One of Indiana’s most important public policies is to promote childbirth over abortion,” it continued.

In a July 17 response, the plaintiffs argued that, if the final judgment and its permanent injunction is vacated, the case should be reopened.
“Rather than simply asking that the final judgment entered in the plaintiffs’ favor be vacated, the State has requested that judgment be entered in its favor,” the plaintiffs wrote. “Under the circumstances of this case, that request is highly improper.”
They said only three of four legal claims were addressed in the judgment, leaving one about the Constitution’s Contract Clause undecided.
“This was certainly appropriate, for the resolution of the Medicaid Act claim in the plaintiffs’ favor rendered it unnecessary to resolve the Contract Clause claim,” they wrote.
“But, if the relief premised on the Medicaid Act claim is vacated, the plaintiffs must be afforded an opportunity to assert their remaining claim for relief,” the plaintiffs continued. “Given the passage of time, they believe it may be appropriate to assert additional challenges to the defunding statute as well.”
Rokita’s office argued that’s meritless.
Its July 23 reply indicates Planned Parenthood only challenged the law’s application to contracts and grants that were executed prior to the effective date.
Twelve years later, the organization “does not contend” that any agreements predating the law are still in effect, the office noted. And it’s been so long that the claim was basically “abandon(ed).”
Additionally, when negotiating the final judgment, “the parties made clear that it would resolve all claims” minus the issue of attorney’s fees, which came separately.
Even if Planned Parenthood wants to reopen things, it “cannot do so by bootstrapping its request onto the State’s motion,” the office argued. “… Procedurally, a request for affirmative relief must be made by motion, not dropped into an opposition brief.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — When Carri Hicks thinks of state testing, she remembers the fourth grader in her classroom who threw up from the stress of the end-of-year exam.
A Democratic state senator and former public-school teacher from Oklahoma City, Hicks found herself in the uncommon position of agreeing with Oklahoma’s far-right Republican state superintendent, Ryan Walters, who on Friday abruptly proposed ending the state’s current “high-stakes” method of student testing this year.
“What I feel like we’re currently experiencing in our Oklahoma public schools is not the best of what that could look like,” Hicks said. “I do think that our current system of state testing is horrible.”
To some Oklahomans, especially those with an education background, Walters’ announcement was a welcome policy change, but criticism of his plan has emerged from voices on both sides of the debate.

Despite agreeing with Walters’ idea, Hicks was skeptical of his decision to announce such a significant change shortly before the start of the school year without first developing a plan with educators, district leaders and state lawmakers. 
Last month, Walters similarly caught the entire state off guard with an order that all public schools provide cafeteria meals at no cost to students — a declaration that district leaders panned because of financial difficulties and a lack of legal basis.
“I feel like this is just a continuation of chaos instead of clarity,” Hicks said after the state testing announcement.
Under Walters’ proposal, Oklahoma would not administer state reading and math tests this school year to students in grades 3-8. Instead, each district would choose benchmark assessments to purchase from a private vendor.
Walters said scores from benchmark tests taken throughout the school year will better benefit students and educators because they reflect real-time learning.
“We’re not going to come tack on a government-required test at the end of the year,” he said. “What we’re going to do is what parents have said is actually actionable and helpful, what teachers say actually drives classroom practice, what administrators say would ease operations.”
Trump administration rejected similar proposal from Arizona
The Oklahoma State Department of Education is accepting public comment on the proposal through Sept. 8 before submitting it to the Trump administration.
Walters said he expects a “very quick” approval from the federal government, but the first Trump administration denied a similar plan from Arizona in 2018.
At the time, Arizona suggested a “menu” of assessment options that districts could choose from. The U.S. Department of Education rejected the idea and threatened to withhold federal funds if Arizona attempted it.
All students should take the same statewide test, federal officials decided.
“The requirements that all students are held to the same, high challenging academic standards and are assessed on the same statewide assessment form the basis for much of a state’s accountability system and provide essential and comparable information to parents and the public,” the federal agency wrote in a response to Arizona.
Last year, a nationwide test revealed all-time-low scores in fourth- and eighth-grade reading in Oklahoma while the state’s overall academic performance showed little to no progress since 2022.

Changing state tests won’t improve those outcomes, said Christy Hovanetz, a school accountability expert at ExcelinEd, an education think tank that advocates for rigorous testing. 
States that try to change their assessments tend to do so to obscure poor results, she said.
“This looks like an attempt to muddy the waters so people don’t know what’s happening with student performance,” Hovanetz said.
Benchmark and state tests have ‘very different purposes’
Benchmark assessments have become a common, integral tool that many Oklahoma schools use in addition to the state tests. Students take these incremental assessments multiple times within the school year to gauge their learning progress.
Oklahoma City Public Schools uses this data “day in and day out,” said Jason Galloway, the district’s chief of staff. 
Meanwhile, state test results aren’t released until two to three months after the school year has ended.

“Internally, we really refer to that as autopsy data,” Galloway said. “The learning has already taken place. It’s not data that we are using to make real-time instructional decisions.”
Other states, like Florida, produce their state test results within hours or days after students finish taking them, giving educators more time to use the data as they plan for the following school year, Hovanetz said. The difference, she said, is state leaders having the “political will” to publicize the scores sooner rather than later. 
While benchmark assessments give up-to-date information mid-year, Hovanetz said state tests reveal whether the decisions a school made over the course of an entire academic year produced positive results.
“They’re two very different purposes,” Hovanetz said. “The state assessment should be a check on the system (to) make sure everything that happened throughout the year went well.”
Accomplishing Walters’ plan would be ‘extremely difficult,’ state official said
Walters’ proposal would add another layer of complexity by allowing Oklahoma’s 500-plus districts to choose from a variety of benchmark vendors. 
Hovanetz said, in her experience, it’s not possible to put together an accurate, statewide picture of student performance with a mixture of different tests.
That issue has raised doubts among Oklahomans, as well. 
The Education Department hasn’t shown how it would compare scores from various district-selected benchmarks, said Brent Bushey, CEO of Fuel OKC, a nonprofit focused on improving public-school quality in Oklahoma City. 
“While the concept is attractive to me, it feels like this announcement came out before the (state Education Department) did the legwork to have a responsible program in place,” Bushey said.

Fairly comparing results across multiple tests will be “extremely difficult” and cost more money, said Megan Oftedal, executive director of the Office of Educational Quality and Accountability. 
OEQA is a small state agency that plays an important part in facilitating state testing. Oftedal said Walters didn’t consult OEQA or its board of commissioners when developing his plan.
The Commission for Educational Quality and Accountability, the board in charge of OEQA, casts the final vote on what state test score determines whether a student is proficient, advanced or behind in reading, math and other subjects. A time-consuming process involving multiple state agencies and several teacher committees leads up to that vote, which typically takes place once every six years.
Under Walters’ plan, Oklahoma would have to conduct that process over and over for each benchmark assessment approved, Oftedal said. 
“These processes are costly, time-intensive, and raise concerns about efficient use of taxpayer dollars,” she wrote in an email to the commission, which Oklahoma Voice obtained.
State superintendent blames teacher unions for state testing failures
To Walters, that process is necessary to eliminate a “teachers union approach” he claimed has failed students.
“Standardized testing has crippled teachers’ ability to educate your children for far too long,” he wrote in a statewide message to parents.
However, the state’s largest teacher union, the Oklahoma Education Association, has long advocated against standardized tests, President Cari Elledge said. Its nationwide affiliate, the National Education Association, has been similarly critical.
“As a 5th-grade teacher, I have seen first-hand the effects of standardized testing on Oklahoma students,” Elledge said in a statement. “These tests only serve as stressful, one-day snapshots in a single school year. They are not representative of a student’s true academic progress.
“The State Superintendent continues to misrepresent and vilify Oklahoma educators’ voices instead of collaborating with them. It is disappointing but not surprising.”

(Photo by Erik Gunn /Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin’s jobs and employment numbers showed a slightly softening economy in July, following national trends, the state labor department reported Thursday.
“The Wisconsin labor market has cooled a bit along with the national economy. Unemployment remains historically low,” said Scott Hodek, section chief in the office of economic advisors for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (DWD), in a briefing on the July numbers.
Private-sector jobs dropped slightly in July from June, DWD reported. Employment and labor force participation edged down slightly, too, as did the state’s unemployment rate.
“What we’re seeing is that Wisconsin seems to be following the national trend,” Hodek told the Wisconsin Examiner. While the economy is cooling down, “we’re actually still seeing historically low unemployment rates,” Hodek said. “So you’ve got kind of a mix of up and down indicators.”
He pointed to national economic uncertainty as well as the longstanding challenge of Wisconsinites aging out of the workforce faster than younger residents are entering it as likely contributors to the economic cooling. 
DWD pegged the number of Wisconsinites working in July at 3.05 million, a drop of 4,500 from June and down 32,500 from July 2024.
The number of people who were unemployed in July was projected at 98,600 — down 2,200 from June, but up 5,400 from July 2024. The unemployment rate for July was 3.1%.
The labor force shrank in July to just under 3.15 million, a decline of 6,700 from June and a decline of 27,000 from July 2024. The labor force is defined as people 16 or older who are working or seeking work, excluding people in the military or who are in institutions such as nursing homes or prisons.
Wisconsin’s labor force participation rate was 65% of the state’s population 16 or older in July — down 0.1% from June and down just under 1% from July a year ago. Labor force participation remains ahead of the U.S. as a whole, while unemployment is lower, DWD reported.
Employment and labor force participation numbers are projected from a monthly survey of households. A separate survey, polling employers, produces data on the number of jobs in the state.
Wisconsin counted just under 3.06 million nonfarm jobs — an increase of 1,800 over June and 20,200 over July a year ago. Private sector jobs in July totaled more than 2.6 million, a decrease of 3,800 from June but still 15,100 ahead of July 2024.
Construction jobs fell by 500 from June, Hodek said, but remained 3,100 ahead of July 2024. Manufacturing jobs fell by 500, and are down 1,800 from a year ago.
Rosier picture in Wisconsin than broader U.S.
Wisconsin’s jobs report Thursday lacked the drama of the national jobs numbers reported two weeks ago that prompted President Donald Trump to fire the nation’s chief statistician.
On Friday, Aug. 1, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported the U.S. gained 73,000 jobs in July, below analysts’ estimates. The BLS also updated national job numbers for May and June, dramatically reducing both: in June, a gain of 14,000 jobs instead of previously reported 147,000, and in May, an increase of 19,000 instead of the previously reported 125,000.
The national unemployment rate of 4.2% was in line with economic forecasts, CNBC reported. Other indicators nationally added up to “a slow but persistent cooling trend,” the North America regional president at Manpower Group, Ger Doyle, told CNBC.
Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to declare without evidence that the numbers were “RIGGED.” He summarily fired the director of the BLS, replacing her this week with an economist from the far-right Heritage Foundation who has called for a broad overhaul of the agency.
Hodek told the Wisconsin Examiner Thursday that DWD has not received any communications about changes in procedure from the BLS.
“We’ve certainly seen the news and we’re monitoring the situation, of course,” Hodek said. “But we do have confidence in our data and we can’t really speculate on what could possibly happen. We’ll just need to wait and see what the Bureau of Labor Statistics actually does down the road.”
Hodek said that revisions of previous months’ reports are “a normal part of the data process.” The first round of data isn’t inaccurate, but “as you take more time, the data become more accurate,” he said.
“Ideally you want a combination of both —  something that kind of gives you the current edge of where you’re headed, and then as more and better data come in, you get a better sense of what has been happening,” Hodek said.
For example, a quarterly collection of information from the unemployment insurance system “actually covers most employers and it’s very solid data,” he said. “But it lags by half a year.”
Information from that report can be used to further refine the calculations and assumptions that go into the state’s monthly reports.
The monthly numbers for the nation as a whole and for each state go through different calculations and formulas, Hodek said, so it’s not possible to draw direct connections between the state jobs numbers and the national jobs numbers.
It’s also too soon to explain the seemingly dramatic differences between the national jobs picture and Wisconsin’s, he added: “We’ve only got a couple of data points where we saw those large revisions, so that doesn’t really make a trend necessarily yet.”
Hodek doesn’t think Wisconsin is somehow “diverging from the national economy,” however, he said. “In fact, it’s fairly unlikely in general, just because what happens to the national economy and the global economy is going to impact us as well. We tend to follow the national and global trends.”

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)The governing board for Idaho’s Commission for Libraries is preparing its budget in case of holdbacks, or a mid-year cut, in addition to restructuring programs to cover a canceled federal grant. 
The commission isn’t alone in considering up to 6% cuts to existing budgets. Gov. Brad Little’s office in May told agency directors to plan for potential reductions in spending, at 2%, 4% or 6% of their budgets, Idaho Education News reported. The direction came amid reports that the state’s revenue was $141 million below the projected level through May, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
State Librarian Stephanie Bailey-White presented proposed budget adjustments to the library commissioners Thursday at the board’s regular meeting. 
“If we have a 2% or 4% holdback, things will be tight, but we’ve budgeted for those scenarios,” Bailey-White said. “If we have a 6% pullback, depending on when we hear about it … the longer it goes when you hear about that, the trickier it is.” 
The Idaho Legislature appropriated around $4.97 million to the commission for fiscal year 2026, which ends next June. The commission budgeted to use around $4.7 million to account for potential holdbacks, Bailey-White said Thursday. 
If there are no cuts required to spending in the current fiscal year, the commission will launch its “tech refresh” program for libraries to be able to purchase laptops and other technology, and allocate funds for the My First Books program, which provides children who are unlikely to have many books in the home, from infants to kindergarteners, with a book a month for eight months. 
Much of the commission’s expenses are tied up in multi-year contracts, Bailey-White said. 
“A lot of our expenses, frankly, are fixed expenses that we don’t have a lot of wiggle room,” she said. “So then we really have to look at travel or some other things that we may have a little more flexibility with, but a 6% will be really challenging.” 
She said options would include canceling a board tour of libraries, limiting staff travel, and keeping vacancies unfilled and using personnel savings to cover costs.

 Commission continues transition of talking book service to partnership with Utah

William Lamb, e-services program supervisor at the commission, said he is continuing to work with Utah’s state library system to continue a program for blind and visually impaired Idahoans or others who have trouble reading because of a disability. 
The Talking Book Service, which provides audiobooks for free to qualifying people, would have been cut because the federal grant supporting it was canceled amid the dismantling of the national Institute of Museum and Library Services by the Trump administration, the Idaho Press reported. 
Four of the Idaho Talking Book staff positions that were supported by the library services institute were eliminated, the Idaho Press reported. Two additional positions from the program will adjust to help oversee the program in partnership with the Utah State Library. 
Lamb said the new partnership will launch in September. 
 Bucks for Books program resulted in more readership among elementary students 

Commission staff also reported Thursday that its program in partnership with the Idaho Lottery, called Bucks for Books, contributed $50,000 this year for elementary school libraries to buy new books. School library grant recipients received between $1,000 and $3,000 to support their collections, Bailey-White said. 
Libraries in 17 schools used the money to purchase more than 5,300 total books, Bailey-White said, and nearly all of those libraries reported an increase in the number of books checked out. 
A few of the school libraries reported a nearly 100% increase in the number of books checked out, a staff report said. Awardees reported 44,845 more checkouts in the 2024-25 school year compared to the 2023-24 school year, the report said.
“At least one in four elementary schools have a book budget of $0,” Bailey-White said, “so when they get an influx of new books, there’s an increase in reading interest and circulation, and kids get to have books that they enjoy reading.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)In a virtual meeting with health care providers and community partners Thursday afternoon, North Carolina Health Secretary Devdutta “Dev” Sangvai said upcoming cuts are a response to a “threat to the foundation of the Medicaid program.”
The call came a day after NC Newsline reported the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services plans to cut Medicaid rates for all providers by 3% effective Oct. 1, with some areas of care like inpatient and residential services and research-based therapy for autism receiving up to 10% rate reductions — for a total of roughly $320 million in cuts. Sangvai first detailed these cuts to leadership of the General Assembly in a letter sent Monday.
The full impact to North Carolina health care providers will be substantially larger than the lost state dollars, as that reduction means a corresponding loss in federal matching funds. A table of rate cuts for different services provided by NCDHHS shows that if the planned reductions take place, patients in North Carolina will receive $1.1 billion less in Medicaid services.

Sangvai told providers the cuts to Medicaid programs will only further contribute to snowballing costs as health outcomes worsen and preventative care is unable to take place. He pointed to the end of coverage for GLP-1 drugs for weight loss and the end of the state’s Healthy Opportunity Pilots, testing non-medical interventions to improve overall health.
“You’re starting to see that some of those services that we have put in place with the idea of spending a little today to save a lot later are going to be suspended. This puts considerable pressure on the Medicaid program to actually bend the cost curve,” Sangvai said. “These were innovations that were put forward with the idea that we can actually lower total cost of care, but with the suspension of both of them, we will not be able to focus on that methodology.”
The cuts come primarily in response to what health officials said was a $319 million shortfall in funding from the General Assembly against the 2025-26 Medicaid rebase, the projected costs the state will incur funding Medicaid services, which stands at $819 million. While the legislature appropriated $600 million, only $500 million will go to the rebase, with the remainder designated for managed care oversight.
Julia Lurch, chief actuary and chief strategy officer for NCDHHS, said making the cuts has been a “very challenging exercise” and that months went into planning for scenarios where state funding fell short of their request.
“We understand that the reductions that I’m about to go through will have serious implications for our provider community as well as our beneficiaries that we are here to serve,” Lurch said. “We know that this will put some financial pressure on our provider partners and potentially lead to some providers stopping their service to our Medicaid beneficiaries due to unsustainable payment rates.”
Top Republican lawmakers dismiss DHHS assessment, vow to protect provider payments
While legislative Democrats indicated they hope the General Assembly will pass additional appropriations to avoid the cuts entirely, Republicans expressed doubts that the rate reductions are needed at all.
Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth) wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that he believes the proposed cuts to be “unnecessary and jumping the starting line before legislators ask their questions and get answers.”

“We have no plans to increase the allocation for the rebase. We have grave concerns with the lack of information shared with the General Assembly related to their proposed cuts,” Lambeth wrote. “I do not believe they need to cut rates and we will fight to protect payments to providers.”
Lambeth said the General Assembly’s Health and Human Services oversight committee, which he co-chairs, will probe the proposed cuts and will “dig deep into their budget” to understand why they came to be.
“The GA did not cut Medicaid. We provided 600 million in new funding and I want to understand why are cuts necessary,” he wrote. “I have not experience in my tenure such poor communication and lack of creativity.”
Republican leadership view the situation similarly, with spokespeople for Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) and House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) calling for more responsible management of the NCDHHS budget and exploration of less severe cuts to services.
Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford), who attended a separate Medicaid information session on Wednesday, said while she has heard from providers opposed to the projected cuts, she has not yet heard from colleagues on the prospects for additional funding.
“It’s unfortunate, but I think the fault lies in us, in the legislature, for not providing the funding they need,” Harrison said. “I wish we’d get on the budget. I think that’s the bottom line.”
Rep. Sarah Crawford (D-Wake), who serves as CEO of the Tammy Lynn Center for Developmental Disabilities, said she hopes as information gets out, providers and patients push lawmakers to protect the health care they need.
“I certainly hope that we will be able to slowly fund the rebase or at least get a little bit closer so that we won’t have to have provider agencies sustaining these cuts,” Crawford said. “It is going to be very hard, particularly for some of the smaller providers, to figure out how to sustain these cuts.”
The General Assembly is slated to return on Aug. 26, the earliest any legislative action would likely take place regarding Medicaid funding.
Medicaid cuts by the numbers
NCDHHS Chief of Staff Jonathan Kappler stressed that “there’s no part of the Medicaid program that is not being touched by these funding issues,” walking providers through the rate cuts set to take effect in October on Thursday’s call.
Those cuts are slated to include reductions in staff, contracts, and other internal projects to reduce the overhead of the state Medicaid program, he said, though those changes have not yet been made public. “This is a shared burden for all of us,” he said.
The largest reduction in state Medicaid costs will come through a 10% rate cut to nursing home services, which the state projects will reduce spending by roughly $46.8 million. That’s followed by a 1.5% cut to pre-paid standard health plans operated by managed care organizations, health companies partnered by the state that operate Medicaid plans at a fixed cost, which the state projects will cut $44 million in spending.
According to Sangvai’s letter to General Assembly leadership, the reduction to the pre-paid plans will be retroactive to July 1 — though officials on the call Thursday indicated they expect the plan operators to bear those costs rather than health care providers themselves.

“There will be no retroactive action on the providers or clawback for any services between July 1 and September 30,” said Jay Ludlam, the Deputy Secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
Ludlam also stressed that the changes taking place Oct. 1 will not remove any individuals from Medicaid. “We’re not cutting or changing eligibility. People are not losing Medicaid coverage because of these changes,” he said.
Officials said in early September, they aim to notify providers of rate changes through a bulletin as well as provide notice to Medicaid recipients about service reductions.
Halting coverage of GLP-1 drugs — commonly sold as Ozempic or Wegovy — for weight loss will cut costs by another $34 million, the state projects. And reducing rates for inpatient services by 10% is expected to reduce the rebase by $33.3 million. When combined with federal dollars, that is projected to represent a $209 million loss for providers in the state.
In addition to the services directly affected by the largest cuts, Crawford said the rate reduction has the potential to endanger additional programs that were already operating at a loss.
“We have a number of programs at [Tammy Lynn Center] where the Medicaid reimbursement rate does not fully fund the cost of providing services, and that includes things like respite care, which is a lifeline,” Crawford said. “What provider agencies or hospitals have to do is really look at how they do blended services to come out on the bottom line not totally in the red.”
Stephanie Strickland, a spokesperson for the North Carolina Healthcare Association, which advocates for the state’s hospitals, wrote in an emailed statement that they are still evaluating the full impact of the cuts.
“We are concerned about how these cuts could affect hospitals’ ability to care for Medicaid beneficiaries and the broader community,” Strickland wrote. “We look forward to working with our partners in the General Assembly and at NCDHHS to explore alternative approaches to achieving Medicaid savings. Once our analysis is complete, we will issue a more detailed statement on behalf of our membership early next week.”
In an effort to help steel rural health facilities against the state cuts and federal changes to the Medicaid program, NCDHHS announced Thursday that it would apply for funding from the Rural Health Transformation program.
Medicaid Services Reductions August 2025
Significant cuts for patients with disabilities
Advocates raised concerns that some of the steepest cuts under the new Medicaid rates will impact services that are crucial to patients with disabilities, such as behavioral therapy and intensive care services.
Research-based behavioral health therapy and applied behavioral analysis services, which largely aid patients with autism, will receive a 10% rate cut, reducing state spending by about $17.4 million. On Thursday’s call, NCDHHS assistant secretary Melanie Bush said the cuts are in response to “exponential growth” in available behavioral health services and their increased use by Medicaid beneficiaries.
“We absolutely want children who have autism to receive the services they are medically necessary for,” Bush said. “We are just simply trying to curb the over-utilization that we feel is happening based on our conversations with other state Medicaid programs and how we’ve seen it implemented over the last year.”
  Rep. Sarah Crawford (D-Wake) (Photo: ncleg.gov)
The state is also cutting $13.2 million to intensive care facility services for individuals with intellectual disabilities, which Crawford said will impact patients who need “total personal care,” including assistance bathing and feeding.
“Those services are very costly. It takes a lot of staff to run those services for a long time,” she said. “Staff were getting paid $9, $10, $12 an hour — because of rate increases, a lot of providers have been able to bring pay up to $15, to $18 an hour depending on the provider, and that’s important to be able to keep up with just the cost of living.”
Corye Dunn, the director of public policy for Disability Rights North Carolina, said in an interview that the rate cuts are likely to only worsen longterm staffing issues in the disability care space.
“We have a real shortage of what we call direct support professionals, people who are providing that kind of hands-on care to people with disabilities,” Dunn said. “Any kind of rate cuts put pressure on pay for direct support professionals and others in the space, and that’s just going to make it much harder for people with disabilities to get their needs met.”
David Laxton, a spokesperson for the Autism Society of North Carolina, wrote in an email that these cuts will “significantly harm our organization and other providers serving North Carolina’s autism community.”
Many providers serving patients with autism operate on thin margins, he wrote, including his own organization. Cuts to Medicaid rates would likely force providers to reduce services or shut down programs entirely, he added.
“Medicaid enables people with autism to live more independently in their homes and communities, ultimately saving taxpayers money,” he wrote. “These proposed changes would hurt the very individuals Medicaid is intended to support — people with autism and other intellectual or developmental disabilities. We are actively working with legislative leaders to reduce the impact on these critical Medicaid services.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Medicaid-cuts-nurse-Getty-2025.jpg,,,2025-08-15 06:57:00.564411

Crested caracara and bean goose in the Rockies? Yes indeed. The biological phenomenon of vagrancy appears particularly pronounced in 2025.
The post Aloft and lost: Here are the 5 ‘accidental’ bird sightings in Wyoming this year appeared first on WyoFile .","Lander resident Frank Stetler was driving eastbound over the Boysen Reservoir bridge in mid-May when he got a call from a fellow serious bird nerd.
“He was like, ‘Where are you right now? You should really consider making your way to Casper,’” recalled Stetler, a nongame biologist with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. 
Excellent timing. Already on his way to Casper for fieldwork, Stetler jumped on his friend’s tip of an especially rare bird sighting. A tundra bean goose — a species that’s typically at home in Northern Europe and Siberia —  was kicking it with native feathered friends in urban Natrona County.
“It was just hanging out in the park with some Canada geese and a turkey eating dandelions,” Stetler said. 
The Game and Fish biologist made it in time to savor what’s called an “accidental” or “vagrant” species, describing the biological phenomenon of birds that head in unexpected directions. Entire books have been devoted to the topic.

Stetler only has hunches about what sent the Casper bean goose to the opposite side of the Pacific Ocean. But based on its condition — no leg bands and intact wing and tail feathers — the past chair of the Wyoming Birds Records Committee was confident it was a wild bird. 
“It probably ended up with either a Canada goose or gray- or white-fronted goose flock,” he said. “My guess would be, by way of Alaska, it got mixed up and then moved with the flock.”
The May 19 sighting marked the first time on record that a vagrant tundra bean goose had ever been observed in Wyoming. 
Reasons for vagrancy are many. Aberrant weather patterns, powerful storms like hurricanes, wildfires and changes in food availability can all cause “accidental” birds to fly to unusual haunts, Stelter said.
“Sometimes they’ll migrate in the opposite direction,” he said. 
Other times, they get human assistance, like an accidental ride on an oceanliner or even an RV. Another theory is that vagrancy is necessary for species survival.

For whatever reason, Wyoming was the recipient of an unusually high number of vagrant birds this year. Typically, there are two or three a year, but Stetler’s aware of five documented during the spring migration alone. 
A common crane — another Eurasian visitor — kicked off this year’s list after being photographed outside of Sheridan. A handful of birders reported the sighting, according to eBird, a global database of bird observations.

Then came the bean goose a few weeks later. The next odd-for-Wyoming sighting followed the next day. A Yellowstone National Park visitor photographed a crested caracara in Lamar Valley.
That’s a unique-looking falcon, typically at home in Central and South America, that has a particular knack for vagrancy, according to TikToker birdman222.
Stetler suspects the caracara was an Equality State denizen for some time. 
“A guy sent me cell phone pictures of a caracara outside of Farson. I want to say it was in February,” he said. “The chances of that bird being the same bird that ended up further north are super likely.”

In late May, a yellow-bellied flycatcher was photographed in Goshen County. That’s a boreal forest dweller that typically migrates through the continental United States well to the east, distribution maps show. It was the first of its kind ever officially documented in Wyoming, according to observers. 
Then in the closing days of May came a Grace’s warbler, spotted just south of Casper foraging in Ponderosa pine and tussling with Audubon’s warblers, its observers reported.

That mature pine-dependent bird is usually at home in the southwest U.S. down to Nicaragua — and it’s slipping into a concerning decline, according to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. 
Stetler sought out the Grace’s warbler while he was in Casper, but no dice. He did, however, see the bean goose at the city park — just in the nick of time.
“It was a one-day wonder,” Stetler said. “We had a big storm come over, and then no one saw it after that.”

U.S. Rep. Hageman's comment didn't go over well in Pinedale, where residents struggled for years to clean up health-threatening pollution from oil and gas drilling.
The post Wyoming crowd boos Hageman retort that protections against greenhouse gases based on ‘false science’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, responding to a question during a recent town hall event in Pinedale, said she is “strongly in support of repealing the endangerment finding.” The landmark 2009 doctrine classified greenhouse gases as pollutants and legally obliged federal agencies to regulate their emissions under the Clean Air Act.
The Republican congresswoman added, “The endangerment finding is absolutely based upon false science.”
A chorus of boos rose from the crowd assembled on July 29, along with guffaws and several people shouting, “No!”
Hageman continued over the outburst: “CO2 [carbon dioxide] is not a pollutant. As far as the validity and the science that was the foundation for that, they cooked the books.”
Many of her Sublette County constituents weren’t having it. The booing continued, along with one person shouting, “Lie, lie,” as Hageman pressed on.
The reaction reflected the community’s struggle with air quality over the past 20 years.

Tucked in the northern edge of the Upper Green River Basin, Pinedale and, in particular, the valley south of town began experiencing alarming ozone levels in the late 2000s. At least one measurement exceeded perpetually smoggy Los Angeles. Residents, especially those with preexisting respiratory conditions, were advised to avoid outdoor exercise on high-ozone days. On one such day, a mother was advised by a doctor to drive her newborn 78 miles to Jackson because the baby was hypoxic (suffering from a low blood-oxygen level).
The sudden air quality crisis in what many had long considered a pristine environment coincided with a national headline-grabbing boom in natural gas extraction. 
The Pinedal Anticline and Jonah fields were among the first testing grounds for the industry’s wildly advancing use of hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling. Along with the intense industrial activity came emissions of raw methane (an especially potent greenhouse gas) volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. VOCs and NOx, under the right atmospheric conditions, turn into ozone — a serious respiratory threat and a greenhouse gas.
The endangerment finding brought added pressure on federal agencies to take the kind of action that helped communities like Pinedale fight back. 
At the July town hall, Pinedale resident Mary Lynn Worl asked Hageman, “What is your position on this proposal [to rescind the endangerment finding], and what will you do to ensure that the citizens breathe healthy air, especially our children with developing lungs?”

The congresswoman responded with her statement about the endangerment finding being based on “false science.”
Worl was among the founding members of Citizens United for Responsible Energy Development. The group — amid community division and resistance from state and industry officials — helped force state and federal action to address the health crisis. 
“At first, I was shocked that people booed, you know,” Worl told WyoFile in a follow up interview. “But then, when I really thought about it, I thought, ‘No. There’s a lot of people in this audience who remember and who have worked hard.'”
Hageman’s office did not respond to WyoFile’s request for comment.
Wyoming stakes, and nuance
Last month, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin chose a car dealership in Indiana as the forum for announcing that his agency will try to rescind the endangerment finding, noting that Obama- and Biden-era policies stemming from the doctrine have had a profound impact on the auto industry.
“With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end sixteen years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers,” Zeldin said in a prepared statement, adding that federal automobile emission standards “stick American families with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year.” 
Although Zeldin has insisted “the Trump EPA’s proposal to repeal the 2009 Endangerment Finding is about mobile sources (vehicles), not power plants,” many — including Gov. Mark Gordon — see the move as another strategy to continue broad emission regulation rollbacks.
“We were never against drilling and development. We wanted it done right. We wanted it to be done as safely as possible.”Mary Lynn Worl, Pinedale
“The potential rescinding of the endangerment finding would represent the federal government not just moving the goalposts, but eliminating them entirely,” Gordon’s Communications Director Michael Pearlman told WyoFile via email. “This Obama-era doctrine has underpinned virtually all the regulations of greenhouse gases that have been implemented, particularly CO2.”
For example, the endangerment finding helped justify Obama’s 2015 Clean Power Plan, which targeted carbon dioxide emissions at existing power plants and instituted rules to reduce methane emissions in the oil and natural gas industry. Though that effort was mostly struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court, Biden revised the initiative, which was commonly referred to as Clean Power Plan 2.0. This time, it imposed a schedule on coal- and natural gas-fired power plants to vastly reduce emissions, retrofit with carbon capture technology or close altogether.
Those, and dozens of other federal regulations to reduce industrial emissions, have been seen by many as an existential threat to Wyoming’s fossil fuel industries.
Since taking office in 2019, Gordon’s administration has initiated or taken part in dozens of lawsuits either challenging federal policies or defending them. Many of the lawsuits challenge emissions rules for coal, oil and natural gas — particularly policies originating under Obama and Biden.

Yet at the heart of the endangerment finding doctrine is climate change and what the U.S. can do to stem the global crisis — also a massive financial risk for the average American, according to top economists and scientists. Though they’re split on the cause, a vast and growing number of Wyomingites — now 86% — acknowledge that climate change is happening and they want something done about it, according to the Wyoming Survey on Climate, Water, and People. 
Despite Wyoming’s long history of natural resource extraction and continued reliance on fossil fuels, along with a U.S. market for those commodities, a full-throttled effort to weaken federal emission rules isn’t likely to be fully embraced in the state, according to Worl.
“We were never against drilling and development,” Worl said. “We wanted it done right. We wanted it to be done as safely as possible.
“It’s very disheartening,” she added, describing what she sees as an onslaught of anti-science policies regarding human health and the environment. “It’s just downright depressing.”
Why go back?
“Wyoming didn’t get cleaner by accident,” John Rutecki told WyoFile, referring to efforts to reduce ozone-causing pollutants in the Upper Green River Basin. “It took years of effort, by the Pinedale community and so many others.”

Rutecki serves as the Environmental Defense Fund’s regulatory and legislative manager for Appalachia and Wyoming. The nonprofit shop of scientists, economists and attorneys dedicated staff and resources to Wyoming way back in the 2000s when Worl and other residents were scrambling for help. EDF, along with Citizens United for Responsible Energy Development, played a major role in convincing a Wyoming community wary of being called “anti-development” and “unAmerican,” to take meaningful action.
First came detailed studies, then the hammer of a “non-attainment” status issued by the EPA, forcing the hand of Wyoming air quality regulators. It all culminated in what is generally considered a success story, though air quality still hangs in the balance. While acrimony remains, industry itself got on board years ago and continues to implement voluntary practices that, in some instances, exceed regulatory minimum standards. In fact, top natural gas producers in the region now market their fossil fuel commodity as “low carbon” natural gas, and they’re finding a niche in the market. 
“I think Wyoming, on its own, has shown that solutions like this — developing fossil fuels and creating strong air protections — are possible,” Rutecki said. “They can coexist. I think we’ve come to a point where we see industry leadership and engagement on all these issues, and so looking to roll back the endangerment finding, you know, puts at risk all of that hard work.”
Wyoming air quality officials are proud of the efforts as well. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality’s 2024 State of the Environment Report, published in June, leads with this highlight: “From 2008-2024, air pollution in the Upper Green River Basin has been reduced by 2,042 tons of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and 7,698 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOC’s). NOx and VOCs are contributors to the formation of ozone.”
“Our agency and industry has worked very hard to bring down all emissions,” DEQ Outreach Manager Keith Guille told WyoFile via email. “For instance, CO2 emissions in Wyoming are back down to 1988 levels.”
Meantime, Gordon’s office warns — as do other federal policy watchers — that the EPA’s effort to rescind the endangerment finding, as well as other efforts to rollback emission rules, are sure to face lengthy legal challenges and perhaps a total policy reversal under a future presidential administration.
“Importantly, many states have zero-carbon mandates or renewable portfolio standards, and it’s unclear if that would change in the event of a rescinding of the endangerment finding,” Pearlman told WyoFile.

In December, residents of Teton County learned they were the wealthiest people in the country. That news instantly intrigued four longtime ""dirtbag"" Jackson Hole residents. What would it be like, they wondered, if they lived and worked in the nation's second-wealthiest place?
The post Beer and clothing in second-place Aspen appeared first on WyoFile .","This commentary was originally published by Writers on the Range.
In December, Teton County, Wyoming, residents learned they were the wealthiest people in the country, making an average of $471,751 a year. That’s almost a half a million dollars a year for “every person living in Teton County in 2023 — regardless of age, health, employment status.”

Opinion

At the county seat in Jackson, town council member and economic consultant Jonathan Schechter made the “wealthiest” calculation in his “cothrive” newsletter. He’d crunched the latest U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates from 3,244 counties, parishes and boroughs nationwide.
Schechter’s analysis made a small group of us — social critics with more than 100 collective years of Jackson Hole living — consider our new status in what Schechter called “the wealthiest county in the wealthiest country in the history of the world.” Our group of aging ski-bum, bicycle-riding gadflies wondered how the other 99.7% of America lived.
We needed to find out. We would start down the social ladder at a community that struggles to flop into second place. It’s Pitkin County, Colorado, site of the town of Aspen, a village about which we had only vague notions.
We would visit by bicycle over six days, observing Aspenites who would, we thought, represent more of the nation’s hoi polloi. Off we pedaled to cross the Income Gulf of America.
As we cycled up Colorado’s Roaring Fork Valley toward Aspen, we ran into the first of the locals. He was a 70-year-old impresario with all the bona fides of a longtime resident — greying braided ponytail, tank top, beater rig and a long resume as a roadie with the Grateful Dead.
He elaborated on his curriculum vitae, which included pre-concert street deals. “Detroit was easy,” he said. “They used to give me $500. That was a lot of money in those days.”
We parried. “We’re from the wealthiest community in the country.” 
“Aspen is the most expensive,” he replied.
Pitkin’s annual per-capita income is $255,839, we riposted, as we headed up-valley. How spendy could this place be, we wondered, if it names a top hotel after a Nabisco cracker?
We were somewhere around Basalt on the edge of Aspen when the prices started to kick up. Numbers on the tap-insert-swipe thingies increased alarmingly. Finally arriving in Aspen, we rattled to a stop at a downtown bar, where beer came in $9 pints.
“Martini?” the menu suggested. Coming from the wealthiest county, we were practiced.
“I’ll take two.” Federal data said we could afford it. “And a burger.”
Twenty-five bucks for a Sapphire gin cocktail. Thirty bucks for a dead-cow patty so tall a mule would have to stretch its lips to take a bite of the towering brioche bun.
Perhaps we missed some of Schechter’s small print. A few billionaires must have skewed our lofty per-capita income figure. In fact, the median annual Teton County income is just $141,500, but still more than anyone in our peloton was making. And second-hand Ralph Lauren button-downs at Jackson’s Browse ’n’ Buy are up to $7.
We read local papers to dig deeper into the customs and culture of our Colorado subject. The papers said the sheriff was taking a trespasser to court who’d lived in a tree for 10 years. A humanitarian nonprofit was running out of money. The Chamber of Commerce was bragging about the coming tourist season.
The ads in glossy local magazines showed a population of the young, tan, fit and wealthy. Aspenites are polyglots, we realized, naming their stores in Italian — Gucci and Prada. In Jackson Hole, we are glad to have Shirt off my Back and Lee’s Tees.
In Aspen, Louis Vuitton, which we deduced was French for “handbag,” offered the Aspen Platform Clog for $1,690. “We’ll take two!” we dreamed.
We went to a liquor store. A sharpie had marked $1,000 on one bottle of wine. We passed that up for a six pack — about what four dirtbags who fell out of the back pages of a 1980s Patagonia catalog could afford.
A ragged sign taped to the counter at the tap-insert-swipe thingie suggested that our communities were much more similar than we thought. We learned the sign had been there a year and a half but was still relevant.
“Jason needs a place to live,” it read.

Tony Evers is implementing pay raises for state employees without additional approval from the Legislature’s Joint Committee for Employment Relations, citing a recent state Supreme Court ruling.
The state budget, which was passed by the Republican-led Legislature and signed by Evers last month, included about $385 million to provide state and University of Wisconsin employees with a 3% pay increase in the first year of the budget and a 2% increase in the second year.
“I fought hard in our bipartisan budget negotiations to secure much deserved pay increases for our talented state workers,” Evers wrote in a letter to state employees on Monday, adding that he was proud to sign the budget last month and it was important to him that state workers receive the wage adjustment as soon as possible.
Eligible employees will receive the 3% base pay adjustment to their current pay rate with their Sept. 4 paychecks, including a lump sum back pay from June 29. The second year of raises is supposed to be implemented June 28, 2026.
“The work that we do together every day on behalf of the people of Wisconsin is so important — perhaps never more so than it is today,” Evers wrote. “With Washington creating continued uncertainty through devastating cuts to investments and programs that so many across our state rely on, Wisconsinites will continue looking to us to lead, support them and build upon the work we’ve done together over the last six years. There is, as always, much hard work ahead of us. Having committed and exceptional partners like you in this good work will make all the difference.” 
The Joint Committee on Employment Relations has been tasked by state law with holding hearings on changes to state employee compensation and approving those changes. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) and Co-chairs of the Joint Committee of Employment Relations have not responded to requests for comment on Evers’ announcement. 
In a bulletin about the raises, the Department of Administration cited the recent Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling in the case Tony Evers v. Howard Marklein, which addressed the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program and the ability of the Joint Finance Committee to hold up already appropriated funds. The Evers administration asserted that the decision clarified its authority to implement the raises without the additional approval of the committee.
The Court ruled 6-1 in July 2024 that the ability for the committee to withhold funds was unconstitutional and a violation of the separation of powers. 
Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote for the majority that a statute that authorizes lawmakers to “exercise core powers of the executive branch violates the constitutional separation of powers and cannot be enforced under any circumstances.” 
“While the constitution gives the legislature the power to appropriate funds, the power to spend the funds the legislature has appropriated for a specific project belongs to the executive branch,” Bradley wrote. “While the legislature has the power to create an agency, define its powers, and appropriate funds to fulfill the purpose for which the legislature established it, the power to spend appropriated funds in accordance with the law enacted by the legislature lies solely within the core power of the executive to ensure the laws are faithfully executed. We conclude these statutes interfere with the executive branch’s core function to carry out the law by permitting a legislative committee, rather than an executive branch agency, to make spending decisions for which the legislature has already appropriated funds and defined the parameters by which those funds may be spent.”
The original lawsuit filed by Evers in October 2023 included the Knowles-Nelson program and two other issues: JOCER’s ability to withhold raises approved in the budget and the Joint Committee for Review of Administrative Rules’s block on administrative rules related to conversion therapy. At the time, JOCER was withholding pay raises approved in the budget for University of Wisconsin employees, so the raises could be used as a bargaining chip in Republican lawmakers’ efforts to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the system. The pay raises, approved in the budget in July, were released by JOCER in December 2023. 
The majority decided in February 2024 that it would only take up the Knowles-Nelson issue and leave the other two “held in abeyance pending further order of the court.” Conservative justices were critical of the majority allowing original action in the case and separating the issues from each other at the time.
Justice Annette Zeigler wrote in her dissenting opinion in the case that taking all of the issues at once could have produced consistency. 
“Selecting an issue that only impacts the Republican-controlled legislature and the longstanding Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program should raise eyebrows,” Zeigler wrote. “Determining all issues at the same time could serve to hold my colleagues to application of the same principles in the same way, even when it comes to a Democratic-controlled branch of government. Unfortunately, we will wait to see if that consistency will be forthcoming, as the majority handpicked and now limits only the legislative branch’s longstanding, statutorily authorized practice.”
The Court dismissed the compensation and Joint Committee on Employment Relations issue in October 2024 when it decided to take up the conversion therapy and Joint Committee for Review of Administrative Rules issue. The Court issued a ruling in July limiting the committee’s ability to block administrative rules.
The University of Wisconsin system will also be implementing the general wage raises. 
“We are grateful to Governor Tony Evers and the Wisconsin State Legislature for their continued support of our workforce and recognition of the vital role our faculty and staff play in education, research, and public service,” UW President Jay Rothman wrote in a memo to employees on Monday. 
The implementation of the raises is not the first time the administration has moved ahead with releasing funds following the ruling. The administration announced funding for 12 Department of Natural Resources projects under the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program in October of 2024.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Reeling from a federal campaign finance investigation, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles landed approval for a legal expense trust fund to pay nearly $120,500 he owes four law firms, documents show.
Ogles, a Maury County Republican who dodged a criminal investigation into his finances, sent a letter to House Committee on Ethics chairs in October 2024 requesting permission to set up the trust fund to pay legal expenses connected to the probe of reporting errors in his Federal Election Commission and financial disclosure reports, according to records obtained by the Lookout.
James Appel of GOP Compliance LLC will serve as trustee of the fund, which cannot take donations from lobbyists or foreign agents, documents show. Appel reported to ethics leaders he’s had no connection to Ogles for two years, which is a requirement to take the job.
“I understand that I will be bound by the Committee’s Legal Expense Fund Regulations, effective May 1, 2024, and that while the Trustee will oversee the Trust, I bear ultimate responsibility for the proper administration of the Trust,” Ogles said in his letter.
A spokesperson for Ogles did not return email questions Thursday.
The committee approved the request in December 2024 for Ogles to pay $75,000 in legal fees, before he incurred $50,000 more in legal expenses this year. Chairs Michael Guest, a Mississippi Republican, and Mark DeSaulnier, a California Democrat, signed the letter notifying him of the requirements for setting up such a trust, including the filing of quarterly reports.
U.S. House ethics board calls for more investigation of Tennessee 5th District congressman

Ogles owes the money for legal representation from October 2024 through June 2025 after an Ethics Committee panel started looking into discrepancies in his campaign finance reporting. It found he likely violated federal campaign finance laws, mainly by reporting an inflated personal loan to make his bid for office look stronger in 2022.
Running in Tennessee’s redrawn 5th Congressional District, which state lawmakers gerrymandered to help Republicans to take over the Democratic stronghold of Nashville, Ogles in 2022 reported receiving a $320,000 personal loan for his campaign. Ogles initially said he raised $450,000 for the race, yet his first FEC report showed he brought in only $250,000.
Ogles amended campaign finance reports in May 2024 and acknowledged making a $20,000 loan to his campaign and saying the additional $300,000 was in a joint account he shared with his wife. Still, he and his campaign manager couldn’t confirm the source of the $20,000.
The ethics board voted 6-0 to call for a closer look at Ogles’ finances because “there is substantial reason to believe that Rep. Ogles omitted or misrepresented required information in his finance disclosure statements or FEC candidate committee reports.”
Despite the congressional investigation, U.S. prosecutors dropped a fraud probe of Ogles after he filed legislation this year to allow President Donald Trump to serve three terms. 
Federal election officials threaten Ogles with campaign finance audit or enforcement – again

Before his problematic financial reporting, Ogles inflated his resume, reports show, including claiming to have a degree from Vanderbilt’s Owen Graduate School of Management when he obtained only a certificate for a weekend seminar. 
In his second term, the former Tennessee director of Americans for Prosperity recently went after Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell for his opposition to a federal sweep of South Nashville for immigrants. Ogles also called for an investigation into Belmont University for allegedly enrolling students without permanent legal documentation of citizenship and disguising its diversity and equity program.
Based on his fundraising this year, Ogles clearly needs financial help to pay his attorneys.
He has a little more than $59,000 in his campaign account, according to FEC reports, a paltry sum for a sitting member of Congress. 
If he can’t bring in any more than that to boost his re-election campaign for 2026, it’s going to be tough to find enough donors to fill up his legal defense trust fund. That is, unless Trump keeps him afloat with some of the $240 million his organizations such as the new super PAC, MAGA Inc., collected to back his agenda, which usually means keeping supporters at his beck and call.
No need to change execution protocol
Gov. Bill Lee won’t look into the execution of Byron Black to determine whether he suffered terribly in the moments before his recent death.
Asked by an Associated Press reporter who witnessed the deadly moment in which Black gasped, moved his head and said it “hurts so bad,” Lee said he sees no need for more review. He explained that the state already went through a “long process” on execution protocol after he suspended the death penalty for two years. The guidelines, which involve the use of pentobarbital to put inmates such as Black to death, were approved by the federal and state Supreme Courts, he said.










While this eliminates one of the possible causes of the reason that Mr. Black lifted his head, groaned, and cried out in pain after the execution began, it leaves many questions unanswered.


– Kelley Henry, attorney for Byron Black


“There’s been an exhaustive review of that process, and that was the process utilized, so I’m not expecting further investigation of that,” Lee said.
Black was on death row for 35 years for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend, Angela Clay, and her two children. His attorneys tried to stop the execution, claiming he was mentally incompetent and arguing that the Supreme Court should review the case to decide whether he should be executed without deactivating an implanted defibrillator,  that could keep him alive even as drugs were administered, violating a constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. 
Black’s attorney, Kelley Henry, sent out a statement afterward saying the initial evaluation of his defibrillator showed it didn’t shock him during the execution.
“While this eliminates one of the possible causes of the reason that Mr. Black lifted his head, groaned, and cried out in pain after the execution began, it leaves many questions unanswered,” Henry said.
An autopsy report could take eight to 12 weeks, and Henry said more information will be sought to figure out what went wrong.
“But make no mistake, we all saw with our own eyes that the pentobarbital did not work like the state’s expert testified that it would,” Henry said. “Mr. Black suffered.”
Complaint could backfire
Tennessee’s Ethics Commission could take action against Memphis area residents after dismissing their sworn complaint against Sen. Brent Taylor for critical remarks he made against participants of a “No Kings” rally there.
Commission members and state ethics director Bill Young raised questions this week about whether the residents tried to “weaponize” the process to go after Taylor, a Shelby County Republican who blasted people who rallied against President Donald Trump’s immigration policies in June, calling them “idiots” and warning the police would arrest them for an illegal protest. Taylor spoke on a Memphis radio station and then posted comments on the X, formerly Twitter, calling the protesters “purple-haired Jihadis.”

— Senator Brent Taylor (@SenBrentTaylor) June 14, 2025
Five people who filed identical complaints against him said he used his official position “to spread false, inflammatory and dangerous misinformation about a peaceful protest event,” endangering constituents and inciting harassment.
Young told the commission it didn’t have jurisdiction to cite Taylor, in part, because he didn’t benefit financially from the criticism. The executive director also told the commission it could hold a hearing to determine whether civil penalties should be levied against the complainants for filing a “frivolous” complaint, potentially leading to a $10,000 civil penalty. 
Commission members agreed it’s “not unethical” for Taylor to state his opinion and that voters should decide whether he remains in office. Ultimately, they decided to defer action until their next meeting when two members who were absent this week could attend.
Taylor’s attorney, Allan Wade, said in a letter to the commissioner the complaints were “merely personal grievances about Brent Taylor’s dislike of complainants and their political views, which is not a proper subject of an ethics complaint under the Ethics Act.”
That could be true, but the ultimate question is whether the Ethics Commission is more concerned with making an example of people who, wrong or right, see it as a last resort for justice or giving politicians the freedom to bad-mouth the public.
Endorsement or not
The day after U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn announced her candidacy for governor, she sent out a list of political luminaries from which she “garners tremendous support” and topped it with a comment from Gov. Lee.
The governor, though, told reporters this week he is not endorsing in the governor’s race, which so far pits Blackburn against U.S. Rep. John Rose of Cookeville.
“I didn’t see what she put out, but I’ve been friends with Marsha for a long time,” Lee told reporters (both are from Williamson County). “She served as my congressman and representative in the General Assembly, so I’m proud that we have really good people running for governor in this state, grateful that the 51st governor will be someone who can continue to move this state forward.”
We love it when Lee takes a strong stand.
In issuing a list of supporters, though, Blackburn seems to be massaging words or, maybe, even pulling a page from Ogles’ political playbook.

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

 Veterans depend on SNAP

Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
 A greater burden on states

In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

Instead of renewing annual TANF contracts with local organizations as has been done since the COVID-19 pandemic, Adams County provided three-month extensions at the start of the current fiscal year in July with a drastically reduced dollar amount for several organizations that rely on TANF funding. 
That’s in part because the county is starting to see the effects of a 2022 Colorado law that requires more funding from TANF to go to direct cash support for residents as opposed to discretionary funding for contracts. The county has also depleted its TANF reserve funds, or savings, to maintain those contracts at previous levels because of the increased need it saw during and after the pandemic.

The federal government approved the TANF program in 1996 but has not changed the dollar amount each state receives annually to administer the program. Colorado has received about $135 million in TANF funding annually, but because of inflation, growing cost of living, and a growing population in the state, that money doesn’t go as far as it did when the program initially passed. 
The state supervises the TANF program, called Colorado Works, while counties administer it to recipients. Funding Adams County previously disbursed for all discretionary TANF contracts totaled just over $4.5 million annually. Adams County is Colorado’s fifth most populous county with 543,000 residents. 
Other Colorado counties have drastically reduced or discontinued contracts and non-discretionary TANF funding in recent years, according to a presentation Adams County human services staff gave to commissioners this week. Boulder County has only one contract, which it will reduce by 80% in the next fiscal year. Larimer stopped all discretionary contracts in the 2023-24 fiscal year. 










You cannot let housing stability programs leave our community when they’re needed more than ever ... People are going to have to decide between food and rent. They’re often going to choose food.


– Delaney Coe, deputy director of Almost Home


Lynn Baca, chair of the Adams County Board of County Commissioners, said that the board is “working to find every available dollar to help families in crisis,” including through funding local nonprofits. But because of the limited funding available and the county’s depleted TANF savings, “we must now make difficult but responsible choices to protect the core benefits required by law — direct cash assistance for food, shelter, and other basic needs.” 
“This isn’t about reducing support; it’s about ensuring we can sustain it for years to come,” Baca said in a statement. “We stepped up during and after the pandemic to make a real difference during a time of uncertainty. Now we must make future-focused decisions to preserve TANF’s core functions and protect our most vulnerable families in a financially sustainable way.”
Longtime employees furloughed
Growing Home, a Westminster nonprofit supporting stability for local families in the north Denver metro area, has seen about 600 families coming through its food pantry each month since the end of emergency allotments from the pandemic for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in 2023. 
The organization’s food pantry as well as its housing stability program will be affected by reduced funding from its Adams County contract, according to Growing Home CEO Veronica Perez. She said her biggest worry is “the cliff” the funding cuts will lead to in terms of service reductions. 
“Because of this shift that they made, it’s now requiring the furloughing of employees that have been with us for 10 years, eight years,” Perez said. “And the issue is that this program itself, it doesn’t only pay staff salaries, it also pays for the incentives for the participants. So it helps pay for that mortgage and that rent.”

The three-month extension Growing Home received from the county was for $110,000, when their annual contract has historically surpassed $1 million. Perez said Growing Home is in a better spot than some other organizations since the TANF funding isn’t their primary or sole funding source, but since it historically accounted for about 25% of the budget, it’s still a big hit. 
Perez said it was difficult to plan ahead because she had no “firm indication of what’s going to happen” after the three-month extension expired, and she’s glad commissioners acknowledged the challenge that created. She also said communication from the county was limited before they were notified of the three-month extension. 
None of the organizations that have TANF contracts with Adams County were aware that the county was dipping into savings to fund their contracts until the commissioners’ discussion Tuesday, Perez said. She said everyone who benefited from pandemic recovery funding knew it was temporary, but the TANF contracts were never communicated as temporary.
“I think we were all blindsided by the fact that they have been pulling our contracts from reserves,” Perez said. “Had I known that, I literally would have done programming for the last few years completely differently had I known we were going to be off-ramping this program.”
‘$1 million is hard to replace’
Delaney Coe, deputy director of Almost Home, a nonprofit based in Brighton that supports people experiencing housing instability, said a TANF contract from Adams County has been one of her organization’s primary funding sources for the last five years. 
Almost Home’s contract has historically been for about $1 million dollars each year, and Coe said its three month extension from the county was for $145,000. She said her organization is at risk of cutting entire programs if it loses the full contract. 
Coe said Almost Home operates the only emergency family shelter in Adams County, and it also uses TANF funding to support eviction prevention programs. Last year, Coe said they helped 155 families through the eviction prevention program and over 100 families each year in their shelter. 
“We’re really looking at asking for our elected leaders to provide some sort of planning for how these critical programs, the safety net, will be able to continue and how we can replace some of that infrastructure, because $1 million is hard to replace with little notice,” Coe said. 
With incoming cuts to other federal welfare programs such as Medicaid and SNAP, Coe said “more people are going to be vulnerable to losing their housing,” so they will need access to resources to support stable living situations.
“You cannot let housing stability programs leave our community when they’re needed more than ever,” Coe said. “People are going to have to decide between food and rent. They’re often going to choose food.”
More evictions
At the Adams County Commissioners’ public hearing Tuesday, over a dozen community members testified asking the commissioners to renew housing assistance contracts with local nonprofits funded by TANF. That included both Perez and Coe, as well as workers and volunteers with both of their organizations and local school district workers expressing similar concerns about how the cuts will affect services that help people stay in their housing. 
“My ask for you today are three things: Number one, find a way to fund rental and mortgage assistance programs across the county. Two, dialogue with people who have lived experience and with social service providers who are strategizing on these topics every day.  And three, move quickly to restore these programs,” said Bev Bishop, a Westminster resident who volunteers with Growing Home.
Commissioner Steve O’Dorisio said during a commissioner study session on the TANF contracts Tuesday that the county needs to be clear as to why it needs to cut down TANF contract funding, as he’s heard many people attribute it to the federal Republican policy bill, H.R. 1, that passed in July, while it is actually the result of state policy and reduced tax revenue for the county. 
“We need to be more clear and accurate that this particular issue is not based on H.R. 1,” O’Dorisio said. “This particular issue is from the Legislature and the governor, who decided to put their thumb on the scale for (direct cash assistance) as opposed to discretionary … This needs to be an example of what happens at the Legislature when you make mandates without understanding the potential consequences of that.”
Other Adams County officials said “the compounding effect” of the 2022 Colorado law, recent cuts to property tax revenue, as well as the overall budget reductions from the federal government have led to less available spending for human services. 
Community leaders want to be involved in the decisions elected officials make about where the limited funding left should go, Coe said, because “we are on the ground and we can tell leaders better what the absolute needs are.” She said she doesn’t envy the decisions county commissioners need to make with “funding being cut in every direction,” but she and other affected organizations want to offer guidance on what must stay.
Perez said she hopes the county will consider using funding from other sources, like its human services reserve funding or general funds, to support their organizations, because without the TANF contract, Growing Home’s entire housing program will cease to exist, and staff furloughs will turn into layoffs, she said. She has meetings scheduled with several commissioners to continue working through the best next steps.
The funding the county contracts provide to Growing Home and other organizations go right back into the community, Perez said, and she expected more “true reciprocation of that respect and partnership that we’ve been giving them for years” as the county makes decisions about its funding. 
“There really just needs to be true dialogue so that we can talk through this and how we can truly be strong partners that are part of their infrastructure in the community, because in all honestly, we are more trusted than the government a lot of the times,” Perez said. “We are a safer place for them.”
Adams County’s human services staff recommended that commissioners extend a TANF contract for domestic violence support services for Family Tree to the end of the fiscal year, which ends June 30, 2026, and extend all other TANF contracts to the end of 2025 at minimal rates to give organizations more time to prepare. 
“We are grateful that the County is continuing the funding for our domestic violence services and understand the financial constraints they are facing,” Family Tree CEO Paolo Diaz said in a statement. “At the same time, we know that reductions in other service areas do not lessen the needs in our community and those needs will continue to grow. We hope the County will continue to assess available resources so that we can collectively meet these challenges and ensure vital services remain accessible for all who need them.”
Cuts to housing support services in Adams County will result in higher eviction rates, Coe said. She said while eviction filings have already gone up, more will go through if people don’t have access to resources like the ones Almost Home offers. That will lead to higher costs for taxpayers, she said, because it costs seven times more to rehouse someone than it does to prevent them from losing their home in the first place.
“It’s not just Almost Home,” Coe said. “We’re hearing from all of our partners that they’ll be impacted by this, so all the doors will be closed for people who just need a little bit of assistance to avoid losing their homes.”

Sign up for Dispatches to get stories in your inbox every week.
Millions of Americans own the rights to oil and gas underground. When they’re approached by an energy company to lease out those rights, they’re offered a cut of the revenue, called a royalty. 
“Royalties saved our place,” said James Horob, a farmer in northwest North Dakota, who used oil royalties to rescue his family’s farm from bankruptcy in 2008 and replace equipment that had been auctioned off. “We’re lucky to have what we got.” 

This is the third story in a series. Read the collection here.

However, the royalty income that mineral owners like Horob get can depend in part on the state where they live. In North Dakota, estimates show that in recent years companies have been deducting hundreds of millions of dollars annually to help cover the costs incurred once oil and gas leave the ground on their way to being sold. North Dakota officials have not stepped in to help royalty owners, even though the state, in its own leases, has explicitly prohibited oil and gas companies from taking deductions from government royalty payments since 1979, as the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica reported this month. 
“It’s tough to think that there isn’t some better solution out there than what we currently have,” said Aaron Weber, a Watford City-based attorney who represents mineral owners in North Dakota. 
In contrast to North Dakota, at least seven oil-and-gas-producing states have taken either legislative or judicial action to restrict the costs that can be deducted from royalty owners’ checks. Here are the key ways North Dakota differs from these other states when it comes to protecting the interests of royalty owners:
 The debate in North Dakota 

North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong has called the oil and gas industry the “No. 1 driver of our economy” in the state. The industry contributed $32 billion in oil and gas taxes to state and local governments between 2008 and 2024, according to the Western Dakota Energy Association, which advocates for energy-producing communities. That same study found that more than 50% of all local tax collections are tied to oil and gas. 
Oil and gas companies owed the state’s private mineral owners, like Horob, an estimated $4.6 billion in 2023 before deductions, according to North Dakota State University research. 
Deductions from that royalty income — which can vary greatly by company and mineral owner — are deeply contentious in the state: Companies say they’re withholding transportation and other expenses that should be shared with royalty owners; the owners say those “postproduction deductions,” as they are generally known, shouldn’t be permitted in most circumstances.
The energy industry says the postproduction deductions, which began surging about a decade ago, reflect changes in the oil business. Oil, discovered in the state in 1951, used to be sold primarily at the well site. Now, oil and gas are often sold farther away, and companies incur costs to process and transport the minerals. The companies say this enables them to fetch a better price, benefiting the royalty owner as well. The industry also attributes an increase in deductions to regulations added in 2014 to reduce natural gas flaring, requiring companies to make new investments.

Owen Anderson previously worked for North Dakota’s regulatory agencies and helped draft language to prohibit companies from taking deductions from royalty payments owed to the state. Anderson, a law professor who studies the energy industry, called the issue “a big, big deal.” 
Armstrong declined to comment. 
 How courts have addressed oil and gas royalties

 Around the country: State supreme courts in Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas and West Virginia have determined oil and gas companies are responsible for the costs that make the commodities “marketable.” That means there are limits on the expenses that companies can pass on to royalty owners after the minerals leave the ground. Those expenses may include removing impurities, gathering the products in central locations, and transporting the oil and gas to where it will be sold.  
Still, the costs that companies can deduct from royalties vary by state, depending on how states define when a product is marketable. 
West Virginia provides royalty owners the most protection from deductions, the result of state Supreme Court of Appeals decisions in 2001 and 2006. In those cases, the court found that companies cannot pass on costs to the owners unless a lease explicitly allows it. This matters because many leases across the country were written before shifts in the industry led to more extensive deductions, so most early leases don’t explicitly mention them. 
“The default is, you cannot take deductions unless they’re specifically agreed to,” said Tom Huber, the leader of West Virginia’s royalty owner association. The 2006 court decision “basically says if there’s ambiguous language, you go on the side of the royalty owner because the company constructed the lease,” he said.

That decision also determined that deductions cannot be taken unless leases specify which costs can be shared and lay out how the deductions will be calculated. Rulings in 2024 and 2025 confirmed the court’s stance.
Courts in Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma also have placed limits on what costs can be deducted from royalty payments. Those courts have determined that companies must make the oil and gas “marketable” before costs can be deducted from royalties. Each state uses different criteria to determine at what point in the process the commodities become marketable. 
Courts in other oil-and-gas-producing states have taken a legal approach that is more friendly to the industry. Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and others have determined that companies can deduct costs incurred between the minerals’ extraction and when they are sold unless there is lease language to the contrary.
That is also true in Pennsylvania. But in 2015, the state’s attorney general cracked down on a company, Chesapeake Energy, alleged to be taking artificially excessive deductions. The attorney general’s lawsuit, prompted by complaints from landowners, was resolved with a $5.3 million settlement for royalty owners and an option to receive royalties moving forward without deductions. The company did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement.
In North Dakota: As is the case in Texas, Louisiana and some other states, the North Dakota Supreme Court has sided with companies. In 2009 and 2021, the court ruled that royalties, in most cases, should be based on the value of the oil and gas when the minerals are extracted from the ground. Costs incurred between when the minerals are extracted and when they are sold can be shared proportionately between the oil company and the royalty owner, the court found. Companies can deduct these costs unless a lease clearly specifies otherwise. 
Josh Swanson, a Fargo-based oil and gas attorney who is involved in multiple pending lawsuits contesting deductions, said he’s concerned companies will impose even more “excessive” deductions unless courts place limits on what the companies can do. 
“Operators are going to continue to be very aggressive in the amounts they’re taking for postproduction costs until a court tells them they’ve overstepped and gone over the line,” he said. 
In responses to questions from the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica, officials from three energy companies that operate in North Dakota said they follow the language in the leases when determining what costs they can deduct from royalty payments. Older leases often don’t mention deductions, however.
 How lawmakers have addressed oil and gas royalties

Around the country: Some state legislatures have passed laws that limit postproduction deductions. Laws in Wyoming and Nevada, passed in 1989 and 1991, respectively, prohibit companies from taking deductions for specific expenses incurred soon after extraction, such as gathering the commodities from well sites to get them to central hubs.  
In Michigan, a law passed in 1999 allows companies to deduct from royalty income only two types of expenses — transportation and some gas treatment costs — unless a lease explicitly allows for other reasons.
They can’t get answers from the oil industry. North Dakota’s oversight program hasn’t helped.

The West Virginia Legislature, meanwhile, has helped royalty owners with what it called “oppressive” leases. Many West Virginia mineral owners receive royalties from “flat rate” leases signed as long as a century ago that provide owners a few hundred dollars a year instead of a percentage of the revenue. Calling those leases “unjust,” West Virginia lawmakers passed a measure in 1982 that guarantees owners at least 12.5% of the revenue, effectively overriding the original leases. A 2018 amendment requires that postproduction deductions not be taken from this royalty. 
West Virginia’s law ensuring a minimum royalty for those leases is enforced by state regulators, who will grant new drilling permits only if the company files an affidavit promising to adhere to the law.
Huber said his state’s legislative and judicial branches have historically tried to protect landowner and royalty owner rights while encouraging the growing natural gas industry. 
“It sounds like North Dakota doesn’t have that, and that’s a shame,” Huber said. “I hope that the people in North Dakota wake up and realize how much money should be in their pockets instead of industry’s pockets.”
In North Dakota: Legislators and state officials have argued that disputes should be settled in the courts. They rejected a measure in 2021 that would have prevented companies from taking deductions unless explicitly allowed in a lease, and another bill in 2023 that would have required oil companies to provide mineral owners with more information about how royalties are calculated. 
State Sen. Dale Patten, a Republican from Watford City, said the Legislature is ill suited to address concerns related to private contracts and royalty owners should seek relief from the courts. Legal action would be prohibitively expensive for most families, however.

“We’re getting into really complicated issues. And actually in my mind the proper venue to solve that would be in the courts,” said Patten, who has served as chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “And you deal with it on a company-by-company basis.”
Public officials have argued that royalty owners should have negotiated language into their leases to prohibit deductions. But leases in many cases were signed decades ago, before this was an issue, and don’t mention who should pay for postproduction costs. The leases don’t expire unless production stops. And in new lease negotiations, mineral owners are at a disadvantage against companies unless they own a large percentage of the mineral rights in the area. 
“It’s really difficult for a private landowner to negotiate a no-deductions lease in North Dakota,” Anderson said. 
Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, which represents the oil industry, warned that regulating or limiting the expenses that companies pass on to owners would discourage oil and gas investment in the state and drive business away. 
“It’s one of the most foolish things the state of North Dakota could ever do, is to try and essentially financially punish operators from getting a better price for their commodities by not allowing postproduction costs on some of those things,” Ness said in an interview. 
But Weber, the attorney who represents mineral owners, said it’s time for the Legislature to get involved and address the concerns. 
“Given that the court has already selected what it is going to do,” he said, “the only way to fix it is to get it to the Legislature.”

(Getty Images)Tax credits that have made health insurance affordable for millions of Americans are set to expire at the end of the year, and West Virginia will feel the effects more than most states, a health policy expert said.  
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that President Donald Trump signed into law last month did not extend the Biden-era enhanced premium tax credits for people who buy their health coverage on the Health Insurance Marketplace though the Affordable Care Act. Unless Congress acts to change that, the 67,000 West Virginians who buy health care on the marketplace will pay more beginning in 2026. 
“We anticipate that everyone on the marketplace will see a spike in the price of their coverage,” said Rhonda Rogombe, health and safety net policy analyst for the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. 
The Center on Budget and Policy said that West Virginians who buy insurance through the marketplace will see their premiums increase by an average of 133% or $1,400 annually. About 15,000 West Virginians will lose health care altogether because they cannot afford it any more, according to the CBP. 
The expanded tax credits, which are income based, were part of the American Rescue Act of 2021 and extended through 2025 in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. 
The average full monthly premium for coverage on the marketplace is $1,170 per person in West Virginia, nearly double the national average of $619 monthly per person, said Louise Norris, a health policy analyst for healthinsurance.org. 
“West Virginia is likely to be the hardest hit in the whole country, just because premiums are higher in West Virginia,” Norris said. “…Before you apply any subsidies, West Virginia has the highest in the country.”
Households that earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level — $128,600 per year for a family of four — will lose their health care subsidies altogether. In West Virginia, nearly 10% of families who buy their health care on the marketplace fall into that category, Norris said. 
“They could be facing very unaffordable, full-price premiums next year, which is particularly challenging in a state like West Virginia, where the premiums are so high,” she said. 
Those who make less than $128,600 for a family of four will still get a subsidy, but it won’t be as big, Norris said. 
According to estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the tax credits expiring will lead to 4.2 million people losing their health insurance coverage by 2034. 
Norris and Rogombe noted that Congress could still act to extend the subsidies before the end of the year. 
Congress is expected to return to session in September after a break this month. Open enrollment for the Health Insurance Marketplace plans starts Nov. 1. 
Some Republican Congress members, including Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Arkansas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, have said they’d support extending the tax credits. 
All of West Virginia’s four-member Republican congressional delegation voted in support of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. None of them responded to West Virginia Watch’s question about whether they would support extending the tax credits. 
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., told Politico last month that “[addressing the tax credits] is “coming, but in senatorial times, we have time to deal with this.” 
Kanawha County resident Ellen Allen is the director of West Virginians for Affordable Health Care. As a customer of the Health Insurance Marketplace, Allen would personally feel the effects of the tax credits expiring.
This year, Allen pays about $500 per month for her coverage and a federal government subsidy pays for the rest of the premium — about $1,400, she said. 
Allen expects her subsidy to be completely eliminated beginning next year. While the exact premiums for next year haven’t been announced, she expects to pay $2,700 per month for health coverage. 
At 64, Allen has one more year until she’ll be eligible for a health insurance plan through Medicare. Allen said she’ll put money away to pay for coverage before she’s eligible for Medicare, but she’s aware that others may not be able to. 
“Mine is as high because, one, I’m so old and the household income is a lot higher than the median,” Allen said. “But even on the median, what you’re going to see go up is their out of pocket, which makes insurance hard for people to use. There’s a lot of studies out there that show when costs go up, utilization of insurance goes down.”
Mariah Plante, community engagement, outreach and story collection coordinator for West Virginians for Affordable Health Care, expects her subsidy to decrease from $611 per month to $474, leaving her with around $150 to $200 per month to pay. Added to her health care expenses is a $150 per month medication that insurance will not cover. 
“So at the end of the day, all told, just for the privilege of having insurance and taking one medication every month, I’m going to be paying $350 that’s before I pay a copay for a doctor’s appointment or see a dentist or get my month, my yearly pap smear, or anything like that,” she said. That’s just to exist and be insured.”
Plante said the cuts to Medicaid and to the Affordable Care Act in the big beautiful bill are confusing. It’s difficult for people to understand how they’ll affect everyone, she said. 
“Even people who are getting the enhanced premium tax credit may not know that they’re getting it, or may not understand just how much it is contributing to their health care,” Plante said. “And they’re not going to understand it until they see those costs go up in real time. I think that it’s likely a purposeful thing.
“It’s so complicated to understand and explain, because that makes it harder to educate folks and combat against,” she said. 
Besides the changes that may come to provisions of the Affordable Care Act, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by $186 billion and cut Medicaid spending by $326 billion over 10 years.
Altogether, the changes in the bill will mean West Virginia will lose about $1 billion in federal funding every year, and work reporting requirements for Medicaid are likely to cause between 50,000 and 110,000 West Virginians to lose their health care, Rogombe said. 
“These provisions won’t go into effect for at least a year, and so we won’t see the impacts of this until, really, by 2027 is when we’ll start to see the impact,” she said.

(Stock photo by FG Trade via Getty Images)A California-based company offering online classes is now eligible to receive West Virginia’s school voucher program, the Hope Scholarship.
The state Treasurer’s Office, which oversees the program, approved Outschool to provide online classes to students receiving the Hope Scholarship. Outschool offers small class sizes for first through 12th grade students in English, math, social studies and more. Courses in music, coding and world languages are available as electives.
“This is a big deal for our Individualized Instructional Plan students, especially as we see a record number of students from the homeschool community coming into the program and we prepare to welcome thousands more once the program goes truly universal for the 2025-2026 school year,” State Treasurer Larry Pack said in a news release Wednesday. 
West Virginia’s Hope Scholarship is one of the nation’s broadest school voucher programs, allowing parents to use the funds for homeschooling materials or to pay for private schools and microschools in- and out-of-state. Most families in West Virginia use the Hope Scholarship to help pay for tuition at private religious schools in the state.
Right now, program eligibility includes students entering kindergarten or who are already enrolled in the public school system. Around 19,000 students are expected to use the program this year. Next school year, eligibility opens up to all West Virginia students. 
The scholarship amount is expected to be around $5,200 for the 2025-2026 school year.
Outschool’s recommended pricing plan is $70 a month, which pays for an average of two group classes per week. 
According to the Treasurer’s Office, eligible families can use their Hope Scholarship funds to purchase Learning Passports, which are Outschool credit bundles, through the Hope Scholarship online portal. 
“I am proud my office is partnering with Outschool so Hope Scholarship funds can easily be utilized to access high-quality educational experiences that support a child’s individualized goals. It is crucial we continue to empower students and parents to find the right education that fits their unique needs,” Pack said. 
The board overseeing the Hope Scholarship recently voted to allow families to purchase lunchboxes with the Hope Scholarship, but clarified that the money can’t be used to purchase tadpoles for science education, MetroNews reported.
The state’s overall price tag for the Hope Scholarship is around $100 million for the coming year, and it was the largest funding increase requested by Gov. Patrick Morrisey in his first budget proposal. The price is expected to grow to $300 million by 2027 as the Hope Scholarship opens up to all students. 
While the GOP-led Legislature has been generally supportive of education choice and the Hope Scholarship, some members have voiced concerns about the program’s rapidly increasing price tag while public schools are dealing with funding woes. The state’s public employee’s insurance program, which insures teachers, is also struggling financially.
Earlier this year, Democratic lawmakers in the House proposed a bill banning the use of Hope Scholarship funds at out-of-state schools, but the measure wasn’t taken up for consideration.

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Geological Survey)Since May 14, 2025, Yellowstone Volcano Observatory scientists have remotely monitored activity in Biscuit Basin using a webcam installed next to Black Diamond Pool.
Biscuit Basin remains closed to the public after a dramatic hydrothermal explosion on July 23, 2024, sent mud, rocks and water at least 400 feet into the air. While this event was the largest known to occur at Biscuit Basin, Black Diamond Pool has a long history of eruptions and probably even formed due to a hydrothermal explosion sometime between 1902 and 1912.
A new view of Yellowstone National Park’s Biscuit Basin (literally!)

Yellowstone Volcano Observatory scientists suspected that explosive eruptions continued at Black Diamond after July 23, 2024. New sediment and rock debris appeared regularly over the months that followed the initial explosion. Monitoring equipment also indicated that something was going on, but only two eruptions were witnessed by people (on Nov. 5, 2025, and Jan. 3, 2025).
The events toppled small seismometers, buried temperature sensors in mud, and in one case washed a temperature sensor down into the Firehole River. Based on the temperature record from several sensors, at least eight events occurred between January and April 2025, but scientists could not determine the size or duration of eruptions from available data.
Due to their mysterious nature, scientists started to call the events “Sasquatch” eruptions, referencing a creature from North American folklore (also called Bigfoot).
The webcam was installed in hopes of finally catching an event on video. The camera sends images to a public website every 15 minutes and records video on site that can be downloaded later if warranted.
At first light on May 21, images from the camera indicated loose sediment chunks on the pool and an increase in turbidity from the previous night — possibly the aftermath of an overnight eruption. Then, on the evening of May 31, several people, including citizen scientist Craig Munson Jr., observed newly displaced rocks and wet ground in the 8:45 p.m. webcam image that had not been present in the 8:30 p.m. image.
Yellowstone Volcano Observatory scientists remotely downloaded video footage from the webcam, which revealed a four-second-long eruption of water, steam and sediment to 20–30 feet high at 8:39 p.m.

https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Biscuit_video.mp4
At last, a Sasquatch sighting! One of the temperature sensors previously installed in a runoff channel of Black Diamond Pool also recorded a strong signal from the event. Temperature increased from approximately 125.2 °F to 146.5 °F and back down to 125.4 °F  over the span of about four minutes. The temperature then dropped before returning to normal over the course of an hour as the pool recovered from the eruption.
The May 31 event was not the only eruption captured by the new camera. Similar eruptions occurred on June 12, July 3 and July 14, 2025. Combined with temperature and infrasound sensor records, webcam footage provides an additional source of data to further constrain the size and duration of eruptions.
  This is a graphic of water temperature in a runoff channel of Black Diamond Pool in Biscuit Basin, Yellowstone National Park, measured on May 31, 2025. The spike and subsequent drop over the span of about four minutes, followed by the low temperature recorded over about the following hour, is due to a small eruption that occurred from the pool at 8:39 p.m. that day.

Hydrothermal explosions or eruptions, like the “Sasquatch” events observed at Black Diamond Pool, are caused by pressure changes resulting from the transition of liquid water to steam. These explosions are not triggered directly by magma or magmatic gases interacting with shallow groundwater; rather, when water boils in a confined space, expanding steam bubbles build enough pressure to eventually overcome the strength of sealed rock, causing an explosion.
The July 23, 2024, explosion at Black Diamond Pool clearly changed the shallow hot water and steam plumbing system of the feature, so that now it seems to favor small eruptions every few days to weeks.
Hazards associated with hydrothermal events cannot be understated. The July 2024 event at Biscuit Basin expelled boulders large enough to smash through boardwalks as visitors ran for safety. Fortunately, no one was injured, but the damage to boardwalks and ongoing “Sasquatch” eruptions mean that the basin remains closed for safety.
But data from the camera and other monitoring instruments — including a seismic/infrasound/GPS/weather station that was installed in late July — should help scientists to better understand what is happening within and beneath Black Diamond Pool. This information is critical for park management decisions about public safety.
You can be the next citizen scientist who reports a rare “Sasquatch” sighting! Watch out for the next eruption on the Biscuit Basin webcam and alert a Yellowstone Volcano Observatory team member at yvowebteam@usgs.gov if you see anything suspicious.

The city of about 8,000 residents also pledged $2.4 million for area public road and infrastructure improvements that City Administrator Phil Green said not only will benefit apartment access but also should ignite surrounding commercial growth that bumps up property and sales tax revenues.
“We’re hoping that this Blair Crossing development becomes the kickstarter to see even more development in that area,” said Green. “Invest a little now, so you get a bigger payoff down the road.”
 Housing crunch

It’s part of a strategy to increase housing options in a town whose job base has expanded but where further growth is threatened by limited and aging housing availability. Blair is among communities across Nebraska exploring ways to address housing affordability and supply, a challenge that a statewide report said had reached crisis proportions.
Mike Rooks, executive director of Gateway Development Corp., which is the economic development arm of Washington County, said Blair businesses have struggled to recruit workers amid a housing crunch.

He believes the shortage also has discouraged some companies from opening or relocating there.
“The CEO will look at me and say, ‘Where are my employees going to live?’” said Rooks. “So this is another tool in our toolbox that we can show.”
Currently, Rooks said, about 3,500 Omahans drive to Blair to work, and about 2,000 Blair residents drive to Omaha to work.
At Blair’s expanding bioscience campus, more than 60% of employees commute there to work, officials said. The campus includes companies such as Cargill, Corbion, Novonesis (formerly Novozymes), NatureWorks and Evonic.
Meanwhile, over the past four years, Blair has seen more than $500 million in capital investment, Rooks said. That includes a Dollar General distribution center officials say employs nearly 700 people. Just last month, a new $100 million Calcium Products project was announced.
Calcium Products, an agricultural technology company specializing in pelletized high-calcium lime and gypsum, bought 113 acres in Blair South Industrial Park to construct two new production facilities. The project is to create about 50 new full-time jobs when scheduled to open next year and also will spur a new rail yard that’s expected to lure additional industrial-focused business.
Rooks expects the Blair Crossing Apartments to be “gobbled up” when they are scheduled to open in 2026. He and Green said Blair hasn’t had a newly built major apartment building since around 2000.

Metonic developers said that about 67% of the Blair housing stock was built prior to 1990, so Blair Crossing will offer a contemporary living option.
The residences should be attractive to Omaha workers as well, Rooks said, offering a modern small-town living option a short drive from the amenities of a bigger city.
He said a 2021 study of Blair and five smaller Washington County municipalities foresaw a demand for more than 500 new housing units by this year. They haven’t “even scratched the surface,” said Rooks.
 ‘Almost unheard of…’

The four-building, three-level Blair Crossing complex is rising on roughly six acres at the convergence of U.S. 30 and Nebraska Highway 133. Dwellings will range in size from studio apartments to three-bedroom units, with rents likely to run from $1,200 to $2,000.
Metonic President Kassie Inness said in a statement that she felt strong local support for the project and has not seen anyone stand up in opposition. “That is almost unheard of in multifamily development,” Inness said.
Metonic partners include general contractor Ronco Construction, Ruff Grading, trb architecture, Lamp Rynearson, Veridian Credit Union.
Rooks said Blair public officials have come to believe that the city “has to step up” with public incentives in order for real estate developers to invest there. A housing advisory committee appointed by Blair Mayor Mindy Rump has recommended various approaches to help bring housing of different styles and prices to the area. 
The $300,000 in “LB 840” funds for Blair Crossing was possible via Nebraska’s Local Option Municipal Economic Development Act. That law allows cities, given local voter approval, to use local tax revenue for economic development, including housing initiatives.

In Blair’s case, voters first gave the green light in 2006 to use a portion of the local sales tax for an LB 840 program, and last year reauthorized a program for 12 more years. 
Green said the city also agreed to cover $2.4 million of a $3.2 million cost, with the rest paid by developer Metonic, to improve access and highway connections around the apartment complex.
He said the project site and surrounding land had remained undeveloped largely because of costly changes needed to link the area to major roadways.
“It was a project that wouldn’t happen if the city hadn’t contributed something,” Green said.
 ‘Show incentives’ 

Green said a recommendation from the city’s housing advisory panel encouraged use of incentives to help make land more alluring for development.

Tax-increment financing is an economic development tool authorized decades ago by the Nebraska Legislature, though it has become increasingly controversial. City Councils, following a public hearing process, must give thumbs up or down for each TIF project.
Critics, including some lawmakers, say TIF in some cases has been used too generously and perhaps on projects that a developer might have undertaken without the incentive. Part of the concern is that the new property tax collected on the improved portion of a project site is redirected, for up to 20 years, to help pay off development expenses rather than being sent to traditional recipients such as schools and local governments.
After that TIF period of 15 to 20 years, all property tax at the site flows to the traditional recipients.
Rooks said public incentives have become increasingly important for smaller Nebraska communities like Blair. 
“We have to show incentives and we have to show them why they need to come here,” he said.

There is a whole disconnect of realism here.” — Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (July 22, 2023)
It was once the case that politicians wanted to talk about the environment — but do nothing about our climate challenges. Now, per Capito’s comments, one political party (the GOP) has decided to ignore the issue. While the other (the Democrats) has downgraded it due to lack of enthusiasm by their base.
There are numerous polls out regarding issues that Americans are most concerned about. In the last presidential election, the economy (inflation) and immigration were the big problems concerning most of us. Former Vice President Kamala Harris said she would do nothing different than President Joe Biden — big (and very obvious) mistake! 
In large part due to this unforced error, she lost to President Donald Trump, a weak candidate who cons his brainwashed followers. He has successfully promoted a change in our national priorities, based on his embrace of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 — which he is closely following as a blueprint to remake our nation.
Gallup polling breaks down current issues into economic and non-economic issues. A third of Americans still believe that the economy is the most pressing problem facing us — specifically, inflation and the deficit. But a fourth of us believe that poor governmental leadership is the biggest issue, while immigration is still a top priority for 20% of respondents. Less than 1% indicate that they view the environment/pollution/climate change as the most important issue, down from 2% in December under Biden.
A recent Morning Consult poll explored this specific aspect in detail, concluding that, “Concern about climate change has dipped across the partisan aisle.” In other words, Americans are ignoring the fact that humanity’s use of fossil fuels (coal, oil) is causing climate change, temperature rising and the many environmental disasters that we have seen in the last few years.

Per the chart above, a little over a third of U.S. respondents (37%) are currently “very concerned” about climate change. That is a drop of 7% from when Biden took office in 2021. About two-thirds indicated that they are “somewhat concerned,” down from 76% in 2021.
Even more concerning is that it continues to be a politically partisan, versus a scientific, issue. Among Democrats, 58% are very concerned about climate change. However, only a meager 18% of GOP respondents felt that way. Nothing will be done in Washington until GOP voters are “woke” to the pollution issue.
Here are the facts. We are experiencing more pollution every year, creating rising temperatures and more severe weather events. Hurricanes and horrendous storms are hitting our towns… even those far inland, like Ashville, North Carolina. Flooding of coastal communities, caused by rising sea levels, is becoming commonplace. Wildfires are becoming much more common, as shown by the recent California wildfires. Droughts are draining our water supplies. 
Pollution is causing an increase in Americans suffering from asthma and other lung diseases. Lower income communities are especially prone to these maladies.
And then there is the economic cost. For example, insurance on coastal properties has gone sky high. Federal and state budgets are strained by the financial cost of responding to disasters. Throwing paper towels, as Trump did to residents of Puerto Rico, may be good political theater. But it does not help those affected.
We are in a crisis. But until the American public wakes up, there is little that will be done. If Capito and her ilk can simply brush off the environmental crisis facing our nation (in her words — “let the free market ride”), things are bound to get worse.
As a former Republican elected official, I can tell you that politicians like Capito respond to their constituents. As is true with the national debt, the polluting of our air, seas and land will continue until voters decide it is a priority that must be addressed. Until then, politicians will downplay environmental issues, ignoring obvious solutions like solar power and windmills. Our children will pay the price for our neglect.

A federal rule to limit coal miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust — which was set to go into effect next week after already being delayed for months — is expected to be further postponed following a joint status update filed in federal court this week.
Now, the rule’s implementation will be pushed until at least October, according to the court filing.
Silica dust exposure is a significant driver of black lung disease among coal miners.
The silica dust rule was initially finalized last spring and was meant to go into effect for coal mines in April 2025. But that didn’t happen.
That month, several industry groups filed a request with the federal 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to block the rule’s implementation, citing the high costs for mine operators to comply and challenges posed by turnover within the Trump administration.
A federal judge granted an emergency stay to postpone the rule until August.
According to the joint status report filed this week, the parties in the case — led by the National Sand, Stone and Gravel Association against the federal Department of Labor and the Mine Safety and Health Administration — “are still discussing potential settlement of the petitions, and those discussions are ongoing.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The implementation will be suspended until at least Oct. 17, with another status update scheduled on Oct. 10. MSHA, according to its website, has yet to publicly alert stakeholders of this second postponement. Representatives for MSHA could not be reached for comment.
The finalized rule would be the first of its kind for silica dust in mines, despite evidence existing for decades showing the dangers of exposure and other industries already enforcing exposure limits due to these risks.
It would cut silica dust exposure limits in half for miners and implement new action levels when a certain amount of silica dust is present in mines. It would also require mine operators and companies to offer free medical monitoring for their workers with the hope of detecting black lung and other respiratory diseases earlier.
 ‘The wind is out of my sails:’ Advocates frustrated, discouraged over pushback on rule

The further delay of the rule is a serious concern for advocates and others who work with people diagnosed with black lung.
Lisa Emery, director of the New River Health Breathing Center and Black Lung Clinic, has worked on black lung as a registered respiratory therapist in Southern West Virginia for nearly 10 years. This summer, Emery was selected to serve as the chair for the National Coalition of Black Lung and Respiratory Disease Clinics.
When the silica dust rule was first finalized last year, Emery said it felt like “finishing a marathon.” So much work and time had gone into developing the rule — from miners, from care providers, from researchers and more over several years. Seeing it finalized and actually about to go into effect was a relief, Emery said.
“We were crossing that finish line. We had so much hope and this was one of the biggest steps toward improving coal miners’ health that we could have hoped for,” Emery said. “It needed to happen and it did. We were just so excited for it.”
But now, as the government continues to delay implementation and the courts consider reviewing the rule, Emery said it’s hard not to feel discouraged.

“Now, I feel like the wind is out of my sails,” Emery said. “We were crossing a finish line, we were about to win the race, right? And in that last stretch, the wind is just totally out of our sails. It’s hard not to be upset about that.”
Gary Hairston, president of the National Black Lung Association, said the disappointments from elected officials and the government generally are becoming more difficult to bear.
A miner for 30 years, Hairston was diagnosed with black lung in his late 40s.
He kept working underground even after the spot on his lung was found by doctors. One day, running up the stairs to avoid rain at his mine, he ran out of breath so severely he thought he was going to die. Soon after, he fell ill with pneumonia.
“For almost a year, I was in and out of the hospital every week, back and forth,” Hairston said. “When I got better, everything had changed. I tried to go back to work, but the [doctor] told me I wouldn’t get better — I’d need oxygen all the time, it was going to only get worse.”
There is no cure for black lung disease. The best way to prevent it from developing into a more complicated form is to limit exposure to silica dust.
Hairston has now been retired from coal mines for almost two decades. Over that time, he’s transitioned from working for mine operators to working for coal miners, advocating wherever and whenever possible for better protections and services for people with and at risk of developing black lung.
Hairston said he used to have faith that the political system — or at least representatives within it — wanted to help coal miners like him.
Now, though, that faith is becoming harder and harder to keep, Hairston said.
“The [people] at the agency meant to protect us [MSHA] are the same ones who [historically] served coal companies,” Hairston said. “How do you trust that, have faith in that? How can you think that’s someone who wants us safe and healthy?”
James McHugh, the deputy assistant secretary for MSHA, was formerly an attorney with the Charleston-based Pence Law Firm PLLC, where coal companies were often clients, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail. 
He also served as an executive at an industrial trade group that filed formal comments against the silica dust rule, namely its strengthened exposure limits and new penalty provisions for mine operators that fail to comply, while MSHA was drafting it in 2023.
Last month, seven of the 21 Republican members of the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce sent a letter to McHugh at MSHA asking him to consider amending the silica dust rule as it “places undue and excessive burdens on the mining industry.”
They said doing so would be appropriate given the Trump Administration’s focus on industry deregulation and — while noting nothing about the health risks and outcomes of black lung disease — said the rule “excludes commonsense practices” like rotating shifts in dustier parts of mines and enforcing the use of respirators in areas with high dust.
Emery said such protections aren’t exactly practical; something shared numerous times by leading respiratory experts in public comments given to MSHA during the creation of the silica dust rule.
Rotating shifts, for example, would mean exposing even more miners to silica dust over time. Those who work in other parts of the mine without dust would have to then be in dustier parts, increasing their exposure, and workers would need to be trained on numerous jobs instead of focusing on the ones they are best equipped to do.
And for respirators to work adequately, miners would have to get a proper fit test to ensure their efficacy. Anyone with a beard would not have an adequate fit and someone would need to be responsible for enforcing their use — which could potentially interfere with communication critical to protecting safety and performing jobs while workers are underground in a loud environment.
Emery also said she’s assessed miners with black lung who have used respirators while underground.
“Their scans still came up positive,” Emery said.
For Hairston, the lack of urgency expressed not only by MSHA but also elected officials who he feels should prioritize miners’ safety is disconcerting. Miners, he said, are the only ones who make coal mining and the economic and energy benefits that politicians say come with it possible.
“None of these things they want to happen work without miners and they just use us and use us as props,” Hairston said. “They say they want more coal, want more workers, want more mines — they promise it [in] their campaigns. Well, who are those workers going to be? We only hear them talk about us when the elections come around. They don’t care about the coal miners, only the coal mines. When does that end?”

Protecting the next generation and learning from the toll put on the past
Today, Hairston is facing a difficult decision: whether to commit to using an oxygen tank full time in order to maintain his breathing.
He currently uses oxygen while sleeping. Sometimes throughout the day, especially if doing laborious activities, he’ll use it as needed.
“It’s hard for me to think about being tied to that thing all the time; It’ll completely change my life again,” Hairston said. “I’m still very active — as much as I can be. That’s a big change to how I can move and what I can do if I’ve got to pull around a tank with me everywhere I go.”
It’s a balancing act, Hairston said, to decide when he’s hit his limit. He knows he’s living with a lifelong condition and 24/7 oxygen will be inevitable one day. He’s just not ready to accept that today is that day.
He wants to see younger miners — those just entering the industry or who will in coming years — not be faced with the same inevitability.
But the more time that goes by without regulation on exposure to silica dust means more miners will develop the disease early, Emery said.
More than 40% of the black lung screenings done at her clinic last year came up positive for the disease.
“If you think about the numbers that we’re seeing right now, we haven’t peaked,” Emery said. “Even if [the silica dust rule] gets implemented tomorrow, there’s still going to have to be massive changes.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of coal miners in Central Appalachia are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
Emery sees firsthand what a diagnosis can do to people. In the worst cases, it means lives are cut short. In cases caught earlier, the diagnosis still can mean lifestyle changes and adjustments that can be hard for many to accept.
In her office in Oak Hill, West Virginia, she said a regular part of her job is delivering this kind of bad news. She sits and consoles miners — and their families — who are struggling to come to terms with having the disease.
Through tears, she said it never quite gets easier hearing people talk about the parts of their lives that are being robbed from them by black lung and the complications that come with it.
In recent years, these conversations have become more frequent with younger miners. It’s not just grandparents struggling to keep up with young grandchildren anymore; it’s fathers in their 40s and 50s unable to play with their own children, keep up on family vacations or participate in activities their healthy peers enjoy — playing sports, yardwork, home projects.
Miners across Appalachia are being diagnosed with black lung at younger ages than their predecessors due to a lack of easily accessible coal. Now, they must dig through more silica-rich sandstone to reach the coal that remains.
“This is not just your grandfather’s disease anymore,” Emery said. “It’s your husband’s disease, it’s your brother’s disease, it’s your son’s disease right now, and it’s affecting all of them.”

As time goes on, the consequences of this will grow.
That’s what is so critical about the silica dust rule, Emery said. It’s already too late to protect many of the miners who are working underground now, but the future generations and those recently entering the industry could be saved from developing black lung.
“When the rule is in effect, it will take a while but we will start to see the trail off of disease,” Emery said. “But it is going to take a while to start seeing true change from a newer generation of coal miners coming in. That’s the immediacy here.”
Knowing there is something that could be done to stop this disease from impacting younger generations in the same way as their predecessors is frustrating, Emery said.
At 48 years old — the same age Hairston was when he was first diagnosed with black lung disease — she foresees many more years in the respiratory health field. Already, she’s seen so many changes occur; miners are more likely to get screened now than in the past, stigma is slowly dissipating over receiving such screenings and, when they do come back positive, there’s more of a willingness for miners to practice their Part 90 rights to transfer to a different, less dusty part of a mine to protect themselves.
But still, she sees so much more that could be done if the willingness to do so existed.
She hopes that, when the time comes for her to retire, she’s treating people in a different environment. One where there’s widespread acceptance and recognition of the importance of preventing black lung and what the costs are if it isn’t stopped.
“I’m hoping by the time I retire, that I’m not giving as much bad news in my line of work, that’s what I wish for,” Emery said. “I love the work I do, I know I’m helping this community and I want to do that as long as I can — I will do that. I want to see us trend in the right direction instead of the wrong direction. We know it’s possible.”

Hartlep, who says higher education should not be rationed to the wealthy. (Getty Images)While the nation was distracted by headlines about celebrity trials and summer storms, a seismic shift occurred in American education policy: The U.S. Department of Education was effectively gutted by President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
Billed as a move to return power to the states, this legislation dismantles the infrastructure of federal student aid, guts Pell Grants, halts income-driven repayment programs and eliminates Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The Pell Grants program is a lifeline for low-income students that covers up to roughly $7,400 annually, but still leaves significant unmet need.
The implications of these changes are catastrophic — and not just for students. This law represents a total abandonment of education as a public good, and the consequences will be felt in every community, including right here in Kentucky, where the median household income is just $58,000 and more than 40% of college students depend on federal aid. 
As someone who has spent years researching and writing about student loan debt, I know how fragile our current system already is: Tuition costs continue to outpace inflation, repayment programs are cumbersome and inconsistent, and federal aid has never kept pace with the true cost of attending college. But the new law doesn’t fix what’s broken — it breaks what was barely holding together, by closing pathways to professional advancement for future lawyers, teachers, doctors and scientists.
Ending income-based repayment and Public Service Loan Forgiveness means new doctors — who typically start their careers with six-figure debt — will be forced into unaffordable standard repayment schedules. Without the safety net of income-based repayment or the promise of forgiveness after serving high-need communities, many will abandon medical training altogether or avoid practicing in rural and underserved areas where salaries are lower.
These changes come as the U.S. faces a looming doctor shortage, especially in rural areas like Kentucky. But this law makes it harder than ever to grow our health care workforce.
The blow is even worse for aspiring doctors of color. In 2023, only 5.7% of active physicians in the U.S. were Black, despite Black Americans making up over 13% of the population. Latino, Indigenous and low-income communities are similarly underrepresented. How do we close health disparities if we close the door on the very students who would serve these communities?
This issue is personal for me, not just as a scholar of education and student debt, but as a father. My daughter recently graduated from Frederick Douglass High School in Lexington, where she completed the biomedical sciences magnet program, part of the nationally renowned Project Lead the Way curriculum. She is now headed to Amherst College to study pre-med, with dreams of becoming a physician.
Her journey exemplifies what’s possible when a school district invests in excellence. Under the leadership of Superintendent Demetrus Liggins — who was just named Kentucky Superintendent of the Year — Fayette County Public Schools are preparing students to lead, innovate and serve.

How can a district so effectively prepare its students for college, only to have college become unreachable or unsupportive due to federal abandonment? This is the contradiction that cuts to the heart of America’s education crisis: We spend years cultivating brilliance in our youth — only to shrivel the pipeline at the very moment it matters most.
Yet Kentucky’s elected leaders have largely abandoned the state. U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, who once championed Pell Grants, has quietly voted in favor of the act. U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, who represents Lexington and many of our college towns, not only voted in favor of the act, he championed it. And U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie was so committed to gutting the federal Department of Education that he reintroduced the bill to abolish it.
These voting patterns aren’t surprising. The National Education Association legislative report gave all of Kentucky’s Republican congresspeople and senators a grade of F. Only a few officials, like U.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, have spoken out against these cuts. McGarvey shows how we Kentuckians can build a new coalition for higher education — one that is bipartisan and unapologetically pro-learning. 
We must pressure our elected officials in Kentucky to restore federal student aid, reinvest in Pell, and protect public institutions by ensuring they have stable federal funding, guardrails against state disinvestment and the capacity to serve all qualified students regardless of family income.
Higher education should not be rationed to the wealthy. It must remain a public commitment — a bridge to careers, to service, to self-determination.

Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
GOP bill shielding conversion therapy clears committee on party line vote

Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.
In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Conversion therapy shielded in Kentucky as legislature overrides Beshear veto

Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
 ‘The world has changed’

While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.

Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.

“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
 Free speech argument

Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
 A Republican loss

In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

And good government groups say Rhode Island’s body-worn camera regulations are riddled with loopholes that give police officers a pass at the expense of public transparency and access.
That’s why they’re again asking the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office to strengthen state policy.
“Transparency is critical within law enforcement agencies, particularly when there is an officer-involved shooting,” an Aug. 7 letter from ACCESS/RI states. 
It’s the third time the nonprofit coalition of watchdog and access groups, including the Rhode Island Press Association, of which Rhode Island Current is a member, has asked the AG’s office to strengthen the state body camera program since the state legislature approved the law in 2021. 
So far, the calls for change have gone mostly unanswered.
“The AG doesn’t take the position of the open government groups when it comes to body cameras because the AG has this duality of also being the chief law enforcement officer,” John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island and a signatory to the letter, said in an interview Thursday. “They typically side with their colleagues in law enforcement.”
Rhode Island Attorney General Neronha’s office acknowledged but did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. 
In a written explanation in response to ACCESS/RI’s proposed revisions last year, Neronha’s office said its approach to state regulations strikes an “appropriate balance” between letting police officers perform their duties, respecting privacy and providing evidence for public accountability.
State law required the AG’s office and the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety to seek public input when developing regulations, and again ask for feedback each year. But it doesn’t force state regulators to accept those suggestions.
ACCESS/RI members submitted nearly identical lists of proposed changes in 2022 and 2024. A few recommendations were incorporated. Most were not.

Waiting for change 
Requested revisions include requiring law enforcement agencies to make full audio and video footage from use-of-force cases publicly accessible within 30 days of the incident. The existing law requires sharing camera footage from extreme or deadly force by an officer after “substantial completion” of evidence collection and witness interviews. It notes that such completion is “expected to occur within 30 days.”
But, it doesn’t outright require a 30-day turnaround.
The lack of specificity results in inconsistent and varied compliance with state law, said Tim White, a former board member for the New England First Amendment Coalition. White serves as an investigative reporter and managing editor for WPRI-TV 12.
“When police agencies want to release body-worn camera footage, they do it quickly and they do it free of charge,” White said in an interview. “They often release video hours within an incident when they want to stop a crime or catch a bad guy.”
Conversely, when law enforcement agencies face scrutiny, including when they use potentially unnecessary force, video footage can take weeks to release to the public, often accompanied by “exorbitant” fees, White said.










Transparency is critical within law enforcement agencies, particularly when there is an officer-involved shooting.


– ACCESS/RI in its Aug. 7 letter to the Rhode Island Attorney General's office


Case in point: an officer-involved shooting in Pawtucket in June. The city shared redacted video footage the following month in response to public records requests by various media outlets, but has yet to share footage of the shooting itself or the events leading up to the incident.
“Worse, there appears to be a malfunction or deactivation of the involved officer’s [body worn camera], resulting in an inexplicable gap in the video — and yet more questions about law enforcement actions that day,” ACCESS/RI’s letter states.
Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said in a written response Thursday that the police officer’s body camera was in “off-duty mode,” before receiving the call, and did not automatically activate as intended when the officer took out his gun.
White, who has covered law enforcement in Rhode Island and Massachusetts for a combined three decades, has found that access to body camera footage, and records generally, depends less on state policy, and more on individual agency culture.
White called Goncalves’ explanation “unacceptable,” further highlighting the problems with vague state guidelines as well as lack of training on how police officers should use their cameras.
Goncalves also noted that the city follows the state’s regulations for body worn cameras.
“Should the Attorney General’s office seek to revise the policy, the Pawtucket Police Department would actively participate in that process,” she said.
The regulations also lack clarity on when officers are allowed to turn off or mute their cameras. Outside of deadly force incidents, in which cameras can’t be turned off until the incident is concluded, police officers can stop recording or mute their camera audio when dealing with minors, speaking to witnesses who want anonymity, or if they see activities or circumstances that are “sensitive or private in nature,” among other scenarios. 
ACCESS/RI called the policy “confusing and over-broad,” giving officers too much authority and discretion to stop recording.

The sound of silence 
Body camera footage released by Providence police who responded to a car crash involving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers last month includes several lengthy silences due to muted audio of police body cameras.
Providence Police Col. Oscar Perez has publicly denied that the city law enforcement cooperated with ICE in its arrest of a self-admitted MS-13 gang member in Providence. But lack of sound in the recorded footage raised suspicions for Steven Brown, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island. Brown also signed ACCESS/RI’s letter to the AG. 
“It’s troubling to have the police department talk about how they did not in any way collaborate with ICE during the incident yet there is this half hour of silence in which police are talking with ICE agents,” Brown said in an interview.
The ACLU has since asked Perez in writing to “address the legitimacy” of muted recordings and release the remaining footage from other officers who responded. 
Anthony Vega, a spokesperson for Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s office, said in an email Thursday night that Providence police officers are allowed to mute camera audio when speaking with other law enforcement officers under department policy.
“After a thorough review of the incident, Providence Police identified some non-compliance and has addressed that with staff,” Vega said. “The Department remains committed to fairness, accountability and transparency.”
Rhode Island is not alone in its struggle to balance law enforcement protections and investigatory powers with public access, said Justin Silverman, executive director for the New England First Amendment Coalition, who also signed the letter to the AG.
State regulations governing police body cameras are still a new phenomenon — a reaction in many places, including Rhode Island, to the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a Minnesota police officer.
“Many states inappropriately rely on the investigatory exemption to withhold footage for an unreasonable amount of time,” Silverman said. “There’s an inclination to really defer to police departments.”
While Silverman acknowledged that there are sometimes legitimate reasons to withhold or redact body camera footage, Rhode Island’s regulations leave room for misinterpretation, or worse, abuse.
“Our recommendations are really focused on narrowing the language of the policy and getting very specific about the circumstances that would need to present to withhold footage,” Silverman said.
Try, try, try again 
Despite failing to persuade the AG’s office on most of the requested clarifications and revisions to the state body camera policy thus far, Silverman insisted it was not a fruitless exercise to try again.
“We’re also educating the public about what could happen because of these policies, how community members might be left in the dark over a police incident we don’t have video for because of restrictive policies that need to be revisited,” Silverman said.
Brown was less optimistic.
“If the AG’s office were truly interested in promoting access with the body camera policy program, they would have long ago adopted many of the recommendations that ACCESS/RI has offered,” he said. 
One alternative path to progress could be reforming the state’s public records act. 
Among the 48 revisions proposed to the Access to Public Records Act during the 2025 legislation was a requirement that law enforcement turn over body camera footage in use-of-force cases within 30 days. The legislation stalled in both chambers of the Rhode Island General Assembly, drowned in a litany of objections by Gov. Dan McKee’s office and other state cabinet heads. Proponents for records reform expect to introduce similar, or identical, legislation next year.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears dropped by an American Legion office in Midlothian on Thursday, a stop on her “Operation Defend and Deliver” campaign event series.
She and U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, emphasized their aim to elevate the lieutenant governor to the executive mansion next year and flip the House of Delegates to their party’s control.
Youngkin touts Va.’s $4.7 billion cash cushion, downplays Medicaid, federal workforce changes

Earle-Sears’ speech was partially a victory lap touting Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration and a projected $4.7 billion cash cushion for next year that the governor announced Thursday. It was also an echo of Youngkin’s winning 2021 campaign themes, like parental oversight concerning their children’s education and support for law enforcement.
“Parents still matter!” she said enthusiastically as the crowd of about 100 cheered. 
 Spanberger criticism

Earle-Sears lambasted her democratic opponent, former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, and alleged that Spanberger “voted to defund the police and end qualified immunity.”
Spanberger — who  scolded other congressional Democrats in 2020 for using the controversial “defund the police” phrasing and said it was partially why her party lost seats in the 2022 elections — has a background working for the Central Intelligence Agency and routinely expressed support for law enforcement. She also proposed a bill in 2021 to “study proactive strategies and best practices to ensure the inclusion of community satisfaction and trust in policing performance measurement,” which was never brought up for a vote. 
When Earle-Sears noted how Spanberger received a donation from someone the Republican National Committee says is a member of the Communist Party of China, several in the audience gasped. 
“Abigail — give it back!” Earle-Sears said. 
The donor, Pin Ni, donated $50,000 to Spanberger’s campaign. Ni has also given nearly $70,000 to Republicans between the RNC and National Republican Campaign Committee in recent years, Virginia Scope reported. 
 Money matters

Money was another talking point during the Earle-Sears event, framed as both a celebration of Virginia’s current budget surplus and a call for more campaign cash for Earle-Sears and Republicans running in the House of Delegates. 
“I need your help,” she said. “We don’t work on assumptions.”
The candidates’ latest campaign finance reports, released in July, showed Earle-Sears raised $5.9 million from donors in the second quarter of this year and has amassed $11.6 million total since last fall. Spanberger raised $10.7 million over the second quarter and has added $27 million to her campaign coffers in total since November 2023. 
 Culture war issues in focus

After months of silence about her running mate Republican John Reid — who was embroiled in a scandal over sexually explicit photos on a social media site and was asked to drop out of the lieutenant governor race by Youngkin — Earle-Sears acknowledged him as her would-be successor. 
As president of the state Senate, lieutenant governors are responsible to cast tie-breaking votes — an important responsibility, she stressed. 
Earle-Sears used the moment to take a jab at Reid’s opponent, Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, who she critiqued for supporting the term “birthing people” in reproductive health legislation. While not as common as cisgender women, nonbinary or transgender people with uteruses have become pregnant and use of the term is meant to be inclusive. 
Connecting legislative battles over transgender students’ access to bathrooms and sports teams to parental authority within public schools, Earle-Sears also accused members of the Democratic party of “erasing women.”
Earle-Sears wrote that she was “morally opposed” to an in-progress effort to enshrine reproductive rights like abortion, contraception and fertility treatment access in the state’s constitution when signing the legislation earlier this year.
Open letter to Earle-Sears reflects Va. voters’ shifting sentiments on reproductive health care

She also used her tie-breaking power to vote against a right-to-contraception bill that ultimately advanced due to a re-vote before facing Youngkin’s veto. Some Republicans signed onto a bipartisan letter this summer to tell Earle-Sears they would not vote for her because of their support for reproductive rights. 
 Promises and proposals

Aside from rallying the crowd to support her party and taking jabs at Democrats, Earle-Sears also laid out goals she would like to achieve if elected governor. 
She said she planned to support legislation that would prevent the first $20,000 of law enforcement officers’ salaries from being taxed. 
“We need them and we don’t have enough of them,” she said. 
Reiterating an early campaign message from this past winter, Earle-Sears stressed her commitment to protecting Virginia’s right-to-work law. Right-to-work laws make it unlawful to deny employment based on union membership or refusal to join a union. Earle-Sears had supported a now-failed attempt to constitutionally enshrine the law earlier this year. 
 Medicaid pushback

Meanwhile, health care advocates rallied within earshot of Thursday’s campaign event, calling out Wittman’s and Earle-Sears’ support for the President Donald Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act that was signed into law last month.
A crowd of about 20 protesters gathered in a cul-de-sac outside of the American Legion Thursday. Earle-Sears called their presence “a wonderful thing” and said “We must ensure that continues in America.”
“It’s always fascinating to me that we can speak our minds,” Earle-Sears told her crowd of supporters inside about the protesters outside. 
Despite inter-party disagreements, himself included, Wittman voted this summer for the reconciliation bill that contains forthcoming changes to Medicaid and hospital funding mechanisms. He framed the law that Trump signed on July 4 as a way to ensure Medicaid sticks around for the long haul. 
The changes entail additional verification processes for recipients to prove they’re meeting work or educational requirements that occupy at least 80 hours a month. Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services director Cheryl Roberts told state lawmakers this summer that the changes will be challenging for localities and the Department of Social Services to process. 
Advocates, including some gathered outside of the Earle-Sears campaign event, have cautioned that thousands of Virginians could fall through the cracks in the new re-verification process and lose their health care. 
Chris Yates, a Bellevue resident who attended the protest, said Virginia’s low-income or already-struggling populations are going to be impacted by the changes first. 
“It’s designed that way,” he said. 
But Youngkin stressed Thursday morning that Virginians’ health care wouldn’t be impacted just because of the changes, a stance echoed by Earle-Sears and Wittman later in the day. 
“Changes to Medicaid are not ‘taking coverage away from anyone,’” Youngkin said during a presentation to state lawmakers in preparation for next year’s budget process. “No Virginians are losing their Medicaid coverage.”
Open letter to Earle-Sears reflects Va. voters’ shifting sentiments on reproductive health care

While the changes won’t take effect until after next year’s congressional midterms, Yates has his eye on Wittman and Earle-Sears. 
Sean Sublette, a former Richmond Times-Dispatch meteorologist and recently-announced Democratic challenger to Wittman, also attended the rally. 
Sublette said he feels like Wittman’s vote was “simply to satisfy Trump and Speaker (Mike) Johnson” and said that he’s concerned about the potential for hospitals trimming services or closing and patients having to travel further for care. 
While Wittman and Sublette each have more than a year to hit the ground for their own campaigns, the current congressman is stumping for Republicans in this year’s House and gubernatorial elections. 
Early voting is set to begin on Sep. 19, Wittman reminded the crowd, and he encouraged Republicans to vote early and tell at least 50 people they know to do the same.
With Democrats running candidates in all 100 of the House of Delegates seats this year, Wittman said “they’re all-in, we need to be all-in.”

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.

his has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.

“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)Here’s something I almost never say: Virginia got it right.
I’m referring to the bipartisan redistricting commission, a process the commonwealth completed for the first time in 2021. Voters had earlier approved a constitutional amendment that had removed the line-drawing from legislators alone. It helped prevent the partisan nonsense now playing out in Texas, too.
Virginia General Assembly passes rules for newly approved redistricting commission

The Virginia panel didn’t eradicate politics from redistricting; that’s nearly impossible. The process had flaws. But the decennial exercise became more transparent, less deferential to incumbents and didn’t provide the majority party in the General Assembly a bludgeon to wield against the minority.
Virginia is one of just 10 states where a commission has the “primary responsibility for drawing a plan for congressional districts,” according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The eight citizen-members and eight legislators in Virginia were equally split between Democrats and Republicans, and the composition produced constant gridlock. After the stalemates, the Virginia Supreme Court was tasked with overseeing the mapmaking for the state House of Delegates, Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives.
“This was supposed to be bipartisan collaboration on getting the work done, and it ended up being partisan,” state Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton and a commission member, told me Wednesday.
Debates ensued over such routine issues as which university could be trusted to supply unbiased data. Members even named co-chairs so neither party would have the upper hand in that role.
Still, the system in Virginia precludes the cowardice and chicanery we’re now witnessing in the Lone Star State. The spectacle in Texas is undemocratic, unseemly and unfair.
There, gutless GOP state legislators are taking the rare step of attempting to reopen the redistricting process mid-decade, all to try to gain five more seats in the narrowly split U.S. House of Representatives. Obsequious Republican legislators are doing this at the behest of their “Dear Leader,” President Donald Trump.
Why congressional redistricting is blowing up across the US this summer

You don’t have to resort to such uncommon tactics if your party’s policies are popular. At Trump’s urging, Republicans gutted Medicaid and food assistance to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy this year.
Democratic state legislators in Texas, in response, fled the state to prevent a quorum. Meanwhile, states with Democratic governors, including Gavin Newsom in California, have threatened to retaliate by rejiggering their own lines and gaining even more Democratic seats in Congress. It was a rare moment of reciprocity by Democratic leaders nationwide.
Other states with Republican governors, including Indiana, are considering whether they’ll join the fray.
This is madness. It’s exactly the “rigging” of elections that Trump has long claimed he opposed (and which he’s lied about). He has no problem, though, if he’s the beneficiary.
Which brings me back to the commonwealth. As frustrating as the constant deadlock was in 2021, Virginia redistricting members didn’t want to throw out the Sharpies with the cartographers just yet.
Mackenzie Babichenko, the Republican citizen co-chair of the panel in 2021, liked the transparency and citizen input. However, the lack of a natural tiebreaker, such as having an odd number of members on the panel, meant there would be frequent hurdles.
“I learned how political this process actually is,” she told me by email Wednesday, “and that lines can be drawn pursuant to neutral criteria, in full compliance with the law, in many different ways, and definitely in ways that favor one political party or the other.”
“Additionally, we need to incorporate our independents,” Babichenko added.” Virginia is home to a lot of people who are single-issue voters, independent, non-partisan or not engaged in politics at all. Those individuals deserve to have their voices represented.”
Babichenko told me rules about not holding partisan elective office will disqualify her from serving again as a citizen member, because she was elected as the Hanover County commonwealth’s attorney in 2023.
The Code of Virginia also suggests mid-decade convening of the commission is prohibited.  
Complaints still arise years after the 2021 process.
Del. Marcus Simon, D-Falls Church, was a member of the panel. He later resigned, but he told me he’s been since reappointed. Simon said the maps the state Supreme Court produced should’ve hewed more to Democrats having an advantage because of recent voting trends in this purple state.
“The process failed … it didn’t result in a map” from the panel itself, Simon told me.
Given some of our state’s obvious shortcomings, I’d characterize the commission differently.
After all, Virginia is the only state where governors can’t run for a second consecutive term. It means the chief executive can advocate policies that he doesn’t have to pay a price for politically.
When it comes to restoring the civil rights of released felons, including voting, Virginia is among the worst. The gubernatorial prerogative is based on racism and dates to the early 1900s.
Anyone who earns $17,000 or more in income is lumped into the same tax bracket. The inequity is appalling. The state’s longtime underfunding of schools is a perpetual embarrassment – especially since we’re among the leaders annually among the top states to do business.
So, considering all of that, I’ll take the imperfect system of redistricting we began four years ago. Agreement might continue to be fraught with roadblocks in the future.
That’s far, far better than the insanity happening in Texas.

Two decades ago, the leaders of Capitol Broadcasting Company had a bold and courageous idea: to devote one minute each night after the simulcast of the WRAL News on Mix 101.5 to a no-holds-barred commentary from veteran journalist and political observer, Chris Fitzsimon.
For more than a decade, Fitzsimon held forth on scores of vitally important and frequently controversial issues with insightful takes that spoke truth to power and championed the rights of average North Carolinians.
In 2017, I was fortunate enough to inherit that role and since then I’ve done my best to build on Chris’s pioneering work.
As the old saying goes, however, all good things must come to an end and so it is that this will be — for now anyway – the final commentary in this series. It’s been a great run.

(Photo courtesy of candidate)Ryan Strnad, who has worked for over 35 years as a beer vendor at the Milwaukee Brewers’ home stadium American Family Field, announced Thursday that he will officially enter the Democratic primary for governor next week.
Strnad’s campaign has been years in the making. He told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2023 (less than eight months after Evers started his second term) that he would be considering entering if Evers opted not to run for a third term. Last month Evers announced he won’t be running so he can spend more time with his family.
Strnad, who lives in Mukwonago, is the founder of Drinks In The Seats, a political action committee and lobbying group formed in 2016 to lobby on behalf of in-seat beer vendors.

Strnad said in 2023 that his top priority if he ran for governor would be advocating for Wisconsin’s unions and working class. His campaign website now lists “improving the working class” as the first item on his plan for Wisconsin along with working on the environment with “common sense”, supporting the police and allowing “any pregnant mother/mother-to-be (or, whatever YOU are comfortable with saying) who wants an abortion [to] have an abortion.”
“I’m running for governor of Wisconsin because I feel obligated to lead our state!” Strnad said on his website. “Moving here to Muskego in 1975, I established roots that I am proud of. I may’ve even served YOU at the stadium where I’ve gotten politically involved and worked there since 1988. I also have jobs elsewhere. I am one of us! I ask for your vote.”
Strnad would be the second Democratic candidate to officially enter the primary, which will likely be a crowded field.
Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez announced her campaign less than 24 hours after Evers announced his retirement. Other potential candidates include Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys and Attorney General Josh Kaul.
The primary is still about a year away on August 11, 2026.
Two Republican candidates, Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien, have entered the race so far. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany has said he would make a decision before the end of September.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
Justice Department demand for state voter lists underscores their importance

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
Though noncitizens can vote in few local elections, GOP goes big to make it illegal

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.

Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
 States in a ‘very, very strong position’

Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.

That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.

Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
 A ‘substantial headache’

Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.










We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw


New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.





“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

(Photo by Claire Sullivan/New Hampshire Bulletin)As of last month, more than 5,000 New Hampshire children are benefiting from a scholarship program aimed at making child care affordable for families, an official with the state said Thursday.
The latest numbers, presented at a meeting of the New Hampshire Child Care Advisory Council, mark a continued uptick in the use of the Child Care Scholarship Program, a state-federal partnership, following expanded income eligibility last year. As of October 2024, 4,348 children had been enrolled in the program, according to researchers at the University of New Hampshire’s Carsey School of Public Policy. (The Couch Family Foundation, which funds the New Hampshire Bulletin’s early care and education reporting position, provided support for this research, and is also a funder of the council.)
In other news shared at the council meeting, the state Department of Health and Human Services continues to await an answer on whether the federal government will allow $15 million in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families reserve funds to go toward a child care workforce grant. And at the Community College System of New Hampshire, millions from multiple funding sources have now gone toward assisting students with taking early care and education courses.
Jotham Spreeman, administrator of operations with the DHHS’ Bureau of Child Development and Head Start Collaboration, called the latest scholarship enrollment numbers “fantastic.” He said another 361 children have been confirmed to be eligible for the scholarship but have not yet been linked with a provider.
In the last budget cycle, lawmakers had expanded eligibility for the scholarship to families making up to 85% of the state median income. A family of four earning up to $124,595 and a family of three earning $104,660 may now be eligible for the scholarship, said Nicole Heller, senior policy analyst at the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research nonprofit. 
In the latest budget passed this legislative session, lawmakers sought to ease administrative burdens for families and providers engaged with the program, with a pilot program that aims to address difficulties completing the application planned to launch in 2026.
As part of the scholarship, families pay a cost-share with the state. For 34% of children enrolled in the program, their families pay nothing, Spreeman said. For 10%, their families pay $5 a week, and for the other 56%, their families pay no more than 7% of their income toward child care, the percentage the federal government deems “affordable.”
The scholarship has historically been underutilized by eligible families, even with recent jumps in enrollment. UNH researchers wrote in February that an estimated 55,000 children in the state under 13 are eligible for the program. The gap between those eligible for the scholarship and those using it may be attributable to a lack of awareness about the program, as well as paperwork and administrative burdens, researchers said. 
Lawmakers and advocates hope the pilot program — which, following an initial screening, will grant families a period of presumptive eligibility to use scholarships funds while they complete the application process — will ease some of those burdens. 
Another recent change to the scholarship program enacted by lawmakers this year will allow providers who accept scholarship funds to be paid at the beginning of the period of care, rather than the end, said Trina Ingelfinger, the early care and education policy coordinator at New Futures, a health policy advocacy group.
Marianne Barter, the departing chair of the council who runs two child care programs, said “that has been a huge problem for child care providers for a really, really long time.”
“This is really huge,” Barter said, “and should really have a huge impact on cash flow for child care providers.”
While families across the state struggle to afford child care, those who provide that care also often struggle to make ends meet. The median wage for child care workers in the state was $15.62 an hour, or $32,490 annually, in 2023, according to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute. Adjusted for cost of living, those are the second-lowest wages for child care workers in the country, according to a 2018 report from the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the University of California, Berkeley. Retaining workers is a challenge in the state, further stressing the availability of care.
In the 2025 fiscal year, $15 million in one-time state funds was distributed to support the child care workforce, according to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute. These funds supported benefits and bonuses for child care workers, among other uses. 
Lawmakers hoped to use the TANF reserve funds to put another $15 million toward the workforce grant in this budget. Spreeman told the council that the letter requesting to use the funds for that purpose had been sent to the federal Administration for Children and Families but had not yet received a response.
In other workforce developments, representatives of the Community College System of New Hampshire shared updates on a grant program that offers tuition assistance for those on the early care and education path.
Teri Laflamme, the system’s early childhood education tuition assistance coordinator, said that the system had awarded over $3,200,000 in scholarships for 5,931 early care and education-connected courses since the fall of 2023.
Applications for the fall 2025 term were still open, she said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/childcarescholar-1024x703.jpg,,,2025-08-15 05:56:20.650519

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio lawmakers are preparing to draft new congressional districts. Several progressive organizations calling themselves the Equal Districts Coalition are joining forces again to push for fair maps.
Lawmakers are going back to the drawing board because they approved maps along partisan lines in 2021. Ohio is actually the only state in the country constitutionally mandated to do so, but the exercise comes as the Trump administration pushes Republican state leaders to redraw more maps.
The “very simple redrawing” Trump wants in Texas is an apparent bid to offset potential mid-term losses in 2026. Republicans hold an exceptionally narrow majority in the U.S. House. New, more GOP-friendly maps in a handful of Republican states might push the goalposts just far enough to stave off a Democratic majority.
With Republican gerrymandering efforts gaining momentum, some Democratic states have threatened gerrymanders of their own to negate Republican gains. But League of Women Voters of Ohio Executive Director Jen Miller was unequivocal in her opposition of those tactics.
“You can judge us by our actions as well as our words,” she said. “We have been fighting gerrymandering when the Democrats do it, and when the Republicans do it. We came out immediately and opposed (California Gov.) Gavin Newsom when he suggested that that they should gerrymander for Democrats.”
“Gerrymandering harms every voter,” Miller insisted. “We are never in support of drawing lines specifically so that politicians can win.”

What Ohio looks like
There’s little doubt Republicans have an edge in Ohio. GOP candidates regularly win statewide races by several points.  But current congressional maps give Republicans a 2-to-1 advantage, holding 10 of the state’s 15 seats.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“That is not fair. That is not representative,” Deidra Reese from the Ohio Organizing Collaborative, said.
“When I go out and I talk to people and I tell them to use their vote, I tell them it is because their vote matters,” Reese said. “But we are often facing a situation where their vote doesn’t matter because we see people who are using the power of the pen to draw maps (so) that their vote is really taken away, the power of their vote is taken away.”
And some Republicans think — with a few tweaks — they could push their advantage further. Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno suggested the party aim for 12 seats, leaving representation of Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati to Democrats. To get there, Republicans would target U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur from Toledo and Emilia Sykes from Akron — two Democrats who defended toss-up seats in the last election.
The Rev. Raymond Greene Jr. from Freedom Bloc argued his home city of Akron has been split up before, and he worries if mapmakers try to kneecap Sykes, they’ll harm the city.
“We know what happens when voices go silent,” he said. “We have been silenced for so long. Resources dry up, needs go unmet, policies are passed that benefit the few at the expense of the many. And equal districts gives us a chance to flourish together.”
Congressional redistricting on the Ohio legislature’s fall docket

How the process works
In 2018, Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved an anti-gerrymandering measure that requires buy-in from the minority party. Republicans held sway throughout the process, though, and drew maps that would benefit their candidates. The state supreme court repeatedly rejected those maps, but GOP lawmakers eventually forced them through.
Last year, Ohioans turned down an anti-gerrymandering ballot measure known as Issue 1. But Miller from the League of Women Voters noted even the measure’s opponents framed a ‘no’ vote as a vote against gerrymandering.
“Ohioans are expecting fairness,” Miller said. “We saw last year that Ohioans overwhelmingly voted to end gerrymandering, even if they didn’t understand the ballot language.”
Under the process approved in 2018, state lawmakers get the first crack at drawing a map. If lawmakers can approve a draft with 60% majorities in both chambers, and the governor signs it, that’s the map. They’ve got until the end of September.
If lawmakers can’t get there, the Ohio Redistricting Commission gets the pen. There are seven members and to approve a map they need two members from both major parties to vote yes. Five of the commission’s seven members are Republicans. They’ve got until the end of October.
If the commission deadlocks, mapmaking returns to the legislature. But this time, they only need simple majority support to approve a map. They face additional criteria like an explicit prohibition on benefiting a party or candidate and limiting community splits. They have to finish their work by November 30.

Where the rubber meets the road
In the past, Republicans have run out the clock and approved partisan maps along party lines. Organizations like the Equal Districts Coalition can challenge those maps in court, but the Ohio Supreme Court has swung sharply toward Republicans. The GOP now holds six of the court’s seven seats.
Miller said litigation is still an option, but she raised a different possibility — challenging the map at the ballot box through a referendum.
“Look, the fair districts coalition has 4,000 volunteers right now trained on signature gathering,” she said. “If there was ever a time to do a referendum, we have the infrastructure right now to collect those signatures and get on the ballot.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-15 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Heating aid in CT expected to increase this winter,Keith M. Phaneuf and John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/15/heating-aid-in-ct-expected-to-increase-this-winter/,"For the first time in four years, CT officials are anticipating an increase in energy assistance for low-income families this winter.","For the first time in four years, state officials in Connecticut are anticipating an increase in energy assistance for low-income families this winter, though it remains to be seen whether much-needed federal funding will come through to provide support for the program.
The Department of Social Services recently released its annual projected spending for the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program, including a maximum benefit of $1,920 this winter, which is $160 more than last year.
Base benefits for households also grew by $115 in the department’s latest plan, though they remain well below pre-pandemic levels.
But state officials also were cautious about the ultimate fate of their plans, given that President Donald Trump has proposed eliminating federal grants to support state programs offering energy assistance.
Earlier this year, Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services fired all of the staff members assigned to the federal government’s Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program — sending state officials scrambling to find someone in the administration to take their calls and release the remaining grant funds.
During a hearing before lawmakers last week, DSS Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves said that state employees working on energy assistance have been able to communicate with their federal counterparts via email but have not received any instructions to shutter the program or stop accepting new applications.
“We’ve been operating as if the office was still intact,” Reeves said. “It’s very hard to predict what’s going to happen now.”
Meanwhile, members of both parties in Congress have fought to preserve or even increase federal funding for the LIHEAP program for the upcoming winter. Earlier this month, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to advance more than $4 billion in federal funding for the program, an increase of $20 million.
Advocates in Connecticut have praised those efforts while warning that that continued staff shortages have left the program teetering. 
“It’s really going to test the system,” said Chris Herb, the president of the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association, a trade group representing hundreds of fuel oil delivery companies around the state. 
“From a small business perspective, you know, our role in this is that we’re the ones who are at these customers’ homes throughout the winter,” Herb added. “If there’s no money to pay us, it becomes very difficult to to be able to participate in a program.”
It remains uncertain whether Trump and Congress will adopt a new budget before the federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1. But if LIHEAP funds are jeopardized, it likely will trigger a fierce debate here over whether Connecticut should fund winter energy assistance with state money.
“One way or another, we’re not going to let residents freeze to death,” said Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, co-chairman of the General Assembly’s Human Services Committee. Lesser’s panel, in conjunction with the Appropriations and Energy & Technology committees, recently approved state social services officials’ plans to spend federal LIHEAP and related funds this winter.
In order to be eligible for Connecticut’s program, households must have income at or below 60% of the state median, which is $91,854 for a family of four. Benefits are tiered based on income and the presence of other vulnerability factors.
Basic benefits this winter for non-vulnerable households would range from $295 to $595 under DSS’ latest plan. For vulnerable households — which are categorized as any household with a member who is 60 or older, has a disability, or has a child that under age 6 — benefits would range from $345 to $645.
The program also provides as many as three “crisis assistance” payments of $425 each for certain households that rely on deliverable fuels, such as home heating oil, and that have exhausted their basic benefit grants.
Those grants, though increasing, are well below pre-pandemic levels and those offered during the early years of the coronavirus. The maximum grant was $2,980 in the winters of 2019-20 and 2020-21 before surging to $4,125 in 2021-22.
From there, benefit levels steadily dropped, along with federal LIHEAP grants.
And though overall projected spending for this winter’s program is up 3%, from $86.4 million to $89.2 million, the federal LIHEAP contribution is expected to remain flat at $81.7 million.
State officials supplemented last year’s energy assistance chiefly with $4.2 million in funding from another federal program, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. That funding is no longer available. 
This year, the state plans to augment its LIHEAP grant with more than $7 million in unused funds from past winter heating assistance efforts.
Meanwhile, the Department of Social Services projects demand this winter at 100,375 households, up sharply from an estimated 88,485 recipients one year ago.
Demand has been very volatile in recent years, although the overall trend has been upward. The caseload stood at 75,300 households just before the pandemic and climbed as high as 105,700 in the winter of 2022-23 and stayed above 100,000 the next year before dropping again last winter.
Herb said the participation in the program peaked in the years around Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which caused a global surge in the price of fuel oil. After watching numbers fall off last year, he said, he’s yet to receive an explanation from DSS as to why they projected another increase this winter.
“I don’t think that there’s any threat that they’re gonna run out of money, because I don’t think that they’ll meet their anticipated participation numbers,” Herb said.
State funding?
The state’s Low-Income Energy Water Advisory Board, other energy assistance advocates, and many majority Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority have called in recent years for Connecticut to supplement shrinking federal LIHEAP grants with state money.
Gov. Ned Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, has pushed against that, arguing energy assistance chiefly is a federal responsibility. But the governor compromised in February 2024, agreeing to dedicate $17 million in state funds to bolster the program.
Reeves told legislators at last week’s hearing that her agency’s best guess was that federal LIHEAP funding would be available to Connecticut this winter but said it’s difficult to predict what Congress will decide long-term.
“We’re really trying to think as optimistically as possible,” she said.
Both Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, and Lesser said many legislators will push to maintain some form of state-funded energy assistance program if Washington eliminates LIHEAP.
“We have the capacity to do it. We have the capacity to fund that,” Osten said. “LIHEAP is too important for us to allow no [federal funding] whatsoever.”
Lamont’s budget staff projects Connecticut closed the 2024-25 fiscal year on June 30 with a nearly $2.5 billion surplus, which would be the second-largest in state history and equal to nearly 11% of the General Fund.   
Nora Duncan, director of the AARP’s Connecticut chapter, called the projected increase in energy assistance grants this winter “a real win for low-income seniors and families.”
Duncan serves on the state’s energy advisory board, which has been pushing in recent years for increased assistance levels and supplemental state funding for the program.
Even with aid to households expected to grow, having the state share the cost of keeping vulnerable residents warm must continue to be explored, she said.
Generation Power CT, a Hartford-based energy assistance nonprofit formerly known as Operation Fuel, expects to help more than 5,000 Connecticut households cover their utility bills over the next year, said Gannon Long, its chief policy and public affairs officer.
“Income-limited households in our state continue struggling to pay for essentials,” Long said, adding that “the hardest time to manage an emergency is when you’re already in one … As we look ahead toward the next legislative session, we ask leaders in our state to keep vulnerable families top of mind.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024_0916_SR_HeatingAssistance_084-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 05:56:20.650519

(Photo by Getty Images)Attorneys leading a class action lawsuit against Ohio’s new stadium funding plan have thrown their weight behind a case out of California. They’ve filed an amicus brief, urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear a case challenging how California handles abandoned funds.
In the most recent state budget, Ohio lawmakers devised a system to use private citizens’ unclaimed funds to pay for a new Cleveland Browns stadium. Lawmakers earmarked $1 million for outreach, but there’s no explicit requirement for officials to notify individual owners before their property gets transferred.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Attorneys Jeff Crossman and Marc Dann see parallels in California’s unclaimed funds program.
“The idea that the government can take your property without notice, without your consent or without payment first, is exactly what our state and federal constitutions were written to prevent,” attorney Jeffrey Crossman explained in a press release.
“Private property rights are supposed to be sacred,” he added. “Yet in both states, the government is treating other people’s property as a slush fund.
What’s California up to?
In California, most unclaimed funds including old bank accounts, security deposits and unused life insurance benefits become dormant once there’s no account activity for three years. If the state controller can’t track down the rightful owner, that property gets liquidated and transferred to the state.
The court case, known as Peters v. Cohen, turns on the state’s notification requirements.
Jan Peters is German citizen, but he had an account in California holding Amazon stock. That account eventually got reported as dormant. But when the state attempted to contact Peters, the private firm it worked with changed his address in Munich, Germany to Munich, California and used a zip code of “00000.”
Munich, California doesn’t exist, and “00000” is not a valid zip code. Unsurprisingly, the notice never reached Peters, and so the controller sold his Amazon stock in July 2020. His holdings were worth $1.6 million at the time of sale. They’d be worth more than $4.2 million now.
Peters’ U.S. Supreme Court petition argues California’s statutes don’t account for reasonable investment strategies like buying and holding. And while California works hard to track down people with unpaid taxes or traffic tickets, it doesn’t go to the same lengths to return money.
The petition added California’s growing reliance on third-party firms, paid on commission, has “not only lubricate(d) the funnel for unclaimed property to slide into the coffers of the state but also increase(d) the risk of erroneous seizures.”
The
Capital Journal reached out to the California Controller Malia Cohen. Her press secretary declined comment.
Unlike Ohio’s new unclaimed funds law, California maintains an indefinite obligation to return funds to their owners. So, Peters eventually received $1.6 million from the state of California. But because the state failed to provide notice before selling his stock, Peters contends he’s also entitled to the difference between the sale price and its current market value.
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals turned Peters down, determining his claim amounted to “a request for money damages barred under the Eleventh Amendment.” He’s appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In September, the justices are slated to consider whether to hear the case.

How the case intersects with Ohio
In an amicus brief, Crossman and co-counsel Marc Dann argue there’s a “striking similarity” between the procedures in California and Ohio. They argue both arrangements allow the state to systematically take private property without adequate notice.
In California, if attempts at contact fail, the state gets the money and then officials run generic newspaper ads. The state also maintains a website where claimants can search for property. For unclaimed property worth less than $50, officials don’t have to contact owners ahead of transfer at all. Even if Ohio lawmakers set aside $1 million for additional outreach, Crossman and Dann argue Ohio’s law doesn’t require directly contacting property owners before taking possession of their unclaimed funds.
“This lack of individualized notice mirrors California’s deficient procedures,” they argued, adding it violates existing precedents “for notice that is reasonably calculated to reach affected parties.”
Crossman and Dann insisted the Peters case isn’t an isolated incident, but rather “a growing trend among states, including Ohio, to exploit unclaimed property laws for revenue.”
Still, there are notable differences between Ohio’s new statute and the process in California.
Because officials in California will repay valid claims in perpetuity, its seizure of unclaimed funds amounts to something more like a loan. California gets the benefit of those dollars without having to pay interest, and rightful owners lose out on their asset’s appreciation, but the money doesn’t just disappear.
That looks more like the prior transfers Ohio has made from unclaimed funds to the state general fund. State lawmakers got to use the money, but the expenditures didn’t change Ohio’s obligation to pay valid claims.
Lawmakers backing the stadium plan pointed to those earlier transfers to justify the new program, but the new program operates differently. After a ten-year grace period, the money transferred to the new sports and cultural facilities fund really does pass into state possession, and property owners can’t get it back.
With that prospect looming, Crossman and Dann told the justices, “this court’s intervention is critically necessary to establish clear standards for notice and compensation in unclaimed property schemes, protecting millions of Americans from unconstitutional deprivations.”

(Getty Images)Our kids can’t get enough of their old time summer camp here in southern New Hampshire. There’s swimming and boating, games and pranks, popsicles galore, and a talent show to boot. Best of all, the whole thing takes place in the great outdoors where kids belong, especially in summer. Or do they?

Over the course of last week at summer camp, I noticed something peculiar about our 6-year-old son. While my wife and I and his two older siblings were fine, and everybody else we had been around for weeks had seemed healthy too, he was developing a cough. In fact, his hacking was bothersome enough that he didn’t want to eat and had trouble falling asleep. He even asked to stay home from camp.
Reading the news the next day, I came across a headline that took my breath away: “Wildfire smoke is like smoking ‘half a pack a day.’” The article noted that when the Air Quality Index (AQI) reaches 100-200, people are exposed to as much air pollution as smoking between five and 10 cigarettes a day. (AQI is the government’s official measure of smog and fine particle pollution from wildfires, power plants, vehicles, and the like.)
I promptly checked the stats for our part of southern New Hampshire and was shocked to learn that on two consecutive days last week, the AQI had reached 117 and 113. It came with the warning “unhealthy for sensitive groups”. A review of the American Lung Association’s air quality website provided some helpful context: when AQI is between 101-150, it said, “Children, active adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion.” The website said even an AQI of 50 — the lowest level recorded in the area last week — can be damaging for people in sensitive groups, especially kids whose developing airways are small and who naturally spend more active time outdoors.
To back up these claims, the American Lung Association pointed me to a raft of scientific research on the dangers of outdoor air pollution, much of it published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the first Trump administration. In case I doubted the gravity of the matter, the research showed that around 350,000 Americans die each year from fine particle pollution (PM2.5) in the air caused by burning fossil fuels. What’s more, each incremental increase of 50 AQI (corresponding to roughly 10 micrograms of PM2.5) raised the risk of respiratory infections in children by 11% and overall cancer by 22%. Talk about a suffocating set of studies!
Yes, I had seen the hazy skies while driving to and from work last week and was aware that another year of record wildfires in Canada was to blame, according to WMUR. In fact, I had been shocked that on my return drive west on Route 101 early in the week, when my weather app said there was not a cloud in the sky, the normally blinding afternoon sun looked more like the moon on a clear night. But habits are hard to break, and clean air is just one of those things I’ve always taken for granted since growing up in New Hampshire. I couldn’t imagine a bit of haze getting in the way of my kids’ summer outdoors — until that darn cough and the headline about smoking.
As it happens, our family’s experience was hardly unique. As WMUR also reported, local doctors were seeing “double the normal number of patients with respiratory issues” last week and recommending people limit time outdoors, wear a mask, and use indoor air purifiers. Another doctor reported seeing “patients without any risk factors who are coughing and wheezing.”
It would appear that my vision of how a New Hampshire summer should be is sadly out of date. While air quality here is still better than many parts of the country, healthy air is no longer a fact of life in the age of fossil fueled climate damage causing record heat and drought — the recipe for worsening wildfires, according to NASA. What’s more, recent events in Washington are all but guaranteed to make matters worse.
Last month, at President Trump’s command, Republicans in Congress overcame bipartisan opposition and narrowly passed the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” In addition to making the richest Americans richer by an average $13,600 a year and the poorest Americans poorer by an average $1,200 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the bill is a stunning success for the largest emitters of deadly air pollution.
Fossil fuel companies, which generate 85 percent of airborne fine particle pollution and almost all sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions worldwide, are winning big in Washington. Centuries after the U.S. government first began subsidizing fossil fuels in 1789, the oil, coal, and gas industries received substantial additional tax breaks and incentives under the new law. According to recent analysis by the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, the cost of these changes adds up to billions more dollars in taxpayer subsidies through lost royalties and bid revenue, delayed methane pollution fees, and expanded direct tax breaks for fossil fuel corporations — part of the bill’s overall contribution of up to $6 trillion in federal debt.
In stark contrast, the “Big Beautiful Bill” effectively ends recent federal supports for wind, solar, electric vehicles, and energy-efficient buildings, the primary tool Americans have for reducing air pollution while maintaining our quality of life. By radically reducing the growth of wind and solar, which became the cheapest sources of energy in 2017 and provided 93% of new electricity generation capacity last year, the law is projected to increase wholesale electricity rates by 74% in 2035. For individual families, that means hundreds more dollars in household electricity bills in the coming years. For the economy as a whole, it means $980 billion in lost GDP and 760,000 lost jobs. All told, the 340 gigawatts of lost power generation also means America will face a major strategic setback in the AI race with China, a defining security threat in the 21st century.
Whether you’re sentimental about summer camp or concerned about energy costs or just want to keep your kids safe, I think we can all agree that current policies in Washington and Concord aren’t cutting it. If the party in power won’t stand up against big polluters, let’s hope the people will.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/smokestacksaq-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 05:56:20.650519

Speech therapist Anne Marie Carey sits on the rug at Galvin Therapy Center west of Cleveland, Ohio with toddler Ryin Johnson holding a tablet while she places a bright plastic ring on a rod.
“I have some more,” Carey says to the 2 1/2 year old, picking up another ring. “Should we put it on? I’m gonna do it with you.”
She takes Ryin’s hand and presses a finger to the tablet so a recorded voice says “More,” before adding the second ring to the cone.
“More!” Carey calls out. “I got more. Yay!”
This activity is more than just a game. Ryin has autism and is nonverbal, so he also receives behavioral therapy. His attention often drifts as he and Carey interact.
But the tablet, once Ryin can use it himself, is a tool that may unlock his ability to communicate and learn when he starts preschool in the fall. It might even help him eventually speak.
“Right now it’s still pretty early on,” said his mother Deanna Szente, a delivery driver from Avon Lake, Ohio. “Because he’s two and a half, we’re having high hopes, but they are preparing him… if he does not.” 

  Deanna Szente is thankful Medicaid pays for her son Ryin’s behavior and speech therapy, but worries if she can keep coverage for him and what will happen to other children if recent cuts to Medicaid remain. (Photo by Patrick O’Donnell, The 74)
Ryin’s therapies, tablet and the TouchChat program are all funded by Medicaid — and examples of how the government program, a major source of health care for low-income families, also supports children’s ability to learn and do well in school.
Medicaid also covers such school-related items as eyeglasses, hearing aids, and microphones for teachers to use to communicate with children with hearing difficulties.
Other devices and care, such as inhalers for asthma and dental coverage provided by Medicaid help make sure kids don’t miss school and add to the chronic absenteeism problems hurting kids academically.
But Medicaid faces massive cuts starting in 2027 as part of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” Cuts to Medicaid and to the accompanying Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) will likely total about a trillion dollars over the next 10 years, according to estimates.
Backers of Trump’s bill say it is much-needed welfare reform that will keep people on Medicaid who really need it, while kicking off those that don’t and can work to have insurance.They also stress that students with disabilities like Ryin are not targets of the cuts.


 Medicaid Cuts in Trump Tax Bill Spark Fears for Child Health, School Services



But how the cuts will affect Ryin and other young children is still unclear: The impact will vary by state, since each has its own version of Medicaid, with different rules for eligibility and benefits, and each state contributing different amounts of money. Differences are so great that a family of four qualifies in some states earning less than $45,300 a year, while other states allow annual income of more than $96,000.
As Medicaid dollars shrink and as rules shift and grow more complicated, child advocates worry students like Ryin are more likely to slip through the cracks and miss out on interventions that are crucial to their ability to learn. They also worry the Trump administration’s removal of some backstops that keep kids on Medicaid even as parents bounce on and off it create additional danger for children.
All of which filters down to how well kids can do in the classroom.
“If the cuts are coming and if kids lose services, it can be very impactful on their learning,“ said Patricia Endley, president of the National Association of School Nurses.
Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families researchers also raised concerns about students losing coverage and medical care that helps them in school. The center pointed to multiple studies showing students read better if they qualify for Medicaid or even if parents have Medicaid coverage that reduces family stress and frees up income.
Other studies show students covered by Medicaid have higher graduation rates and adult earnings than those that go without health coverage, Georgetown officials report.


 Analysis: How Medicaid Can Help Schools Support Students’ Mental Health



Elisabeth Burak, senior fellow at the Georgetown center, worries that as rules change and grow more confusing, parents might not enroll their children or let coverage expire.
“We know that a lot of these kids will roll on and off of coverage,” Burak said.
“They might have been enrolled for a little bit of time at some point during the year, but they dropped off because the mail didn’t reach them, or there was paperwork that their parents didn’t know about, or maybe their parent might have lost coverage and that somehow the renewal paperwork didn’t get to them,” she said.
Beyond just the common-sense idea that healthier kids do better in school or life, researchers and advocates identified several tangible ways student learning could be hurt if students lose coverage:

Kids might miss out on early screening that catches disabilities before reaching school age. While Ryin might keep Medicaid because of his disability, being eligible for Medicaid allowed him to get checkups that identified his autism and allowed him to start treatment before preschool.

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThough school district preschools can catch students’ disabilities, church-based or private preschools might not. Parents may need private therapy for their children.
“We have a lot of preschoolers… who attend community preschool or no preschool, and who come to our place for help,” said Carey, Ryin’s speech therapist. “Parents notice something’s not clicking…and they come here.”

Children might have to wait until school for vision tests and might not ever afford eyeglasses. In addition, students may not have hearing aids to absorb words and language patterns.

“They’re going to have difficulty learning those important speech sounds and strategies to be able to follow classroom conversations,” said Caroline Bergner, director of health care policy for Medicaid for the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

 Children may not have inhalers so they can deal with asthma in the classroom. Researchers have found asthma to be a major cause of students missing school – nearly 13 million school days a year nationally — and of students having to repeat grades.

That’s all on top of family disruptions and stress if kids keep Medicaid but parents lose it under the new rules.
Endsley also worries about students struggling if they lose dental care.
“You might say, ‘well, what does your teeth have to do with learning?’ ” she said. “Well, if you have an impacted tooth, or if you’re having tooth pain, you absolutely cannot learn… if you’re sick or if you have a chronic disease… Having access to daily medications keeps kids in school. It really is all interconnected.”
Defenders of the bill say opponents are being overly dramatic, noting that benefits for disabled children are not being directly cut. Well-publicized requirements that adults work in order to keep coverage don’t apply to parents since they don’t kick in until children turn 19. And they say the cuts make Medicaid sustainable by trimming people that don’t need it.
Others, including Cato Institute researcher Michael Cannon, argue that limiting Medicaid’s growth is necessary for the federal budget.
“When Republicans propose that Medicaid grow at 3% annually instead of 4.5%, Democrats suddenly act like cutting waste means everyone will die,” he wrote.
Even child care advocates worried about the plan can’t say which children would lose coverage or how many and when.
They instead see risks in the confusion of shifting rules that states – and parents – will have to watch carefully.
A big reason is that Medicaid eligibility isn’t the same for children and adults, so children can still keep coverage even if parents start earning more money and lose their coverage. Parents may not realize that and let their children’s coverage lapse.
Endsley, who worked as a school nurse in Maine, said parents often don’t know how to apply for Medicaid for their kids.
“They’ll say, ‘Well, yeah, I just can’t figure it out’,” she said. “So sometimes a school nurse will help them navigate through the process, or refer them to an insurance navigator. I’ve even made a home visit to help a parent who didn’t have a computer work out the forms.“
“The whole system application process can be complicated, and what I see is kids slipping through the cracks,” she said.
There are some existing safety nets to prevent kids bouncing on and off coverage: Children keep coverage for a full year each time their eligibility is approved. Eight states — Colorado, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington — went further the last few years and extended that “continuous coverage” for young children until they turn 3 or 6 to create more stability.
But the Trump administration announced July 17 it would no longer let states extend coverage beyond a year.
Bruak called that decision a “kicker” on top of the cuts.
“That could really impact the stability of family and kids coverage,” she said.
Meanwhile, Szente is talking regularly with child care advocates to stay on top of changes so she can do what it takes to keep all three of her children covered.
“I’m terrified,” Szente said. “I’m scared for when my son gets older, what we’re going to have to do to be able to make sure that he can go see a doctor. And I’m scared for my older two, if I’m still going to be able to provide Medicaid for them.”

(Eric Thomas for Kansas Reflector)As students arrive on campus this week and classes start next week, Kansas universities and colleges still tremble under challenges they have faced during my decade-plus on campus, particularly the racial justice protests during 2020 and COVID-19 lockdowns around the same time. 
This academic year, however, feels even bigger.
When someone asks how morale is on campus, my chest tightens as I recite this list:
The federal withdrawal of university research funding.

February’s news seemed wonky when it broke. How much could a changed formula for federal medical research funding affect universities? The answer from universities: This funding means everything, especially when those funding cuts were followed by more. Longstanding research funds — revenue that fuels universities — disappeared. For decades, the marriage between universities and the federal government had been good for both sides, economics writer Binyamin Appelbaum said last week: “The universities grow and prosper … and the government derives huge benefits from the research that they’re doing.”
At KU, the top two sources for federally funded research in 2024 were the Department of Health and Human Services (including NIH) at No. 1 and the National Science Foundation at No. 2. During fiscal year 2024, those entities poured more than $181 million into KU.

Distrust of the value of college, particularly the value of student loans.

Ten years ago, a healthy majority of Americans reported having a “Great deal/Quite a lot” of confidence in higher education. By last year, that number slid to a low of 36 percent. (It rebounded slightly this year.) This shaken confidence has many causes. In particular, Americans might be reacting to journalism showing that graduates with student loans are particularly imperiled when compared to people who elect to not attend college. 

A falloff in the number of potential college students.

Educators obsess about birth rates because they predict future enrollment. When birth rates fell during the financial crisis beginning in 2008, schools knew a disruption was coming. Many news reports call this birth rate drop a “demographic cliff.” But this undersells the crisis. A cliff has a floor. This demographic trend doesn’t show signs of stopping: Birth rates keep falling, making schools increasingly worried about tuition-paying students in the future.

International students leaving American universities.

One projection last month estimates that Kansas will lose more than $37 million in revenue this year as international students steer away from enrolling in American schools. The Trump administration earns the blame here, as its policies have blocked students from admission to Ivy League universities — and international students have considered that as their cue to avoid college in the United States altogether. Losses nationwide could reach almost $7 trillion. 

The roiling political atmosphere on many campuses.

This final point seeks to boil down quite a stew. It includes President Donald Trump’s attacks on universities, the federal government’s investigation into consideration of race during admission, settlements over antisemitic actions on campuses, arrests of pro-Palestinian students, restrictions on transgender students and the downsizing or elimination of multicultural supports on campus. Seen from many different political vantage points, college can look less inviting.   

In a public announcement and university email last week, campus leaders summed it up: “We are again navigating an uncertain fiscal environment because of external factors, such as disruptions to federal funding, changes in federal law, stagnant state funding, rising costs, changes in international enrollments, and a projected nationwide decline in college enrollment.”
The email continues, saying that in fiscal year 2027, KU “must reduce annual spending at KU Lawrence and Edwards by $32 million dollars.”
Some observers claim that the chickens have come home to roost: Postsecondary education, they will say, has ignored the values of the American middle class and political center and right for too long.
Defenders of universities say that many of these forces are beyond the control of a university president, let alone an adjunct professor.
Regardless, this academic year will be an inflection point. Ten years from now, educational historians will look back on the 2025-2026 academic year as the moment when universities rose to the challenge, the year they revitalized — or the year they caved.
On Tuesday, I will teach my first classes of the semester on campus, standing in front of more than 400 students in KU’s Budig Hall. I considered teaching the class as I have done six semesters before: an overview of the course, an opportunity for student questions and some pictures of my dog.
This year demands something different.
So, we will talk about what it’s like to express yourself on campus these days. About the number of students who feel scared to voice their convictions. About the current academic constipation that bores many students.
It’s a lesson that I normally save until later in the semester, but I don’t think it can wait. The start of school this year just feels too urgent to delay.
Most college students know the feeling of realizing too late in the semester that their grade has sunk too far to rescue. How can I earn an A? How can I manage a B-? Or, How can I pass?
Let’s hope that we in higher education — researchers, administrators, instructors, staff and professors — haven’t waited too long to pass this year’s vital test.
Because the final exam is coming.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.
One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
 States in a ‘very, very strong position’

Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXHe said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
 A ‘substantial headache’

Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.
New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

(Getty Images)I was born and raised in Omaha and got my start in health care when I was just 16, working as a Certified Nursing Assistant at Methodist Hospital.
Back then, I didn’t fully grasp how special Nebraska’s health care system was. Our state is built on people looking out for one another. Whether it’s a big hospital in Omaha or a small clinic in a town of 200, we’ve always believed that everyone deserves good, reliable care — no matter where they live.
That belief is now under serious threat.
The newly passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act has a name that sounds cheerful — yet its effects on Nebraska’s health care system are anything but. Over the next decade, this bill will cut about $6.5 billion in federal Medicaid funding to our state.
As a result, more than 78,000 Nebraskans — including kids — will lose their health coverage. These harmful cuts aren’t happening in a vacuum. They’re part of a trade-off, in which health care for vulnerable Nebraskans is sacrificed to fund tax breaks for the rich.
This isn’t about numbers on a spreadsheet. It’s about families who will no longer be able to take their child to the doctor when they’re sick, seniors struggling to afford their nursing home, new moms being left without nearby maternity care, and about communities that will be left without any care at all.
However, the ripple effects don’t stop at the clinic door. These cuts will cause about 5,000 jobs to be lost and slash $28 million annually in state tax revenue, successfully shrinking our state’s economy.
In addition, the bill cuts $322 million from food assistance (SNAP), putting 155,000 Nebraskans — including 64,000 kids — at greater risk of hunger. More than 70 percent of counties in Nebraska will struggle with food access. The hardest hit will be our rural communities.
Just hours after the bill passed, Curtis Medical Center announced it would shut down because of these funding cuts. Two more hospitals, Avera Creighton Hospital and Ogallala Community Hospital, are now at high risk of closing, with three more hospitals not far behind.
Yet, this isn’t surprising. In the last two years, one in five Nebraska hospitals has already eliminated key services like labor and delivery units, hospital-owned nursing homes and behavioral health, home health, hospice, and EMS services. These cuts put an already strained health system at great risk.
While the bill includes a new rural health fund, it’s simply not enough to offset this damage. A short-term grant doesn’t replace the steady, reliable funding that keeps small hospitals afloat.
This matters deeply for Nebraska. Most don’t realize how rural our state really is: nearly 7 in 10 hospitals are rural. And many Nebraskans already live far from care. Fourteen counties do not have a primary care doctor. Nearly one in six moms drive at least half an hour to find maternity care — double the national average.
And when hospitals close, it’s not just about longer drives — it’s about longer wait times for ambulances, more crowded emergency rooms and real danger when minutes matter.
Imagine calling 911 because you’re having a stroke and being told the nearest ambulance is 45 minutes away. For Nebraskans living in rural communities, this hypothetical scenario could become a reality if hospitals continue to shut their doors.
This bill threatens the foundation of Nebraska’s health care, not just facilities, but the people and values that keep our communities strong. I am proud to be raised in Nebraska, a place where people look out for each other, especially when times are tough. But with this bill, we’re turning our backs on that tradition — stripping away health care from those who need it most and handing out more to those who already have enough.
Growing up in Nebraska, I have always believed that where you live shouldn’t determine whether you live. If we let this legislation stand and don’t speak up, we’re beginning to turn our backs on that promise — and on the families and communities that built this state.
Nebraskans show up for each other when it counts. Let’s not change that now. I’m reaching out to my representatives to remind them that the “the good life” includes not only a great quality of life, good jobs and overall well-being, but care for all. I hope you’ll join me. Together, our voices are stronger.

(Photo by Stephanie Keith/Getty Images)The Minnesota State Board of Investment is a relatively unknown state agency with a critical role for Minnesotans: managing over $146 billion in assets including public employee retirement plans. Its board members include Gov. Tim Walz, State Auditor Julie Blaha, Secretary of State Steve Simon, and Attorney General Keith Ellison.
The State Board of Investment pledges to “consider all material risks and opportunities” including those from climate change and the energy transition, according to Minnesota’s Climate Roadmap.
That’s why the board should take a close look at the implications of its investments in Energy Capital Partners, which is currently seeking an additional $250 million investment from the state.
This is concerning because while Energy Capital Partners claims to have a focus on “sustainability infrastructure providing reliable, affordable, and clean energy,” it is in the process of purchasing the General James M. Gavin coal-fired power plant. Gavin is a 50-year-old coal plant in southeastern Ohio and is one of the most deadly power plants in the nation in terms of health effects due to air pollution with a history of public health and environmental violations.
The Gavin power plant represents risks to its owners due to ongoing litigation regarding expensive toxic coal ash cleanup requirements, the plant’s high debt burden, and the unstable future for coal, not to mention the reputational risks associated with owning a power plant that has been associated with over 200 premature deaths per year and $1.7 billion in costs associated with health problems from the plant’s pollution.
The Gavin coal plant is the single biggest contributor to Energy Capital Partners’ health impacts. According to research released this summer, emissions from Energy Capital Partner’s assets nationally are estimated to cause between $1.8 and $3.3 billion in costs related to health impacts each year. The emissions are estimated to cause 62,000 asthma incidents, 130 emergency room visits, 11,000 lost work days, $15,000 lost school days, and over 200 premature deaths.
Minnesota should not rely on returns from an out-of-state power plant that causes the premature deaths of hundreds of people each year to fund the retirement of state employees.
The Minnesota State Board of Investment has an opportunity to collaborate with Energy Capital Partners to insist on a thoughtful retirement plan for the Gavin coal plant. This would be a positive result for the environment, public health, and Minnesota public pensioners.

Conservative judges might allow lawmakers to reinstate the practice of conversion therapy, which aims to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Week after week, a teenage Brandon Long sat through counseling sessions that he said framed his identity as a failure.
Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy, and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association, and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide, and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.
In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
 ‘The world has changed’

While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.
Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
 Free speech argument

Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully, and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor, or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
 A Republican loss

In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

Since its founding in 1965, Head Start has served more than 39 million children. And it has been supported by every president, Republican and Democrat alike. Choosing to deny immigrant families — including DACA recipients and families with mixed immigration statuses — is not only heartbreaking, it is a betrayal of everything the program has stood for.
As a mother, lifelong educator, and director of an early childhood program in New Haven, I see every day how essential high-quality, reliable child care is — and just how unaffordable it remains for far too many families. In Connecticut, child care often costs more than housing. Across the country, care eats up more than a quarter of household income. And, nearly 40% of parents who have reduced hours or left the workforce say the lack of affordable child care was a factor in this tough decision.
And now, by reclassifying Head Start as a “federal public benefit,” the federal government is proposing to cut off access for immigrant families — a cruel and shortsighted move that will force families to choose between working and caring for their children. That’s not a real choice. It’s an impossible bind.
And while this decision is devastating, there’s a powerful counter-story unfolding: While federal policymakers walk away from families, Connecticut is leading. 
A coalition of community, early education and public sector leaders, led by Child Care for CT and chaired by Friends Center for Children, for years has worked together to advocate for investments in Connecticut’s early care and education system. And this year, our state passed one of the boldest early childhood investments in the country — a $860 million Early Childhood Education Endowment that will eliminate child care costs for families earning under $100,000, cap costs at 7% of income for higher earners, expand access by 16,000 slots, and achieve pay parity with public school teachers for early educators for those in the state-funded system. This is what real leadership looks like: bold, compassionate, and focused on solutions that work for everyone.
If years of advocacy have taught us anything, it’s that real change takes all of us. Here in Connecticut, it’s taken a coalition of community, early education and public sector leaders to show what’s possible. But lasting progress depends on federal leaders stepping up, not stepping back.
If we let this decision stand, we make it normal to be a country where care is conditional — where a child’s future depends not on their potential, but on their paperwork. That’s not the America I believe in. — and not the country we should be building for our children.
Connecticut has proven that transformational changes, even in this moment in time, are still possible. In the face of federal retreat, we chose to lead. Now, let’s meet this moment again — with courage, compassion, and action.

Section 2 of the order states that, “The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall take appropriate action to: (i) seek, in appropriate cases, the reversal of Federal or State judicial precedents and the termination of consent decrees that impede the United States’ policy of encouraging civil commitment of individuals with mental illness…”
The executive order contains numerous false and misleading assertions about people who are unhoused and may be experiencing mental health conditions or substance-use disorders. I encourage everyone to read the statements of the National Civil Rights Network (NDRN), and the National Association for Mental Illness (NAMI Statement on Executive Order Targeting Homelessness and Criminalizing Mental Illness | National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)). The NDRN reminds us that “Americans have due process protections before the government can take away their liberty and confine them in a psychiatric hospital … Protections against inappropriate commitment are critical.” 
While NAMI declares that “Mental illness is not a crime, and people with mental illness deserve to be treated as human beings, with dignity and respect. … We should be investing in supportive housing and other wrap-around services.”
America’s streets are the domain of local and state governments. Our nation is a federal system wherein powers not specifically given to the federal government or denied to the states by the Constitution are retained by the states. Civil commitment is not one of the few powers given to the federal government and civil commitment of individuals with mental illness is not the policy of the State of Connecticut. 
Section 17a-498 of the Connecticut General Statutes specifies the due process for civil commitment and the rights of individuals including the right to counsel, the right to a hearing, and the right to a hearing annually thereafter if “the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent has psychiatric disabilities and is dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled, [and makes] an order for his or her commitment, considering whether or not a less restrictive placement is available.”
The federal government has no authority to reverse state statutes or state judicial precedents. In the words of Roger Sherman, Connecticut “shall forever be and remain a free, sovereign and independent State … under the sole authority of the People thereof, independent of any King or Prince whatever.”
We must resist federal interference in our work to support the people who are unhoused, the people who are experiencing mental health conditions, and the people with substance use disorders here in Connecticut.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-15 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The unofficial guide to your first official election,Milannia Martin-Hayes,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/15/the-unofficial-guide-to-your-first-official-ct-election/,"I was in danger of becoming another statistic, the young voter who doesn’t show up, so I made myself a plan.","“The election to end all elections!” “The fight for the very soul of our democracy!” My first presidential election was not going as planned. One candidate dropped out, replaced by another making history, and the other candidate… there’s not a nice way to put it — promised to be a dictator. 
Not only that, I had just begun college half-way across the country. I hate to admit it but the election was the last thing on my mind. I was in danger of becoming another statistic, the young voter that doesn’t show up, despite our futures being on the line in these elections.


But who can blame us? Politics is so overwhelming that it reduces political action. Worse than that: none of this was covered in school. No one ever taught me how to vote. They taught me when and why I should vote, never how.
I knew voting is important to me but not how to get started. After learning voters that create plans of action are more likely to turn out, I made my own plan, which turned into this guide to help my peers – you – show up. This voting guide for all new adults who feel just as lost as me, burdened with saving our futures but unsure where to start. And don’t forget – Connecticut has important municipal elections coming up this fall!
The first part of any effective voting plan is registering to vote or checking your status. Voters must update their registration if they move to a new address or change names. You should always check your registration status prior to election day because your polling place may have changed or your registration may have been deactivated.

Next, you must decide when and how you will vote. I gathered some friends as accountability partners to ensure we all voted by mail in our home states. Several states, including Connecticut, have early voting and election day voting options available. Since election day always falls on a Tuesday, this is good for students that attend school far away or people who can’t take off work. Early voting options might include in-person or mail-in ballots. Connecticut residents can now vote early, beginning 15 days prior to the election until two days prior. 
If you choose election day voting, it’s important that you double-check your polling site and its open hours prior to voting. Polling places may change over time but you can only vote at your assigned location. It may be easier to vote early in the day but if you find yourself in line when the polling site closes, DO NOT GET OUT OF LINE! It is your right to cast a ballot if you are in line when the poll site closes. Don’t forget to bring a valid identification card or proof of your address.
After creating your plan, research the candidates and issues on your ballot to create a voting guide. There are tons of non-partisan organizations that will create a guide for the issues and positions on the ballot in your next election. To find a candidate’s political stances, look at their campaign websites. Just like 38% of young voters, I didn’t feel fully represented by either of the major political parties. To choose candidates, I focused on the top three issues important to me. From there, I chose the one with the most policies I agreed with. 
Researching this can be overwhelming and time consuming, so I hosted a party with my friends. Each of us researched a candidate’s platform and presented them to the rest of the group. All of the information found and decisions made on who to vote for were put into a spreadsheet that we referenced while completing our ballots.
When election day comes, put your plan into action! If you have accountability partners, check in with everyone to ensure they have all the information and documents needed to cast their ballot. Don’t forget your voter guide! If voting by mail, make sure to check your state’s deadlines and cast your ballot in advance. 
The most important part of an effective voting plan: take care of yourself after voting. Election self-care can look differently for everyone. During the 2024 election, my self-care looked like avoiding any election news until the official results had come in. For my friends, it meant watching the election map as ballots were counted. 
Even after results are in, it is important to keep yourself engaged in politics. This could include monitoring your representatives to ensure they carry out their election promises, volunteering for your organizations that support your policy interests, and, most importantly, maintaining a habit of voting, even in midterm and local elections.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)What started as a discussion on the various arms of immigration enforcement nearly spiraled into a shouting match Thursday as advocates and some elected officials pleaded with a federal agent to “be kinder” when interacting with the immigration community.
“Your agents are terrorizing our communities,” said Baltimore City Councilmember Odette Ramos, “What you are doing is racial profiling.”
Ramos was addressing Nikita Baker, director of the Baltimore Field Office with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), who was part of a panel on immigration and deportation policy at the Maryland Association of Counties conference in Ocean City.
The panel, called “Clearing the Air on Immigration: Compliance Standards for Local Governments,” aimed to help officials understand the various cogs of the immigration system, as President Donald Trump (R) has been pushing ICE agents to increase deportation efforts.
Some local and state officials have expressed confusion on what is required of them regarding immigration enforcement, as many officials are looking to protect as many people in the immigrant community as possible.
In rush for immigration arrests, a shift by ICE to ‘incredibly aggressive’ tactics, advocates say

The panel heard from Warden Daniel Galbraith of the Harford County Detention Center, which has  287(g) agreement with the federal government to help facilitate detainment processes. The panel also included Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), who talked about her bill that prompted the the attorney general to issue guidance for how “sensitive locations,” such as schools and churche,s should comply with ICE agents; and Julia Cortina of the National Association of Counties, who discussed federal court cases and policies NACo is watching to help county officials comply with federal immigration enforcement.
But when it came to the question-and-answer session, all questions were directed at Baker.
Ramos’ question lasted four minutes and raised concerns about how ICE agents were conducting business in her jurisdiction, including conditions in ICE detention facilities, frustrations about ICE agents wearing masks and detaining people from common community spaces such as grocery stores.
“Why is it that the agents are operating in this manner, very violent, picking up our people … masked and not identifying yourself?” she asked. “It is really abhorrent that this is happening.”
“I am asking you to resist. I am asking you to stop doing this,” Ramos said, to applause from the audience.
Baker said her ICE agents are identifiable.
“All my officers clearly are identified. They all wear their vests … they all have their badges on them, they all wear body cameras, so they are readily identifiable,” she said. “As far as masks go, some of our officers wear them, some of them do not.”
“All of them do,” Ramos interjected, as other audience member chimed in, asking, “Why are they wearing them?” and, “Do you want to see videos?”
At that point, Del. Ashanti Martinez (D-Prince George’s), who was moderating the panel, stepped in and reminded the room to remain respectful.
“There’s a lot of emotions. There should be – this is about our neighbors and our communities, right?” he said. “That’s why we’re in Ocean City to talk about these things – we’re not just here for the beach.
“But in order to get these conversations out, we’ve got to listen to each other, even if you don’t like what you’re hearing,” he said, passing the question on to the next person. Ramos then left the room.

Prince George’s County Councilmember Eric Olson asked how ICE agents are supposed to operate in school settings. He said agents gather near schools, making families nervous.
“What’s the legitimate law enforcement activity going on there?” he asked. “Because to me, it certainly seems like intimidation … and harassment. People are afraid to go to school.”
Baker said that officers may hang around a school because they are looking for someone that is nearby.
“I have no issue with them trying to catch somebody in the area, but we’re not there to scare parents from taking their kids to school,” she said.
Ninfa Amador-Hernandez, policy manager with immigration advocacy group CASA, asked for justification on why some individuals without criminal histories were targeted by ICE. She listed high-profile cases such as Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was arrested by ICE agents in Maryland earlier this year and wrongfully deported to El Salvador due to what the Trump administration admits was an “administrative error.”
“We keep seeing individuals like them getting swept off our streets,” Amador-Hernandez said. “How will you ensure … to not engage in indiscriminate family separation with no clear-cut enforcement priorities, since that is something that the (Trump) administration has not done?”
Baker said her agents can into custody, “Anybody who is here, unlawfully present” but that they focus “on taking in the worst first. And then while I am doing those enforcement actions, and I come across somebody that is not a criminal … but they’re here illegally, they have no status, I am going to take those individuals into custody.”
“But you’re taking people with status,” Ninfa said.
Baker tried to say ICE is not detaining people who have legal status to be present in the U.S., but the audience started to get riled up again, making snide remarks about her reply. Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Montgomery) stepped up to ask a question before tensions boiled over.

“I know this is not easy,” she said to Baker. “I thank you for being here, knowing what the room feels like. I am going to speak with you heart to heart, in a humane way.
“I know you have to do your job, but do you have to do it in a manner where windows are broken in a car, where they’re doing it in front of small children that are in a car seat?” she asked.
“Can you tell your officers to be humane? Be respectful? Because we are lacking empathy right now in this country,” Peña-Melnyk said. “Can you at least go back to your office and tell them to be kinder? Can you do that?”
“My job is to enforce the law,” Baker responded. “But I understand where you’re coming from, and I appreciate your feedback.”

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.

Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

	One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.

That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.

Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.




We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw



New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

The Charlotte-based utility said in its announcement that such a merger would save customers even more than the $1 billion in savings it has seen in the 13 years since Duke Energy merged with Raleigh-based Progress Energy. The company also called the proposal a “reorganization” in its announcement, but it is legally a merger.
The two companies have nearly 5 million customers across North and South Carolina with Duke Energy Progress covering the Raleigh area and eastern North Carolina, while Duke Carolinas covers Charlotte and western North Carolina.
Duke’s target date for the merger is Jan. 1, 2027. But the deal needs the approval of the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
There will be no immediate changes to retail rates for customers, Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO of Duke Energy Carolinas, said in a statement.
Future rate changes will be subject to regulatory approval, with both North and South Carolina regulators deciding rate cases separately.
According to Duke, streamlining operations will allow for more than $1 billion in savings for retail customers between Jan. 1, 2027 and 2038.
Duke Energy is one of America’s largest energy holding companies with a market value is $97.4 billion.

(Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)Alaskans are planning demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine across the state, ahead of the meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war in Ukraine. 
Trump and Putin are expected to meet at the Anchorage military base, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, at 11:30 a.m. on Friday. The two leaders then plan to hold a joint news conference following the meeting, which was confirmed by both the White House and the Kremlin, according to the political news outlet The Hill. 
At least 16 protest events are scheduled to take place across Alaska from Thursday through Saturday, protesting the meeting and demonstrating solidarity with Ukraine, from Fairbanks to Kodiak to Ketchikan.    

  At least 16 events are planned in 15 communities across Alaska to show solidarity for Ukraine, as Trump and Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage on August 15, 2025 (Screenshot of map via marchagainst.org)
 

Nicole Collins is an organizer with the group Ketchikan Mayday for Democracy, which is planning a vigil on Thursday evening to show support for Ukraine.  
“First and foremost, our goal is to communicate solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Ukraine, to let them know that we all watched in horror as Ukraine was invaded over three years ago now,”  she said in an interview. “Even though we’re on this island in Southeast Alaska, we are members of the human race, and we’re all part of this world, and we want them to know that we see them and we stand with them.”
Collins said the group started monthly protests in the spring, when members watched a meeting between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 
“The majority of us felt like something wasn’t right,” she said, and community members have come together since to show support for Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine.
The Thursday event is also to express outrage for the president’s invitation and welcome to Putin, she said. “Our secondary goal would be to show that we just have this utter disgust in a war criminal stepping foot on our precious Alaskan soil, our U.S. soil, and that we have great concerns over the fact that our president shows every sign of admiration towards this war criminal dictator that’s coming from Russia,” she said.
Putin has been widely condemned internationally for the invasion of Ukraine, where tens of thousands of people have been killed since 2022. More than 6.9 million Ukrainians have been displaced, and more than 13,000 civilians killed, according to the United Nations, which says the true number is likely far higher. Over 1 million Russians have been killed or injured. 
The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin related to war crimes. He risks being arrested if he travels to any of the 125 member states, which has impacted his ability to travel. 
“This is far beyond left and right now, it’s about right and wrong,” Collins said. “And we feel like we have to speak out. We have to show our support for democracy and for decency, for honesty, for unity, not division.”
This will be the first in-person meeting between Trump and Putin since the war began. 
Trump announced the meeting in Alaska last Friday, amid high-stakes negotiations around a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, but the president has not provided details on what a long-term deal would look like. Zelenskyy was not invited. 
Riza Smith, an organizer based in Anchorage who served in the Air Force at JBER, said it feels like an about face for Alaska to welcome Putin.
“If Russia decides to, you know, escalate things against the U.S., we’re right nearby. If Russia decided, ‘Hey, we want this portion of land,’ or, ‘Hey, we want these resources,’ or something, we’re right nearby. So I think it impacts a lot of people a lot more strongly, especially for the military,” they said. 
Various branches of the U.S. military in Alaska conduct regular exercises, as part of homeland security efforts, including patrols of the airspace and maritime border with Russia. Currently the U.S. Northern Command is conducting military drills known as Arctic Edge throughout the state. 
“(For) the past 20 years, we’ve been dealing with intercept flights,” Smith said. “That’s affected our military for years. So it’s a little confusing, since about like 2015, when that kind of escalated, to see like a complete nonrecognition of them.”
In addition to protesting Putin, Smith said the planned protest actions are also condemning the Trump administration. 
“I think we’re fed up with corruption. We’re fed up with people trying to take something that isn’t theirs. And I think the prime example of that is Russia and Ukraine. … Vladimir Putin has overstepped his bounds repeatedly with Ukraine. Donald Trump has overstepped his bounds repeatedly with Alaska … making these different claims, like offering to sell resources, or whatever he wants to offer people,” they said. “I think people are just kind of done with people, you know, doing something without their input.”
Smith also helped coordinate a calendar of solidarity events taking place across the state, from vigils to protest actions to a plan to unfurl a Ukrainian flag at the Delaney Park Strip in Anchorage on Friday. 
“So if you just want to visit an office, that’s an option. If you want to rally hard on the side of the building, that’s an option. If you want to do sign making, if you just want to do a local community thing, or a barbecue, like, people are just kind of coming together. So it’s every kind of opportunity to just kind of build that community in Alaska.”

(Image courtesy U.S. Forest Service)Nearly a dozen representatives from environmental groups and members of the public told the Department of Environmental Quality that allowing nearly double the concentration of selenium in Lake Koocanusa would jeopardize the transboundary waterway, harm fish, and make it harder to hold polluters accountable.
They also said it would only benefit international mining companies.
“Selenium is a scary element, and we’re not talking about a little bit of pollution here,” said Derf Johnson, deputy director for the Montana Environmental Information Center. “What we’re talking about is possibly the worst case of selenium contamination in the world.”
Montana’s environmental agency held a public hearing on Wednesday  on a rulemaking petition the Lake County Commissioners submitted challenging the current site-specific standard of acceptable concentration of 0.8 micrograms of selenium per liter of water. That is much more stringent than the federal threshold of 1.5 micrograms per liter, which is where the county commission would like to see DEQ end up. 
Commissioner Noel Duram, the only proponent of the change at the hearing, said the lower standard doesn’t make sense for his county.
At the hearing, he said the petition is about looking out for the economic interests of the county, and having standards for pollutants that are more stringent than there are nationally could prevent companies from investing in industries, such as mining, in the area. 
“From our understanding, it only affects new applications for discharge into the lake,” Duram said. “It doesn’t actually affect anybody that’s currently discharging into it from another entity or another region. It does affect Lincoln County specifically.”
But opponents to the petition said that the standard, adopted in 2020, had been developed through years of rigorous study and consultation with stakeholders across both sides of the border, and that the only beneficiaries of leniency are the mining companies responsible for the pollution. 
Selenium is a mineral often found in coal-rich deposits. The element, which is an essential nutrient for animals, is toxic in high concentrations, and excessive accumulation in fish can lead to detrimental effects, including growth inhibition, reproductive defects and mortality.  
The primary source of the selenium found in Lake Koocanusa can be found by tracing its tributary, the Elk River, which enters the reservoir roughly 16 miles north of the U.S. border, into the mountains of British Columbia.
Those mountains are home to four active, mountaintop-removal, metallurgical coal mines operated by Elk Valley Resources, currently owned by Swiss mining conglomerate Glencore, after being sold by Teck Resources Limited in 2023. 
The mining operations have leeched various pollutants into the Elk River, including selenium and nitrates, according to multiple studies spanning more than a decade. 
A recent U.S. Geological Survey study published in 2023 linked expanding mining operations with increased selenium concentrations and indicated Lake Koocanusa had exceeded Montana’s site-specific standards since 2020.  
Since the rule was put into place, it has been embroiled in litigation on both sides of the border and ongoing attempts by Montana officials to weaken it.
In 2021, the Lincoln County Commissioners submitted a similar petition to the one heard this week. Around the same time, Teck had also lobbied for moderating the standard, submitting the same petition as Lincoln County. 
Teck, and now Glencore, have argued against the standard for being “more stringent than the comparable federal guideline for selenium,” according to documents the company submitted to the state. 
There is an ongoing lawsuit between the Montana Board of Environmental Review – a quasi-judicial body that handles environmental permit disputes — Teck, and Lincoln County, and a multitude of environmental groups led by the Montana Environmental Information Center seeking to keep the stronger pollutant standard in place, after the review board overturned the standard. In another suit, MEIC sued the Montana Department of Justice for denying access to communications between Teck and the state. 
One of Duram’s arguments was rooted in concerns that the current standard might prevent future industries from being able to discharge any amount of selenium in Lincoln county. But in 2021, then-DEQ director Chris Dorrington told Montana lawmakers that “there is no source of selenium, and there would be no scientific basis for a limit placed on a logging or a mining operation due to selenium because the selenium doesn’t exist,” according to reporting by the Flathead Beacon. At the time, legislators from Lincoln County introduced legislation that would have rescinded the new rule.
“It may be true that there are no geological areas of selenium in Lincoln County that will stop the future economic opportunities, but having further regulations that are far more restrictive than the EPA guidelines will not help the future opportunities,” Duram wrote in an email to the Daily Montanan. “I fear that the comments regarding selenium from the alarmists calling the water polluted and saying that selenium is ‘scary’ will not help the fishing economy that they claim to try and protect.”
More than 30 environmental, conservation and outfitting groups signed onto a letter opposing weakening the standard, pointing to potential impacts to Montana’s robust recreation-based economy that includes a $149 million contribution from boating and fishing.
“Compromising Montana’s water-based recreation by allowing more pollution into our waters, all for the benefits of mines located in Canada and owned by a Switzerland-based commodities trader, is not just foolhardy, but reckless,” states the letter, signed by myriad groups including MEIC, Montana Trout Unlimited, Yaak Valley Forest Council, Montana Conservation Voters and numerous fishing and outfitting groups. “Weakening the standard will undoubtedly compromise and negatively impact the clean water and aquatic life of the watershed, and would not benefit Montana economically.”
Another major stakeholder in the discussions over Koocanusa is the transboundary Ktunaxa nation, comprising members of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, Kootenai Tribe of Idaho and the Ktunaxa First Nations of ʔakisq̓nuk, ʔaq̓ am, Yaqan Nuʔkiy, and Yaq̓it ʔa·knuqⱡi’it. The tribal nations have long asked the U.S. and Canadian governments to study the impacts of mining and the extent of pollution in the Elk-Kootenai watershed, including looking at the impacts to Ktunaxa homelands.
“The current standard was developedthrough a rigorous and in depth scientific study amongst all the jurisdictions in the water set, and is supported by multiple state, tribal and federal entities, including our tribes and our sister Ktunaxa governments in Canada,” Rich Jannsen, head of the Natural Resources Department for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, said at the hearing. “The current standard also ensures that all species of the fish in the reservoir are protected, including culturally important fish, not just certain species of fish. The current standard is critical to ensuring that Montana tribal and US territory is protected from mine contamination”
While Duram said during the hearing that he wants to see polluters held accountable, the DEQ standard for Koocanusa doesn’t have a mechanism to do that. 
“The headwaters of the Koocanusa do have some pollution coming into them from an entity we have no control over. It’s been 100 years coming,” Duram said. “This problem, no matter what happens on the other side of the border, will be in existence for Lincoln County and Koocanusa for 1,000 years to come, probably because the spoils of the activity will allow selenium to continue to come into the reservoir.”
Many opponents at the hearing alleged that Lincoln County’s petition merely served to benefit the mining companies. 
Documents from DEQ when the current standard was being adopted indicated that the stringent standard was partially intended to push Canadian governmental regulators to hold the mining companies accountable for their actions and bolster cleanup activities along the Elk River. 
As of last year, Teck had the capability to treat more than 77 million gallons of water a day, with plans to build six more water treatment facilities by 2027, increasing treatment capacity to 150 million litres per day, according to reporting by The Narwhal. 
But total cleanup costs could exceed $6 billion, the Narhwal reports, much higher than what the provincial government currently requires as a financial security to ensure the project owners do not leave taxpayers with the future cleanup costs of the mine.
Duram said he met with representatives of DEQ and mining company Elk Valley Resources this spring to discuss the pollution issue, and that EVR gave a presentation challenging the science of the current standard and offering more recent studies. 
According to Montana law, within 60 days after submission of the petition, DEQ must either deny the petition in writing or initiate rulemaking proceedings. The department will respond by Sept. 2.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/stelprdb5261097-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-14 21:56:33.858443

Emily O'Brien, vice chair of the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee, questions staff from the Attorney General's Office about how it handled finances related to a controversial renovation and lease of a south Bismarck building. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Financial discrepancies related to an Attorney General’s Office building project have been resolved, staff with the office said Thursday, but some lawmakers questioned why the agency hasn’t provided documentation backing that up.
A committee of lawmakers since 2022 has ordered several investigations to settle lingering questions about the project — and whether any taxpayer money is still unaccounted for.
The building was selected by former Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem’s administration around 2019 to become new office space for several agency divisions. The agency ordered extensive renovations to the property on Burlington Drive in Bismarck.
The project raised eyebrows for exceeding projected costs by at least $1.7 million, and because a state lawmaker and partial owner of the property — Rep. Jason Dockter, a Bismarck Republican — was convicted of a conflict of interest misdemeanor related to the deal. 
North Dakota Ethics Commission makes first finding of violations by public official

Financial questions about the project resurfaced in a recent investigation report by the North Dakota Ethics Commission that found Dockter had violated ethics laws by voting on budget bills that included funds for the building lease.
Despite inquiries by the commission and other investigators, it remains unclear whether the Attorney General’s Office reconciled project finances with Stealth Properties, the building owner. The state initially paid Stealth too much money for the renovation, but both parties arrived at different calculations for how much the state had overpaid. The Attorney General’s Office has recovered about $525,000, but a report by a Montana investigator indicates the Attorney General’s Office is owed an additional $14,600. 
Laura Balliet, an attorney for the Attorney General’s Office, told lawmakers on Thursday that the agency ultimately decided not to pursue the additional money. 
“We determined internally that it wasn’t worth the time and effort and resources to continue to try to recover $14,000 when we have recovered $525,000,” she told the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee.
Stealth’s attorney, Monte Rogneby, told Rep. Emily O’Brien, R-Grand Forks, on Thursday morning that he and his clients were unaware that the Attorney General’s Office considered the project settled, according to an email O’Brien provided to the North Dakota Monitor.
Rogneby said in a statement to the Monitor that Stealth has provided documentation to the Attorney General’s Office of construction costs and its financial reconciliation. He said Stealth  “has not received any communication from the attorney general raising any concerns with the lease or the reconciliation of construction costs.”
Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, asked agency staff why they didn’t take the time to put together an agreement with Stealth that shows the finances were reconciled.
“I still would have wanted some type of documentation signed by both parties saying that there’s no longer a dispute,” he said. “It just seems really messy to me, and not very open or transparent.”
Balliet said she couldn’t speak to why the agency had not opted to do so, but that the Attorney General’s Office staff can provide documentation to lawmakers at the committee’s next meeting, scheduled for December.
Attorney General Drew Wrigley, who assumed office in 2022 after Stenehjem died in office, first brought the cost overrun to lawmakers’ attention.
That led to a review by State Auditor Josh Gallion and later an outside investigation by the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation. A Montana investigator, however, said the probe was limited by a lack of subpoena power. Mountrail County State’s Attorney Wade Enget reviewed the Montana report, but said questions about the building project were beyond the scope of his review.
The Ethics Commission’s report focused on Dockter’s conflict of interest. However, it also reiterated concerns previously discussed by lawmakers, including that all project expenditures may not have been authorized by the Legislature or the Emergency Commission.

Mary Kae Kelsch, a division director in the Attorney General’s Office, said the office’s finance team wouldn’t have made illegal expenditures. The office has appropriation authority for leases, she added.
“Was it illegal? No, but it wasn’t managed well,” Kelsch told lawmakers.
According to both Attorney General’s Office staff and Stealth representatives, there was no “cost overrun” related to the project. While the project went roughly $1.7 million over initial projections, the lease permitted the parties to go beyond that figure.
“It wasn’t really an overage,” said Kelsch. “It’s just there was no cap put on, and so the till was running, the meter was running, and no one was paying attention to the meter.”
Wrigley in a Wednesday letter to the committee said his agency has tied up all financial loose ends related to the building deal, and that the Ethics Commission’s concerns have no merit. Wrigley said in the letter he could not attend the meeting because he was out of the country Thursday.
Pat Monson, who was hired to conduct the investigation of Dockter on behalf of the Ethics Commission, said the Attorney General’s Office did not provide the commission information about the reconciliation during her probe. She said she’s not sure how the Attorney General’s Office could have reconciled the finances.
“There were so many discrepancies within the invoices and the bills and costs that were submitted by Stealth to the AG’s office,” Monson, who was a trial attorney for nearly 50 years, said. “How and when those discrepancies were overcome and agreed upon is really unclear.”
Lawmakers on Thursday considered requesting an additional review from the state auditor, but opted instead to first request the written documentation from the Attorney General’s Office.
Bekkedahl also asked the Attorney General’s Office to report to the Legislature’s Budget Section about the more than $500,000 that was returned to the state.

Phil Murphy said the portrait of late Lt. Gov Sheila Oliver will bring some diversity to the group of portraits hanging in the Statehouse.,"The late Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver’s loved ones with a new portrait of Oliver unveiled on Aug. 14, 2025. (Photo courtesy of the governor’s office)State officials unveiled a portrait of the late Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver at the Statehouse in Trenton on Thursday, about two years after Oliver’s death.
Oliver, the first Black woman speaker of the New Jersey Assembly, was elected as Gov. Phil Murphy’s running mate in 2017 and reelected in 2021. Murphy on Thursday said she devoted her life to fighting injustice.
“She was the definition, as they say in baseball, of a five-tool athlete, from fighting to expand affordable housing to supporting community revitalization up and down our state,” he said. “Sheila was the architect behind some of our greatest victories in building a stronger, fairer, and more just New Jersey.”
Murphy pointed to the wall of white, male portraits hanging in the Statehouse, noting that Oliver’s portrait, along with one of former Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno that was unveiled just weeks ago, will bring some diversity to the wall.
Oliver’s political career started with positions on the East Orange school board and the Essex County Board of County Commissioners, when they were called freeholders. She was elected in 2003 to represent the 34th District in the Assembly, and in 2010, she became the Assembly speaker.
As lieutenant governor, Oliver stepped in as acting governor during key moments, including in March 2020 when Murphy was undergoing cancer treatment and New Jersey recorded its first cases of COVID-19.
Oliver was behind numerous pieces of legislation during her time in the Assembly, including measures creating a caregiver task force, strengthening equal pay protections, launching mandatory youth financial literacy education, and starting a program aimed at keeping youth out of detention centers.
“Sheila wasn’t a politician, she was a true public servant,” Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way said at the ceremony. “That’s who Sheila was – one who saw beyond titles and cared about the whole person in front of her.”
Oliver led the Department of Community Affairs while serving as lieutenant governor. She died on Aug. 1, 2023, at age 71.
Oliver will soon be inducted into the hall of fame in New Jersey, according to Renee Oliver, the president of the Sheila Y. Oliver Foundation.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-14 23:32:12+00:00,Mississippi Today,Jackson State students call on administration to address ‘an unfair housing crisis’,Candice Wilder,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/14/jackson-state-students-call-on-administration-to-address-an-unfair-housing-crisis/,More than 380 JSU students have signed a petition demanding school officials address housing and financial aid concerns.,"More than 380 students on financial aid at Jackson State University have signed a petition calling on Denise Jones-Gregory, the interim president, and the university’s housing and residence life office to “address an unfair housing crisis” as they scramble to find lodging just days before the first day of classes begin. 
Arianna Thomas, who identified herself on the change.org site as a Jackson native and honors elementary education scholar, created the petition Wednesday. She could not be reach for comment.
Students who applied for dorms and financial aid in the spring were removed from their housing assignments without warning, according to the change.org petition. Some were told they were rejected because of unpaid balances or their aid wasn’t applied correctly or delayed. 
As a result, students said they are now left without housing, placed on waiting lists or reassigned to more expensive campus lodging and meal plans costing $3,000 or more. Students said no clear answers have been provided by university officials to address the matter, according to the petition. 
When reached for comment via email by Mississippi Today, university officials said they were aware of the petition and working to address the issue.
“Jackson State University understands the importance of stable housing to our students. We are working directly with students who still need placement, including partner housing that offers shuttle service, security and daily support,” Anthony Howard, media relations specialist with the university, said in an email statement. “While each student’s situation is unique, our Housing and Residence Life team and university partners are also assisting students with cost concerns to ensure they have the resources they need.”
Commenting on the change.org site, Naheeme, a student from Bronx, New York, said, “They have terrible communication when it comes to housing and they makes problems for family’s because that disrupts people money due to not having them having overly expensive housing it’s just not acceptable for a school as good as Jackson State.”
“Students should be provided the housing they paid and waited for,” a student from Houston named Rhylin commented.
“Students need the housing they apply for. Stop prioritizing students that you don’t know will stay over returning students who need housing to continue their education. Graduation rates will surely drop,” said Deona, a student from Jackson, said. 
Last year, former university president Marcus Thompson unsuccessfully pitched a $5 million plan to Mississippi’s college governing board to purchase the Jackson Marriott as a temporary solution to the school’s housing crisis as the school experienced increasing student enrollment in the past years. 
Thompson, who prioritized the issue during his tenure, told board members the school had received roughly 800 more housing applications than it had housing to accommodate when the campus only had 2,000 available beds. 
For years, the state’s largest HBCU has been trying to secure funding to fix its housing shortage through state legislative support. 
For the 2025-26 academic year, the school leased 106 rooms at the Holiday Inn Express & Suites in downtown Jackson for $2.1 million, providing housing for 200 students according to Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning board meeting minutes. The state college governing board approved of the leasing agreement during a July 31 special called meeting. 
Alcorn State University, the state’s oldest land grant university and an HBCU, is also experiencing a housing crunch as dozens of students will be spending their first semester rooming at Magnolia Bluffs Casino Hotel of Natchez, which is owned by Magnolia Bluffs Casino, according to the IHL board’s meeting minutes from a July 18 special session. 
The hotel is approximately 40 miles from the university’s main campus in Lorman. About 100 students will be housed in 50 rooms at the hotel, which is one mile away from the casino. Two additional rooms will provide lodging for administrative staff as oversight as Robinson and Burrus Hall, a residence on campus remains offline for repairs. These projects are funded through Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds, which are set to expire next year.
Transportation services will be provided to students, John Pearce, senior associate commissioner of the IHL explained, during the session.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/06182224/JSU14.jpg,,,2025-08-14 19:57:09.187358

Jon Ossoff speaks at a press conference in Atlanta on Aug. 14 to urge Congress to extend the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits. Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderGeorgia residents could see as much as a 40% increase in their health insurance premiums if Congress does not act to extend the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits, U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff said at a press conference Thursday.
Ossoff, a Democrat, said he is urging congressional Republicans to “reverse course” on allowing the credits — which help subsidize ACA health care premiums for low-income and middle class families — to expire. Currently, families with incomes up to 400% of the federal poverty line are eligible for the credits, which comes out to $62,600 for a single-person household and $128,600 for a household of four.
Without the credits, Ossoff warned, health care costs are expected to rise dramatically, forcing families to pay more out of pocket or forgo health insurance coverage entirely.
“When folks can’t make their household finances work already with rent or the mortgage and the car payment and gas and groceries, the last thing Georgia families need right now is to be paying thousands of dollars more per year for their health insurance,” Ossoff said.
Roughly 310,000 people across Georgia are projected to lose access to health insurance by 2034 under the GOP’s budget reconciliation bill, often referred to by supporters as the “big, beautiful bill,” which was signed into law by President Donald Trump in July. If Congress allows enhanced tax credits for those insured through the Affordable Care Act to expire this year, that number could rise to 750,000, according to data from the nonprofit health policy research organization KFF.
The credits were first introduced in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, and are associated with record high ACA enrollment levels. In Georgia, 96% of enrollees use advanced premium tax credits to cover some or all of their health care costs. Georgia’s state insurance marketplace, known as Georgia Access, is the second-largest in the country after California.
“The enhanced premium tax credits have allowed Georgia Access to be so successful, and they have allowed hundreds of thousands of Georgians to get coverage for the first time,” said Whitney Griggs, the director of health policy at Georgians for a Healthy Future, a patient advocacy group.
Other organizations that advocate for health care access joined Ossoff in his push to renew the credits.
“This is going to affect a lot of people,” said Lloyd Sirmons, the executive director of the Georgia Rural Health Association. “It’s going to affect your elderly people who are going to see their premiums go up drastically. It’s going to affect your small business owners and their workers, because their premiums are going to go up.”
“At the end of the day, that’s the thing that really kind of resonates with me most is when people have to start deciding if they’re going to be able to pay for the health care, or if they’re going to be able to pay for their food,” Sirmons added.
Ossoff said that Congress could advance legislation to extend the credits as soon as their first week back in session. Both chambers will return from their August recess after Labor Day.

Murrow Award for its coverage of reproductive health care policy in the state. 
The reporting that’s being honored was led by New Orleans-based freelance journalist Lorena O’Neil and overseen by Illuminator Editor-in-chief Greg LaRose. It was made possible with support from the Pulitzer Center’s Story Reach fellowship.
In October 2024, Louisiana became the first state to designate the pregnancy care drugs mifepristone and misoprostol Schedule IV controlled dangerous substances. The medications were targeted because they are used in abortions, but they also have other medical applications.
O’Neil’s reporting included accounts from doctors, pharmacists and other health care providers who aired concerns about how the new law would impact their ability to provide timely and, in some cases, life-saving care.
New Orleans offers help to doctors fearful of new drug law; Murrill says ‘problem doesn’t exist’

Earlier this year, the Illuminator reported on the nation’s first attempt to criminally prosecute a doctor for prescribing abortion medication. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill is leading the case against Dr. Margaret Carpenter, a New York doctor who reportedly sent the drugs to a Louisiana woman for her pregnant minor daughter. Carpenter and the mother, who the Illuminator is not identifying to protect her daughter’s identity, are charged with breaking state law that prohibits the mailing of medication used to illegally terminate a pregnancy.
O’Neil also followed the approval of another law this spring that added more restrictions to the state’s definition of a “coerced abortion.” 
Winners of the RTDNA’s Edward R. Murrow Awards will be recognized Oct. 13 during a ceremony in New York City. The Illuminator is being honored in the Small Digital Organization category.
Since 1971, RTDNA has honored outstanding broadcast and digital journalism with the Murrow Awards. They recognize local and national news stories that “uphold the RTDNA Code of Ethics, demonstrate technical expertise and exemplify the importance and impact of journalism as a service to the community,” according to the organization. 
The awards honor legendary broadcaster Edward R. Murrow, who reported live from Europe throughout World War II and confronted U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s for his “Red Scare” campaign.

More than a year later, they say the issue still hasn’t been resolved. 
When they filed suit, the interpreters for the state Department of Labor and Industries alleged they were owed more than 3,500 payments, ranging from $6 to $494, totaling $280,000, dating back to 2021. The unpaid work continues to “pile up” for language access providers, according to a spokesperson for their union, Interpreters United.
Specifically, these interpreters serve those injured while working for an employer that is self-insured and does not participate in Washington’s workers’ compensation system. Such companies must pay for medical services, including interpretation assistance, needed after workplace injuries.
Self-insurance allows the employers, including companies like Walmart, Costco and Tyson as well as some local school districts, to exert more control over workers’ compensation claims. 
The Department of Labor and Industries still manages the claims. It contracts with an outside company to handle the scheduling and paying of interpreters for self-insured claims. Until June 2024, that company was InterpretingWorks, which is named as a defendant in the ongoing wage theft lawsuit. Last year, L&I switched to SOS International, or SOSi.
Self-insured employers are required to compensate the interpreters through the outside company that acts as a middleman. The union is pushing Labor and Industries to pressure those firms to pay up.
“L&I has the authority and obligation to require self-insured companies to pay the compensation owed to LAPs, but has failed, refused, and neglected to do so,” reads last year’s lawsuit filed in Thurston County Superior Court.
Labor and Industries spokesperson Matt Ross said the agency has “the same goal as the interpreters: We want to see them get paid what they are owed.”
Some interpreters don’t want to work with the agency any more.
“I used to do a lot of interpreting for injured workers for L&I, but stopped doing it for over a year now,” union president Quan Tran said in a statement. 
Barbara Robertson, a Swahili interpreter, said it’s “utterly ironic that the agency that investigates and litigates wage theft does not guarantee that interpreters will be paid.”
“Frankly, I’m not inclined to interpret again for a client whose insurer hasn’t paid me,” she said.
Ross, from L&I, said in an email, “We’re working hard to find a resolution for those cases” where interpreters haven’t been paid.
The agency’s new vendor, SOS International, has also contracted with the federal government to provide interpreters for immigration court proceedings. In 2017, the National Labor Relations Board found SOSi had misclassified those interpreters as independent contractors, enabling the Virginia-based company to avoid giving them benefits like overtime pay.
A SOSi spokesperson said the company is “committed to ensuring we meet our obligations to pay interpreters in accordance with the terms of our contract with the State.” The company wasn’t named as a defendant in last year’s lawsuit.

Ross said since changing vendors interpreters are being paid on time.
“The number of interpreters providing services for workers has also more than doubled, from 254 last June to 520 today,” he said Wednesday.
InterpretingWorks CEO Marisa Gillio said if interpreters didn’t get paid, “neither did we.”
“Even after our contract ended over a year ago, we’ve continued processing invoices and ensuring interpreters are paid as soon as the funds come in,” Gillio said in a statement.
The contract interpreters for Labor and Industries had long fought for union representation. Last year, they secured their first contract with the state. It provides a 5% pay increase in the current two-year state budget. The union represents about 1,400 interpreters who work with state government, including L&I and other agencies, said spokesperson Patrick Sugrue.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/roof-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-14 19:57:09.187358

(Photo: Duke Energy) Duke Energy is asking regulators for permission to merge its two utilities in the Carolinas — Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress.
The Charlotte-based utility said in its announcement that such a merger would save customers even more than the $1 billion in savings it has seen in the 13 years since Duke Energy merged with Raleigh-based Progress Energy. The company also called the proposal a “reorganization” in its announcement, but it is legally a merger.
The two companies have nearly 5 million customers across North and South Carolina with Duke Energy Progress covering the Raleigh area and eastern North Carolina, while Duke Carolinas covers Charlotte and western North Carolina. 
Duke’s target date for the merger is Jan. 1, 2027. But the deal needs the approval of the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
There will be no immediate changes to retail rates for customers, Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO of Duke Energy Carolinas, said in a statement. Future rate changes will be subject to regulatory approval, with both North and South Carolina regulators deciding rate cases separately.
According to Duke, streamlining operations will allow for more than $1 billion in savings for retail customers between Jan. 1, 2027 and 2038.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota officials are hopeful that bolstering community engagement and English language learning will help the recruitment and retention of foreign-born workers as the state continues to address workforce shortages.
North Dakota’s Global Talent Office, formerly the Office of Legal Immigration, a division of the Department of Commerce, hosted the 2025 Global Talent Summit at Bismarck State College on Thursday that featured workforce and immigrant advocacy organizations highlighting the needs of the state.
“The real challenge … is retention,” said Buba Kanagi, global talent coordinator for the Global Talent Office. “Giving someone a job is one thing, but keeping them at the same job, upskilling them, is a whole different story.”
Kanagi said retention is about finding a home and becoming part of a community.
Rebekah Smith, executive director of Labor Mobility Partnerships, said when she addressed the summit last year, there were more than 26,000 job openings in the state and only 30 workers for every 100 positions. This year, there are about 22,000 job openings and nearly 50 workers for every 100 positions. She said economic factors may have played a role in the decrease in available positions.
Holly Triska-Dally, North Dakota state refugee coordinator, said her job is to connect refugees who come to the state with employment opportunities, English language learning, health and well-being programs and youth programs to acclimate them and their families to the state.
In 2023, North Dakota directly settled about 400 refugees, but also drew an additional 600 refugees to the state who initially settled elsewhere, she said.
She said refugees have told her they enjoy North Dakota more than other states because of the workforce and educational opportunities, as well as a lower cost of living. However, lack of transportation and adult English language classes can be barriers to becoming engrained into their new communities. 
“They (adult learning centers) don’t have the capacity that they need and that’s a problem,” Triska-Dally said.
She said the adult learning center in Grand Forks, one of eight adult learning centers across the state, only has one classroom and one teacher for English classes.
“We tried working with them for refugee English language learning, couldn’t be done,” Triska-Dally said. “I think we waited for six months and not a single student was able to get into classes so we began working with East Grand Forks (Minnesota) on the other side of the river.”
She added city governments, local organizations and available services all have roles to play that can impact the integration of immigrants and refugees into North Dakota communities.
“The closer that we work with communities, the better outcomes we’re going to experience,” Triska-Dally said.

Rep. Dori Hauck, R-Hebron, attended the event. She said North Dakota has been utilizing international farm labor through visa programs for decades and now other sectors need international help, such as health care.
People may not see the need for immigrant workers until it affects their own families, Hauck said. She said, if a parent or grandparent isn’t getting the care they need because of worker shortages, people can come to a new realization on the need for legal immigration.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong and first lady Kjersti Armstrong, a Norway native, both spoke during the event and shared their stories about how immigration helped shape their lives together.
“Global talent is not a backup plan,” Kjersti Armstrong said. “It’s a cornerstone of innovation and progress.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers praised the Arkansas State Police on Thursday for the swift identification and arrest of a man accused of murdering a couple at Devil’s Den State Park.
Andrew James McGann, 28, was arrested and charged with two counts of capital murder five days after the stabbing deaths of Clinton David Brink, 43, and Cristen Amanda Brink, 41, while they were hiking in the park on July 26 with their two young daughters. McGann was arrested in Springdale while getting a haircut.
Police have said on multiple occasions that they have not found any evidence linking the family and McGann and that the attack appeared to be random.
At his arraignment in Fayetteville Thursday morning, McGann entered a not guilty plea to both charges. He is being held without bond, and is represented by public defenders Katherine Streett and James Wyatt.
Unusually, the arraignment was not open to the public, local TV station 40/29 News reported. Washington County prosecutor Brandon Carter told the station he anticipates the judge in the case will issue a gag order.
At a meeting of the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Game and Fish/State Police subcommittee Thursday, legislators praised the two young girls, 7 and 9, who provided descriptions of their parents’ alleged attacker. ASP Director Col. Mike Hagar said the descriptions they provided would have been “pretty amazing” if they had been adults, much less young children who had just been “traumatized.”
“Those little girls are heroes,” Hagar told lawmakers.
In response to a request from subcommittee co-chair Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain Home, to provide an overview of the timeline of the investigation, Hagar emphasized that it was not a typical situation that state police found themselves in when they got the call about the murders.
Truly random crime, such as the one that appeared to occur in the state park, “is actually extremely rare,” Hagar told legislators. And since both the victims and the suspect had recently moved to Northwest Arkansas from other states, police had to talk to people who knew the Brinks across vast areas to try to determine if there was a link or motive.
“Our victims were from California. They had moved to Montana, then to South Dakota, then, most recently, to Arkansas. And so there was a huge geographical area that we had to cover,” Hagar said.
McGann also had recently moved to Arkansas and was due to start a teaching job with Springdale schools. He is due back in court on Nov. 14.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mike-Hagar-20250814-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-14 18:57:56.432054

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)The Trump administration has refused to fund a study that was to have measured toxic air pollution in West Louisville. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency denied an appeal of the EPA’s cancellation of the grant that was funding the study, a spokesperson for Louisville’s air pollution regulator said.
The Lantern previously reported the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District was notified by the EPA in March that a $1 million grant for the study would be terminated because it was “inconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, agency priorities.” It was one of hundreds of canceled EPA grants, the majority involving environmental justice programs. The study was set to benefit predominantly Black neighborhoods in West Louisville.
The Louisville agency told the Lantern in May it would contest the grant termination through an internal EPA process. But Madd Mudd, a spokesperson for the air pollution district,  in a statement Thursday to the Lantern said the appeal was rejected as Louisville Public Media previously reported.
“Clearly this is not the outcome we hoped for, but we will continue to keep our options open and conversations will continue with the county attorney’s office and our partners on the project about our path forward and other potential work together,” Mudd said. 
The grant was set to pay for placing canisters and monitors measuring volatile organic compounds and airborne metals. Some of the monitors were to be placed downwind of Rubbertown, a collection of chemical plants near West Louisville that has been the subject of complaints from the adjacent neighborhoods and beyond. The monitors would have compared the levels of air pollution and health impacts to those in a study conducted in the early 2000s that found unacceptably high levels of a number of cancer-causing pollutants.
The Lantern did not receive a response to an emailed request for comment sent Thursday to a regional EPA office. When asked about the grant termination, an EPA spokesperson previously told the Lantern the former Biden administration “shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”
The air monitoring was part of a larger community project studying the health impacts of air pollution involving multiple organizations. Arnita Gadson, the executive director of the West Jefferson County Community Task Force, one of the groups involved in the community project, told the Lantern the rejection of the appeal was “terrible.” She said a key part of the community project was educating local health care professionals on how to treat exposure to air pollution. 
“This grant was to help people who had been disproportionately exposed to chemicals from the Rubbertown complex through no fault of theirs,” Gadson said. 
Gadson said she wasn’t sure what would happen with the efforts to study the health impacts of air pollution near Rubbertown.
She said the community task force did a previous study with the University of Louisville that heard from people who were exposed to pollution from Rubbertown before the creation of the EPA in 1970. 
“We found a few people who were still living, and the stories they told of living close to those companies — they were horrible,” Gadson said. “These are not ‘DEI’ people.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1088-1024x695.jpg,,,2025-08-14 18:57:56.432054

A series of lightning-sparked wildfires sent authorities scrambling Wednesday and Thursday, as one fire outside Thermopolis exploded to burn across 15,000 remote acres.

That blaze, dubbed the Red Canyon Fire, drew an evacuation order from officials for an unknown number of rural homes in the area. The fire was burning in a very sparsely populated region of grass and scrub brush well east of Thermopolis itself, James Coates, secretary for the Thermopolis Volunteer Fire Department, told WyoFile.
A federal incident management team is en route to take command of the firefighting effort, Coates said, and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management is currently in charge of the fire. 
The Red Canyon Fire has drawn a significant airborne response, Wyoming State Forester Kelly Norris told WyoFile on Thursday. Helicopters, large air tankers and single-engine air tankers are all working to stop the flames’ advance.

Two other fires, one northeast of Meeteetse and one southeast of Ten Sleep, were also on the move and cause for concern Thursday, Norris said. An estimate on the National Interagency Fire Center’s online map put the Spring Creek Fire, in the Ten Sleep area, at 1,000 acres. But Norris said the fire has been very active. A photograph taken Wednesday night by one of her colleagues and provided to WyoFile showed flames spread along a timbered ridge. 
That fire and another in the area will be managed by a state incident command team, Norris said. 
Northeast of Meeteetse, the Sleeper Ranch Fire also stood at around 1,000 acres, the NIFC map showed. 
The sudden rash of blazes comes after a relatively quiet July on the wildfire front, though the Bighorn Basin has already seen some significant conflagrations.
“Fire season is here,” Norris said. “It showed up over the course of the last couple of days.” 
Norris called on people to take extra care not to spark new fires while officials race to control those already burning. Wyoming is bone dry, she said. “We are very dry and we need to be very aware of the fire risk because while we’re managing these fires we don’t need any others.” 
Lightning storms started as many as 20 fires around the state Wednesday, Norris said, with firefighters rushing to corral ignitions in Crook, Campbell, Johnson, Converse, Uinta, Lincoln and Sublette counties. The fires in the Bighorn Basin are the most worrying. 
“Some of these fires, depending on where they grow or how they grow, they could go for weeks if they get a strong hold,” Norris said. “This is a really critical time.”
Wyoming had a record-breaking and state-bank-account-draining fire season in 2024. Wildfires burned across 840,000 acres in grasslands and mountains across the state, a season surpassed only by the infamous 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park. About half of last year’s acreage burned in four big fires in the northeastern part of the state in late August. 
Wyoming’s blazes join a stretch of fires around the mountain west. Montana, Utah and Idaho all have new wildfires burning, and in Colorado, the Lee Fire outside Meeker is burning across more than 127,000 acres, according to InciWeb. 
“The rest of the West is experiencing the same pattern at the same time,” Norris said.

(Getty Images)After not reporting any measles cases this year during the nation’s worst outbreak of the highly contagious disease in decades, Idaho health officials reported two cases this week.
The two new infections — both in unvaccinated children — are Idaho’s first measles cases since 2023, when an outbreak in southwest Idaho led to 10 infections. The new reports are the first measles cases recorded in local residents in eastern Idaho and the Panhandle area of North Idaho in more than three decades, local health officials say. 
Health officials: Unvaccinated North Idaho child is state’s first resident measles case since 2023

A child living in Bonneville County became eastern Idaho’s first measles case of a local resident since 1991, the Eastern Idaho Public Health District announced Thursday. When symptoms first showed, the child was isolating in a household with an international visitor who had measles, health district spokesperson Brenna Christofferson told the Idaho Capital Sun. 
Eastern Idaho Public Health officials “still believe the public has not been exposed to the identified cases due to self-isolation during the contagious period[s],” she said. 
Eastern Idaho Public Health will not publicly announce in news releases other measles cases that could be linked to the household, but will report household cases to the state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, the health district said in a news release. Cases linked to community spread will be reported, officials said. 
On Tuesday, North Idaho officials reported that a child in Kootenai County became the first case in the state’s Panhandle area since 1991. Last week, officials detected measles in wastewater in Coeur d’Alene, the largest city in the state’s Panhandle area where Idaho’s first measles case this year was reported. 
This year, health officials have confirmed 1,356 measles cases across 40 states by early August, according to the CDC. Idaho’s two cases are not included in the national tally yet.

 Officials encourage people to verify vaccination records

Measles is highly contagious but rare. Up to 90% of non-immune people in contact with an infected person can become infected. The virus can live in the air up to two hours after someone infected leaves.
Symptoms typically appear seven to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a distinctive rash, the CDC says. While many recover without problems, measles can lead to serious complications, especially in very young children and people with weakened immune systems.
Vaccination is the best way to prevent measles, health officials say. 
Health officials encourage people to verify their family’s vaccination records with their primary care provider or through the Docket App. A person is considered immune if they were born before Jan. 1, 1957, have a documented history of laboratory-confirmed measles or have documentation that they received both doses of the MMR vaccine. 
Idaho has a spotty record for measles vaccinations, the Sun previously reported. 
The virus’s serious complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain) and, in rare cases, death.
People with measles symptoms should not enter health care settings without calling ahead, and they should contact their health care providers. People exposed to measles should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure.
There is no antiviral treatment for measles, according to the CDC.

(Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)New Mexico’s top law enforcement officer and his counterparts from a majority of states this week called on the social media giant Meta to add guardrails to a newly launched Instagram feature allowing the company and anyone who follows a user on the app to see their location.
Instagram on Aug. 6 launched the new feature for all users in the U.S. called Map, which displays the user’s profile picture and location in real-time on a map visible to any mutual followers. It quickly faced backlash from privacy advocates who warn against sharing highly personal data with an intermediary like Meta.
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez and attorneys general from 36 other states sent a letter Wednesday to Instagram executive Adam Mosseri saying that without careful controls, the new feature raises public safety and data privacy concerns, especially for vulnerable users like children and domestic violence survivors.
“Unrestricted location-sharing features pose a particular risk for minors as they can be readily used by sexual predators to identify and geographically target children in the real world,” they wrote. “We know that dangerous individuals are already present on Instagram, and we have serious concerns that this feature will increase the likelihood of hands-on abuse and exploitation.”
The attorneys general are calling on the social media company to prohibit minors from enabling location-sharing; provide clear alerts to adult users about the feature, its risks and how their location data will be used; and allow adult users who opt in to easily disable the feature at any time.
Implementing those measures would demonstrate Meta’s “commitment to protecting the privacy and security of your users while still allowing those who wish to share their location to do so knowingly and with informed consent,” they wrote.
The New Mexico Department of Justice is also pursuing litigation against Meta and Snap Inc, which owns Snapchat, alleging the companies’ policies fail to protect children.
“Instagram is once again prioritizing engagement over safety and has enabled a potentially dangerous feature without first ensuring the safety of their users, especially kids,” Torrez said in a statement. “It is absolutely stunning that the company would allow children on the platform to enable a feature which would provide predators with even more information to target and abuse them.” 
“Real-time location features should of course be intentionally built and give users control, which is why Instagram Map’s design already addresses the issues the attorneys general raise: it is off by default, everyone receives a notification explaining what the feature entails and can turn it off whenever they want, and with parental supervision, parents get a notification if their teen starts using it and can block their access to location sharing at any time,” a Meta spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Instagram has accounts designed for teens that are automatically equipped with built-in protections, the company says on its website. That includes limiting who can contact them and what content they can see.
Other attorneys general joining New Mexico in the letter are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.

Gov. Greg Gianforte continued his 56 County Tour in Yellowstone County on Thursday, celebrating the opening of Rodeo Billings at MetraPark, his office said in a news release.
“It’s great to join in the celebration of the return of outdoor rodeo back to the Magic City,” Gianforte said in a statement. “This arena will be a place where families gather, people compete, and our western traditions are carried forward for generations to come.”
Joining Stoney Field, general manager of MetraPark, and David Allen, general manager of NILE Stock Show and Rodeo and Rodeo Billings, the governor celebrated the opening of the brand-new, state-of-the-art outdoor arena built on the grounds of MetraPark behind the Expo Center.
The new facility will serve as a multi-purpose entertainment venue.
Rodeo Billings, held on August 14-16 during the MontanaFair, will mark the first major event held in the new arena, the news release said.
“This is a big opportunity for everybody in Yellowstone County and in eastern Montana because we are kind of a regional hub,” said Allen in a statement provided by the Governor’s Office. “There’s going to be all kinds of events here in the future that are going to contribute to the economy.”
This year, Gianforte signed into law House Bill 190, sponsored by Rep. Greg Overstreet, R-Stevensville, which designates American rodeo as the official state sport.
During the grand opening event on Thursday, the governor acknowledged the passing of Yellowstone County Commissioner John Ostlund, the news release said. The inaugural year of Rodeo Billings has been dedicated to the late commissioner.
“I want to take a moment to remember Yellowstone County Commissioner John Ostlund, whose passing is a tremendous loss for this community and for our state,” Gianforte said. “John was an advocate for protecting our Montana way of life. I am grateful for his commitment to making Yellowstone County a great community.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gov-rodeo-1024x817.jpg,,,2025-08-14 18:57:56.432054

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Glacier National Park will host volunteer training for its annual Hawk Watch Program on August 26 and September 22.
The park outlined the following details in a press release:

The training session on August 26 will run from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. in West Glacier in the Community Building. Trainings will provide an in-depth introduction to raptor ecology, identification, migration and teach volunteers how to conduct migration counts at both the Lake McDonald and Mount Brown Hawk Watch sites in September and October.
Once trained, volunteers can hike to an observation point and count migrating raptors just below Mount Brown Lookout, alongside trained raptor migration counters. This is a hike of about 4.5 miles one-way (about 9 miles roundtrip) with an elevation gain of more than 4,000 feet.
The September 22 training will be an in-the-field training day for volunteers interested in participating in the Lake McDonald Lodge Hawk Watch during the end of September through October. This field training will take place from noon to 4 p.m. in Jammer Joe’s parking lot adjacent to Lake McDonald Lodge.
To join the Hawk Watch Team, participants will learn from park biologists on how to identify and count migrating raptors. Park biologists will answer questions and share information about the integral role of raptors in our ecosystems, risks they face, and why Glacier started the Mount Brown Hawk Watch Program.
Volunteers interested in registering for either or both training days should email the Glacier Citizen Science Office, GLAC_citizen_science@nps.gov, for additional details.

Each year in the fall, golden eagles migrate from northern breeding grounds to warmer climates. One of the most important North American golden eagle migration routes passes directly through Glacier National Park, the park said. Large numbers of other raptors also use this migration corridor during the fall and spring months.
In the mid-1990s, biologists documented nearly 2,000 golden eagles migrating past Mount Brown annually, but recent data indicate significant declines in golden eagle numbers, according to Glacier.
Due to this concern, the park initiated a Raptor Migration Project in 2011 to investigate possible locations for a Hawk Watch site, part of an international effort to track long-term raptor population trends using systematic migrating raptor counts, Glacier said. Observers also record data on sex, age, color morph and behavior of raptors, as well as weather and environmental conditions.
In 2024, observers on Mount Brown counted 1,782 golden eagles, and 2,741 total raptors passing the observation point, according to the raptor migration database.

Article Summary

Texas Republican Party Chairman Abraham George spoke to Illinois GOP leaders Thursday, ahead of Republican Day at the Illinois State Fair.
George says Republicans are underrepresented in Illinois, pointing to Donald Trump’s 43% vote total in 2024.
The state party is still in search of candidates and a winning message that can push them above 50% in statewide races.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – The chairman of the Texas Republican Party said Thursday that he thinks Illinois is winnable for the GOP in 2026, despite the party’s lack of success in recent elections.
Speaking to a joint meeting of the Illinois party’s state central committee and county chairs, Abraham George pointed to the fact that Donald Trump won 43.5% of the vote in Illinois in the 2024 presidential election. That was three points more than he received in 2020, when he lost his first reelection bid to Democrat Joe Biden, and nearly five points more than he received in his first presidential run in 2016. The closer margins, however, were mostly due to fewer votes for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, as Trump improved his vote total by just over 2,000 from 2020 to 2024.
“That’s not a blue state anymore. That’s a purple state,” George said. “This state can flip to a Republican pretty fast.”
The meeting of party officials Thursday morning was a precursor to the annual Republican Day festivities at the Illinois State Fair, an event where the party showcases its major candidates for the next round of elections and tries to generate enthusiasm among its core base of voters.
Gerrymandering battle
George was invited to speak to the group largely because of the ongoing controversy in his home state over congressional redistricting, a controversy that has spilled over into Illinois politics.
The Texas Legislature is currently meeting in a special session to consider several issues, including relief for victims of deadly floods that struck the state in July.
In addition, at Trump’s request, the Republican-controlled Legislature is also considering a mid-decade congressional redistricting plan that is designed to give the GOP at least five additional seats. That would raise their total to at least 30 out of the state’s 38-seat delegation.
To prevent the Texas House from voting on that plan, dozens of Democratic lawmakers fled the state on Aug. 3, with many of them lodging in Illinois. That has prevented the Texas House from mustering the two-thirds quorum required for it to do business.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has openly welcomed the Texas lawmakers to stay here. He has also suggested that if Texas Republicans follow through with their redistricting plans, Democratic-led states like Illinois and California could retaliate by redrawing their own maps in favor of Democrats.
But George criticized the outrage that Pritzker has shown over the efforts in Texas, given how heavily gerrymandered the Illinois maps already are. He noted that while Trump won 43% of the vote in 2024, Republicans hold only three, or 18%, of the state’s 17 congressional seats.
“You know, Democrats, they don’t hate gerrymandering. They hate losing,” George told the Illinois Republicans. “Because if you haven’t looked at your map, they love gerrymandering. I was looking at the map of Illinois and the congressional seats. I’m like, I don’t think this is possible in a computer system.”

Recruiting candidates
Despite the optimism expressed Thursday, Republicans have been slow to announce runs for some of the higher-level offices that will be up for election in 2026. Those include races for governor and all other state constitutional offices, all 17 congressional seats and a U.S. Senate seat being vacated this year by the state’s senior senator, Dick Durbin.

One Republican who has decided to run is former state party chairman Don Tracy, a Springfield attorney, who has announced he intends to run for Durbin’s U.S. Senate seat.
Speaking to reporters Thursday, he conceded it is a “daunting task” for a Republican to run for any statewide office in Illinois, given the Democrats’ significant fundraising advantage.
“They usually outspend us three-to-one, five-to-one, 10-to-one,” he said. “I think I can beat them if it’s only five-to-one. If it’s 10-to-one or 20-to-one, it will be a bigger challenge.”
But fundraising isn’t the only challenge facing Republicans in a statewide race. They also face the reality that in recent statewide races, Democrats have consistently outpolled Republicans in Illinois by roughly a 55% to 45% margin. That means to be considered viable, any given Republican needs to attract about 6 percentage points more than GOP candidates have typically gotten in recent elections. Based on the last race for a U.S. Senate seat in 2022, that would amount to about 246,000 votes.
Asked how he intends to attract those votes, Tracy said, “by running a good campaign, by having a big team, by taking advantage of the Democrat Party’s drift toward leftist socialism and crazy social things like boys and girls sports. They are opening the door for us. But I’m going to need help. I can’t do this on my own.”
Illinois Democrats, meanwhile, have made it clear that a big part of their message will be to focus on the Republican Party’s drift toward the right under the Trump administration, which has pushed through a package of steep cuts in social spending and large tax breaks for upper-income taxpayers, as well as the deployment of military personnel on the streets of Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
Fox News analyst Gianno Caldwell drew cheers from the crowd during his keynote State Fair speech when he told the crowd it “took guts” for Trump to activate the National Guard and federalize policing in the nation’s capital.
Tracy also rejected the suggestion that Trump’s political agenda has been extremist.
“The Trump agenda is peace, prosperity and law and order,” he said. “I think most Americans, including most Illinoisans, support that agenda.”

As conservative lawmakers work to restrict online access to abortion medication, a new report shows how popular it has become for women who live in states that have outlawed abortion.
Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin led a team that analyzed 15 months of prescription data from Aid Access, one of the largest online abortion telemedicine providers.
They found 84% of Aid Access’s more than 118,000 online prescriptions went to patients living in abortion-ban states.
The South and Midwest had the highest rates of patients accessing telemedicine abortion. Rates were also greater in high-poverty areas or where people would have to travel more than 100 miles to reach an abortion clinic, according to the report, which published this month.
Aid Access is able to mail abortion medications to residents in all 50 states — even those in states with abortion bans — thanks to shield laws in Democratic-led states. Shield laws are designed to minimize the legal risks for people who provide or access abortions across state lines.
Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have reproductive care shield laws, either through legislation or by executive order, according to a report from University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
Eight of those states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — specifically protect telehealth abortion providers regardless of where their patient is located.
Shield laws, along with difficulty accessing in-person abortion services in abortion-ban states, have contributed to a rise in medication and telehealth abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, clearing the way for state bans. With telehealth abortion, patients have a virtual appointment with a clinician who can prescribe abortion medication, which is then filled by a licensed pharmacy and mailed to the patient.
Research has shown telehealth medication abortion is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
But as abortion medication use rises, so have conservative efforts to ban it.
This year, more than a dozen states introduced bills to bar access to medication abortion by criminalizing its sale, purchase or distribution, according to Guttmacher.
One such bill in Texas, which could have been a blueprint for medication abortion restriction in other states, was specifically aimed at groups like Aid Access. It would have allowed private citizens to sue for at least $100,000 anyone who provided abortion pills in Texas. The bill passed the Texas Senate but died in the House in May.
Earlier this year, the state of Louisiana criminally charged a New York physician under its abortion ban law for allegedly providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teen via telehealth. New York, which passed a shield law in 2023, refused Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor.
Last month marked the first federal test of shield laws, when a Texas man sued a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to his partner.
This week, a Texas woman filed a federal lawsuit against Aid Access and against a man who she said impregnated her, then spiked her drink with abortion pills. She is also suing the Dutch doctor who founded Aid Access, alleging Aid Access and its founder mailed abortion-inducing drugs in violation of Texas and federal law.

(Credit: Utah Fire Info)Several fast-moving fires have broken out in Utah in the last few days, including a blaze in Weber County that is threatening homes and prompted about 150 evacuations. 
Discovered Wednesday afternoon in the foothills of North Ogden, the Willard Peak Fire ballooned to about 754 acres in roughly 24 hours, with smoke clouding much of the Wasatch Front. As of Friday afternoon, it was not at all contained. 
Fueled by increasingly dry conditions and strong winds, the Willard Peak Fire was sparked by a vehicle fire, which then spread uphill through scrub oak trees. By Wednesday evening, the state reported at least 29,000 customers were without power. Erratic winds in the area prompted air resources to be grounded.

Crews worked overnight and by Thursday morning Utah Fire Info reported no structures had been lost. However, conditions remain ripe for fire activity. 
Although there is some rain in the forecast, especially in high elevation parts of northern Utah, nearly the entire state remains under a red flag warning, and meteorologists expect dry thunderstorms and high winds. The National Weather Service says “critical” fire weather conditions will be in place for all of northern Utah, as well as parts of eastern Nevada, southern Idaho and western Wyoming for the next 24 hours. 
“Moisture moving into the area will bring increasing coverage of afternoon thunderstorms today. Given the dry lower levels, little if any rain will fall with these storms,” the National Weather Service announced in a social media post. 
Fires continue to burn in the Uinta Mountains, southern Utah 
On Wednesday, a lightning strike sparked a new fire in the Uinta Mountains near the popular hiking and camping areas surrounding Washington and Trial lakes. 
Called the Haystack Fire, it was reported to be about half an acre, burning in the forest. 
That’s the second fire burning in the Uinta Mountains, with the Beulah Fire now at an estimated 4,341 acres. The fire was discovered on Aug. 7, and the cause is still under investigation.

Given its location — a remote section of national forest defined by steep, rugged terrain and dry, dead trees from previous fires and beetle kill — crews are taking a hands-off approach to fighting the fire. 
“Crews are instead working indirectly from safer locations, which reduces the risk to firefighters and is currently the best strategy for long-term success in containing the fire,” the National Forest Service said in a statement, noting that the fire is 0% contained. 
The Monroe Canyon Fire, which has been burning since July 13 in southwest Utah near Richfield, is the largest blaze in Utah this year, and the seventh largest in the continental U.S. so far in 2025, according to federal data. As of Thursday, it was reported to be at more than 73,600 acres, and 41% contained.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/northogden-1024x813.jpeg,,,2025-08-14 18:57:56.432054
,DC,2025-08-14 21:57:45+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Immigration crackdown intensifies in D.C. under Trump order for federal control,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/immigration-crackdown-intensifies-dc-under-trump-order-federal-control,,"WASHINGTON — Local leaders and advocates Thursday said that President Donald Trump’s decision to seize the District of Columbia’s 3,400-member police force and deploy 800 National Guard members is a continuation of his administration’s immigration crackdown.Since the president’s decision Monday to invoke the district’s Home Rule Act, checkpoints are being set up in busy neighborhoods, bulldozers are clearing out tents of people experiencing homelessness and Republican governors are volunteering their own National Guard members to bolster the president’s federalization of the district’s 68 square miles.Videos of masked law enforcement officers making Washingtonians step out of their cars and conducting arrests have been posted on social media by journalists, drawing concern over civil liberties.While Trump’s control of the district’s police force ends in 28 days, he’s signaled he wants Congress to extend his authority to deter the “crime emergency.”Advocates questioned the situation. “There does appear to be evidence that non (Metropolitan Police Department) federal authorities may have exceeded the lawful bounds at some of those traffic stops … and there will be accountability if the law is violated,” said Norm Eisen, the executive chair of Democracy Defenders Fund, a litigation organization that has challenged many of the Trump administration’s actions, in a call with reporters.Trump predicts enforcement ‘all over the country’The checkpoints have drawn backlash from district residents and local elected leaders.In a statement, district Councilmember Brianne Nadeau criticized the immigration enforcement at checkpoints.“Last night what would have been a routine MPD traffic safety operation was co-opted by federal law enforcement agents,” she said. “Agents who are not trained in D.C. law. Agents who do not know our community. Agents who were not seeking to address traffic safety but rather were interrogating drivers on their immigration status.”Trump Thursday said that law enforcement using the checkpoints as immigration enforcement was “a great step.”“I think that's going to happen all over the country,” the president told reporters at the White House after signing a proclamation celebrating Social Security‘s 90th birthday. “We want to stop crime.”Violent crime in the district is at a historic 30-year low, according to the Department of Justice.Eisen called the checkpoints unlawful.“They're using it as an immigration control checkpoint,” he said. “That is illegal.” Bulldozing camps for homeless peopleHomeless camps across the district are also being cleared as part of the president’s directive.Trump Wednesday signaled that he plans to send a request to Congress for “a relatively small amount of money” to make improvements to the district.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that if those people experiencing homelessness don’t agree to go to a shelter, they could face fines or jail.“The homeless problem has ravaged the city,” Leavitt said. “Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services, and if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.”The district has faced a backlog in getting vouchers to those experiencing homelessness, according to Street Sense Media, a news outlet that focuses on reporting on homelessness in the district.Local police to aid feds on immigration actionsThe district's police chief Thursday issued a new executive order allowing local police to aid federal officials in immigration enforcement for immigrants not in police custody.The new order does not change the district's law that prohibits local police from sharing information with federal immigration officials about people in police custody. It’s a policy for which Trump has criticized the city, calling it a “sanctuary city,” but the policy does not bar immigration enforcement.Trump called Thursday’s executive order “a very positive thing,” especially at checkpoints in the district.“When they stop people, they find they're illegal, they report them, they give them to us,” he said.Since taking office for a second term, the president has intertwined military involvement in immigration enforcement, such as sending thousands of troops to the southern border and deploying thousands of National Guard members to Los Angeles after protests sparked by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.More National Guard movements possibleAdditionally, the Trump administration is evaluating plans to establish a “Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force” composed of 600 National Guard members to remain on stand-by in order to be quickly deployed to any U.S. city undergoing a protest or other civil unrest within an hour, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.On Wednesday, in another new twist, Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said he’s prepared to send his National Guard members to the district. Lee added that U.S. Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll told him that the military might request states  send troops to the district for law enforcement.The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 generally bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.While the president has stated he also wants to send in National Guard members to other cities – Baltimore, Chicago, New York City and Oakland – all heavily Democratic cities led by Black mayors, like he has done with the district, it can’t be replicated, said Abbe Lowell, a high-profile defense attorney.“One thing that people need to remember about his assault on the District of Columbia, it is a very unique legal framework because of the Home Rule Act that gives him some ability to do something which he does not have in other states and cities where the governors still have some or the primary control over things like the National Guard,” said Lowell, who was with Eisen on the call with reporters.A trial is underway this week challenging Trump’s move to federalize California National Guard members, in a suit filed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, after an appeals court temporarily upheld Trump’s move.‘Racial undertones’ cited by Baltimore mayorBaltimore Mayor Brandon M. Scott said Trump’s singling out of those cities, including the district, can’t be ignored.“Every city that he called out had a Black mayor, and we're talking about Black-led cities,” he said on the call with Eisen and Lowell. “We cannot overstate the racial undertones here.”Scott also criticized the Trump administration for pulling federal law enforcement officers – Drug Enforcement Agency, Homeland Security Investigations, FBI, Customs and Border Patrol – from their duties. Instead they are “patrolling neighbors of Washington DC, stopping residents and checking cars instead of doing their actual jobs,” Scott said.“If the president really wants to help these cities continue to lower violence and crime, he could go back to sending agents to their actual agencies and having them help us work on gun trafficking, work on violent drug organizations, and not taking these agents off to work on this immigration brigade that he's had them on,” Scott said.He added that he’s working closely with Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore and “we’ll be prepared to take any legal and any other action that we need to take.”Moore, who served in the U.S. Army, has criticized the president for calling in the National Guard to the district and raised concerns that service members do not have the same training as police officers.Trump brushed those concerns off on Thursday.“They're trained in common sense,” the president said of National Guard members.EmergenciesEisen said Trump’s actions in the district are part of the president’s pattern of invoking “non-emergencies.”On Inauguration Day, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, despite low levels of immigration.In March, he invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law only used three times previously.Trump’s decision to declare a “crime emergency” in the district earlier this week came after a former U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, official was injured in an attempted carjacking incident around 3 a.m. Eastern near the Logan Circle neighborhood. Two Maryland teenagers were arrested on charges of unarmed carjacking in connection with the incident.“Well, what he's doing in the District of Columbia, including illegal traffic stops, what he's doing is of a piece with that dictatorial approach,” Eisen said of the president.",,,,2025-08-14 18:57:56.432054

Their decision upholds a lower court ruling that found the boundaries discriminated against Black voters. 
The panel’s ruling was issued Thursday in the case Nairne v. Landry, in which Black voters sued the state over redistricting plans the legislature adopted in 2022. The new boundaries for Louisiana Senate and House of Representatives districts did not increase the number of majority Black seats. The plaintiffs alleged they were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. 
The three appellate judges – James Dennis, an appointee of President Bill Clinton; Catharina Haynes, an appointee of President George W. Bush; and Irma Ramirez, an appointee of President Joe Biden – upheld a 2024 ruling from U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick of the Middle District of Louisiana. 
Dick, who former President Barack Obama named to the federal bench, determined the legislative maps do not give Black voters a fair opportunity to elect their own representatives. Dick’s ruling came after the 2023 elections, when a new class of lawmakers were elected, yielding a Republican supermajority in both chambers. 
The state appealed Dick’s decision, arguing in part that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional and should not be applied to Louisiana. The section prohibits actions and policy that restrict a person’s right to vote based on their race, color or membership in a language minority group.
The 5th Circuit judges disagreed with that argument. 
Their decision said that when Congress approved the Voting Rights Act, “it did so based on overwhelming evidence that ‘sterner and more elaborate measures were needed to address ‘an insidious and pervasive evil,” referring to laws in some states that sought to disenfranchise Black voters. 
The judges shot down the state’s request that it ignore the Supreme Court and disregard the intent of Congress when it outlawed racial discrimination in voting in Section 2.
“This is a historic affirmation of the rights of Black voters in Louisiana,” said Megan Keenan, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Voting Rights Project who is representing the Nairne plaintiffs. “Today’s decision sends a powerful message: The Voting Rights Act is still a vital safeguard against racial discrimination in our democracy.” 
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill condemned the ruling. 
“We are reviewing our options with a focus on stability in our elections and preserving state and judicial resources while the Supreme Court resolves related issues,” Murrill said in a statement to the Illuminator. 
Murrill’s comments refer to the U.S. Supreme Court’s consideration of a separate Louisiana redistricting case over the constitutionality of its U.S. House districts. It’s scheduled for a second round of arguments on Oct. 15. 
Justices asked parties to the case to address whether the state’s “intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district” violates the 14th or 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution. 
Though the 5th Circuit panel agreed that the maps in the Nairne case violate the Voting Rights Act, there is a stay on redrawing them until the Supreme Court rules in Louisiana v. Callais, the congressional redistricting case. A ruling on Callais is not expected until next May or June. 
Attorneys for the Nairne plaintiffs have advocated for new maps to be quickly adopted and special elections to be held. But if new maps are eventually adopted, it is most likely they will not be used until the 2027 elections.

Screenshot via Green Mountain Care Board
Vermont hospitals presenting annual budgets in public hearings this month largely aligned their proposals with state regulatory guidelines or suggested even lower or negative growth rates. That’s a marked difference from the last two years when most hospitals’ requests exceeded the benchmarks for budget growth set by the Green Mountain Care Board.
Staff and board members at the state’s top health care regulator, alongside health care leaders, have been immersed for two weeks in hearings to review 2026 budget requests for the 14 hospitals under the board’s regulatory purview. The fiscal year for hospitals in the state begins Oct 1. 
The annual hospital budget hearings are transpiring amid an ongoing health care affordability crisis, with the state’s largest insurers teetering on the edge of insolvency and Vermonters bearing the highest health care premiums in the country in recent years. 
The state’s top health care regulator is reviewing three metrics within hospital budgets this year. The board asked hospitals to limit the increase in their net patient revenue — the amount of earnings through patient service without uncompensated care and other deductions — to 3.5% or below this fiscal year, and set a rate of 3% for growth in operational expenses.

Most critically for Vermonters’ private health insurance costs, the care board set a benchmark of a 3% increase in the amount hospitals can charge commercial health insurers this fiscal year.
The high cost of health insurance in Vermont reflects the overall high cost of health care in the state, and the decisions of insurers, hospital and regulatory health care leaders, Vermont’s Chief Health Care Advocate Mike Fisher said in an interview Thursday. All these factors impact Vermonters’ ability to afford the care they need and can lead to people being priced out of care, he said.
The Green Mountain Care Board also reviews proposed price increases for certain types of commercial health care plans in Vermont. Those increases are often directly influenced by hospital budgets. The board held hearings on state insurance rates last month, and plans to decide on whether to grant Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont and MVP rates requests on Aug. 22, according to board spokesperson Kristen LaJeunesse.  
A new state law capping how much hospitals can charge private health insurers for certain outpatient pharmaceuticals is likely the largest influence on the coming year’s budget proposals, Emma Runia, an analyst for the Green Mountain Care Board, said last week. 
The new price restrictions apply primarily to injectable and IV-administered drugs for immunotherapy and cancer treatment and go into effect Jan. 1, 2026. Preliminary board staff analysis found that the price caps will reduce revenue for affected hospitals by approximately $100 collectively. A large majority — around $70 million — of the dollar impact will fall on the University of Vermont Medical Center, the only academic medical center in the state. 
Vermont’s critical access hospitals — a federal designation for small hospitals in rural areas — are exempt from the legislation’s impact unless they belong to a hospital network. 
That measure and other new legislation, including a move towards reference-based pricing, are positive steps forward, Fisher said. 
In a recent letter, an independent liaison group suggested the care board limit commercial pricing for all hospital services to 500% of the Medicare rate. While Fisher said he appreciates the group putting forward a starting concept for a cap on health services charges, he said it may take a couple of years to determine what counts as a reasonable upper limit to prevent excessive charges.
With hearings closing out on Wednesday, the Green Mountain Care Board will review the information and ultimately make a decision to accept, reject or adjust to hospitals’ requests by Sept. 15. 
Michael Del Trecco, president and CEO of the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, urged the board to support the hospitals’ “lean” budget requests on Aug. 5 at the onset of hearings. He said Vermont hospitals are taking measures to address the state’s health care affordability crisis, such as the University of Vermont Health Network announcing cost-saving measures like layoffs late last month to meet its proposed 2026 budgets. 
“We need payment models that are fair and sustainable and that create the right incentives. Just having rate restrictions is not viable,” Del Trecco said. “I truly believe reductions beyond what has been submitted will challenge transformation efforts and the ability for hospitals to meet the needs of their communities.”
Fisher said addressing the health care affordability crisis and pricing across in the state will require a concerted effort from health care leaders over many years. 
While Vermonters often view hospital budgets in terms of access to services in their local communities, the annual budgetary decisions are felt across the statewide health care system, he said. 
“I know that communities recognize how important their community hospital is in terms of people being able to get the care they need and in terms of the economic engine that hospitals represent for every community,” Fisher said.
“This decision on how much to give hospitals across Vermont has a direct bearing on, to what degree more Vermonters are priced out of the ability to get care,” he said. 
Hospital budget proposals
Almost every hospital with budgets regulated by the Green Mountain Care Board either met or came in under benchmarks set by the board this year, according to a staff analysis of hospital submissions presented on Aug. 5. The hospitals’ rate requests are subject to change through the hearing process and beyond. 
The largest community hospital in Vermont — Rutland Regional Medical Center — requested a 2.8% increase to operating expenses, a 1.7% decrease to net patient revenue and 3.7% decrease to charges to commercial insurers. 
Northwestern Medical Center requested a 3% increase to operating expenses, a 2% decrease to net patient revenue, and a 2.6% increase to commercial insurance rates. 
Southwestern Vermont Medical Center proposed a 2.4% increase to operating expenses, a 1.9% increase to net patient revenue and 3% increase to commercial rates. 
While facing significant budgetary shortfalls in the current fiscal year, Brattleboro Memorial Hospital sought increased rates at last week hearings, including a 1.8% increase to operating expenses, a 1.7% increase to net patient revenue and a 3% increase to commercial rates. 
The three hospitals that requested rates above the regulator guidance are all critical access hospitals: Springfield Hospital, Mt. Ascutney Hospital & Health Center and Copley Hospital. 
Springfield Hospital requested a 8.3% increase to net patient revenue, a 10% increase to operating expenses, as well as a 3% increase to commercial rates. Mt. Ascutney Hospital & Health Center in Windsor requested a 3.5% net patient revenue, a 5.3% increase to operating expenses and 3% increase to commercial rates. 
Copley Hospital in Morrisville asked for a 3.7% decrease to net patient revenue, a 1.6% increase to operating expenses and a 4.2% increase to commercial rates to insurers. 
But one critical access hospital — Gifford Medical Center in Randolph — requested no change to its operating expenses, a 2.5% decrease to its net patient revenue and a 3% increase to commercial rates from the current fiscal year. 
Two of University of Vermont Health Network’s hospitals also requested decreased rates to charges to commercial insurers for the coming fiscal year, mostly due to recent legislation capping outpatient-administered injection drugs. The network’s critical access hospital — Porter Medical Center in Middlebury — requested increased rates for net patient revenue and commercial rates at the regulator’s benchmark and below the benchmark for operating expenses. 
There were no hearings for Grace Cottage Hospital, North Country Hospital and Northeastern Vermont Medical Center, as the board accepted the three critical access hospitals’ budgets with rate requests that all fell below the board’s benchmark increases.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Maine’s largest reproductive health care provider made the case in federal court on Thursday to restore Medicaid funding to the organization, which it said has been unfairly blocked through a provision in congressional Republicans’ massive tax cut and spending law. 
That provision only applies to nonprofit healthcare centers that offer abortions and receive above a certain amount in Medicaid funding, impacting reproductive health care providers nationally, including two in Maine: Maine Family Planning and Planned Parenthood.
“The consequences for Maine Family Planning and its patients are nothing short of catastrophic,” said Meetra Mehdizadeh, senior attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, the national organization that represented Maine Family Planning at the U.S. District Court in Portland.
Maine Family Planning, which operates 18 clinics across the state, filed a lawsuit in late July against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz.
Judge Lance Walker, who was nominated by President Donald Trump during his first presidency, did not immediately issue the preliminary injunction Maine Family Planning requested, but a decision is expected soon. Late last month, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Massachusetts granted an emergency injunction for Planned Parenthood and its national affiliates after an initial injunction blocked only certain clinics receiving Medicaid funds under the new law.
On Thursday, Mehdizadeh asked the court to immediately block part of the law, arguing that Maine Family Planning would suffer irreparable harm by having to shut down their primary care practice and lay off at least two primary care providers. The health care provider has been unable to access Medicaid funding since July 4, when Trump signed the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” into law. Since then, the organization has stopped accepting new primary care patients.
Without Maine Family Planning clinics, thousands of rural patients would have nowhere else to access cancer screenings, STI testing, contraception and annual checkups, plaintiffs said. About 70% of the 8,000 patients that rely exclusively on Maine Family Planning will not see any other health care provider in a given year, they said.
“We’re facing a loss of $1.9 million, but even more important is potentially the loss of access to critical health care services to people who are living in …medically underserved areas,” said George Hill, the organization’s president and CEO.
“We’re often the only provider of care in these areas.” 
Plaintiffs also argued that the law violates the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution — which guarantees equal protection under the law — by withholding federal money, not because of any wrongdoing on the part of Maine Family Planning, but because of Republicans’ efforts to target Planned Parenthood and put abortion providers out of business.
The provision violates this right because “it treats some providers differently from others who are still able to bill Medicaid,” Mehdizadeh said, noting that Medicaid funds already can’t be used for abortions.
Attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice said that Congress can select which entities receive taxpayer dollars and is within its right to withhold funding from organizations providing elective abortions. 
“Congress is entitled to special preference when it engages in funding decisions,” said justice department attorney Emily Hall.
The reason the law only applies to nonprofit entities that receive more than $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements is because Congress can choose to “start with the biggest part of the problem … before considering whether to go further,” Hall said.
Hall also argued that Maine Family Planning has not demonstrated irreparable harm in this case. 
“We would say having to end the primary care practice and having to discharge patients, potentially lay off staff members, is going to irreparably harm Maine Family Planning’s ability to serve its patients,” Mehdizadeh said. “I think it would be bad if courts allowed businesses to get to the point where they are in bankruptcy or on the brink of ruin before stopping an unconstitutional law.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by State Superintendent Ryan Walters against a group that works to enforce the separation of state.
Walters and the State Department of Education filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District in March against the Freedom from Religion Foundation.
The nonprofit organization sent a letter to southeast Oklahoma’s Achille Public Schools in 2024 concerning school-sponsored prayers and Bible readings, asking that the practice be stopped. 
It also sent a letter in 2018 to Putnam City Public Schools concerning a football team chaplain’s actions.
The Education Department’s suit alleged the actions interfered with its ability to govern public schools.
In a ruling filed Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge John F. Heil III said the lawsuit does not explain how the letters interfered with day-to-day operations in any real way.
Walters and the agency have failed to show any real injury, the order said.
“We are so pleased that Walters’ frivolous lawsuit seeking to muzzle FFRF and our free speech rights was promptly dismissed,” said Annie Laurie Gaylor, the group’s co-president. “It was an outrageous attempt by a Christian nationalist public official to attack FFRF’s work to uphold the First Amendment.”
A  spokesperson for the State Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Aug. 14, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceWith the new school year on the horizon, educators and education professionals gathered at Lansing Community College Thursday for a daylong symposium aimed at helping school district employees build an inclusive environment for students and address incidents of antisemitism. 
Brandeis University, alongside the Anti Defamation League of Michigan, education think-and-action tank Boundless Israel and the Michigan Department of Education, broke down the history of antisemitism, while offering tools and resources for teachers to support students and address hate.
“Antisemitism troubles me, not simply as a Jew or as an educator – so it troubles me profoundly in both regards – but also as a person deeply concerned about how humans treat their fellow human beings. We spend an enormous amount of time, energy, focus, attention, money and lose far too many lives through hatred and xenophobia, including antisemitism,” State Superintendent Michael Rice told attendees. 
There’s no place for hatred, discrimination, bullying or harassment in Michigan schools Rice said, emphasizing that’s not just his opinion, but state law.

The Anti Defamation League recorded 9,354 incidents of antisemitism in 2024, marking a 5% increase from 2023, with the organization noting 58% of all the incidents it tracked were tied to Israel or Zionism, with many of these instances tied to protests against Israel amid the war on Gaza. 
Rachel Fish, special advisor at Brandeis University and the founder of Boundless, offered several examples and definitions of antisemitism, noting that the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition is the one utilized by the U.S. Department of State, and is commonly used by higher education institutions and some state and local governments.
While the definition has been challenged by some individuals arguing it does not allow enough room for criticism of Israel, Fish noted it was still important to understand this definition as it relates to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which bars discrimination on the grounds of  race, color, or national origin, with Fish noting this applies to individuals with shared ancestry. 
Fish later added that while a healthy critique of Israel both has to happen and is happening, that critique crosses a line into antisemitism when it stems from the question of whether or not the nation has a right to exist. 
When looking into critique of Israel, Fish said she utilizes former Israeli Minister of Interior Natan Sharansky’s three-D test.

“Sharansky says, when you talk about Israel, Israelis, and you demonize them, you delegitimize them, and you hold them to a double standard you’ve now entered into the space of anti semitism. It’s not healthy critique,” Fish said, pointing to U2 singer Bono’s recent critique of Israel as a healthy example.

Fish also emphasized that antisemitism does not remain stagnant and is constantly morphing in order to remain relevant and resonant in society.
“Whatever the antisemite needs the Jew to be is then how the Jew will be portrayed. That’s why it is easy for it to live within conspiracy theories, and especially in an age of the internet, in an age of social media, you see this in very real time,” Fish said.
Alongside panels offering educators tools for addressing antisemitism and deconstructing antisemitic memes to help students view online hate critically, a group of Michigan students offered their perspective on fostering a safe space for students in schools to support them and promote cultural belonging. 
These spaces provide students with an environment where they feel like their identity is understood, and they feel comfortable expressing themselves, said Olivia Wilson, a Zeeland East High School alumni. These spaces are also areas where students are working for change, Wilson noted. 
Chloe David, a Farmington High School Sophomore, said there was a school counselor, one of only the Jewish people on staff, who was instrumental in building her confidence in her identity, and had helped her through hard times in middle school. 
“Having that Jewish person that I could go to was very helpful for me. It made me feel included and made me feel important, and she was someone I could go to if I did experience anything antisemitic or anything that was bigotry or hatred,” David told the Michigan Advance.

Olivia Graham, a Plymouth High School senior, shared her experience of finding community in her school’s Black Student Union. 
“I’m biracial. I’m half Black, half white, and I used to live in Atlanta, Ga. where my school was primarily African American. So I was around a lot of people who shared the same culture as me.…When I moved here around middle school or elementary school, it was kind of a culture shock to me,” Graham said.  
Moving to a primarily white suburb left Graham without a space to talk about issues, things that made her uncomfortable and her experiences being a Black woman in a white suburban community. 
“I used to put my curly hair up. I used to try to stop speaking in a southern accent. And this was really challenging for me as a student,” Graham said.
However, Plymouth High School’s Black Student Union allowed her to relate to other students’ experiences and share her culture. 
“It was an absolutely amazing experience that has helped me become way more confident in my identity,” Graham said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4916-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-14 17:57:27.886234

Two of Vermont’s statewide elected officials — Republican Lt. Gov. John Rodgers and Democratic Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas — said Thursday they plan to seek reelection in 2026.
Rodgers discussed his plans to seek a second term, which have not been previously reported, in an off-the-cuff interview with VTDigger Thursday afternoon. Copeland Hanzas signalled she was running for a third term in a fundraising email to supporters earlier this week, and confirmed those plans in an interview Thursday.
Candidates for the 2026 election have until next May to formally declare they are running. But Copeland Hanzas said she wanted to announce her plans well in advance because she’s concerned President Donald Trump is sowing distrust in states’ elections well before next November, and she sees herself as “a steady hand” to push back against that rhetoric. 
“I figured, with all that’s going on in the world, that people would probably like to know that their secretary of state — who’s got an eye on taking us through the 2026 election — plans to be there, and working hard, to make sure that our democracy is safe and and that our elections go off as we expect them to,” she said in an interview. 
Rodgers said he does not plan to formally announce his reelection bid until next year, though said in response to a reporter’s question about his plans that he is not ready to hang up his hat.
“I think I’ve been very effective working with legislators in the building and working with the governor’s office,” Rodgers said. (The lieutenant governor presides over the Vermont Senate.) “I think we’ve made some progress, but there’s a lot left to do — and so, I’m excited about staying in the position and continuing my work.”

Copeland Hanzas announced Wednesday that her office will not comply with a request it’s expecting to receive from Trump’s Department of Justice to share detailed personal data on Vermont’s registered voters. After putting out that statement, she said, she’s received encouragement from a number of supporters to run for governor, instead.
But her plans to run for another term as secretary of state likely leave just two other statewide Democratic officials as potential gubernatorial candidates — Attorney General Charity Clark and Treasurer Mike Pieciak. 
Incumbent Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, has not yet said whether he will run again in 2026. He is in his fifth term. Scott has made a habit in years past of not announcing his reelection plans until the state Legislature adjourns for the summer — typically in May — during an election year. 
Clark said in an interview Thursday that she plans to run in next year’s election, though has “not officially decided what office I’m running for.” She declined to say which offices she was considering.
Meanwhile, Natalie Silver, political advisor to Pieciak, said the treasurer had not made a decision about the upcoming election yet. Silver previously served as campaign manager for Democratic U.S. Rep. Becca Balint’s winning bid for Congress in 2022. 
“Mike is very focused on his current job,” Silver said Thursday. “He certainly is thinking about his options for the next cycle, but has not made any decisions.” 
Both Pieciak and Clark are sitting on substantial campaign cash, according to their latest filings with the state, which detail fundraising and spending through the end of June. Pieciak had about $184,000 on hand, the filings show, while Clark had about $98,000. Copeland Hanzas, by comparison, had about $12,000 on hand as of late June.
Vermont State Auditor Doug Hoffer, a Democrat/Progressive, has said previously he did not plan to seek reelection in 2026. He said in an interview Thursday that he wasn’t aware at this point of anyone who was angling for the job after him. 
“I’ve put in my time. I’ve enjoyed the work,” Hoffer said. “But it’s time for somebody else to take it on.”

Article Summary

Ted Dabrowski, the president of a conservative public policy research organization, said he plans to announce his campaign for governor.
Dabrowski joins DuPage County Sheriff James Mendrick in the Republican primary for governor.
Former Illinois GOP Chair Don Tracy announced he will run for U.S. Senate in 2026.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – More Republicans are entering races for statewide office after an initially slow start in announcing candidates for the 2026 election.
Illinois Republicans held their annual events around the Illinois State Fair on Thursday, with former Illinois GOP Chair Don Tracy launching a U.S. Senate campaign and Ted Dabrowski, the president of conservative research group Wirepoints, announcing he will launch a campaign for governor in the coming weeks.
The men enter the 2026 race a week after the window opened for candidates to begin collecting signatures that are due to the State Board of Elections at the end of October.
“For 15 years I’ve been working on reporting on Illinois, on these problems, suggesting a lot of solutions, and what I’ve seen is the state continue to go downhill,” Dabrowski told reporters.
Dabrowski’s Wirepoints.org publishes research and commentary on state policy issues and advocates for conservative solutions on pensions, taxes, governance and other public policy issues. Before joining Wirepoints in 2017, Dabrowski was vice president of policy for the conservative Illinois Policy Institute think tank after spending nearly 20 years in banking.
He said the state’s business climate, tax burden and population growth have gotten worse under Gov. JB Pritzker, who is seeking a third term in 2026. Dabrowski said he is focused on improving reading scores in schools, making life more affordable and creating jobs.
But a major question Republican candidates will have to answer is where they align with President Donald Trump. Dabrowski side-stepped the question on Thursday.
“Illinois’ problems having nothing to do with Donald Trump,” Dabrowski said. “He can’t fix the property taxes. He can’t fix the gas taxes. He can’t fix our outmigration. We have to fix it.”
Mendrick focuses on crime
Dabrowski is joined by DuPage County Sheriff James Mendrick in the race, who called Medicaid cuts signed by Trump “unsustainable,” but said he believes the president is doing a good job overall.
“I don’t really follow the national, the presidential stuff, a whole lot, but I’ll be honest with you: so far what I’m seeing, financially, it looks like he’s doing pretty good,” Mendrick said. “I can’t think of anything that he’s doing right now that I would disagree with.”

Mendrick is leaning into his experience as the only elected official in the Republican primary for governor.
“I know how politics works out there,” Mendrick told reporters, saying that he approaches his job with bipartisanship. “I think I can do a lot better than most other candidates.”
Crime is his top issue – an issue former state Sen. Darren Bailey made the center of his unsuccessful 2022 campaign for governor. But the difference, Mendrick said, is he believes he knows how to address public safety issues because of his work as sheriff.
Mendrick was elected sheriff in 2018 and did not face an opponent in 2022, allowing him to survive a wave of Democratic victories in DuPage County that year. But he still has to convince other Republican leaders to support him.
“He’s done a great job as sheriff, but like any other candidate, you got to get out there, and you got to build a base of support,” Senate Republican Leader John Curran, of DuPage County, told reporters.
Both Dabrowski and Mendrick hinted they have some donors lined up willing to fund their campaigns.
Joe Severino, a Lake Forest businessman who has unsuccessfully run for Congress, has also said he will run for governor.
Tracy to run for Senate
Tracy is getting back into the political arena after resigning as party chair last summer, citing infighting on the party’s State Central Committee. Several other candidates have filed paper work with the Federal Election Commission to run for office, but Tracy is the most notable name to enter the Senate race.

Tracy, an attorney from Springfield who unsuccessfully ran for lieutenant governor in 2010, said he plans to self-fund most of his campaign and believes he can attract voters from all sects of the Republican Party.

“It’s a team effort,” Tracy told Capitol News Illinois. “But having been state chairman, having run statewide before in 2010, I know people throughout the state. A lot of people, I think, will help me, and I’ll need their help. I’ll need the help of all Republicans.”
Tracy has previously been criticized by some in the party for not being more vocal in his support of Trump. At Tracy’s last State Fair as party chair in 2023, Trump was largely ignored. But on Thursday, Tracy said he supports Trump’s agenda.
“The Trump agenda is peace, prosperity and law and order,” Tracy said. “And I think most Americans, including most Illinoisians, support that agenda.”
Voters’ affordability concerns will be Tracy’s top issue, he said.
“For working families, it’s become unaffordable, especially in Illinois, where we have – on top of inflation – we have high taxes,” Tracy said. “It’s going to be hard work, but I’m not afraid of hard work.”
Other races
The choices of statewide candidates for Republican voters in March’s primary are still taking shape. No candidates have emerged for comptroller or treasurer, while Bob Fioretti, a Cook County attorney who has unsuccessfully run for numerous offices in both parties, is planning to run for attorney general.

Diane Harris, a Joliet Junior College trustee who is active in Will County Republican groups and unsuccessfully ran for state senate in 2022, is running for secretary of state. She said lines remain too long at drivers services facilities and new policies putting many services online aren’t working for everyone.
“Even though this is an online era, not everybody is online,” Harris told Capitol News Illinois, adding that people shouldn’t have to make appointments for services that should be available at the offices at anytime.

In legislative races, the Republican leaders in the General Assembly acknowledged the midterm election for a Republican president coupled with Pritzker likely spending millions to help Democrats could create a challenging year for Republican candidates. But Curran said he is hopeful.
“We’re going to be very well positioned defend every seat we have. 2026 is going to be about gains for us,” Curran told reporters as 16 of 19 Republican senators, including himself, are up for reelection next year.

Democrats already have two seats to target in the west suburbs after Sen. Don DeWitte, R-St. Charles, and Rep. Amy Grant, R-Wheaton, announced they will not seek reelection. Both have held their seats in districts that have increasingly leaned Democrat in recent elections.
“Whenever Republicans are on top, the Democrats get activated, and vice versa. However, we’re not going to give up. We’re going to stay activated,” House Minority Leader Tony McCombie, R-Savanna, told reporters.

(Image courtesy of Roblox)Louisiana is suing Roblox, the popular online gaming site, claiming it has distributed child sexual abuse material and fails to protect or notify users of sexual predators. 
Attorney General Liz Murrill filed the lawsuit Thursday in Livingston Parish at the 21st Judicial District Court. The lawsuit alleges Roblox endangers Louisiana children as an unchecked forum for sexual predators to connect with children and allows the sharing of sexually explicit material.
Roblox’s lack of age verification and warnings of the danger pertaining to sexual predators are listed in the lawsuit as key missing elements that could protect children. 
“Due to Roblox’s lack of safety protocols, it endangers the safety of the children of Louisiana. Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety,” Murrill said in a news release. 
Louisiana’s lawsuit follows legal action brought against video game companies with children as a primary user base. A class action lawsuit filed in California in May against the companies that own Minecraft and Fortnite claims the two games cause harm and addiction, and that they encourage unchecked in-game purchases and excessive playing time.  
Murrill’s lawsuit cites an arrest made July 15 in Livingston Parish as an instance of child endangerment linked to Roblox. The suspect possessed child sexual abuse images, actively used the gaming site and used voice-altering technology on his computer to mimic a younger feminine voice, allegedly to lure and sexually exploit young players, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit also cites issues with lack of adequate age verification for Roblox “experiences,” games created by independent users. Games with titles such as Escape to Epstein Island, Diddy Party and Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe can be easily labeled by users in the “all ages (suitable to everyone)” category, according to the lawsuit, making sexually explicit material, simulated sexual activity such as child gang rape, and open trading of child pornography among gamers more accessible to children. 
The state of Louisiana is suing the San Mateo, California-based company for restitution, damages and attorneys fees. 
Roblox has not yet responded to a request for comment about the lawsuit.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Officials from Des Moines Water Works said Thursday a decision from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pertaining to water quality did “not align” with the “operational and financial” challenges the utility has faced in providing safe drinking water to Iowans. 
EPA previously designated seven river segments, including two connected to Des Moines’ source waters, as impaired segments due to high concentrations of nitrates. The agency rescinded the decision in July following pushback from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources on the decision. 
Amy Kahler, the CEO and general manager of Des Moines Water Works, said in a news release the high nitrate levels in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers are making it “increasingly difficult to treat source water.” 
“The Des Moines and Raccoon rivers must have targeted water quality plans to be sustainable sources of drinking water for generations,” Kahler said in the release.

State agencies are required to assess surface water quality every two years and develop a list of impaired water segments. These segments have identified pollutants that exceed EPA standards and are given water improvement plans to reduce the pollutants. 
EPA rejected part of DNR’s 2025 list to add the seven additional segments in November. The agency finalized the decision in January following a public comment period in which DNR officials pushed back on the ruling, saying in a letter that nitrate was not on the list of toxic pollutants under the Clean Water Act and that EPA did not provide reasoning for the decision. 
This summer, Des Moines Water Works and its regional authority, Central Iowa Water Works, banned lawn watering for about a month and half in order to keep the nitrate levels in finished water below safe drinking water standards. 
Des Moines Water Works has been running its nitrate removal system, which is estimated to cost about $16,000 per day, for more than 110 days this summer.

“The impairment of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers threatens our mission and ability to safely (provide) drinking water on behalf of the region to 600,000 central Iowans,” Kahler said. 
According to the EPA Region 7 letter sent to DNR in July, DNR submitted additional information to the federal agency in May as to why the state did not list the seven segments identified by EPA. 
EPA said in the letter it had evaluated different standards from DNR’s evaluation and would therefore rescind the previous designation on the seven segments in order to “further evaluate this rationale” and reconsider the decision. 
Andrea Boulton, chair of the Des Moines Water Works Board of Trustees, said “human health and safety are our top priority.” 
“We cannot lose sight of that amid a disagreement on technical language,” Boulton said in the release. “We clearly have a problem in the state of Iowa when water quality issues prevent our drinking water utilities from being able to make clean, safe water for Iowans.”
The release from the utility also pointed to a recent study, commissioned by Polk County, that evaluated water quality issues in the rivers. It said the report “confirmed what Des Moines Water Works has shared for years – nitrate concentrations in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers are increasing.” 
Des Moines Water Works is not the only group concerned about water quality. Citizen groups and environmental groups, including Iowa Environmental Council have also been outspoken about disapproval with the EPA’s decision. 
Citizen scientists take to Iowa’s waters to monitor nitrate levels

Colleen Fowle, the water program director with Iowa Environmental Council, said this summer “provided a clear picture of the consequences of high nitrate in our drinking water sources.” 
“Iowans across the state have been concerned about nitrate in drinking water on all the rivers that EPA has decided to remove from the impaired waters list,” Fowle said in a statement. “All have regularly exceeded the drinking water standard, but not all the cities relying on them have treatment systems to remove nitrate.” 
The other river segments were on the Cedar River, Iowa River and the South Skunk River.
Fowle said DNR’s evaluation of the impairments looked at a “short-term” measure, rather than long-term data. 
“Looking at only a few years makes no sense for pollutants that can differ from year to year based on streamflow,” Fowle said. “The long-term data show that safe drinking water is at risk. That is precisely what the water quality standard is meant to protect and the reason why these waters need to be listed as impaired.”
Iowa Environmental Council’s General Counsel Michael Schmidt said called the rescission “unprecedented” and “misguided.” 
“We call on EPA and DNR to engage in a public process and bring Iowans together to address nitrate concerns that threaten the health and economic wellbeing of people across Iowa, rather than taking action behind closed doors,” Schmidt said. 
DNR declined to comment on the decision.

A new legislative study commission is looking for ways to change that.    It was “not a large cohort” of foster kids who could have graduated last year, said Rep. […]","A new legislative commission studying graduation rates and other ways to increase academic success for students in foster care held its first meeting on Aug. 13, 2025 in Providence at the Rhode Island State House. (Screenshot/Capitol TV)Rhode Island’s foster kids had a high school graduation rate of 43% in 2024 — the lowest in the state, lower even than students experiencing homelessness. A new legislative study commission is looking for ways to change that.   
It was “not a large cohort” of foster kids who could have graduated last year, said Rep. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat, at the commission’s inaugural meeting Wednesday.  
“It was 178 students,” Casimiro continued. “If we can’t get it right for 178 students to graduate with a high school education, then we’re not doing our job.”
The number represents a downward slide from the 2023 graduation data, when 51% of foster kids graduated.
The 17-member volunteer panel — officially titled the Special Legislative Commission to Study Educational Outcomes for Children in State Care — was created through a resolution passed in May by the Rhode Island House of Representatives. Rep. Marie Hopkins, a Warwick Republican, is also on the commission, plus a mix of state officials, educators, and child welfare advocates. Casimiro, who sponsored the legislation to create the committee, chairs the group. Jeannine Nota-Masse, the superintendent of Cranston Public Schools, is the vice chair.
The commission is charged with creating a final report for the General Assembly by July 1, 2026, and then dissolves on Aug. 15, 2026. 
An analysis of state education department data in the 2025 Rhode Island KIDS COUNT factbook shows that the average four-year graduation rate was 84%, or nearly double the rate at which foster youth graduated. Students experiencing homelessness, which comprised 227 youth in all, also graduated at higher rates than foster kids at 59%. 
Students living in foster care also had the highest dropout rate in the state at 26%.  
Those numbers aren’t all that different from national averages: According to the National Foster Youth Institute, about 50% of foster kids graduate high school, compared to their peers who aren’t in state care. Those challenges can continue into postsecondary education, with the institute citing research that notes only about 3% to 4% of former foster kids acquire a four-year college degree.   
In a 2024 study published in the journal Remedial and Special Education, the study’s sample of foster students averaged a 41% chronic absenteeism rate, compared to 26% for non-foster students. Foster students also failed courses at higher rates, averaging about five across their time in high school, and earned fewer credits. These numbers were even higher for foster students who had disabilities.
Comparable to other states or not, Casimiro said the state’s graduation numbers were “beyond dreadful” — and also tinged with a sense of déjà vu, since the state had previously formed a study commission to study educational outcomes for foster youth in 2012. 
“I don’t know what’s not happening,” Casimiro said. “The adults in the room need to get their act together and work on doing better for this cohort of kids. We should be able to get this right. It’s Rhode Island.” 
‘All he did was sleep’
David Sienko, the director of the Rhode Island Department of Education’s (RIDE) Office of Student, Community and Academic Supports, told his fellow panel members that the state’s data collection on foster youth has improved since that 2012 commission, with stronger linkage between RIDE and the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF), which oversees foster care in the state. 
That includes a data dashboard for educators which tracks foster kids and is meant to help school administrators support these students. DCYF now verifies this data, and the “mechanics of the data system” have gotten more sophisticated in recent years, Sienko said. But he also acknowledged that the data is only valuable if people use it. 
“If I’m a superintendent and I have two kids in my district that are in state care, what does that mean for me?” Sienko said. “What do I do as an educational leader to put those supports in place?’”
Casimiro added that a survey conducted on schools’ use of this information saw only 15 districts respond. 
“Some have the database in front of them, the superintendents, but they’re not sharing it at the building level, and that’s where decisions are being made about these kids,” Casimiro said.










The adults in the room need to get their act together and work on doing better for this cohort of kids. We should be able to get this right. It’s Rhode Island. 


– Rep. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat


Part of the confusion may come from the fact that administrators can be unaware that kinship care — placement with relatives or close family friends — is legally considered foster care in Rhode Island. That doesn’t mean it has any less impact on kids, Casimiro shared an anecdote about a 17-year-old boy from North Kingstown she knows and has been working with. The boy’s mom lives in Atlanta and his dad is “in and out of prison in Maryland,” Casimiro said.
“He lives with his aunt, who works two jobs, and his sister just died of a fentanyl overdose,” Casimiro continued. “This kid is traumatized. Traumatized. He got into a fight at school because someone called him an inappropriate name. They sent him home from school for seven days, unsupervised. Unsupervised for seven days. He thought he’s on vacation. All he did was sleep.”
Casimiro added, “Now it’s not my job to work with him … Now I am going to work with him, make sure that if I can drag him across that stage next June, I’m going to do it.”
Hopkins said the commission needs to hear directly from people who’ve lived in or have been affected by the child welfare system. Casimiro promised a panel of kids and parents would attend an upcoming meeting. 
The commission also flagged transportation and funding as barriers for foster youth. Students can have trouble accessing programs that help academic outcomes, especially if they live far from their schools. And even when initiatives do exist to help them, reliance on short-term grants or federal dollars can make such programs hard to sustain without more lasting state-level commitments.
Katelyn Medeiros, the attorney who heads the Office of the Child Advocate, which is charged with oversight of DCYF, said Rhode Island should look to “states that are getting it right” as models.
Hopkins agreed: “I love the ‘don’t reinvent the wheel’ perspective. … As much as I love the state, we tend to be huge innovators, and we’ve got to do everything bigger, better, newer.” 
The panel’s next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 15.

As of this month, 12 states, mostly Republican and in the South, have opted to limit SNAP recipients from purchasing foods such as soda and candy. (Shalina Chatlani/ Stateline)At least 12 states have received federal approval to restrict recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from using their benefits to purchase certain foods such as soda and candy.
The states receiving waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are overwhelmingly Republican. Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia received approval last week. The feds granted waivers to Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and Utah earlier this year.
SNAP served on average nearly 42 million people a month in fiscal 2024, with about 12% of the U.S. population receiving benefits.
GOP cuts to food assistance would hit rural America especially hard

The trend is part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s agenda to “make America healthy again” by inviting states to apply for waivers to change SNAP rules to limit what types of food recipients can buy.
Kennedy said in a statement that SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to “fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics.”
“These waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health,” the statement said.
Critics of these waivers say the policy could harm people in places such as food deserts, where healthy options are limited, and take away recipients’ power to make their own food choices.
Craig Gundersen, a professor in the Department of Economics at Baylor University, told Stateline that these changes could harm the integrity of the program.
Nebraska first in nation to ban soda, energy drinks from public grocery aid benefits

“One of the main reasons why SNAP is such a successful program is because it gives dignity and autonomy to recipients. It gives dignity to recipients by allowing them to shop in the same manner as their neighbors, friends and family, and it gives autonomy to recipients by saying to families: You are the best ones to make decisions for your families about what to purchase,” Gundersen said.
Gundersen said he worries the restrictions could stigmatize SNAP, which he called one of the best programs for fighting food insecurity.

In July, the university began asking employees to submit personal documentation, such as birth certificates or marriage certificates, to a company with a history of data breaches in order to verify dependent coverage eligibility.

Dozens of unionized staff and faculty members at the University of Vermont protested on Thursday, demanding an end to an ongoing health insurance audit that union leaders say threatens the sensitive information of their members.
Members of the UVM Staff United, United Academics, and United Electrical unions, which together represent more than 2,500 staff and faculty members, gathered on the steps of the Waterman building, and later marched inside of the university’s executive offices, to express their fears around handing over personal information to a third party company.
In July, the university began asking employees to submit personal documentation, such as birth certificates or marriage certificates, to Willis Towers Watson, a multi-national insurance brokerage company. The university hired the firm to verify whether family members and dependents enrolled on employees’ insurance plans were eligible for health benefits.
The university is paying the company a fee range of $109,000 to $114,000 to conduct the audit, according to Adam White, a public information officer with the university.
If employees fail to complete the verification process, their dependents will be removed from the university’s medical, dental and vision plans, according to information posted on the university’s website.
The audit comes as the University of Vermont, like many institutions and companies in the state, has seen ballooning health insurance costs. The university said on its website that it has a “fiduciary duty” to ensure that plans are only used by employees and dependents who are eligible.
In a statement, Chris Lehman, the chief human resources officer at University of Vermont, said that while the audit “differs from past practices at UVM, it is critical for how the university can care for its employees, as it ensures the integrity and sustainability of its healthcare plans.”
Verifying eligibility, Lehman said, “helps protect all employees by minimizing unnecessary costs and mitigating broader financial risks to employees and the institution” and can “help preserve the university’s capacity to assist those who may be in more vulnerable situations.”
“Employee cooperation strengthens the university’s collective ability to care for every member of its community,” he said.
But members of UVM Staff United, United Academics, and UE Local 267 on Thursday decried the process, and said the university administration was forcing its employees to share sensitive family documents with an “unaccountable” multi-national firm.

The university has not produced evidence of insurance fraud, union members said.
In a press release, union leaders pointed to a data breach that Willis Towers Watson reported in 2023 that compromised individuals’ names and social security numbers.
“We’re talking about sharing our birth certificates, our marriage licenses with a company that’s going to have all of our sensitive information that is not our employer, and is not accountable to us,” said Claire Whitehouse, a co-president of the UVM Staff United.
More than 650 unionized employees, in a survey about the audit, said they had concerns about data privacy. And at the rally on Thursday, members described their fears of handing over sensitive documentation to a company with a history of data breaches.

Ellen Kaye, a member and co-president of the UVM Staff United, described the audit as “harmful and chilling,” and likened the practice to the federal government’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.
“The practices of a federal government that is dismantling institutions and firing workers on the premise of getting rid of ‘waste, fraud and abuse’ has come home to Vermont,” she said at the rally.
One employee, whose statement was read anonymously, said they worried about a family member on their insurance plan who was assigned a different gender at birth than is on their documents now.
“If that information gets breached, that could be a problem for that person in this political environment,” Whitehouse said.
Lehman, in a statement, said that the university’s information security office “conducted a thorough review of WTW’s system and approved its use.”
He added that the company “recommends redacting social security numbers from submitted documents, which adds another layer of protection to the process.”
Kaye, Whitehouse and other union members called on the university’s new president, Marlene Tromp, to meet with the unions next week to discuss the audit process in bargaining.
If not, they said they would “take their message to the incoming class of 2029 at convocation,” Kaye said.
“The university wants to review its health insurance options, that’s within its right,” Whitehouse said, “but how it affects employees and its implications are mandatory subjects of bargaining, and we want to bargain how that impacts us.”

[…]","SmartScripts is a multimillion-dollar business and state-licensed pharmacy operating out of this location in Washington, Iowa. (Photo via Google Earth) An Iowa pharmacy that has been sued by business partners for millions of dollars is now being sanctioned by the state for distributing counterfeit Ozempic.
The Iowa Board of Pharmacy is, however, allowing the company SmartScripts, which has past ties to agribusinessman and former Iowa Board of Regents President Bruce Rastetter, to keep its license.
According to the board, SmartScripts, a state-licensed pharmacy in Washington, Iowa, ordered the popular weight loss drug Ozempic from a wholesale supplier, Pharma Pac, in November 2023. The order was for one case of 1,260 Ozempic “pens” designed to deliver 4 milligrams of the drug.
The board alleges that one week later, on Nov. 28, 2023, SmartScripts received 15 cases, not one case, of the drug from Pharma Pac. On Dec. 7, 2023, SmartScripts allegedly shipped the drugs to Central Pharmacy Management in Lansing, Michigan, which then distributed the product to at least two other pharmacies.
The board alleges that several days later, on Dec. 18, 2023, SmartScripts’ owner, Todd Thompson, received a call from Pharma Pac requesting payment for all 15 cases of the product. For reasons the board has not disclosed or explained, Thompson then quarantined the Ozempic still in his possession and asked the pharmacies that had received the drug from him to refrain from selling any of the product.
On Dec. 21, 2023, the board alleges, Thompson “became aware” the Ozempic he had purchased was counterfeit. According to the board, Thompson failed to report the matter to the Board of Pharmacy until July 2024.
In January 2025, the board charged SmartScripts with knowingly making misleading or untrue representations in the practice of pharmacy; violating a state law in the practice of pharmacy; committing willful or gross negligence; obtaining a fee by fraud or false representations; failure to maintain accurate records as required by law; and obtaining or possessing drugs without lawful authority.
To settle the case, the Board of Pharmacy recently agreed to let SmartScripts keep its license, which will be placed on probationary status for five years. The company will also be required to pay a $25,000 civil penalty, according to board records.
Thompson disputes board’s chronology
Thompson said Thursday the board’s final order in the disciplinary case incorrectly describes the sequence of events in the matter.
He said he first became aware his Ozempic was counterfeit when he was notified by the Food and Drug Administration a few days after he sold the product to Central Pharmacy Management. He said he immediately contacted CPM to inform his buyer of the situation, and said none of the counterfeit drugs reached any patients.
“We cooperated with the FDA and this is still an ongoing investigation,” he said. “I think more than 100 pharmacies nationwide got scammed on this. My violation occurred because I sold to another pharmacy, unaware that they couldn’t sell in that quantity to another pharmacy.”
In court filings, CPM has outlined a different chain of events. CPM is suing SmartScripts, alleging the Iowa company and Thompson “were aware” the drugs it sold to CPM for $132,249 were counterfeit — and, in the alternative, if they were unaware they must have “acted negligently in selling counterfeit drugs without ensuring that they were legitimate.”
CPM also claims that on Dec. 7, 2023, it received its shipment from SmartScripts, and that on Dec. 27, 2023, a special agent with the FDA informed the company the drugs it had purchased from SmartScripts were counterfeit. CPM claims it then reached out to SmartScripts to report the drugs were counterfeit and had been confiscated by the FDA, at which point Thompson stopped returning CPM’s calls.
SmartScripts has denied any wrongdoing and a trial is currently scheduled for Sept. 16, 2025.
SmartScripts sued over COVID-19 test kits
Launched in 2017, SmartScripts claims to be the first telepharmacy in Iowa and delivers pharmaceuticals directly to consumers in all 50 states.
The company has marketed, sold, and delivered medications in part by using automated telemarketing, or robocalls, facilitated by the acquisition of telephone numbers from data brokers. In 2023, the company was the target of a class-action lawsuit for allegedly calling individuals whose names are on the national Do Not Call Registry.
SmartScripts admitted using phone numbers purchased from data brokers but denied deliberately calling individuals on the Do Not Call Registry. Within a few months, the case was settled out of court. A similar lawsuit was filed and settled out of court in 2022.
SmartScripts was also sued last year by a Maryland company called Tiero. That company claimed it was in the business of selling at-home COVID-19 test kits to individuals. Customers would order the kits on Tiero’s website and provide Tiero with their insurance information. Tiero would then purchase the kits from a third party and arrange to have them shipped to the customer.
Because insurers required billing for the kits to be submitted though a licensed pharmacy, Tiero hired SmartScripts to submit those bills to the customers’ insurance companies, with the understanding that SmartScripts, in return for a fee of $5 to $10 per kit, would route the insurance money to Tiero.
“Instead of forwarding the funds as required, SmartScripts improperly retained the funds and wrongfully used them to fund SmartScripts’ business,” the lawsuit alleged. “As part of this scheme, SmartScripts has misappropriated almost $3 million that is rightfully due to Tiero.”
Court records show that in July 2024, SmartScripts agreed to a consent judgment requiring it to pay Tiero $3,052,575 “to avoid the time and cost of litigation without admitting to any allegations.”
Last year, SmartScripts was sued in Missouri state court by KB Evans Drugs. SmartScripts allegedly failed to respond to the lawsuit, resulting in a judgment against the company in the amount of $68,154.
SmartScripts has also been sued in Ohio state court by Capital Wholesale Drug Company. As with the Missouri case, SmartScripts allegedly failed to respond to the Ohio lawsuit, resulting in a judgment against the company in the amount of $65,514.
Last year, SmartScripts was sued in federal court by a Texas-based supplier, the McKesson Corporation, for $2.1 million in allegedly unpaid bills.  That lawsuit named the three principal members of SmartScripts as Thompson, Samuel Zoske of Solon and Rastetter.
Thompson said Thursday that Rastetter was an investor in the company many years ago and has not been involved in the business since that time. The McKesson lawsuit was settled out of court in June 2025.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SS.jpg,,,2025-08-14 17:57:27.886234

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach on Thursday asked a federal court to remove Gov. Laura Kelly from a multi-state lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s refusal to release grant money to states.
Kelly joined 22 states and the District of Columbia in the lawsuit last month. Kobach, a Republican, said the Democratic governor doesn’t have the authority under Kansas law to represent the state in federal litigation.
“The governor is purporting to represent the state of Kansas and claiming that Kansas demands and wants the federal government to continue spending this money that these federal agencies have deemed to be unnecessary and wasteful,” Kobach told legislative leaders at a meeting Thursday at the Statehouse.
The states sued the Office of Management and Budget over decisions by President Donald Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, to terminate billions of dollars in federal funding that had been allocated by Congress. The lawsuit argues those cuts have had a devastating impact on state efforts to combat violent crime, educate students, safeguard public health, protect clean drinking water, conduct medical and scientific research, provide meals for students in school, and ensure access to unemployment benefits.
When the governor joined the lawsuit, her office said the Trump administration had terminated “millions of dollars used to purchase goods from Kansas farmers, to mitigate natural disasters and to enhance childhood education.” Her office didn’t immediately respond to a Kansas Reflector inquiry on Thursday.
Kobach appeared before the Legislative Coordinating Council, which consists of five Republicans and two Democrats, to ask for a statement of support in dropping Kansas from the litigation. He said he filed an amicus brief Thursday to inform the Massachusetts federal court of his assertion that state law allows only the attorney general to represent the state in federal litigation.
“Otherwise the court might assume that a governor walking into a federal court might have the authority to represent the state in court, but under Kansas law, that is not the case,” Kobach said.
The council on a party-line vote approved a motion made by House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican who is running for state insurance commissioner, that declares the governor is violating Kansas law and should be dropped from the case.
“Even if the attorney general were representing Kansas, doing so would not be in the state’s interest,” Hawkins said.
Kobach also said Kelly had asked him to join the lawsuit and that he refused because he believes it is destined to fail. He pointed to the Trump administration’s insistence that a federal regulation allows agencies to terminate a grant if it no longer effectuates agency priorities.
“We don’t believe that any state has the ability to compel the federal agency to spend the money, and so, purely on legal grounds, we rejected the governor’s request,” Kobach said.
He said the states could get a favorable ruling at the district court level in Massachusetts, where the case was filed, but that their legal claims “are not winners.”
“We’ve all heard in the news there are district judges on every position on the political spectrum, and judicial, ideological, jurisprudential spectrum,” Kobach said. “When this case goes up on appeal, the states seeking the grants are going to lose.”
In the lawsuit, the states argue that the Trump administration is attempting to redefine a regulation that has never before been used to justify an agency withholding grant money “when the agency simply changes its mind.”
The regulation “provides no support for a broad power to terminate grants on a whim based on newly identified agency priorities,” the lawsuit said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P6170150-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-14 17:57:27.886234

Mark Smith officially launched his bid to represent South Carolina’s coastal 1st Congressional District.
The 55-year-old Daniel Island Republican plans an announcement event Thursday evening event at New Realm Brewery. Smith did not respond to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.
In a campaign video released earlier in the day, Smith railed against “do-nothing politicians” and painted himself as “a man that gets things done” and who President Donald “Trump can count on.”
“Mark Smith is going to shake up Congress,” the video voiceover announces.
If elected, Smith would replace Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., who is one of five Republicans running for governor in 2026.
Voters first elected Smith, CEO of McAlister-Smith Funeral Homes, in 2020 to the state House seat previously held by Mace. Before moving to Daniel Island and representing parts of Berkeley County in the Statehouse, he was a Mount Pleasant town councilman.
But he grew up in rural South Carolina. The married father of three is a native of Bamberg.
Smith’s priorities, according to his campaign website, include combatting illegal immigration and foreign drug trafficking, cutting federal spending, cutting taxes and reducing regulations.
In the campaign video, he touted his support for state-level income tax cuts and a special immigration enforcement unit at the State Law Enforcement Division.
Smith was among supporters of a 2022 law that cut income tax rates and reduced state revenues by more than $1 billion. The law, which passed both chambers unanimously, was expected to be phased in over five years. Instead, legislators completed the phase-in early with the budget that took effect July 1.
He was also one of 55 co-sponsors on the House GOP’s “historic” tax cut plan, which is still pending at the Statehouse. Republicans, amid public outcry, revamped the original plan after an analysis showed 60% of tax filers would have actually paid more in taxes. The new version reduces the number of tax brackets and lowers collections by $400 million in year one.

Smith also voted in favor of a 2024 law that moved the state’s Illegal Immigration Enforcement Unit from the state Department of Public Safety to SLED. Gov. Henry McMaster started pushing for the change in 2017, shortly after he became governor.
In addition to the move, the law reinforced a 2008 law requiring SLED to enter into an agreement with U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement to aid federal agents.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)The state Health Plan Board of Trustees plans a vote Friday on a proposal that will for the first time set premiums according to how much state employees earn. 
Premiums would increase substantially for the state’s top earners. 
Premiums will increase $10 a month, to $35 monthly, for state employees and teachers enrolled in the standard insurance plan, make $50,000 or less, and have coverage for only themselves.  That same coverage will cost $80 a month for employees who make more than $90,000. 
The premium this year for workers who insure only themselves under the standard plan and say they don’t smoke is $25, no matter how much they make. 
The proposal establishes four salary tiers: under $50,000, $50,001-$65,000, $65,000-$90,000, and $90,001 and more. Premiums increase from tier to tier. 
The premium increases and other changes to the health insurance plan that covers 750,000 state employees, teachers, and retirees would help erase a deficit that is running at $507 million this year. 
State employees have gone seven years without premium increases. The plan has been using cash reserves to help pay the bills. The health plan is operating at a loss and reserves are running low. 
“The past eight years, the state Health Plan was spending more money than it was taking in,” executive administrator Tom Friedman said Thursday.  
“The previous Treasurer came in with significant reserves. Those reserves are gone. As health care costs continue to increase, without reserves we had to make pretty significant changes to make sure that we were solvent,” he said. 
The proposed changes will put the insurance plan on solid fiscal footing into 2028, Friedman said. 
About $150 million to $200 million included in the stop-gap state budget the legislature approved last month also helps address the deficit. 
The median salary for state agency employees was about $57,000, according to state Department of Human Resources’ June data. For state university employees, the median salary was about $52,000 a year. The average teacher salary was about $58,000 a year in 2023-2024.  
Premiums will drop for employees who make $90,000 and less if they opt for insurance coverage for themselves and their children. Reducing premiums for dependent coverage has been a long-time State Health Plan goal. 
This year, premiums for state employees and their children are $218 a month under the basic plan. Premiums for comparable coverage will drop to $185 a month for employees who make less than $50,000.
Breast cancer screening techniques that go beyond standard mammography, such as MRIs and ultrasound, will be free. 
State employees said earlier this year that increases would come as a hard blow because the low premiums are seen as a balance to low wages. 
While health insurance costs are rising for state employees, they are not guaranteed raises this year. House and Senate Republicans have not agreed on a comprehensive state budget for the fiscal year that started July 1 that would include state employee and teacher raises. 
The health insurance plan overhaul has been a multi-step process that will continue after Friday’s vote. 
In May, the trustees voted to raise out-of-pocket costs in the form of increased deductibles and copays for some medical care. 
Last month, state Treasurer Brad Briner announced active members and their families covered under the health plan will be able to receive certain surgeries at no cost through a network organized by the company Lantern.
The health plan is continuing to work to lower surgical costs for enrollees. It is negotiating with health systems to lower prices for specific surgeries in exchange for being designated as preferred locations for treatment. 
“It’s a substantial overhaul,” Friedman said. “Historically, the state health plan has been every member can have access to any provider with the same cost sharing across the board. We’re going in a different direction in trying to align member incentives with provider incentives with the plan incentives, and really using market forces to try to drive better prices for our members for higher quality care.”

Patrick Morrisey announced the West Virginia Infrastructure and Jobs Development Council has awarded $3.4 million in funds for five water and sewer projects in Kanawha, Marion, and Richie counties on Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025, in Fairmont, W.Va. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced millions of dollars in water and sewer project investments across the state on Thursday.
The money being disbursed totals about $14 million and is split between grants ($4.96 million) and a “low-interest” loan of $9.2 million. Combined, the money will go to projects in six different communities in four different counties. 
A majority of the grant funds — all but $1.34 million — comes from the state Infrastructure and Jobs Development Council, which is a clearing house for infrastructure projects in the state. The remaining grant funds will be disbursed by the state Department of Environmental Protection’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund.
Water and sewage projects in West Virginia tend to be high-cost, but also highly necessary. Water infrastructure is rapidly aging across the state and dilapidated service structures often lead numerous communities to going without adequate drinking water service. Other areas of the state are still not connected to centralized water and sewage systems, relying instead on private wells or outdated septic systems that can illegally drain sewage directly into drinking water sources.
According to the IJDC’s 2023 Needs Assessment, the state needs to spend at least $13.9 billion to both expand water and sewage services to every existing structure and maintain the services lines that already exist. Per the report, however, the future needs “may be understated by as much as $4 billion,” raising the total monetary need to nearly $18 billion.
On Thursday, Morrisey said the water infrastructure investments were crucial to help the state compete economically.
“You can’t talk about growing your economy if you don’t have basic infrastructure in place. We’re certainly working to make that happen,” Morrisey said. “These are the basics, and I’m excited that we’re focusing on the basics. That’s how West Virginia is going to soar.”
Projects announced Thursday are as follows:
Kanawha County
Communities throughout Kanawha County will receive a total of $1.9 million in grants and $9.2 million from a singular loan to the Kanawha County Regional Development Authority.
Per a release from the governor, $1 million in IJDC grant funds will be awarded to the authority in addition to the $9.2 million loan to extend centralized water service to 110 new customers in Olcott. Work has been ongoing to connect Olcott residents to centralized water service for several years. 
The total project cost for the Olcott area is about $11.4 million. With the newly announced funds — which will come in addition to funds from the Kanawha County Commission, the Kanawha County RDA and a “private utility partner” — the total project costs have been covered. 
It’s likely that the “private utility partner” for the Olcott project is West Virginia American Water, as the water company has been in talks since at least 2021 to provide service for the area and is the only private water utility operating in Kanawha County. It’s unclear if the money given for the project will cover the tap fee for residents to connect to the centralized service, which can cost around $300 per a household.
In Marmet, $400,000 in IJDC grant funds will go toward repairing a “stream embankment failure” at the Marmet Wastewater Treatment Plant. The total project cost is $440,000 which, along with funds from the Marmet Sanitary Board, has now been completely raised.
And lastly, the Elk Valley Public Service District will receive a $500,000 in IJDC grant funds to modify chlorine tanks at the sewage system. The upgrade will allow the utility to use “alternative means of disinfection” within the system. Per the release, the project will largely affect 4,500 customers in the Elkview area. The total project cost is about $1.16 million, which has now been met.
Harrison County
The town of Anmoore, in Harrison County, will receive $1.34 million in grants from the WVDEP’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund for various projects. Those include replacing failing lines, installing 24 new fire hydrants and upgrading meters. 
The total project cost is $3.56 million and will affect service for about 475 people, per the release.
Marion County
The Greater Paw Paw Public Service District will receive $500,000 in IJDC grant funds to repair seven pump stations in its sewage system. The project will largely affect about 157 customers in the Baxter area. The total project cost is $1 million, which has now been raised. 
Ritchie County
The town of Cairo will receive $1 million in IJDC grant funds to replace a river-crossing water line and perform “other system improvements.” The total project cost is $4.2 million and will affect 157 customers throughout the municipality’s service area.

DonahueSecond bites at the apple are sometimes scarce for political candidates who lost by wide margins to their opponents in a previous election cycle, but that hasn’t deterred attorney Matt DePerno from filing paperwork to run again for the position of Michigan attorney general in 2026.
DePerno, who is currently facing felony charges for the alleged mishandling of local voting equipment following the 2020 election, ran for attorney general in 2022 and emerged as the Michigan Republican Party’s nominee following a tense convention battle.
The attorney went on to lose that contest against incumbent Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel by nearly 10 percentage points in the November 2022 general election.
Campaign finance paperwork filed Wednesday shows DePerno is again seeking the position, but will have to get through the party’s delegates in order to secure that nomination. The respective political parties endorse and then formally nominate their candidates for the position of attorney general and secretary of state in the spring and fall of election years, and those candidates do not have to endure the public primary process.
They do, however, have to endure tough convention floor fights, the kind that DePerno was able to capitalize on when he bested former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard and former state Rep. Ryan Berman in the leadup to the 2022 race.
DePerno tried again to insert himself into a leadership position with the party when he ran to be the chairman of the MIGOP, but the party’s delegates chose former secretary of state nominee Kristina Karamo – who was later ousted by a rogue faction of the party that later installed former chair Pete Hoekstra.
It’s unclear how the party’s delegates under the leadership of chairman and state Sen. Jim Runestad (R-Whitelake) will view DePerno’s candidacy and chances this time around.
A request for comment to DePerno has yet to be answered.

Animal breeding without a license is a potential misdemeanor that can carry significant fines. 
“We’re thrilled to share that Jett (Dr. Yach’s beloved dog) has had 7 beautiful Labrador Retriever puppies,” says an email sent to Yach’s clients last week by his office. “These adorable puppies are AKC registered and come in a variety of beautiful colors.”
The “adoption fee” for the puppies — five females and two males — is $1,800 each, according to the email. 
Yach, a Clark County spokeswoman says, has no breeding license. 
The Clark County Commission recently increased penalties for unlicensed breeders. A first offense warrants a fine of $500 per animal or the cost of the animal as offered for sale, whichever is more. The cost of a breeding permit is $400. 
Yach declined to be interviewed. 
“Dr Yach is aware that there are many groups that are upset with the fact that his personal pet has had puppies and at this point, Dr Yach is not a breeder. He believes in spaying and neutering pets,” Julie Johnson, Yach’s hospital manager, said during a phone interview Wednesday.
“The act of breeding your dog makes you a breeder,” said animal activist Bryce Henderson, who was provided the pup solicitation by two of Yach’s clients. 
Henderson, founder of No Kill Las Vegas, says the incident is evidence that the public is uneducated about breeding, assuming Yach didn’t know the law. 
“You would think someone who works in the animal field, and especially a veterinarian, would be aware of the crisis we’re in and how many animals are being killed at the shelter, and that we don’t need more puppies right now,” Henderson said Thursday.

It’s more evidence that relying on the fossil fuel industry to address a problem after the fact – rather than preventing it in the first place – continues to prove pointless. In this latest instance, a framework set up with the direct input of oil and gas interests appears to have collapsed under the weight of self-dealing and shoddy bookkeeping.
A lawsuit filed Friday in a state court in Baton Rouge asks a judge to issue a temporary restraining order to prevent the Louisiana Oilfield Restoration Association from tossing any business records, The Advocate reported. Louisiana parted ways with LORA after an audit last year showed it was failing to keep pace with abandoned and neglected wells. A separate review raised questions about the association’s financial practices.   
Among the allegations state officials have lobbed at LORA is that it helped arrange a $780,000 home loan for Johnny Adams, the former assistant commissioner for the state Office of Conservation. Adams helped establish LORA in 2019 and fashioned its cooperative endeavor agreement with the state, according to the lawsuit. It set up a fee schedule for oil and gas exploration companies that LORA collected to pay for orphan well remediation. 
Adams’ attorney told The Advocate his client’s home loan was arranged with Chromos Wealth Services – and not LORA. The state included Chromos as one of the defendants in its lawsuit, claiming it’s among the companies that received investment fees from the association and benefited from its tight-knit relationships.
It’s arguable that close-kin business ties were inevitable from the start when LORA was established as a for-profit entity with minimal oversight from the state. Last year’s audit noted that while the Office of Conservation allowed the association to increase the fee it collected for administrative costs, there was no way to review LORA’s spending to see if it was justifiable.     
LORA stands by its work. In a statement to The Advocate, spokesman David LaPlante said “the current administration has different plans for addressing orphan wells,” and that LORA will address the state’s allegations in court. 
The audit counted 976 plugged orphaned wells during fiscal years 2020-23 based on numbers from LORA and the state’s Oilfield Site Restoration Program. But during that same period, nearly 1,700 new orphaned wells were reported.
The Office of Conservation gave the association its official kiss of death in May, saying it no longer recognized LORA as an “acceptable financial institution” to help drillers meet financial security requirements in Louisiana. Six years ago, it was created to provide what amounts to insurance for exploration projects, then given authority to collect fees for abandoned and spent well cleanup.
The writing on the wall for LORA came in spring 2024 when the Louisiana Legislature approved the creation of the Natural Resources Trust Authority, a subdivision of the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources. It was pitched as an opportunity to bring oversight of orphan well remediation in house and find a more reliable funding source for the work.
There’s skepticism over whether the state will make appreciable progress in addressing its orphan well issues. Last year’s audit estimated it would cost more than $500 million to cap and clean the number of wells needing attention at the time, which was nearly 4,800. Furthermore, the number of inactive wells — ones with a high risk of becoming orphaned — exceeded 21,600.
Gov. Jeff Landry has reconfigured his Department of Energy and Natural Resources (he added “Energy” to its name) with a decided lean toward fossil fuel interests. Its secretary, Tyler Gray, was hired away from one of the state’s leading oil and gas lobbying groups with a $60,000 salary increase compared with the person who previously held the department’s top job.
Certainly, LORA’s inadequacies leave lots of room for improvement for a state-led effort to plug orphan wells. But it remains to be seen whether Landry and legislators — and their eventual successors, given the scope of the problem – can fund a long-term solution. 
Until they are willing to require the oil and gas industry to take financial responsibility for the mess it’s left behind in Louisiana, there’s little hope conditions will improve – leaving Louisianians to face the risk and cost.

Measles symptoms can take one to three weeks to develop, but people can spread the virus even before symptoms develop.
(iStock / Getty Images Plus)State health officials reported three new measles cases in Santa Fe County on Thursday, pushing New Mexico’s infection count to 100 since the outbreak in west Texas spilled across the state line in mid-February.
The New Mexico Department of Health said the three new infections — with the most recent positive recorded on Aug. 10 – were for  two adults and one child who tested positive. All were unvaccinated. No hospitalizations were reported. New Mexico health officials update the case counts every Thursday.
“We remain grateful New Mexicans continue to get their measles vaccination in an effort to slow the spread of the virus,” health department Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham said in a news release. “Without that, measles outbreaks are more likely to last longer and grow over time.”
The three new cases bring Santa Fe’s total to five cases. All five of the Santa Fe County cases were tied to exposures from an airplane flight, health department spokesperson Robert Nott told Source NM in an email. None were linked to the warning issued after a child with measles exposed people at popular art installation Meow Wolf.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared measles eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, with sporadic outbreaks due to international travel. The 2025 outbreak has been the largest national case count in 33 years, driven by falling vaccination rates spread by misinformation. Gaines County, Texas, which ignited the outbreak of over 1,300 cases nationwide, has some of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S. Three people, including two school-age children in Texas and one adult in Lea County, have died. All three were unvaccinated.
Measles, a highly contagious respiratory virus, spreads through contact with airborne particles from an infected person’s coughs and sneezes. These particles can linger in the air for hours.
Infected people  can spread the disease several days before symptoms appear. It can take between one and three weeks for symptoms to show, which include: headache, fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a spotted red rash spreading from the head and face, down the body. About one in five cases has severe complications including pneumonia, brain swelling and even death.
There is no specific treatment for measles, but health officials urge individuals to get two doses of the measles vaccine. The vaccine can prevent catching the disease, ease symptom severity and stop the spread.
Health officials report a 73% increase in New Mexicans seeking the measles vaccine this year  compared to 2024, administering 48,620 vaccines since Feb. 1.
New Mexicans can check their vaccination record online at Vax View. Questions for scheduling vaccinations or symptoms can be directed to the Department of Health Helpline at 1-833-796-8773.
A list of vaccination clinics is available on the state’s measles website.

Bob Ferguson on Thursday announced the hiring of a Biden administration executive to lead the state Department of Social and Health Services whose programs serve nearly a quarter of Washington’s population.
Ferguson chose Angela Ramirez, chief of staff to former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, to guide the department that oversees vocational rehabilitation, long-term care, behavioral health treatment and developmental disabilities services.

Ferguson said Ramirez’s “deep experience in delivering essential human services, and focus on collaboration makes her exceptionally well-suited for this role. She will provide the direction and strategic vision needed to effectively deliver critical services across Washington.”
Ramirez, a California native, will start Sept. 22 and earn an annual salary of $258,744.
She will oversee an agency with about 18,000 full-time employees and a $25 billion two-year budget. Its multiple programs, including the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and the Office of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance, serve about 2 million people.  The agency also oversees court-ordered behavioral health treatment at state hospitals, the Special Commitment Center and other facilities.
Under Ferguson, there’s been an organizational restructuring to streamline access to services and supports.
In a statement, Ramirez said she understood the importance of supportive public services, noting her parents were farmworkers who experienced homelessness.
“Whether someone needs housing, a job, mental health care, or simply the dignity of choice — I believe in the power of government to help individuals shape their own lives,” she said.
Following the 2020 election, Ramirez was a senior staff member on President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team. She served a year as a special assistant to the president in the Office of Legislative Affairs, becoming Becerra’s deputy chief of staff in 2022. She was chief of staff until Jan. 20 when Donald Trump was sworn in as president.
Prior to joining the Biden administration, Ramirez spent nearly two decades working in congressional roles including a stint as executive director of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and more than a decade as chief of staff to then-U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico. Lujan now serves in the U.S. Senate.
Ramirez is the second Biden administration official on Ferguson’s team. In January, the governor tapped Casey Sixkiller, then a regional administrator of the federal Environmental Protection Agency, to lead the Department of Ecology.
Her hiring ends the governor’s monthslong search to fill the critical post.
Ferguson asked Cheryl Strange, then secretary of corrections, to delay a planned retirement and serve as acting DSHS secretary as he conducted a nationwide search. Strange led the agency from 2017 to 2021.

Slow Birding, a meditative and insightful form of birding, is a new concept in Vermont and beyond. Birding enthusiast Bridget Butler has emerged as the reigning “Bird Diva.”

Kate Kampner and Camryn Woods are reporters with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
ENOSBURG — The percentage of Vermont residents who make an outing out of observing birds is greater than any other state in the nation, according to the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department. It’s no wonder — the state’s diverse ecosystems, from lakeside wetlands to hardwood forests, make it a hotspot for a variety of birds. 
For Enosburg resident Bridget Butler, these outings have defined both a lifestyle and a business. Self-monikered the “Bird Diva,” Butler has been practicing and teaching a new form of birding for the last 11 years called “Slow Birding.”
The act of birding gained traction in the 1800s when individuals would go out and physically collect specimens. Nowadays, traditional birding typically consists of collecting the names of unique or interesting birds that one has observed. In some cases, it has taken a competitive form where birders try to be the first one to spot a species. 
Butler’s Slow Birding is the most recent evolution in the activity’s lifespan. Butler said her form of birding is more “intentional,” and invites birders to slow down and be present with the birds while also connecting with the landscape. 
“In traditional birding, we don’t talk about how birds make us feel or what they remind us of or where birds can take us in our own life experience,” she said. 
Her business, Butler said, stemmed from her move to Vermont and from smaller birding gigs she operated while working for the Vermont Audubon Society. After eight years of traditional birding experience, she realized that she had been yearning for a more contemplative practice.
“I followed what felt good and what helped me feel like my most authentic self,” she said. “So, that was sitting in place. That was watching birds for longer periods of time on a regular basis in the same spot over and over again. I wanted to linger.”
Butler hosts Friday morning coffee sessions, Slow Birding retreats, and birding events throughout the year.
During her outings, Butler follows a three-part framework. The first part allows her participants to become aware of the birds on the landscape by encouraging them to describe what they see as a group, rather than asking them to immediately identify a bird. 
During the second part of her outings, Butler asks participants to sit alone in nature for 45 minutes and journal about what they notice. She gives them prompts but lets them decide what they want to do with the time. 
The third part brings them back as a group to discuss their observations. Butler said that this framework lets members of all birding skills participate equally. 
“I’m constantly surprised by how it moves people,” Butler said. 
Erin Creley, a St. Albans resident, has been attending Butler’s bird walks, weekend retreats and coffee talks for the last five years. She found Slow Birding during the 2020 pandemic when her work in healthcare felt overwhelming. 
“Slow Birding has given me a language to describe the feelings I’m having when I’m in nature; the joy that I have, the awe,” Creley said.

This practice isn’t without its difficulties though. Any outdoor activity is subject to the unpredictability of nature.
This July, for example, Butler cancelled her second Slow Birding outing after air quality levels reached above 160, which is considered “unhealthy” by the U.S. Air Quality Index.
“Climate has its way,” Butler said. “When you lead people, their care and safety is in your hands.”
As a result of these weather events, Butler now has thresholds for air quality, rain, snow and extreme heat and cold. 
Fortunately, Butler said that she hasn’t had to cancel an event due to flooding simply due to the timing and location of her outings. If she does encounter a conflict in the future, though, she always has a backup date planned.
Despite the unpredictability of the weather, Butler said her membership is strong. Along with connecting with the landscape, participants have also voiced an appreciation for the community-building aspect of the birding outings. 
“It was great to breathe and talk birds with people around me,” said Diane Brown, a frequent birder and participant of Butler’s sessions. “They were all there for the same reason.”
Brown said the sessions take her back to an old-school mindset that prompted her love for birding. Brown’s been birding for almost 40 years and has seen firsthand how birding culture has changed over time. 
“It’s no longer about the birds,” she said in regards to traditional birding culture which she felt has been overtaken by competition and technology. “I like how (Butler) encouraged our own experience rather than the experience of computer technology,” Brown said.
With Butler, Brown said “It’s about where I stand, what I’m looking at, what I’m hearing. Who I’m with.” 
Despite having her outings and retreats in Vermont, Butler doesn’t limit her teachings to just the one state. She also offers online Slow Birding courses, which has allowed birders from across the country to access her methodologies. 
Joy Rochester, a North Carolina resident, is one of them. She took her first course with Butler a year and a half ago, which consisted of six two-hour-long classes — one of which she participated in during a trip to Arizona.
“It was really neat to observe what was around me in Arizona, because I’m not used to those birds and those sounds. Even the air around me [was] different,” Rochester said. “I realized then I could transfer what I was learning to a lot of different places and be better at sensing things around me.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight) SIOUX FALLS — The University of South Dakota announced Thursday it plans to move the state’s only medical school from Vermillion to Sioux Falls. 
Starting in 2027, students will attend temporary locations provided by Sanford Health. USD President Sheila Gestring said the university plans to build a new Sioux Falls facility in seven to 10 years, costing about $150 million. She hopes most of the funding will come from donors.
The medical school has been in Vermillion for 51 years.

The move will increase the school’s competitiveness and improve clinic and research access for beginning medical students, Gestring said. Two of South Dakota’s three major health systems — Sanford and Avera — are based in Sioux Falls, and there is also a Veterans Affairs hospital in the city. 
Gov. Larry Rhoden said the move will benefit South Dakota.
“Students standing here with us will have more opportunities for clinical experiences, and they’ll develop closer ties to our South Dakota health systems,” Rhoden said, gesturing to dozens of USD medical students at the announcement. “When they graduate, we should expect to see more of them stay right here in South Dakota.”
Vermillion leaders respond
Vermillion’s population is just under 12,000, making it one of the smallest cities with a medical school in the nation. 
There are 57 medical students living in Vermillion, while most other students already commute from Sioux Falls.
It’ll also impact 24 faculty, 15 researchers and 29 staff within the medical school, Gestring told South Dakota Searchlight. About half of the 24 faculty members commute from Sioux Falls. The university will offer others based in Vermillion relocation packages or the opportunity to switch positions within the university.
Vermillion Mayor Jon Cole responded to Searchlight with a written statement.
“The most difficult part of this decision is its impact on the faculty and staff who have built their careers and lives here in Vermillion,” he said. “We recognize the university’s challenging position and understand the factors that led to this choice, but we also know that change is never easy.”
The loss of dozens of students and families from Vermillion will hurt, said City Council President Rich Holland, but the move could open up some needed housing.
“I won’t say I’m looking forward to it, but I understand it,” Holland said in a phone interview. “It’s a shift that needs to be done for the benefit of the students.”

Republican South Dakota state Sen. Sydney Davis, whose district includes Vermillion, said she’s heard some residents say they’re worried the town is losing the university to Sioux Falls. But she said other programs at the Vermillion campus are growing, and the move will provide better efficiencies for the programs already existing on campus.
Gestring said the university doesn’t have plans to wholly relocate any other programs to Sioux Falls. The university has expanded several programs to Sioux Falls to meet workforce needs, including education and nursing, and plans more expansion.
The move to Sioux Falls will open up part of the Lee Medicine Building on the Vermillion campus, which houses the medical school and the School of Health Sciences. University officials plan to move some programs housed in the Akeley-Lawrence Science Center into the vacated space due to structural problems in the center.
The move will allow those programs to grow in the larger space and could benefit the Vermillion community in the future, Gestring said.
“Be patient,” Gestring said. “My hope is that we will replace those 57 students with a whole lot more than 57 students.”
Students react
Some students attending the event were supportive of the move. 
Fourth-year medical student Tanner Berg plans to go into anesthesiology and practice in South Dakota. He formerly lived in Vermillion and said it was difficult to find housing.
Vermillion is “isolated” from research and clinicians, he added, and moving to Sioux Falls will improve access and students’ education.
Earlier access to research will improve education as well, said Tim Ridgway, vice president of health affairs and Sanford School of Medicine dean.
The move will allow students to learn from professionals, apply their experience right away and think more critically, he said, which will improve treatment for South Dakotans.
“That’s when they retain the information,” Ridgway said. “That’s when they become true physicians.”

(William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)This story originally appeared on New Hampshire Bulletin. 
On Wednesday, Gov. Kelly Ayotte said New Hampshire has “open arms” for visitors from Canada. The data suggests that gesture hasn’t been enough to persuade them to cross the border.
New Hampshire business officials say tourism from Canada is down roughly 30% amid rising tension between the Trump administration and Canadian government.
“Absolutely the Canadian numbers are lower,” Taylor Caswell, commissioner of the state’s Department of Business and Economic Affairs, told the Governor and Executive Council during a meeting in the border town of Pittsburg last month. “I mean, they’re running at about 30% underneath what we’ve seen in prior years.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Though the commissioner couldn’t say for sure what’s driving this decrease, he floated the strained relations between the U.S. and Canada as a possible culprit.
“It could be weather,” he said. “It could be basic economics. It could be gas prices. It could be, as we are seeing now, some difficulty and volatility between the Canadian government and the United States government.”
Customs and Border Protection data reflects this, too. The number of passenger vehicles traveling into New Hampshire, Vermont, or Maine from Canada was about 228,000 in July. That’s down about 105,000 vehicles over last year, a 32% drop. That number has been down from last year every single month since January. In total, the number of vehicles traveling into northern New England from October (the start of the agency’s fiscal year) through July was about 1.8 million. That same time period last fiscal year, it was 2.1 million.
New Hampshire’s outdoor recreation economy, particularly its mountains and lakes, have long brought tourists from both Massachusetts in the south and Canada in the north.
Since re-entering the White House in January, President Donald Trump has frequently floated the idea of annexing Canada as the “51st state,” at one point alluding to the possible use of military force. The idea has offended Canadians and prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to rebuke it repeatedly.
At one point in a May Oval Office meeting between the two leaders, Carney told the American president Canada is “not for sale, won’t be for sale, ever,” to which Trump replied, “Never say never.”
Trump has also imposed hefty tariffs on Canada, as part of his controversial campaign to eliminate trade deficits with other countries. At the beginning of this month, Trump increased those tariffs from 25% to 35%. The tariffs are ostensibly meant to curb what Trump argues is a fentanyl and drug trafficking issue at the northern border. Goods that fall under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement are exempt from the 35% rate.
For her part, Ayotte is scheduled to visit Canada in September for a trade mission. Asked Wednesday about her level of concern about the hit to tourism, she emphasized that “we certainly welcome the tourists from Canada.”
“That’s one of the things I’m going to just continue to promote on behalf of New Hampshire,” she said. “Not only that they’re welcome here — the Canadians — but we have open arms to them.”
She said her team is also going to be emphasizing business opportunities and relationships between New Hampshire and Canada during her visit next month. The trip is scheduled for Sept. 7-11, and Caswell will be joining her.

Unless Congress acts, full benefits end in 7 years.",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/happy-birthday-social-security-unless-congress-acts-full-benefits-end-7-years,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump signed a proclamation celebrating the 90th anniversary of Social Security on Thursday, though he offered no plans for avoiding insolvency and a steep drop-off in benefits within the next decade.Trump, who campaigned on “saving” the income stabilization program for America’s seniors, said during an appearance in the Oval Office that Republicans would keep the program going.But neither Trump, nor Republican leaders in Congress, have advanced legislation that would avoid a decrease in Social Security benefits in 2033, or begun to seriously address the issue.“In the campaign I made a sacred pledge to our seniors that I would always protect Social Security and under this administration we're keeping that promise and strengthening Social Security for generations to come,” Trump said. “You keep hearing stories that in six years, seven years, Social Security will be gone. And it will be if the Democrats ever get involved because they don’t know what they’re doing.“But it’s going to be around a long time with us. Very much, you’ll be surprised to hear some of the numbers.”‘One big, beautiful’ law speeds up fund depletionThe latest Social Security trustees report, released earlier this year, shows that without changes the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance trust fund will no longer be able to pay full benefits starting in 2033. “At that time, the fund’s reserves will become depleted and continuing program income will be sufficient to pay 77 percent of total scheduled benefits,” the report states.Republicans’ “big, beautiful” law will, however, speed up that timeline.Karen Glenn, chief actuary for the Social Security Administration, wrote in a letter released earlier this month that the lower tax rates in the GOP law will reduce the amount of revenue flowing into the trust fund.When combined with “increased program cost” associated with the new law, Glenn wrote “the reserve depletion date for the OASI Trust Fund is accelerated from the first quarter of 2033 to the fourth quarter of 2032.”Bipartisanship neededRepublicans cannot restructure Social Security on their own and will need to negotiate with Democrats in the years to come if lawmakers want to avoid insolvency.The budget reconciliation process, which GOP lawmakers used to pass their “big, beautiful bill,” cannot be used to address Social Security, making bipartisanship the only path to avoiding a decline in benefits for America’s retirees.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in a post published Thursday that “solutions are needed soon to prevent insolvency and the statutorily required benefit cut.”Without a new law to address the financial struggles facing the program, CRFB wrote, a “typical couple retiring just after insolvency will face an $18,400 cut in annual benefits.”President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the law enacting Social Security on Aug. 14, 1935.",,,,2025-08-14 16:56:44.281906

Joni Ernst, right, as well as other Republican lawmakers. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)AMES — U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said Thursday during a visit to Ames National Laboratory that he supports the development and research of clean energy sources — but also said he believes the ending of some federal supports for industries like solar and wind energy has come at the right time.
Several parts of the budget reconciliation law signed by President Donald Trump change clean energy programs created through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the flagship legislation of former President Joe Biden. The “big, beautiful” law takes funding out of some of these programs, in addition to ending or phasing out clean energy tax credits, shortening the qualification window for wind and solar projects and terminating rebates this year for purchase of electric vehicles and energy efficient home upgrades.
Nearly 60% of Iowa’s net electricity generation comes from wind energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Advocates for clean energy say Iowa, which has a higher share of wind energy production than other states and hosts a growing solar energy industry, could see higher costs and the loss of new projects, jobs and manufacturing facilities as these federal incentives end.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But Wright told reporters he supported the move to end these incentives, saying the industry has grown enough to be able to compete without the government financial support.
” I think it’s the right time to sunset them,” Wright said. “… In an early energy producing industry, the government provides subsidies or incentives or whatever to do it. But they’ve been around for 33 years, and I think you’ve seen a mature industry develop. So like with any energy source, it’s got to achieve maturity and compete in the marketplace.”
Wright was joined by members of Iowa’s federal delegation, Sen. Joni Ernst and Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Ashley Hinson, as well as other members of the conservative climate caucus in the U.S. House, Reps. Bob Latta of Ohio and Bruce Westerman of Arkansas.
Ernst said discussions are ongoing with the Trump administration and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on wind projects in Iowa “to make sure that they do qualify for those tax credits.”
“It doesn’t mean our wind energy is going away. It just means that those tax credits will be phased out,” Ernst said. “So I can anticipate that states like Iowa, we will continue to see a great pull of electricity coming from those wind turbines, the solar projects that are there, but we will see less subsidies coming from the federal government.”
Wright also spoke in support of other components of the budget reconciliation law, saying the measure included some changes to permitting that “took some shackles off” on building new energy production infrastructure, as well as for natural resource extraction within the country.
The Ames National Laboratory, located on the Iowa State University campus, is one of the 17 national laboratories throughout the country that focus on research related to energy production, national security and environmental impact. The Ames lab focuses on issues related to materials science and minerals — areas of research Wright said are vital, as the nation needs to become less dependent on countries like China.
Currently, he said, the U.S. is over-reliant on foreign countries for certain chemicals and minerals that are needed in many energy, technology and medical fields.
Miller-Meeks said bringing the mining of minerals back to the U.S. — as well as setting up more processing and manufacturing industries for these natural resources in the U.S. — would be more environmentally conscious overall, as there are “better labor practices, better environmental practices” in the U.S. than in other countries.
There are also methods being developed at facilities like the Ames National Laboratory to remine rare earth elements and other materials through recycled electronic waste, Miller-Meeks said.
Wright said while there were cuts made through the budget reconciliation law and other efforts by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress to cut costs, he said he does not expect cuts to the National Laboratory system.
“Of course, when I got there, the original idea was, ‘Let’s cut everything, let’s shrink everything,'” Wright said. “We need to shrink our spending of the government. But the smallest — and potentially no cuts — will be to the broader national laboratory complex. These are investments in our future. They’re much smaller dollars than giant corporate subsidies, and they have huge payoffs.”

The Lee Fire had become the fifth-largest wildfire in state history and was threatening the town of Rifle, where officials had to evacuate a state prison in the fire’s potential path.
In a social media post about the visits, Hurd thanked local authorities and community members for their response to the fires tearing across his district, and he vowed to “be here for the long haul to help recover.”
But nowhere did he offer the most appropriate gesture: an apology.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Hurd, along with the other three Republican members of Colorado’s U.S. House delegation, has promoted drill-baby-drill policies as part of a Trumpist “energy dominance” agenda, even though those policies crank up the greenhouse gas emissions that guarantee more megafires in Colorado. The only posture truly available to Hurd when he meets constituents is contrition. The only plausible message is, “I was wrong.”
Rising global temperatures are increasing the risk and frequency of extreme weather across the globe. The Southwest is being transformed by aridification amid the worst drought in 1,200 years. There is no scientific doubt that the primary cause of climate change is the combustion of fossil fuels.
In Colorado, this means bigger, fiercer wildfires and a fire season that no longer respects warm-month limits. The most destructive wildfire in state history, the Marshall Fire in 2021 in Boulder County, occurred five days after Christmas. The state’s 20 biggest fires have all occurred since the turn of the century. The three biggest came in 2020, when one of them, East Troublesome, grew so ferocious it leapt over the Continental Divide. A 2021 study found that hotter, drier conditions in the American West are causing fires, such as East Troublesome, to reach high elevations that were previously too wet to burn.
“And they are burning at rates unprecedented in recent fire history,” the authors wrote. “While historical fire suppression and other forest management practices play a role in the West’s worsening fire problem, the high-elevation forests we studied have had little human intervention. The results provide a clear indication that climate change is enabling these normally wet forests to burn.”
Colorado is especially exposed. A huge part of the state is the site of one of the largest areas of the highest temperature spikes in the lower 48 states. It covers Hurd’s hometown of Grand Junction and much of his district. Either Hurd is oblivious to the science or he’s cynically chosen to side with oil and gas industry interests.
During the freshman Hurd’s campaign last year, he sometimes seemed to align with an “all of the above” energy policy, which at least purports to include renewables, but he also signaled a strong preference for fossil fuel extraction over wind, solar and other renewable energy sources. He even champions coal, the most damaging of fossil fuels, a position he’s reinforced as recently as April. 
Hurd found himself in an awkward spot once he was in the House as MAGA extremism sought to demolish the all-of-the-above plank and demonize renewables. He and U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton were among 21 Republicans who urged colleagues not to eliminate energy tax credits, which support wind and solar jobs and development in Colorado. (The other two House members from Colorado, Lauren Boebert and Jeff Crank, left their names off the letter.) But they both voted to pass the recent Trump megabill, which eliminated the credits.
Hurd insists he believes climate change is real. But this just makes his approach all the more hypocritical. For example, he repeats the pro-carbon talking point that since fossil fuel in other countries is dirtier than America’s the U.S. should maximize production.
“If you genuinely care about reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, then you ought to support getting as much energy out of Colorado as possible. That includes not only the clean coal that we have, but also natural gas,” he told CPR in September.
But that’s like saying that since people are going to abuse fentanyl even though it’s deadly, America should manufacture a superior product to preempt China’s more dangerous supply. An immoral practice should be avoided because it’s immoral, not pursued with improvements.
If he has any doubt that prioritizing carbon-based energy is immoral, Hurd should take a closer look at the environmental catastrophe unfolding in his own district. He often cites the jobs at risk in the transition to renewable energy, but this short-sighted perspective ignores substantial state greening efforts to responsibly transition local economies, and it misses the larger risk that whole regions of a cooked Earth will be uninhabitable.
The megafires in Hurd’s district are exposing “energy dominance” as disastrously self-defeating.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The arrest of a Chinese-American man who ran three Hot Springs massage parlors will help Arkansas authorities continue to crack down on human trafficking, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said Thursday at a press conference.
Zengguang “Gary” Liu is a naturalized U.S. citizen whom Griffin said is part of a “Chinese-focused effort” and “criminal enterprise” engaged in sexual slavery.
Police and U.S. Marshals arrested Liu earlier this week in Oklahoma City and charged him with two felonies: human trafficking, a Class A felony, and unauthorized use of another person’s property to facilitate certain crimes, a Class B felony, according to a news release from Griffin’s office.
Liu owned the AI Massage, Magic Massage, and Diamond Massage parlors in Hot Springs and “likely owned other such establishments elsewhere in the country,” Griffin’s office learned after raiding all three businesses on July 28, the news release states. Authorities seized about $16,000 in cash in multiple currencies, including American and Chinese.
The raid was part of Operation Obscured Vision, a coordinated effort Griffin’s office started in January to raid massage parlors throughout the state in search of illegal activity. Besides Hot Springs, the office has conducted raids in Harrison, Jonesboro, Little Rock, Rogers and Russellville. Authorities have issued search warrants at 13 businesses and arrested seven people. Six of the arrested are Chinese nationals, and three of the six are naturalized U.S. citizens, according to the news release.
After the July 28 raid, Griffin’s office interviewed three Chinese women who said they were recruited online, including via social media, to come to the United States from China and do “illicit massage work” in other states before being sent to Hot Springs, according to the news release.
Working group recommends human trafficking prevention, intervention tactics to Arkansas leaders

Running multi-state human trafficking operations is an example of China’s “gray zone warfare” against the U.S., Griffin said, naming cyberattacks and fentanyl production and distribution as other examples.
He described Liu as a “mid-level” operative in the suspected broader human trafficking operation but said the information gained from the July raid and Liu’s arrest should “pay dividends” in tracking down more offenders.
Human trafficking prevention has been a shared priority among Griffin, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the Arkansas Legislature. In October 2023, Griffin held the first statewide Human Trafficking Summit in Little Rock, and a working group convened by Sanders proposed several state-level human trafficking prevention and intervention tactics.
Lawmakers adopted new laws this year related to human trafficking. Act 484 added to the list of places that must post information about the national trafficking hotline, including restrooms in establishments already required to display the information, nail salons and strip clubs. Act 366, adds a five-year enhanced sentence to people who recruit others to trafficking. Act 316 adds trafficking individuals and grooming minors for sex trafficking to the list of sex crimes.
Griffin’s office created the Arkansas Human Trafficking Council alongside the Arkansas State Police and the Department of Human Services, using a $1.5 million grant that the Office for Victims of Crime within the U.S. Department of Justice awarded the state in 2023.
In January, Griffin’s office, the State Police and the Human Trafficking Council launched a new webpage that provides human trafficking victims with county-level resources, including a searchable county-by-county map that victims can use to locate legal services and child advocacy centers, among other things.
On Thursday, Griffin called human traffickers “the lowest of the low” and said “there’s almost no other crime [they] won’t do.”
Liu waived extradition to China and will be brought from Oklahoma to Arkansas to face the charges against him, Griffin said. A Class A felony is punishable by six to 30 years in prison, and a Class B felony by five to 20 years.

Corrections officials, county sheriffs discuss prison capacity with Arkansas lawmakers

 

Griffin said Liu is one reason to support expanding Arkansas’ prison capacity because “if we don’t have more prison space, these are the kind of guys that walk.”
The Protect Arkansas Act of 2023 removes the possibility of parole for the state’s most serious offenders, among other things. The law will require more prison beds to accommodate a growing inmate population, including 5,000 more beds in the next decade, according to a forecast presented to Arkansas lawmakers Wednesday.
Sanders proposed a 815-acre Franklin County prison site late last year, taking the local community, elected officials and members of the state Board of Corrections by surprise.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-14 19:29:56+00:00,Mississippi Today,Supreme Court allows enforcement of Mississippi social media age verification law,Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/14/supreme-court-mississippi-age-verification/,Supreme Court justices have rejected an emergency appeal from a tech industry group that sought to block Mississippi from enforcing a law aimed at regulating children's use of social media.,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday refused for now to block enforcement of a Mississippi law aimed at regulating the use of social media by children, an issue of growing national concern.
The justices rejected an emergency appeal from a tech industry group, NetChoice, that is challenging laws passed in Mississippi and other states that require social media users to verify their ages. The court had been asked to keep the law on hold while a lawsuit plays out.
There were no noted dissents from the brief, unsigned order. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote to say that NetChoice could eventually succeed in showing that the law is indeed unconstitutional.
Kavanaugh said he nevertheless agreed with the court’s decision because the tech group had not shown it would suffer legal harm if the measure went into effect as the lawsuit unfolded.
NetChoice argues that the Mississippi law threatens privacy rights and unconstitutionally restricts the free expression of users of all ages.
A federal judge agreed and prevented the 2024 law from taking effect. But a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in July that the law could be enforced while the lawsuit proceeds.
It’s the latest legal development as court challenges play out against similar laws in states across the country.
Parents and even some teenagers are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of social media use on young people. Supporters of the new laws have said they are needed to help curb the explosive use of social media among young people, and what researchers say is an associated increase in depression and anxiety.
Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch told the justices that age verification could help protect young people from “sexual abuse, trafficking, physical violence, sextortion, and more,” activities that Fitch noted are not protected by the First Amendment.
NetChoice represents some of the country’s most high-profile technology companies, including Google, which owns YouTube; Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat; and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.
NetChoice has filed similar lawsuits in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Ohio and Utah.

(Screenshot of service)OKLAHOMA CITY – Former President Bill Clinton on Thursday remembered the late George Nigh as a man who put people ahead of politics.
“He came at other people with an outstretched hand, not a clenched fist,” Clinton said of the former Oklahoma governor, who died July 30 at 98.
Clinton, a friend of the former governor, delivered the remarks at Nigh’s memorial service at Crossings Community Church in Oklahoma City. 
“He honestly believed that public life could be decent and honorable and that people could be helped, not so much with a hand out as with a hand up,” Clinton said.
He described Nigh, a McAlester native and  former teacher who was twice elected governor, as a person who made a decision to be happy, uplifting, positive and loving.
“I am convinced that one of the reasons that he lasted 98 years and had all of his marbles all the way to the end (was) because he made good choices,” Clinton said.
Clinton said he and Nigh were both elected governor the same year. Clinton was elected governor of Arkansas. 
“He knew I was too young to know what I was doing, so he offered to help me make fewer mistakes,” Clinton said.
The pair worked together on the Arkansas River navigation project and interstate highway improvements, Clinton said.
When he first met Nigh, he wondered if he still had his wallet in his pocket, Clinton said.
“This guy is too good to be true,” Clinton said. “Nobody is this nice.”
Some speakers talked about his relationship with Donna, his wife of 61 years.
Before they were married, the state’s largest newspaper named Nigh, then a very popular lieutenant governor, the state’s most eligible bachelor, said Bob Burke, a Nigh biographer and attorney. 
When Nigh would tell that story, he would quote Donna as saying  that she had a car, a house and a good job, while Nigh had none of the three, Burke said.
“I thank you for taking him in. He needed a place to live and an automobile,” Clinton said to Donna Nigh, eliciting laughter. “Thank you for giving it to him.”
The service closed with a rendition of “Oklahoma!” 
Nigh, as a state lawmaker, was the author of a law that made it the state song.
Nigh also served as president of the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond.

James Russell, a former sociology professor at Eastern Connecticut State University, and Gloria Bent, the wife of a former physicist at the University of Connecticut, have  firsthand experience. They are both enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan, the default coverage for retired state employees and their dependents over 65. 
Their experiences led them to start Connecticut State Employees for Medicare Choice, which aims to “get Connecticut state employee retirees an affordable choice between Medicare Advantage and traditional Medicare,” Russell said. Already, the group has roughly 1,500 people signed up for its email distribution list.
In 2021, Russell was diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer. When he called to make an appointment for chemotherapy at a major cancer center in Portland, Oregon, where he now lives, he was informed that the facility didn’t accept his Medicare Advantage plan, even though they would have accepted traditional Medicare, he said. 
“I thought there was a mistake because up until then I had thought that the state of Connecticut had found a way to get an MA plan with a near-universal network like traditional Medicare,” Russell wrote in an email. “There was no mistake, the person on the phone told me.”
Covering retirees through Medicare Advantage instead of traditional Medicare can save states a lot of money. Connecticut made the switch in 2018 and it has led to nearly $1.7 billion in savings over the last five fiscal years, according to estimates from state Comptroller Sean Scanlon. He said the state is able to leverage the “scale and size” of the Medicare Advantage plan — which covers 64,000 people — to reduce costs.
Over breakfast one morning, Russell came across an article in The Guardian about Gary Bent, another Connecticut state retiree, who in 2022 was denied coverage by the state’s Medicare Advantage plan for intensive rehabilitation recommended by his doctors after a brain surgery left him with severe mobility and cognitive impairments.
Bent had since passed away, but his wife and daughter, Gloria and Megan, were quoted in the article. Russell immediately tried to get in touch. Once he did, the organizing effort began.
Connecticut’s Medicare Advantage plan is now run by Aetna, but prior to 2023 — when Bent and Russell both dealt with access issues — UnitedHealthcare provided the coverage.
A spokesperson for UnitedHealthcare said the company couldn’t comment on specific cases without a signed waiver from the patient allowing for the release of their medical records. 
Bent declined to provide access to her husband’s medical records out of privacy concerns. Russell signed the authorization, but UnitedHealthcare did not answer specific questions about the challenges he faced in time for publication. 
Asked for general information on the company’s prior authorization practices, UnitedHealthcare’s spokesperson referred to a page on the company’s website, titled “Get the facts: Why is prior authorization needed.” The page states that, “for all the recent noise around prior authorization, the reality is it’s rarely used.”
The fight for a choice
The contract governing retirement and health benefits for current and former Connecticut state employees expires in 2027. Early discussions have already begun between the state government and the State Employee Bargaining Agent Coalition, or SEBAC. 
Russell said CT State Employees for Medicare Choice is pushing SEBAC to demand a traditional Medicare option in the new contract. “We have definitely made it an issue,” he said. “If we had not come along, I think this just would have sailed through with another Medicare Advantage plan.”
A spokesperson with SEBAC wrote in emailed comments that the bargaining coalition came to a mutual agreement with the state to switch to Medicare Advantage in an effort to help “find savings for Connecticut.” But SEBAC is aware, the spokesperson wrote, that “a small number of members began to experience serious access issues.”
A spokesperson with Aetna, which has administered Connecticut’s retiree Medicare Advantage plan since 2023, said the company is committed to providing state retirees with “quality, affordable and convenient health care.”
As of last year, 34 states offered their retired employees the option to enroll in Medicare Advantage, according to KFF Health News. But Connecticut is one of just 13 states where state retirees must enroll in Medicare Advantage, without the option to enroll in traditional Medicare. Russell and Bent want to see that change. 
“Medicare Advantage programs as a whole continue to face rightful and concerning criticism over their business model,” the SEBAC spokesperson wrote. “SEBAC and the State instituted a workaround so that state retirees can receive the care they need to address the few cases brought to our attention.”
When asked whether the state would consider allowing retirees the option to enroll in traditional Medicare as part of the updated SEBAC agreement, Scanlon said anything is possible.
“Nothing is ever off the table in a SEBAC negotiation. These are one of the more important negotiations the state does,” Scanlon said. “My personal opinion is that what we’re doing is working.”
Scanlon said the state has made efforts to address issues raised by enrollees. 
In January 2025, the state launched the option for people to enroll in a Medicare plan with Aetna — the current provider of the state’s Medicare Advantage plan — if they find a critical care provider that won’t accept Medicare Advantage. Russell will be enrolled in the Medicare plan as of September 1, a spokesperson for Scanlon confirmed.
“My personal opinion is that what we’re doing is working.”Sean Scanlon, Connecticut state Comptroller
The state has also removed prior authorization for radiology services and has worked to improve the prior authorization practices for skilled-nursing facilities, or SNFs. Scanlon said his office identified SNFs as a pain point for enrollees and resolving those issues has been a “huge focus” for his staff. The prior authorization approval rate for SNFs is now at 92%, he said.
Medicare Advantage plans have come to dominate the market. Both nationally and in Connecticut, over half of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage as opposed to traditional Medicare. 
Scanlon acknowledged that much of the criticism regarding these plans is warranted, but he said the service retirees receive through the state’s plan is very different from the experience of people who individually enroll in Medicare Advantage.
“We can pair big savings with responsive management of the plan and then can be adaptive to problems that come up,” Scanlon said. “Whether that’s dealing with specific cases for one of our 64,000 members or taking anecdotal feedback on things like prior authorizations.”
Many people like their Medicare Advantage plans, which often have lower premiums than traditional Medicare. For someone who is relatively healthy, Medicare Advantage will cover most of the services they need. But issues can arise when they face a catastrophic diagnosis, Russell said.
“It does work for people,” Russell said. “Until it doesn’t.”
Gloria Bent said, like Russell, she wants people who haven’t yet experienced issues with Medicare Advantage to understand that they might be one health disaster away from dealing with those problems themselves.
“I would ask them to just hold onto the awareness that when they need it most, if they’re in an acute crisis, they’re probably not going to get what they need,” Bent said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP23270447262861-1024x691.jpg,,,2025-08-14 15:57:33.676098

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)The head of the agency spearheading Maine’s energy efficiency efforts is still hopeful about the long term shift to battery-powered and low-emission vehicles, which are a key aspect of the state’s climate goals, despite the loss of a federal tax credit and projected cost increases due to tariffs.
“I’m cautiously optimistic,” said Michael Stoddard, executive director of Efficiency Maine, the quasi-state agency that implements energy efficiency programs.
The series of federal policy changes — including a sunset of tax credits and increased tariffs on parts and products made overseas — will make the widespread adoption of combustion engine vehicles to electric and battery powered vehicles (commonly referred to as EVs) more challenging, Stoddard said. However, he also believes manufacturers will continue to improve EV options and find ways to lower prices as the rest of the world moves toward this technology. 
Federal and state incentive programs have helped the state’s goal to put 150,000 light-duty electric vehicles on Maine roads by 2030 outlined in the climate action plan, given that transportation is responsible for nearly half of the state’s carbon emissions.
One major incentive has been federal tax credits, which were set to expire in 2032, but will now end on Sept. 30 due to a provision in President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax cut and spending law. 
Vehicles must be acquired by that date to qualify for the New Clean Vehicle Credit, which offers up to $7,500 for new battery electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles, or the Used Clean Vehicle Credit, which offers up to $4,000 for used electric or hybrid vehicles.
Effort to replenish Maine’s depleted EV incentive program could also reduce electricity costs

While Stoddard said there isn’t data from this calendar year to see how consumers have reacted since that measure was signed into law on July 4, data shows increased demand for EVs at the end of 2024, which precipitated a change in state incentive programs.  
In 2019, Efficiency Maine launched an EV rebate program that offered up to $2,000 for the purchase of a new electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid to Mainers of any income. The rebate amount increased to $7,500 for low-income consumers and included an option to get some money back for purchasing a used hybrid or electric vehicle.










Whether it happens in the next two years or the next five years is not so important, I think it’s just important that we keep moving in the right direction.


– Michael Stoddard, Efficiency Maine


But in November 2024, Efficiency Maine had to stop issuing rebates — except for those designated for low-income customers — because it exhausted the $13.5 million provided for the program.
However, Efficiency Maine will soon resume offering rebates thanks to a new law that allows the agency to tap into a new revenue stream, Stoddard said. 
This summer Gov. Janet Mills signed LD 585 into law, which allows Efficiency Maine more flexibility in using certain funds that are currently only used for subsidizing heat pumps. The new law removes those limitations so the specific revenue, known as forward capacity market funds, can be used for electric vehicles as well.
The resumed rebate program will look different than before, Stoddard explained. 
Consumers are required to purchase an off-peak charger to receive the incentive. A discount is available on the agency’s website, which brings the cost of the charger to $129. Stoddard said this will ensure that most charging for those EVs will happen when the electrical grid has plenty of capacity. 
There are also limitations as to who can access the incentive program, which will be available to businesses, nonprofits, government entities and low- and moderate-income households. Low-income households can receive $7,500 for a new vehicle and $3,500 for a used one, while all other groups will receive $2,000 for new and $1,500 for used vehicles.
Stoddard acknowledged that there will always be a percentage of the population that doesn’t make the shift, but he thinks that despite the recent federal policy changes, sooner or later most Mainers and the rest of the country will switch.
He also pointed out that the expansion of charging infrastructure, decreased battery costs, as well as more variety in electric vehicle type — from pickup trucks to vans — could all contribute to people continuing to veer away from gasoline-powered cars. 
“Whether it happens in the next two years or the next five years is not so important, I think it’s just important that we keep moving in the right direction,” he said.

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)On Monday, President Donald Trump said his administration is considering reclassifying marijuana — a drug that’s been legalized for recreational use in a growing number of states over the past decade and a half — to make federal penalties for its possession and sale less severe nationwide. While Gov. Kelly Ayotte said she’d respect the federal government’s decisions, she doesn’t plan to push for legalization on the state level in New Hampshire.
“If federal law changes, I have to comply with federal law,” Ayotte told reporters Wednesday. “But my position has been, and continues to be, that we should not legalize marijuana in the future.”
Her concerns are multifold.
“As a mother, as someone who worked as a prosecutor in this area, my concerns are quality of life,” Ayotte said. “The impact on the mental health of youth, and also they can’t measure it when it comes to road safety.”
Unlike with alcohol, where a Breathalyzer can determine if you’re under the influence at a specific moment in time, there isn’t a way for police to measure the level of marijuana in a driver’s system. Ayotte worries about a potential increase in car crashes, citing other states that have legalized the drug for recreational use.
Indeed, a 2023 study from the University of Illinois Chicago School of Public Health examined seven states that had legalized recreational marijuana and four saw a substantial increase in crash fatalities, with a 10% increase in motor vehicle accident deaths on average in those states. Other studies have come to similar conclusions, though some marijuana advocates, including the Marijuana Policy Project, dismiss those concerns and argue other factors, such as distracted driving, not wearing seatbelts, and speeding, are bigger contributors to crash fatality increases, citing different (but older) studies.
Advocates of marijuana legalization argue the drug is much less dangerous than other hard drugs; that legalization keeps people seeking the drug from entering the black market; and ending criminal penalties reduces overincarceration. Marijuana is currently illegal in New Hampshire for recreational use, but is legal for medicinal purposes. Nationwide, it is legal for recreational purposes in 24 states and for medicinal purposes in 39.
“If the federal law changes, I also hope they address that core safety issue, because that’s important to me,” Ayotte said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cannabisayottefeds-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-08-14 15:57:33.676098

The city of Burlington lifted a water conservation notice for some city and Colchester residents Thursday morning, two days after it was announced.
Tuesday’s advisory affected customers who receive a water bill from Burlington Water Resources or Colchester Fire District 2, which the city also serves. The reservoir and tanks serve about 10,000 customers in Burlington and about 2,800 in Malletts Bay.
“The cause of the conservation notice was the booster pump failure on the water main that supplies the Colchester water tank,” Chapin Spencer, the city’s director of public works, wrote in an email Thursday. “Without the booster pumps, our regular supply lines to the tower could not keep up with the higher water demand that we saw during the heat wave.”
The alert was sent midday Tuesday after the water in a Colchester tank fell 2 feet below the minimum desired level, Spencer said earlier this week. On Thursday morning the drinking water level was back to normal and the alert was lifted. 
“With our customer’s water conservation efforts, now both the Colchester water tank and the Burlington reservoir are replenished and up to normal levels,” Spencer wrote.
The two booster pumps feeding the Colchester water tank that failed are approximately 25 years old, said Spencer, who oversees upgrades to Burlington’s aging infrastructure. One is fixed, and despite significant maintenance, the other pump is not online yet.
“We do exercise the pumps weekly, but moving forward we are now going to exercise the pumps for a longer duration to more fully test them,” Spencer said in the email.

(Photo courtesy U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Salt Lake County health officials have announced Utah’s first confirmed human case of West Nile virus this year. 
The infected person is an adult diagnosed with neuroinvasive West Nile virus, a more severe form of the disease, according to a news release issued Thursday by the Salt Lake County Health Department. 
The person was hospitalized earlier this month but is now recovering at home, according to the county.
“Public health’s investigation has determined they were likely infected in late July near the Jordan River in the southern half of Salt Lake County,” the health department said, declining to release additional information about the person due to medical privacy laws. 
So far this season, Salt Lake County’s three mosquito abatement districts have detected West Nile virus in 24 different mosquito samples throughout the county. Statewide, 108 mosquito samples have tested positive, according to the county health department.

“Because mosquitoes can travel several miles, everyone in the area — regardless of exact location — should take precautions against mosquito bites to avoid exposure to the virus,” county health officials said.
West Nile virus was first detected in the U.S. in 1999. In 2003, Utah saw its first confirmed case. 
Last year, Utah public health officials confirmed that 14 people in the state contracted the virus, and 12 of those resulted in the neuroinvasive form of the disease. That year, the state reported no deaths from the disease, but in 2023 one person died. 
However, health officials warned that the virus can be difficult to detect, and it’s likely more prevalent than statistics show. 
“Because only 20-30% of infected people will have any symptoms at all — and many of those will notice only minor, flu-like symptoms — it’s likely that infection with WNV is more prevalent than the reported case numbers indicate,” county health officials said. 
West Nice virus can cause mild to severe illness, and many may not even know when they have been infected.
“It is estimated that less than 1% of people infected with (West Nile virus) will develop the neuroinvasive form of the disease, which can result in debilitating long-term complications or death,” health officials said. 
Symptoms of can infection can appear within two to 14 days of a mosquito bite. They include fever, headache and body aches. More severe infections may include high fever, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, tremors and muscle weakness or convulsions.
Those over the age of 50 and people with weakened immune systems are at the highest risk of illness from West Nice virus, health officials said, but anyone can become ill from the bite of an infected mosquito. The virus is not transmissible from person to person. 
“There is no specific treatment for (West Nile virus) infection other than to treat symptoms,” county health officials said, urging anyone who thinks they might have been infected to contact their health care provider. 
Even though only some mosquitos carry the virus, “there is no way for residents to tell which mosquitoes may be infected, so it is important to minimize all exposure opportunities during mosquito season,” which continues on until the first hard freeze. 
Salt Lake County health officials urged Utahns to do the following to protect themselves from the disease:

Use an EPA-registered mosquito repellent with DEET, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus. Follow package directions for application.
After dusk, wear long sleeves and pants.
Drain standing water in yards (in old tires, potted plant trays, pet dishes, toys, buckets, etc).
Keep roof gutters clear of debris.
Clean and stock garden ponds with mosquito-eating fish or mosquito dunks. Contact your local mosquito abatement district for assistance.
Ensure door and window screens are in good condition so mosquitoes can’t get inside.
Keep weeds and tall grass cut short. Adult mosquitoes look for these shady places to rest during the hot daylight hours.

Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) failed to publicly report the purchase of up to $50,000 in stock shares purchased from a well-known proxy for cryptocurrency holdings, a violation of a law created to prevent conflicts of interest and increase transparency around lawmakers’ stock trades.
A periodic transaction report filed this week with the clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives shows Thanedar purchased common stock in MicroStrategy Incorporated in an amount ranging from $15,000 to $50,000. The report date and its notification date listed the purchase as occurring more than a year ago on July 1, 2024.
The transaction type was listed as a stock purchase, but MicroStrategy is well-known as a Bitcoin treasury and the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency, owning 423,650 bitcoins worth $42.43 billion, according to a CNBC report published in 2024.
The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012 does not ban trading for sitting federal lawmakers, but it does require them to disclose stock purchases of more than $1,000 within 45 days.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Violations of the act are rectified through fines against lawmakers starting at $200 per violation.
In an interview with Michigan Advance on Thursday, Thanedar said the MicroStrategy stock buy was something that his wife purchased and was something that he just became aware of recently.
“As soon as I became aware, I reported it,” Thanedar said. “[People are] trying to make it like this was intentional, but it was not. … I have also been reporting my crypto holdings for years, so there’s no particular reason to not report this one transaction under $50,000, when I had reported other transactions within minutes [of those purchases].”
As far as penalties for any potential violation of the law, Thanedar said he has not had any communication with the U.S. House Ethics Committee. Thanedar indicated that he was willing to pay the fine if he had to. 
The congressman also reiterated that he reports all his stock holdings in a timely manner, and although this one fell through the cracks, it did not represent a pattern.
“If my delay of reporting one stock caused a problem, then, if there is a consequence, I would pay for it,” Thanedar said. “It’s less than 1% of what was not reported, this one stock is one out of maybe 500 or 1,000. I don’t know how many individual stocks I have.”
Although Thanedar is nowhere near the Top 10 wealthiest members of Congress, he is ranked No. 30 with a net worth of $40.97 million out of the 457 members, according to a list compiled by Quiver Quantitative, a website that tracks alternative data for trading trends and analysis.
News of the purchase and the potential violation related to the MicroStrategy stock was first reported by NOTUS, a nonprofit news organization based in Washington, D.C. Other reports show that this was the second time since 2023 that Thanedar potentially violated the STOCK Act.
Thaendar told NOTUS that he plans to direct his financial advisors to no longer invest in individual stocks and to sell off the ones that remain. The congressman, however, was less committed to that plan when speaking to the Advance on Thursday.
“I’m just like any other investor, and I have been investing in stocks for 30 or 40 years now, way before I became a public servant,” Thanedar said. “When I talked to the agent, I was wondering aloud about was it worth even doing this, and is it better for me to just get out of stock so there are no misunderstandings of my intent.”
When asked about his advisors’ response to that question, Thanedar said he was advised that it was not financially wise to just dump stocks like that.
“If I direct them to, they will, but this is not financially smart,” Thaendar said.
Asked whether he planned to do that or if it was something he was just taking under consideration, Thanedar told the Advance that he was talking with advisors about whether it was worth the perception questions that surround holding individual stock.
The late report also raises questions about Thaendar’s cryptocurrency holdings and a potential conflict of interest given that the congressman is a member of a cryptocurrency subcommittee that has been exploring the expansion of digital coins as a major new asset. He recently voted for three pro-cryptocurrency bills that provide a regulatory framework for digital markets and stablecoins, complete with consumer and financial privacy protections.
Thanedar told the Advance that he didn’t see his holdings in cryptocurrency as a conflict of interest because he’s been investing in the area since 2017, and that his recent purchases were not related to any of his work on cryptocurrency in Congress.
“I believe in a digital future,” Thanedar said. “Digital currency is the future. I believed that in 2017 and I believe it today. … I have invested in this before I was a member of Congress and even if I invested now as a member of Congress, I really don’t see an issue.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DSC_0583-1-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-08-14 15:57:33.676098

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)TOPEKA — The U.S. Department of Education is investigating four Kansas school districts after a right-wing nonprofit complained about their policies allowing teachers to maintain confidentiality with transgender students.
Topeka, Shawnee Mission, Olathe and Kansas City, Kansas, public school districts are under investigation for potentially violating Title IX and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, the department said in a Thursday press release.
The education secretary, Linda McMahon, said the districts’ alleged violations are an affront to the law and educational leadership.
“School personnel should not confuse and unsettle young girls by forcing them to share sex-separated sports and intimate facilities with boys,” McMahon said, “nor should school personnel abuse their position of authority by hiding sensitive information pertaining to a child’s health and wellbeing from that child’s parents.”
She vowed a vigorous investigation into the four districts.
Those school districts allegedly allow students to participate in sports and use restrooms and locker rooms based on gender identity instead of biological sex, said the initial complaint from the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies, a conservative nonprofit founded by two former Trump administration officials. Kansas law already prohibits transgender and cisgender girls from playing sports together and bans transgender girls from school locker rooms and bathrooms.
The district policies under investigation also allow educators to maintain confidentiality with transgender students, which in some cases means not disclosing a student’s gender identity to their parents without the student’s consent.
In a 35-page complaint detailing the districts’ gender identity practices and policies, the institute encouraged the federal department to pull funding from the districts, listing court decisions, a January presidential executive order, federal law and state law as justification.
The institute alleges Shawnee Mission, Topeka and Kansas City, Kansas, districts violated Title IX “by forcing students to share intimate facilities with members of the opposite sex as a condition of participation in their education programs and activities,” the complaint said. It argues that the districts’ gender identity policies “erase” sex.
All four schools, the complaint argues, are allegedly in violation of FERPA, which prohibits districts from preventing parental access to student educational records.
The districts “are undermining parents’ rights to access their children’s educational records and appear to be distributing the information contained therein to employees with no legitimate educational interest in these records without parental consent,” the complaint said.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach wrote a letter to McMahon in June, urging the department to investigate. He said in a Thursday announcement that Title IX was created to safeguard girls’ equal educational opportunities.
Kobach had previously sent letters to six Kansas school districts in 2023, criticizing gender identity policies and practices.
“It would be arrogant beyond belief to hide something with such weighty consequences from the very people (parents) that both law and nature vest with providing for a child’s long-term well-being,” he wrote in the December 2023 letter. “That a Kansas school district could so cavalierly allow a minor child—whom science tells us does not even have a fully formed brain until into his or her twenties—to decide whether his or her parents know about such things is shockingly irresponsible.”
Two school districts reportedly modified their policies, Kobach said, but four did not. Those four districts are the subject of the recent complaint.
Kobach also sued the Biden administration in federal court in 2024 to challenge new rules that strengthened antidiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ students and expanded the definition of sexual harassment at colleges and schools. A federal judge eventually blocked the rules from taking effect in Kansas.
“I am grateful that we now have a federal government that takes Title IX seriously and will ensure that school districts follow the law,” Kobach said.
Title IX is enforced by the federal department’s Office of Civil Rights and FERPA is enforced by the department’s Student Privacy Policy Office.
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat, said in a statement the investigation and complaint illustrate “how out of touch Republicans are with reality and with what is happening in our school buildings.”
“These vague, unspecified claims are a witch hunt and a distraction from providing a world-class education,” said Sykes, whose Senate district sits within the Shawnee Mission school district.
She said the investigations are a distraction “from the real issues that are impacting our students right now,” including access to mental and physical health care, food access for families and school funding threats.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The University of Iowa announced Thursday the launch of a new initiative aimed at identifying solutions for raising revenue and bettering efficiency in order to take a proactive position ahead of further changes in higher education.
The university stated in a public release Thursday its new campus initiative, titled the Revenue and Efficiencies Strategic Plan Action and Resource Committee (reSPARC), is being implemented as part of its 2022-2027 strategic plan.

According to the release, the UI is starting this work “from a position of financial health” so it can strengthen its current success amid increasing financial uncertainties, decreasing trust in higher education and a looming demographic cliff.
“At Iowa, we have an opportunity to lead by being proactive rather than reactive,” said UI Executive Vice President and Provost Kevin Kregel in the release. “Instead of waiting for challenges to dictate our choices, we are creating structures and strategies that position us for continued success.”
Close to 100 UI employees, including faculty, staff and leadership, are being placed into teams with the goals of either developing plans for increasing revenue or identifying administrative efficiencies, the release stated.
Each team will focus on a different aspect of campus and university functions, according to the reSPARC website, ranging from academics to financial operations, student enrollment and retention, philanthropy, information technology and more. Teams will bring their ideas to initiative leaders before moving to the university president and provost, who have the final say on if and how plans will be implemented.
The website stated there is are no plans for budget cuts or layoffs included in the reSPARC initiative, as it is being implemented as a proactive plan rather than a response to budget problems.
UI President Barbara Wilson said in the release that collaboration is a strength of the UI community, and this new initiative will allow people across more than 30 departments to generate ideas together to ensure a strong present and thriving future.
“Our goal is to create a pipeline of actionable, well-vetted ideas that will have a real impact,” Wilson said in the release. “This is not about quick fixes—it’s about building a foundation for sustained growth and excellence.”

Lindsey Graham told reporters in Aiken last week to cut the ribbon on a new, $66 million nuclear research […]","The interior of the unfinished Unit 2 nuclear reactor pictured Sept. 12, 2024, at VC Summer nuclear site near Fairfield. (Provided by S.C. Nuclear Advisory Council)AIKEN — South Carolina’s senior senator is doubling down on his support for a potential reboot of a failed nuclear power plant expansion in the state.
“We don’t have enough power in this country already,” Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters in Aiken last week to cut the ribbon on a new, $66 million nuclear research center.
“Wake up call; America needs to get back into the nuclear business,” he continued. “We need to build nuclear power plants and get them up and operating.”
His stance has only strengthened since January, when Graham told SC Public Radio he was “open to trying to revitalize” the completion of partially built nuclear reactors in Fairfield County.
State-owned utility Santee Cooper and now-defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas were partners on the V.C. Summer expansion, which was a first-of-its-kind design and marked the first new nuclear construction in the country in 40 years. When the companies abandoned the effort in 2017 — after jointly spending $9 billion — Graham unsuccessfully sought federal help to keep it going during President Donald Trump’s first term.
$66M manufacturing and research center opens at USC Aiken

Last week, Graham pointed to the fraud and abuse that plagued the V.C. Summer project as the reason behind its failure.
The debacle left customers of Virginia-based Dominion Energy, which bought out SCE&G’s parent company SCANA in the aftermath, on the hook for more than $2 billion for reactors that never generated power.
Santee Cooper’s share of the debt was $3.6 billion.
Unlike South Carolina, Georgia pushed forward with its own, nearly-identical reactor, finishing it seven years late and $17 billion over budget.
Then, in October 2024, members of a state nuclear advisory group started batting around the idea of restarting the project.
In late January, Santee Cooper put out a call for a potential buyer.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, speaking to reporters alongside Graham in Aiken last week, said he met with Gov. Henry McMaster in Washington, D.C., about the effort.
“These are plants that have got a lot of the construction already done — a lot of the engineering has already been done,” Wright said. “Can these be up and running faster and cheaper than starting from scratch? Absolutely. I think it’s a tremendous idea.”
Proponents have also pointed to revitalization efforts at other nuclear plants across the country.
A unit at the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Watts Bar nuclear plant came online in 2016, 43 years after construction began. The timeline included a 22-year gap: Work halted in 1985, then resumed in 2007.
And developers struck a deal last year to restart the remaining unit at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island, where a second unit suffered its notorious partial meltdown in 1979, to power a Microsoft data center.
Santee Cooper announced in May it had received some 50 proposals.
Now, those applicants are partnering off and submitting joint bids for a second round of vetting. Utility officials expect to continue the bidding process at least through February and possibly until November 2026.
“My goal is to make sure they are up and operating. We cannot lose the nuclear energy race,” Graham said. “We’ve let this atrophy. We let the whole nuclear energy footprint kind of go into the dark. We’re going to finish these reactors. Too much money has been spent, and we need the power.”
Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

Graham took credit for negotiations that continued Biden administration tax incentives for nuclear construction.
The GOP megalaw signed by President Donald Trump last month ends tax credits for wind and solar projects years earlier than planned under Biden’s hallmark clean energy package of 2022. Under changes in the “big, beautiful” law, those projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify.
U.S. House Republicans sought to strip the credits for nuclear too. But senators, including Graham, insisted on keeping those incentives.
Graham chairs the U.S. Senate Budget Committee, but he suggested the credits offer enough aid to get the project done, making taxpayer dollars through a budget earmark unnecessary.
For nuclear energy, developers can still claim a 30% federal tax credit tax for investments through 2032. V.C. Summer would likely qualify for an additional 10% credit in the new law for “nuclear energy communities,” or sites with a history of employees in the nuclear sector.
As for the timetable, an executive order signed by Trump in May aims to speed up the licensing process.
Critics have raised concerns this could undermine safety measure. But Wright suggested safety will increase because regulators have fewer factors to consider.
“The regulations are so cumbersome and so bureaucratic, nothing gets built. And when you try to get people to focus on 200 things, you don’t get focus on anything,” he said.
‘The power is on in SC’ legislators proclaim in celebrating massive energy law

Wright and Graham also touted nuclear, which does not emit greenhouse gases, as a clean source of power.
Taylor Allred, of the Coastal Conservation League, said while it’s true nuclear does not pollute the air the way fossil fuels do, it comes with other environmental risks.
The state has already experienced radioactive waste leaks, both at the federal Savannah River Site near Aiken, and at Chem Nuclear in Barnwell County, a privately owned landfill for low-level radioactive waste. The landfill has been closed to most of the nation since 2008.
Allred said opening more nuclear plants would mean more nuclear waste.
“That raises some concerns that things could get missed, and there isn’t a lot of room for error when it comes to nuclear power and radioactive waste,” he told Fox 24 News in Charleston, in a clip shared by the Coastal Conservation League. “It would be potentially devastating to our communities to start having that accelerate.”

(Photo courtesy Jenn Sikora)Jenn Sikora recalls the night in 2005 in her northern Virginia home talking with a group of parents of children with Down syndrome. They discussed ways they could help ensure their children’s future as they aged.
That’s when “one of the dads” remarked that he’d established a tax-advantaged savings plan for one daughter’s college education but wasn’t sure what he could do to help his second daughter with Down syndrome through life.
“She might go into a postsecondary college program, she might need help with housing, or she might need assistance with transportation or with jobs, and I just don’t know what that is. But, as a dad, I want to be able to provide for what her needs are later on,” Sikora recalls the man saying.
“And that’s really how ABLE got started.”
“ABLE” is the Stephen Beck Jr. Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, which allows individuals with disabilities diagnosed before age 26 and their families to save up to $19,000 per year for future expenses. Congress approved it in 2014. In July 2015, Florida created ABLE United, a registered not-for-profit and direct support organization of the Florida Prepaid College Board.
Sikora — whose son, Sean, has Down syndrome — had got to lobbying the issue immediately. She was a former staffer for U.S. Rep. Bill McCollum and wasn’t reluctant to tackle tax policy. She also had connections. Her neighbor at the time was John Ariale, chief of staff to then-Jacksonville Republican U.S. Rep. Ander Crenshaw.
So she pled her case to Ariale that parents of children with disabilities should be able to defer money into tax-free accounts to help cover their children’s needs as they aged. And, perhaps more importantly, the savings accounts shouldn’t trigger the loss of Social Security income or Medicaid benefits when the children turn 18.
“We said, ‘Look, we want to save for our kids, and we don’t want to impact their benefit eligibility later on in life. What do you think?'” Sikora told the Florida Phoenix. “And [Ariale] said, ‘I can’t believe that you’re not already able to do this.’ ”
140K, $130M
  ABLE United Director John Finch via subject.
ABLE United announced Thursday that 14,000 account holders in Florida have saved a combined total of more than $130 million. The announcement coincides with the the second annual national ABLE Savings Day, created raise awareness of this opportunity.
“Reaching $130 million in savings shows that Floridians are embracing ABLE accounts as a game-changing disability financial planning tool,” said John Finch, director of ABLE United.
Finch estimates that represents about 3% of the individuals in Florida who could qualify for and have enough discretionary funds to invest in an ABLE account.
The National Association of State Treasurers estimates that nationally more than 214,000 Americans with disabilities have collectively saved $2.6 billion in ABLE accounts.
The accounts can be used for various expenses, such as assistive technology, education, housing, transportation, health care, and more. Enrollment is free, there are no monthly fees, and savings grow tax-free.
More opportunities & more necessary
With nearly $1 trillion in health care cuts looming in the next decade, mostly through Republican legislation slashing Medicaid, the savings accounts may prove more necessary than ever. Medicaid is a health care safety net for the poor, elderly, and disabled people.
Although the “One Big Beautiful” law makes those deep cuts in Medicaid and health spending, the new law also ups eligibility for ABLE accounts to age 46, effective Jan. 1, opening the program to military veterans, plus people diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or lupus, or who suffer from traumatic brain injuries or have been diagnosed with mental health disorders.
“We have a lot of work to do. And I think with this age adjustment, it’s going to help expand that,” Finch said.
Former Florida Agency for Persons with Disabilities Executive Director turned lobbyist Jim DeBeaugrine said hard work isn’t new for the Florida family members and advocates who have championed the ABLE accounts.
“I’m especially proud of the role that Florida played in establishing this program nationally. Florida family members and self-advocates worked tirelessly behind the scenes for years in the hall of the U.S. and Florida capitols to make this program a reality.”
Sikora now lives in Orlando, far from the northern Virginia home where a cadre of parents initially met to discuss their special-needs children and how to best provide for them. Instead of lobbying on Capitol Hill, she is an ambassador for ABLE United.
“I’ve been talking about ABLE accounts for so long. it’s part of my DNA,” she said.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)An effort by Elon Musk’s Boring Company to turn its tunneled Teslas into taxis on Las Vegas’ surface streets, which could put taxi and rideshare services out of business, according to experts, may win approval from the Nevada Transportation Authority without providing the public the opportunity to comment on, ask questions about, or critique the proposal.
The Current reported earlier this month that Paradise Transportation Company, a subsidiary of Boring, tried to mask its connection to the Vegas Loop in its initial application to shuttle passengers to and from the airport and special events with fares that undercut taxi and rideshare services. 
In May, then-NTA Commissioner David Groover partially denied the company’s bid for the ability to operate while its application was being considered. Groover was subsequently removed from the commission by Department of Business and Industry Director Kristopher Sanchez. 
A June hearing on the bid never took place, without explanation from the NTA.  
Within days of the Current’s story, two months after the cancelled hearing, the NTA posted a notice on its website stating the hearing would be rescheduled. 
  A notice posted earlier this month on the Nevada Transportation Authority website. The notice has since been taken down, and no hearing has been scheduled.
A source with knowledge of the situation says the Nevada Transportation Commission intends to vote on the application at its August 28 meeting without holding a hearing, in an effort to avoid public criticism.  
On Thursday, NTA attorney Yoneet Wilburn confirmed that the agency’s statement on its website doesn’t mean a hearing will take place. 
“It does not ensure it,” Wilburn wrote via email, adding an “application hearing is not a requirement before being voted on by the full Authority.”
Dept. of Business and Industry spokeswoman Teri Williams denied the NTA posted false information on its state website, and refused to say why the agency waited two months to post a notice saying the cancelled hearing would be rescheduled. 
“While the language of the notice posted on the website may have been better stated to say that the hearing ‘may’ be rescheduled, the intent of staff was to provide maximum transparency related to the process given that the matter is of high interest to the public because of the unique nature of the larger project,” Williams said Wednesday via email. “We have elected to remove the notice and will not be providing you any further explanation.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/elonmuskmarch52025-1024x731.jpg,,,2025-08-14 14:57:33.297736

“School personnel should not confuse and unsettle young girls by forcing them to share sex-separated sports and intimate facilities with boys,” McMahon said, “nor should school personnel abuse their position of authority by hiding sensitive information pertaining to a child’s health and wellbeing from that child’s parents.”
She vowed a vigorous investigation into the four districts.
Those school districts allegedly allow students to participate in sports and use restrooms and locker rooms based on gender identity instead of biological sex, said the initial complaint from the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies, a conservative nonprofit founded by two former Trump administration officials. Kansas law already prohibits transgender and cisgender girls from playing sports together and bans transgender girls from school locker rooms and bathrooms.
The district policies under investigation also allow educators to maintain confidentiality with transgender students, which in some cases means not disclosing a student’s gender identity to their parents without the student’s consent.
In a 35-page complaint detailing the districts’ gender identity practices and policies, the institute encouraged the federal department to pull funding from the districts, listing court decisions, a January presidential executive order, federal law and state law as justification.
The institute alleges Shawnee Mission, Topeka and Kansas City, Kansas, districts violated Title IX “by forcing students to share intimate facilities with members of the opposite sex as a condition of participation in their education programs and activities,” the complaint said. It argues that the districts’ gender identity policies “erase” sex.
All four schools, the complaint argues, are allegedly in violation of FERPA, which prohibits districts from preventing parental access to student educational records.
The districts “are undermining parents’ rights to access their children’s educational records and appear to be distributing the information contained therein to employees with no legitimate educational interest in these records without parental consent,” the complaint said.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach wrote a letter to McMahon in June, urging the department to investigate. He said in a Thursday announcement that Title IX was created to safeguard girls’ equal educational opportunities.
Kobach had previously sent letters to six Kansas school districts in 2023, criticizing gender identity policies and practices.
“It would be arrogant beyond belief to hide something with such weighty consequences from the very people (parents) that both law and nature vest with providing for a child’s long-term well-being,” he wrote in the December 2023 letter. “That a Kansas school district could so cavalierly allow a minor child—whom science tells us does not even have a fully formed brain until into his or her twenties—to decide whether his or her parents know about such things is shockingly irresponsible.”
Two school districts reportedly modified their policies, Kobach said, but four did not. Those four districts are the subject of the recent complaint.
Kobach also sued the Biden administration in federal court in 2024 to challenge new rules that strengthened antidiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ students and expanded the definition of sexual harassment at colleges and schools. A federal judge eventually blocked the rules from taking effect in Kansas.
“I am grateful that we now have a federal government that takes Title IX seriously and will ensure that school districts follow the law,” Kobach said.
Title IX is enforced by the federal department’s Office of Civil Rights and FERPA is enforced by the department’s Student Privacy Policy Office.
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat, said in a statement the investigation and complaint illustrate “how out of touch Republicans are with reality and with what is happening in our school buildings.”
“These vague, unspecified claims are a witch hunt and a distraction from providing a world-class education,” said Sykes, whose Senate district sits within the Shawnee Mission school district.
She said the investigations are a distraction “from the real issues that are impacting our students right now,” including access to mental and physical health care, food access for families and school funding threats.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lindamcmahon_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-14 14:57:33.297736

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Attorney General Todd Rokita escalated two investigations into alleged discrimination at one of the nation’s top Catholic universities and at a second private Indiana college.
His office recently issued civil investigative demands — similar to a subpoena — to the University of Notre Dame and Butler University, probing into diversity, equity and inclusion practices.
“Treating people differently based on skin color has no place in our state. The universities’ responses to our investigations will determine whether further action is needed to vindicate Indiana’s commitment to equality,” Rokita said in a Thursday news release.

A U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2023 struck down affirmative action in college admissions. It has led to broader challenges to diversity programs and initiatives across higher education.
Rokita sent initial letters in May seeking information, but says now that the universities didn’t provide “meaningful” responses. A third university, DePauw, did respond and that investigation is ongoing, a news release said.
In the Aug. 6 letter to Notre Dame, Rokita said “I appreciate the contributions that Notre Dame makes to our state and country and respect the University’s religious mission. However, neither Notre Dame’s religious mission nor the benefits it may provide to the state would excuse the University from complying with civil rights and nonprofit laws.”
The Aug. 13 letter to Butler included similar language, but focused more on the nonprofit status.
“The suggestion by your attorney in your June 27 Response that the Office of the Attorney General lacks authority to investigate potential legal violations committed by a private nonprofit university is incorrect. As a domestic nonprofit corporation organized and operating under Indiana law, Butler University is subject to Indiana’s nonprofit statute.”
Both of the letters included language saying that nonprofit and educational institutions are supposed to provide a public benefit to the state and that complying with civil rights laws “is critically important.” However, the office went on to say it wasn’t enough for leaders to say they complied — they also needed to meet his civil investigative demands.
Responses from Notre Dame, Butler
In a statement to the Indiana Capital Chronicle, Notre Dame said it didn’t discriminate based on race or ethnicity.
“As a faith-based institution driven by its religious values, Notre Dame strives to treat every member of our community in a manner consistent with our firmly held Catholic beliefs. At the heart of these beliefs is the recognition that we are all children of God, deserving of dignity and respect from one another. We are likewise committed to the rule of law. Accordingly, Notre Dame does not discriminate based on race or ethnicity. We are in receipt of the attorney general’s letter and will respond in due course.”

Bulter said it was assessing “the scope and implications” of Rokita’s legal maneuver but likewise said it didn’t discriminate.
“We stand by the response we submitted on June 27, which affirmed that Butler University does not treat individuals differently based on race or ethnicity. We are committed to ensuring that our policies and practices comply with federal and state laws. Butler remains committed to our founding mission of providing equal access to education for all and fostering a learning environment where every student has the opportunity to succeed.”
Rokita maintains that materials posted on the universities’ websites suggest that various aspects of Notre Dame’s and Butler’s operations may be governed by policies that treat individuals — including students, prospective students, faculty, staff and job applicants — differently based on the individuals’ race or ethnicity; employ race in a negative manner when making admissions or hiring decisions; utilize racial stereotyping; or allocate university resources based on race.
In March, Notre Dame also came under fire when the U.S. Department of Education included Notre Dame among 50 universities targeted for allegedly using racial preferences and stereotypes in education programs, according to WSBT. In that investigation, the university could face losing federal funding if found in violation.

Food, fuel and shelter are not luxuries. They are necessities. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Paul Dragon: What happens when Vermont’s rural communities are left behind.","This commentary is by Paul Dragon of Underhill. He is the executive director of the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity.


Nearly two years ago, I received a call from a Vermont woman in her 70s. It was the dead of winter. Her furnace was broken, and she was out of fuel. She said she wouldn’t normally ask for help, but she was worried about her dog and how cold it was. 
In rural areas across Vermont, the federal government for decades has quietly but critically supported communities through community action agencies like the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity. We repair furnaces, provide crisis fuel assistance and weatherize drafty homes, saving homeowners money to expend on other vital needs. 
Thanks to the small Community Service Block Grant that we leverage with donations from community members we can fill gaps in emergency services like food, shelter and fuel. 
The proposed cuts and elimination of the grant, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and weatherization services do not trim the fat off the budget, they sever the arteries of services and supports which are a lifeline to rural communities. Make no mistake, in these proposed federal cuts, rural communities and rural states like Vermont are taking the brunt. Community Service Block Grant funding and community action agencies serve all people in need and in particular older Vermonters, children, people with disabilities and veterans. 
Food, fuel and shelter are not luxuries. They are necessities. 
Rural Vermont, like much of rural America, is already skating on thin ice. Disappearing farms, higher-than-average poverty rates, food insecurity, little and aging infrastructure, limited public transit, and shrinking hospital networks already make it a daily grind just to get by. In this budget, the grind could become life-threatening as people are forced to choose between food, heat and health care. 
Our money tends to follow our values. What we fund is who we prioritize. The federal budget is not prioritizing rural Vermont or rural America, plain and simple. Decades of effective, proven programs are at risk of disappearing — leaving rural communities and the people who live closest to the land with little or no support. 
The Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity, like other community action agencies around the country, use Community Service Block Grant funds to fight poverty with local, targeted strategies — from emergency food aid, fuel assistance, emergency shelter, housing education and advocacy, Head Start, microbusiness development, weatherization and access to employment.
Our budgets should be a blueprint for dignity by providing the infrastructure and services that will grow our economy, build self-reliance, and strengthen our communities. This 2026 budget does none of that. Instead, it threatens to undermine and visit ruin upon our rural communities. Vermont deserves better.

Don Bacon, R-Nebraska, speaks during a press conference after a visit to Saunders County by Trump Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Aug. 9, 2025. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — President Donald Trump will have a moment in Friday’s Alaska summit to show the world he sees Russian President Vladimir Putin for who he is and not how Trump might want him to be, Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon says.
Putin is the expansionist leader of an American adversary who wants to advance on Europe like one of his idols, Peter the Great, Bacon said, not an ally to American interests.
But to see things clearly, Europe and the world need Trump to respond like he has more recently and be the version of himself who recognizes the nighttime bombings of Ukrainian cities by Putin and not the one who viewed Putin as a friend, Bacon said.
History in national defense
Bacon, a retired Air Force brigadier general who served during the Cold War and leads the House Baltic Caucus, is a longtime hawk on Ukraine, having argued that both Trump and the Biden administration have moved too slowly in arming Ukraine’s defense against Russian invasion. He oversaw the 55th Wing at Nebraska’s Offutt Air Force Base, which is home to U.S. Strategic Command.

The Omaha-area congressman is one of the few House Republicans willing to criticize Trump and a rare military veteran in Congress who has pushed Trump on national security issues. He has gotten more direct since announcing his intention to retire and not run again in 2026.
“We need to see a President Trump that is the President Trump of the past month, not the Trump of the first seven months,” Bacon said in an interview with Nebraska Examiner on Thursday. “A lot of us who care about Ukraine worry that he’ll go back to … where there seems to be a blind spot toward Putin.”
Bacon said the president must head clear-eyed into his meeting with Putin about what the former Soviet and Russian spy really wants: expansion back Russia’s  imperialist borders from 300 years ago under Czar Peter the Great, including taking over the Baltic states. 
Russian perspective vs. Ukrainian independence
Russia considers Ukraine a key part of its territory, and would prefer “a vassal state” to an independent one, Bacon said. That’s a reality most Ukrainian civilians and the bulk of its elected leadership oppose. The people of Ukraine have said they prefer to align with Europe.

Bacon says the president should speak from a place of moral clarity about the differences between the actions of Russia and Ukraine. Russia invaded a sovereign country, hitting civilian targets, he said, and Ukraine is trying to expel them.
“One is an invader, and one is a victim,” Bacon said. 
Putin and his defenders argue Russia had no choice but to attack Ukraine out of fear Ukraine might join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But Bacon says no serious country was prepared to let Ukraine join NATO out of fear of provoking the Russians. But “war came anyway,” he said.
Trump, Bacon said, should consider the reminders from First Lady Melania Trump about the civilians in Ukraine who go to bed each night worried about what missiles or bombs might drop, because Putin sends them in spite of Trump’s calls for a cease fire. Trump has argued that the first lady is part of why he has changed his tone on the war, a shift Bacon has praised.
Bacon wants Trump to remember land swaps in Europe have failed to keep the peace. The British and French swapped  Czechoslovakian land in 1938 with Adolf Hitler, seeking what the British called “peace for our time.” Soon after, Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia and Poland, and World War II ensued.  
Trump does not want to become “Neville Chamberlain, Part 2,” Bacon said, referencing the former British prime minister often blamed for trying appeasement. 
Eastern Europe vulnerable
Much of the rest of Eastern Europe is vulnerable to potential Russian aggression, Bacon said, and if parts of Eastern Europe fall, the price of preserving the rest gets higher. NATO countries would likely get attacked, he said.

“If Ukraine falls, I would put my life savings that Moldovia will be taken over immediately,” Bacon said. “That’s another bordering country with Romania. I think that Georgia and Azerbaijan are very vulnerable. … The Baltics are threatened.”
Russia since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, under Putin and his predecessors, has attacked its neighbors nine times seeking to expand its borders, he said. European nations understand this, particularly Baltic states like Poland.
Putin, Bacon said, is not hiding his ambitions. He has told the world he wants to restore Russia’s former borders. 
“Any country that’s had dealings with Russia in the past or been occupied by them are deathly scared,” Bacon said. “Sometimes Trump seems oblivious to the real dangers of Russia and Putin. But I would say the past month he’s been much better.”

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)Dozens of custodians and security guards in Ramsey and Hennepin counties may have been shorted more than $700,000 while working in libraries, detention facilities and other government buildings, according to SEIU Local 26, a union representing thousands of property service workers.
Union president Greg Nammacher says they reviewed workers’ paystubs and public records and found three contractors — PK Property Services, Squeaky Services, and Black Knight Protection Agency — have been underpaying workers $5 to $12 per hour in wages and benefits by failing to pay prevailing wages. Around 75 workers may be affected, Nammacher said.
PK Services, Squeaky Services and Black Knight Protection Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Companies with government contracts are often required to pay workers prevailing wages, which are set by labor regulators based on the local average wage paid to similarly employed workers.
But workers may not know that they’re entitled to pay and benefits above the minimum wage.
Gregory Murphy, who worked for Black Knight for four years at Hennepin County libraries, said he found out from a union organizer that he should be making $30.44 per hour including wages and benefits. He was only making $24.62 per hour.
“This is wage theft. Plain and simple,” Murphy said during a news conference on Thursday. “My coworkers and I work hard and deserve every dollar we earn.”
As of last week, Murphy works for a different contractor —  Unparalleled Security — providing security in Hennepin County libraries and is earning the prevailing wage.
Jhonnier Gazo said he, too, didn’t know he was entitled to prevailing wages — $27.80 per hour in wages and benefits — as a custodian for PK Services in the Ramsey County Juvenile Detention Center until he was approached by a union organizer. He was earning $18 per hour with no benefits.
“Although I’m afraid of losing my job, I am not afraid to raise my voice. I came to this country to work honest work, and I deserve the same honesty from my employer,” Gazo said in Spanish through an interpreter.
SEIU Local 26 says they submitted their findings to the Ramsey and Hennepin county attorneys offices, which are investigating the alleged wage violations.
SEIU Local 26 criticized Ramsey County last year for switching to non-union contractors, warning the move would lead to job losses and lower labor standards. At the time, PK Property Services already faced allegations of wage theft at an apartment development in Edina.
“Many of our members ultimately lost their jobs a year ago, and today we see that, unfortunately, our cause for concern has come to fruition,” Nammacher said.
In 2019, Minnesota legislators passed one of the most stringent wage theft laws in the country, making it a felony to steal more than $1,000, like other forms of theft. Yet few have been charged in the past six years.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Ethics Commission on Thursday voted unanimously to allow state officeholders to use campaign funds for security. 
The board voted to permit Oklahoma officials to use the funds to pay for security if there is a threat posed to the individual as a direct result of holding office. Any expenses must pass a personal use test, meaning the cost would not have been incurred if the individual was not in office. 
“The officeholder must need security to respond to dangers or threats related to the office held, and not simply for security that any member of the public would need,” according to the opinion. “Further, the dangers or threats are related not just to any elected office within the State of Oklahoma, but the office held by that elected official.”
The approval comes as a bipartisan group of state House and Senate legislative leaders requested increased spending flexibility following the June assassination of a top Minnesota lawmaker and her spouse.
Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Ethics Commission, said any further clarifications will require a rule change, which requires legislative approval. 
“The nature of an advisory opinion is really to clarify the rules,” Bruce Boone said. “That’s why you ask for an advisory opinion. And we think this clarification is certainly appropriate. But to get more specific, that’s really more of a rule change itself. So we may need to consider some additional rules that would be related to this as we consider a rules package for the next legislative session, to give a little more specificity than what can be given in advisory opinion.”
Administrative rules have the force of law and are designed to build upon the statutes legislators create. 
The Federal Election Commission previously issued guidance which allows campaign funds to be used to pay for certain security devices and services to address ongoing dangers and threats. 
Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City and House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, jointly requested the advisory opinion and issued a statement Thursday applauding the Commission’s action. 
“Public service should never mean putting your safety at unnecessary risk,” Paxton said. “This ruling gives elected officials a clear, ethical pathway to address credible threats that arise solely because they hold public office.”
Hilbert said this decision sends a clear message and “strikes the right balance” between the safety of public servants and ensuring accountability of campaign fund use. 
Violence should never be part of the democratic process, Kirt said, but the events in Minnesota reminded elected officials of the risks of public service. 
“Tragic events this past year have left many lawmakers fearful for their safety,” Munson said. “All public servants should have the support they need in order to best serve their communities.”
Lawmakers and elected officials around the country have been on edge and weighing the cost of holding public office after Melissa Hortman, a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party and House Speaker Emerita, and her husband Mark Hortman were shot and killed in their home. 
Vance Boelter, 57, is accused of posing as a police officer to gain entry to the couple’s home and shooting them. He’s also accused of shooting another state lawmaker Rep. John Hoffman and his spouse. Hoffman and his wife are recovering. 
Boelter faces federal and state charges for murder and stalking, some of which carry the potential for the death penalty. He allegedly had a list of other targets.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

Glenn Youngkin addresses the Virginia General Assembly in January 2025. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)At a joint meeting of the Virginia Senate and House appropriations committees Thursday morning, Gov. Glenn Youngkin presented his final overview of the fiscal condition of the state of Virginia. He painted a rosy picture, with revenues coming out over forecast for fiscal year 2025 and a $4.7 billion cushion in rainy day funds.  Democrats, however, pushed back on the governor’s claim that no Virginia Medicaid enrollees would lose coverage under the new federal government requirements.  
Recently, Congress signed off on the reconciliation bill that includes new Medicaid work requirements for “able-bodied” adult enrollees. Starting in 2027, Medicaid recipients will have to work or volunteer, or be enrolled in school. Most Medicaid recipients already work, while lawmakers and hospital associations in Virginia have warned that if thousands of Medicaid recipients lose their insurance, it could have “ripple effects” including a strain on health care centers and passed-down costs to taxpayers. 
For months, state Democrats have said over 322,000 Virginians could lose health insurance, based on a state-by-state breakdown from the U.S. Senate’s Joint Economic Committee and previous CBO estimates released as the reconciliation bill made its way through Congress. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that approximately 4.8-5 million people could lose coverage.
As partisan disputes boil, it’s still unclear how new federal law will impact Medicaid in Virginia

“Changes to Medicaid are not taking coverage away from anyone, and I want to say that again, not a single Virginian is losing access to Medicaid or getting kicked off the program,” Youngkin said to reporters after his presentation on Tuesday. “Not 40,000 Virginians, not whatever number someone else is saying on a given day, no Virginians are losing their Medicaid coverage.” 
Secretary of Finance Stephen Cummings also said no one will lose coverage, but hospitals may face financial challenges, which he said they can absorb. Lawmakers were skeptical.
“I’m glad that you have confidence, but a lot of folks who are relying on us, especially to provide their health care, don’t feel confident,” Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, stated. King cited Medicaid changes inArkansas, where 18,000 individuals lost their health care coverage when the state implemented work requirements in 2018.
Cummings would not comment on whether the administration would use its multi-billion dollar rainy day fund to offset Medicaid costs. 
On Wednesday, Youngkin signed two executive orders to launch a Rural Health Transformation plan, leveraging federal funds to support quality health care access in rural Virginia. Virginia is expected to receive at least $500 million, potentially $1 billion, over five years for rural health care improvements through the initiative.
 Federal job loss impact

Youngkin brought up how the state has fared amid mass federal layoffs, saying 11,200 Virginians have lost their jobs since the start of the year. That number doesn’t reflect the full scope of the impact, with Cummings stating it does not include the workers that took the early buyouts and are still receiving payments until later in the year. As he has in recent months, the governor touted the 250,000 open state jobs in the commonwealth as a possible solution for unemployed workers. 
“What we have seen is unemployment claims generally staying at a very normalized level,” Youngkin said. “Today, we have 250,000 open and available jobs, many of them in Northern Virginia, over 100,000 of them require a bachelor’s degree.”
The governor did not have data to show how many of the former federal workers had made the shift over to an open state position. Virginia’s overall unemployment rate ticked up to 3.5% in June, which has continued an upward trend since January.

 Effort to reduce SNAP error rate 

The governor recently signed an executive directive aimed at localities to reduce the amount of error in doling out payments. In 2027, the state will be on the hook for some of the SNAP funding if there is an error rate above 6% The state currently pays nothing towards SNAP, with it all being federally funded. The state could pay up to 15% depending on the error rates, which would come out to about $270-million in the budget. 
Virginia currently has an 11.5% error rate in SNAP payments. If the state can get that number down to below 6% before 2027, then the state funds will not have to be used for the program.
“I firmly believe that if we can go to work with the localities and provide them with support resources, automation, we do have to change some of the rules which we can do,” Youngkin said. “You can’t allow somebody to attest that they made this much, but they actually have to verify it real time, and I think that will bring down error rates substantially.”
SNAP is handled on the local level, not by the state. But the state is directing the localities to create incentive programs that encourage weeding out fraud, developing partnerships to help alleviate workload in these offices managing the program, and possibly implementing technology upgrades.
 Youngkin touts strong financial situation

Cummings also reiterated the governor’s main message that the commonwealth is in a strong and resilient fiscal position heading into fiscal year 2026.
Cummings said this is a result of Virginia collecting a significant amount of extra money, including $572 million more than expected, due to Virginians paying more in individual income tax nonwithholding revenues. The total general fund revenues grew  by 6.1%  from last year  to $1.78-billion. 
Virginia has accumulated $10 billion in revenue surpluses since 2022 against original forecasts, demonstrating a consistent trend of exceeding expectations.
Overall, Virginia’s economic output grew by 2.6% compared to the 1.5% forecast.
Virginia has also given back over $8.9 billion to taxpayers through tax cuts since 2022, meaning a typical family has saved over $4,600. However, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, questioned the taxpayer data, considering most of them are military retirees.
Cummings said the total is a blended figure and is not intended to “mislead” anyone. He said the data can be broken down by military and non-military.
Youngkin will present his fiscal year 2026 amendments and the 2026-2028 biennial budget to the money committees in December.

A federal grand jury returned a new indictment Thursday with upgraded charges against Teresa Youngblut, including accusing the Washington state resident of shooting and killing a Border Patrol agent in northern Vermont earlier this year.
It was not immediately clear if the new offenses carry the death penalty, though one of Youngblut’s attorneys said at a recent hearing that he expected the federal government to bring capital charges against his client.
Youngblut, 21, had previously been charged with firearms and assault charges in connection with a Jan. 20 shootout stemming from a traffic stop on Interstate 91 in Coventry that resulted in the death of David “Chris” Maland, a Border Patrol agent.

Youngblut, who was also wounded in the incident, was treated at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire. After receiving treatment, Youngblut was arrested and has remained in custody since.
Authorities leading the investigation into the shootout have previously refused to confirm that Youngblut fired the shot that killed Maland.
However, the new indictment does include that allegation, stating that on Jan. 20, Youngblut, “with malice aforethought, unlawfully killed United States Border Patrol Agent D.C.M.” in violation of federal law “by shooting him while he was engaged in and on account of his performance of official duties.”    
During the traffic stop leading to the shootout, according to court documents, Youngblut came out of the vehicle and opened fire, leading to an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement at the scene. 
Maland was killed in the shootout, as was Felix Bauckholt, a German national who was a passenger in the vehicle Youngblut was driving.

There has not been a legislative effort in Connecticut to make breastfeeding in public illegal.
Connecticut General Statutes allow and protect mothers breastfeeding their babies in public spaces. This law is enforced by the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities.
Mothers who want to breastfeed in a public place do not have to cover the baby with a towel or blanket, and do not need to go to the bathroom. 
If an owner, manager or employee of the public space requests the mother to stop breastfeeding the baby, cover up, or leave, it is discriminatory by law, and the mother is legally protected.
There is no national law about breastfeeding in public. It’s up to the states to decide. All fifty states have laws that allow women to breastfeed in public; in Connecticut, the law has been in effect since 1997.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Across the country, farmers and small entrepreneurs are adding drones to their fleet of tools for tasks like spraying agricultural chemicals or spreading seeds for a cover crop. 
Today, the majority of the ag-drone market is made up of Chinese manufactured machinery, which some federal laws seek to outlaw, largely due to national security fears. 
Those in the industry, however, wonder if the budding American ag-drone market is ready to fill the gaps in the event of a U.S. ban on Chinese drones — which could begin at the end of the year.

How and why drones? 
Drones have slowly integrated into the agricultural sector. The price tags and ability to go out and spray right after a rain make them attractive options for farmers who would otherwise risk getting a spray rig stuck in the mud, or wait on the local aerial sprayer to fit them in their schedules. 
Cory Maassen attended a spray drone workshop Tuesday in Clear Lake with his father, who farms corn and soybeans near Avoca. The younger Maassen, who plans to take over the farm when his dad is ready, said he has been looking into drones as an option to add a supplementary revenue stream to the farm operation. 
The Maassen property is under 1,000 acres, so Maassen figured adding a custom sprayer business could help build some longevity in the farm operation. 
“To have a different income stream would be nice as well,” Corey Maassen said. “It’s cheaper than buying new land, it’s cheaper than buying a new sprayer.” 
Maassen’s plan is in line with a lot of spray drone operators. Some farmers will buy a couple of drones for their property and make some cash spraying a neighbor’s field too. Others have built custom spraying businesses with a fleet of drones.
A traditional ag sprayer, one driven in the field, could cost upward of half a million dollars. A new spray drone costs between $25,000 and $60,000, depending on size. Granted, there is a tradeoff in time as a drone can spray a 20- to 30-foot swath at a time, compared to 120-foot booms that could come on a traditional sprayer. 
“This is a fraction of the cost,” Maassen said. “And if it holds up as well as what they’re saying it can, it pays for itself within a year or two.” 
Doug Dodd, a drone specialist at Titan Pro in Clear Lake, where the workshop was hosted, said the biggest reason a farmer should think about a drone is it gives them control over when they spray. 
Dodd said farmers also have the ability to tackle uneven terrains, seed a cover crop and perform multiple applications. To him, drone technology in ag is akin to his grandfather’s generation adding tractors on their farms.  
“You know any farmers who … farm without a tractor?” Dodd said. “I really feel like if guys are apprehensive, they’re falling farther behind.”
Disruption to the Chinese drone market could be imminent
Eric Ringer is the president of the American Spray Drone Coalition and vice president of partnerships for an Iowa City based spray drone retailer and software company. 
Ringer said the nature of the spray drone industry is that the majority of the technology comes from China. 
The American Spray Drone Coalition represents nearly 80% of the ag spray drone market in the country and has opposed some legislation that would restrict the sale of Chinese drones in the U.S. 

The same law also specified Autel Robotics, another Chinese-owned drone company that specializes in drones for security, inspection and surveying purposes.

Last year Congress considered, and ultimately passed, the National Defense Authorization Act, which among many things, stipulated the Chinese-owned drone company DJI join the Federal Communication Commission’s “covered list” unless a federal agency reviewed the company and determined it did not pose a threat to national security.
No agency has taken up the process to review the company and if none steps up by Dec. 23 of this year, DJI will join a slew of other Chinese companies on the covered list, and in essence be banned in the U.S. 
According to the American Spray Drone Coalition, Chinese-made drones account for about 90% of the market in the U.S. Ringer said it was estimated that around 80% of spray drone flights in the U.S. were done with DJI equipment as of 2024. 
“The reality is that the best drones on the market right now are from China,” Ringer said. “We need to do better, as a nation, in building up good domestic alternatives — but that doesn’t happen magically by banning all drones from a certain country.” 
Ringer said the coalition advocates for consumer choice in the spray drone space and he said the coalition is supportive of legislation that can “curb dependency” on Chinese options without limiting options in the market. 
“We advocate for basic farmer choice,” Ringer said. “We want there to be lots of options on the market so that our farmers benefit from all the good things about competition in technology suppliers.” 
Ringer said more competition means downward pressure on price and upward pressure on quality. 
According to data from the American Spray Drone Coalition, more than 10.3 million acres were treated via spray drones in 2024, which represented $215 million in rural revenue – not from purchasing drones but from operators offering custom applications and other such services with the drones. 
U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-New York, penned a letter with other lawmakers urging the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to expedite a review of DJI and Autel to prevent the companies from defaulting to the covered list in December. No further action on this effort has been announced.
A DJI spokesperson wrote in an email the company has been “urging” the relevant agencies to conduct the audit required by Congress, and said the removal of DJI from the American market would have “devastating ramifications” on the U.S. economy.
“We made clear then – as we do now – that we welcome the opportunity to participate in a rigorous, transparent, and fair audit,” the spokesperson said. “We believe our products can stand up to scrutiny because our security protections and data privacy controls are real and robust.” 
The spokesperson also said DJI has also received certifications and security audits from “industry experts and federal agencies.” 
According to the spokesperson, DJI products, which stretch beyond the agricultural sector, generate “more than $116 billion in economic activity” in the U.S. 
“America’s drone community deserves due process,” the statement said. “Today, thousands of farmers, first responders, small businesses, and others would be cut off from essential tools that enable them to operate safely, efficiently, and cost-effectively.” 
Opponents of the Chinese drones fear the surveillance- and data-gathering capabilities of the drones pose a national security threat. 
Ringer said if cybersecurity is a concern, then the focus should be on creating the same types of firewalls and security protections that are on foreign-made consumer electronics. 
Ringer said U.S. options make up around 5% of all manufactured drones, not just ag drones, on the market. With such limited current capacity, he said legislation should urge U.S. drone manufacturers to focus on the “high sensitivity use cases” such as military drones and surveillance. 


Path to flying an ag drone:
Before farmers or custom applicators can take to the sky, there are a number of permits they must obtain: a small unmanned aircraft systems license from the Federal Aviation Administration, a pesticide applicator license and an FAA license for agricultural operations. Operators must also register their drones with both the FAA and the state.

The National Defense Authorization Act is not the only threat to Chinese made drones. 
Certain shipments of DJI drones have been stopped by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, due to concerns of forced labor under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. In a company blog post, DJI said the claims were “entirely unfounded and categorically false.” 
In June, the U.S. House Appropriations Committee approved the Homeland Security budget for fiscal year 2026, which had a provision that would stop U.S. Customs and Border Protections from admitting “aerosol-dispensing unmanned aircraft system(s) produced or manufactured in a foreign adversary country.” 
Ringer said this legislation, if approved by the House and Senate as is, would mean “our farmers are left hanging.” 
Another federal bill, which Ringer said was a “good way” to go about the issue, has a longer timeline for a Chinese drone ban and it offers grants to domestic manufacturers as they ramp up production. 
“The thing that we risk if we cut off our supply of drones today, is that the U.S. options are going to get rushed to market, because there’s a huge vacuum there, and we’re going to deal with quality issues,” Ringer said. 
Ringer said the market has enough options right now that cutting off DJI won’t break it. But, he worries about the impacts to the market if all Chinese drones and components are banned. 
Texas-based ag drone company ready to step in 
Hylio is a Texas-based drone and software company that was born out of a group of college engineering students who saw the potential of ag spray drones. 
Currently, Hylio represents between 10%-15% of the U.S. spray drone market, and is the sole drone brand sold at Titan Pro in Clear Lake. 
Hylio’s CEO Arthur Erickson said if DJI were banned in December, his company wouldn’t fill the gap immediately, “but it really wouldn’t take us long to catch up.”

Part of that is because there are only a few thousand operators in the U.S. that use ag spray drones. Right now, Erickson said, Hylio can make about 2,000 drones a year, but will be up to 5,000-6,000 annually once they reach full capacity in three or four years. 
Erickson said he and his cofounders were not thinking about the geopolitical divide when they founded the company, but as they realized the dominance Chinese brands had on the market, the American-made promise became more of the company’s “ethos.” 
“It’s not that we’re against China or even DJI,” Erickson said. “It shouldn’t be the only monopolistic option on the market. There should be a lot of different choices.” 
Erickson said the strategy to ban all Chinese drones could be a “rip the Band-aid off” method to force American drone companies to accelerate. This would increase demand for Hylio, but also encourage some of the younger U.S. manufacturers to become more competitive. 
“It’s not going to be existential if there’s a somewhat limited supply of these spray drones over the next two or three years as these American companies scale up,” Erickson said. “(Farmers) are not going to go out of business just because they didn’t have spray drones for two or three years.” 
But, he said, some of the risks might come to other sectors of the drone market, like firefighters and police officers who have used drones to locate missing people, as some agencies did following the recent flooding events in Texas.
Erickson said there are certain elements about Chinese owned drones that worry him, including reported funding ties to the Chinese Communist Party and what he called anticompetitive business practices. 
“China’s doing what’s best for them, but we can’t just sit back and let them completely dominate this industry,” Erickson said. “… It would be an existential threat to let any single entity, Chinese or not, have that amount of control.” 
Erickson said the bottom line is that “China is on the chopping block” and that it’s a “serious factor” for those purchasing drones to know that some Chinese models could be banned in a couple of months. 
Maassen, the prospective buyer, said he was considering purchasing a Hylio drone for that very reason.
“DJI, XAG (another Chinese drone company) are going to be cheaper in the buy out – that’s the reality of it,” Maassen said. “Why would I want to buy that drone if I’m not going to be able to service it … it’s not exactly a smart plan on my part.”

As conservative lawmakers work to restrict online access to abortion medication, a new report shows how popular it has become for women who live in states that have outlawed abortion.
Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin led a team that analyzed 15 months of prescription data from Aid Access, one of the largest online abortion telemedicine providers.
They found 84% of Aid Access’s more than 118,000 online prescriptions went to patients living in abortion-ban states.

The South and Midwest had the highest rates of patients accessing telemedicine abortion. Rates were also greater in high-poverty areas or where people would have to travel more than 100 miles to reach an abortion clinic, according to the report, which published this month.
Aid Access is able to mail abortion medications to residents in all 50 states — even those in states with abortion bans — thanks to shield laws in Democratic-led states. Shield laws are designed to minimize the legal risks for people who provide or access abortions across state lines.
Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have reproductive care shield laws, either through legislation or by executive order, according to a report from University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
Eight of those states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — specifically protect telehealth abortion providers regardless of where their patient is located.

Shield laws, along with difficulty accessing in-person abortion services in abortion-ban states, have contributed to a rise in medication and telehealth abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, clearing the way for state bans. With telehealth abortion, patients have a virtual appointment with a clinician who can prescribe abortion medication, which is then filled by a licensed pharmacy and mailed to the patient.
Research has shown telehealth medication abortion is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
But as abortion medication use rises, so have conservative efforts to ban it.
This year, more than a dozen states introduced bills to bar access to medication abortion by criminalizing its sale, purchase or distribution, according to Guttmacher.
One such bill in Texas, which could have been a blueprint for medication abortion restriction in other states, was specifically aimed at groups like Aid Access. It would have allowed private citizens to sue for at least $100,000 anyone who provided abortion pills in Texas. The bill passed the Texas Senate but died in the House in May.
Earlier this year, the state of Louisiana criminally charged a New York physician under its abortion ban law for allegedly providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teen via telehealth. New York, which passed a shield law in 2023, refused Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor.
Last month marked the first federal test of shield laws, when a Texas man sued a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to his partner.
This week, a Texas woman filed a federal lawsuit against Aid Access and against a man who she said impregnated her, then spiked her drink with abortion pills. She is also suing the Dutch doctor who founded Aid Access, alleging Aid Access and its founder mailed abortion-inducing drugs in violation of Texas and federal law.

(Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) A judge has denied a request from Utah death row inmate Ralph Menzies to undergo another evaluation to see if he’s competent to be executed, clearing a major hurdle for the state to proceed with his firing squad execution.  
Utah 3rd District Judge Matthew Bates denied the 67-year-old inmate’s request on Thursday morning, writing that he is “unpersuaded” by the claim that Menzies, who has dementia, is mentally unfit to be executed. 
State and federal law prohibit executing inmates who don’t have a “rational understanding” of why they’re being executed, which essentially means they can’t grasp the government’s reasoning behind pursuing the death penalty. 
For much of the last year, attorneys have tried to argue that Menzies lacks that understanding. Menzies underwent a competency evaluation about a year ago, where doctors commissioned by the state, and his attorneys, reviewed the inmate’s cognitive abilities. In June, Bates ruled that he does have dementia, but was not incompetent. 
Menzies’ attorneys say terminal illness and good behavior are reasons to spare him from firing squad

Menzies’ attorneys then filed a petition for another review in July, arguing that Menzies’ dementia has worsened — that’s what Bates denied on Thursday. 
Menzies, convicted of kidnapping and murdering Maurine Hunsaker in 1988, is scheduled to die on Sept. 5. His attorneys still have a pending appeal with the Utah Supreme Court, with arguments set for next week. The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole is also holding a commutation hearing, where board members could vote to impose a life sentence without the possibility of parole (although that has never happened in Utah). 
But Bates’ ruling on Thursday allows the Utah Department of Corrections to continue moving forward with their plans to execute Menzies. Had they ruled in his favor, it would have likely paused execution proceedings, giving doctors time to conduct their evaluation.
Both Menzies’ attorney and Matt Hunsaker — Maruine’s son — reacted to the news Thursday. Hunsaker said he was “very pleased” with the ruling. 
“I had no doubt that Judge Bates spent a lot of time and a lot of effort,” Hunsaker said. “I’m happy that this step is over and that we can now focus on getting this commutation (hearing) over as well.” 
Eric Zuckerman, Menzies’ attorney, called the ruling disappointing, telling Utah News Dispatch that it “may result in the execution of a man who does not understand why he is being executed.”

“Mr. Menzies has not been evaluated by an independent evaluator for over a year and to proceed with his execution without an assessment of his current cognitive functioning offends the Constitution and will not serve the ends of justice,” Zuckerman said.
Bates, in his ruling, cited phone calls from the prison that show Menzies is still able to hold conversations and understand the basics of his case. There is a change in his voice, Bates writes, which “sounds weaker and more tired.” 
“Even so, Menzies is able to speak with a normal speed. He is able to ask questions, track conversations, and laugh at appropriate times. He remembers names of family members, makes plans with family to visit, and even gives a brief update on his court case. Nothing in the current phone conversations demonstrate a substantial change in his cognitive functioning,” the ruling reads. 
Bates also said there’s a lack of evidence showing that he’s disoriented, impaired or doesn’t have a basic understanding of the concept of crime and punishment. 
“He had a sense of time and place. He was not confused about who the examiners were, who he was, or where he was,” Bates wrote. 
Instead, Bates found the reports and evidence submitted simply show that Menzies is physically struggling, with a memory that isn’t as good as it used to be — not enough to be deemed incompetent. 
“Forgetfulness, an inability to concentrate, and a paucity of language do not amount to a lack of an ability to reach a rational understanding of the link between crime and punishment. Menzies has not alleged sufficient facts or provided sufficient evidence that raises a significant question of whether Menzies is incapable of understanding that he is being executed because he killed Maureen Hunsaker,” Bates wrote.

This change is most strikingly evident at the federal level, where the Trump Administration has aggressively pursued truly shocking anti-environment and anti-clean energy policies, and where the Republican controlled House and Senate have provided zero resistance to those numerous attacks. (A good tracking of these attacks is provided here.)
Having had the opportunity over the years to testify in Congress, and in the state legislatures in seven different states, I have had a good vantage point to observe this disturbing shift in Republican actions. For the rest of this piece, I will focus on my particular area of expertise: energy efficiency policy, and on my home state of Michigan, which happens to provide a vivid example of this deteriorating Republican support.
Michigan made some good early progress on energy efficiency in the post ‘energy crisis’ years, from 1979 until the early 1990’s. This was first under Republican Governor Bill Milliken and then Democratic Governor Jim Blanchard. However, Republican Governor John Engler terminated all the utility energy efficiency programs around 1995.  (There were certainly some ‘bad’ Republican politicians regarding clean energy even then.)  As a result of those bleak years, I left my position as Supervisor of Evaluation at the Michigan Public Service Commission in 1999 and became Director of the Utilities Program at the non-profit organization the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
Fast forward to 2008, when after over a decade of no energy efficiency programs, the state seriously pursued a strong clean energy policy. The state was under very mixed political control. Democrats controlled the governorship (Jennifer Granholm) and the House, while Republicans had the majority in the Senate.  (I personally testified in the House, had meetings with key senators and wrote a Detroit Free Press editorial.)  After months of discussion and drama, the legislature ultimately passed PA 295 of 2008.
That legislation established for the first time a specific requirement for utility energy efficiency programs and set target savings requirements, and also set a requirement for a certain percentage of electricity generation to come from renewable energy.   (In full disclosure, as it turned out, I had the great fortune to help compose most of the text of the utility energy efficiency portion of the legislation that ultimately passed.)
But most notably for the purposes of this essay, the legislation passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in both chambers: 83-24 in the Democratic controlled House and 26-10 in the Republican controlled Senate. [As a side note, this established a very strong core policy for utility energy efficiency, such that in the most recent national rankings by ACEEE, Michigan was ranked second in the nation among all 50 states in the category of utility energy efficiency policies and performance.]
The next major policy action on clean energy was in 2016, a time when the Republicans controlled the governorship (Rick Snyder), the Senate and the House.  While some initial draft efforts actually proposed ending the state mandates for energy efficiency and renewable energy, after much effort (e.g., in disclosure, I personally testified in the Senate and wrote a couple op-eds) the tide was turned.  Ultimately the legislature passed PA342, which actually strengthened both the utility energy efficiency requirements and the renewable energy standard.  Notably, the final votes were overwhelmingly bipartisan, 33 -4 in the GOP controlled Senate and 76-31 in the GOP controlled House. [Much credit is due to Republican Governor Snyder, who fortunately remained a supporter of energy efficiency and renewable energy throughout his terms in office.]
Which brings us to the next and most recent big move in Michigan clean energy policy, and a direct example of how Republican support for clean energy has vanished. In 2023, Democrats controlled the Governorship (Gretchen Whitmer), the House and the Senate (albeit with slim majorities). Climate change had become a major topic of interest, and a package of bills was introduced to address that issue. The most pertinent bills here ended up being PA235 (to greatly strengthen the renewable energy requirement on utilities) and PA229 to strengthen the utility energy efficiency standard.  (Again, in disclosure, I testified in the House and helped craft some of the PA229 provisions.)
The result of this effort vividly illustrates how the Republican Party seems to have come to complete abandonment of clean energy (and climate) policy.  Republicans opposed these efforts, and both PA 235 and PA 229 passed the House and the Senate without a single Republican vote (PA235: 20-17 Senate, 56-51 House; PA229 20-15 Senate, 56-53 House).  And since the Republicans took control of the Michigan House after the 2024 elections, not a single piece of positive clean energy legislation has advanced at all.
So, this leaves us with two crucial questions: 1) how on Earth did the Republican Party shift so strongly from at least moderate support of energy efficiency and renewable energy to such virulent opposition? And 2) given that the future of a livable planet is frankly at stake, how can we either change or overcome that opposition?

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers is taking a victory lap after four major semitruck manufacturers his office sued last fall agreed this week that California-led electric vehicle standards and emissions rules are now “voided.”
Hilgers last November announced a state-level antitrust lawsuit against Daimler Truck North America, International Motors Inc. (formerly Navistar Inc.), PACCAR Inc., and Volvo Group North America, as well as the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association. His office had targeted a joint “Clean Truck Partnership” involving the manufacturers, trade association and California regulators that required regulatory compliance “even if those mandates were unlawful.”
After manufacturers said Monday that those California rules are no longer binding, while being careful not to assume liability, Hilgers said it’s a “culmination of a multi-front war … against a destructive ideological agenda.”
“If successful, these efforts would have decimated jobs in Nebraska, cut off parts of rural [America] from [a] regular supply of goods and raised consumer prices,” Hilgers wrote this week on X, formerly Twitter. “Nebraska has been leading the fight, and we have been winning.”
The lawsuit was filed in Lincoln County District Court, in North Platte, which Hilgers described as Nebraska’s “epicenter for transportation.” The Energy Marketers of America and Renewable Fuels Nebraska had joined Hilgers in his lawsuit.
The lawsuit was the third prong in Nebraska’s fight against California-initiated “shortsighted and damaging electric-truck mandates,” the Nebraska AG’s Office said this week.

In May 2024, Hilgers challenged California’s “Advanced Clean Fleet” regulations in federal court, guidelines that had spurred the subsequent “Clean Truck Partnership” in July 2023. Hilgers and Nebraska truckers said the California regulations “reached well beyond California’s borders” and would potentially block access to California or its ports.
California state regulators agreed to repeal the “Advanced Clean Fleet” regulations this May. 
Nebraska, along with 24 other states, also sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last year seeking to repeal EV mandates and regulations crafted under former President Joe Biden. President Donald Trump’s administration recently agreed to repeal those requirements.
Liane Randolph, chair of the California Air Resources Board, had praised the Clean Truck Partnership as an “unprecedented collaboration” that “marks a new era in our zero-emission future.”
“This agreement makes it clear that we have shared goals to tackle pollution and climate change and to ensure the success of the truck owners and operators who provide critical services to California’s economy,” Randolph said in a July 2023, statement.
Hilgers argued the partnership was unlawful in part because the four targeted manufacturers had secured an “oligopoly” on producing 99.9% of trucks over 33,000 pounds, including:

Cement mixers.
Dump trucks.
Fire trucks.
Fuel trucks.
Heavy semi-tractors.
Refrigerated vans.
Semi sleepers.
Tour buses.

Andrew Ferguson, chair of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, also weighed in on Nebraska’s actions this week, praising Hilgers for doing “incredible work for the people of Nebraska and the whole country.”
“Very proud to partner with him to protect competition in our markets!” Ferguson wrote on X.
Hilgers said the nation’s economy depends on diesel-powered semitrucks, which he described as critical to keeping costs low for consumers and supplying rural America.
“That industry has been under assault by California,” Hilgers said Monday. “Today’s victory ensures that the availability and costs of those trucks will be dictated by market forces, not unelected bureaucrats in another state.”

Enrollment there, much like the rest of the microschool sector, has seen a boom, and operators such as Wilson believe state laws are a key to the future growth of alternative school settings like hers (photo submitted).When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.
In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
 Many microschools aren’t accredited

Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
 ‘Microschooling is not one thing’

Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
 Seeking choices

After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

(Photo by Gage Skidmore)A bipartisan group of Congress members has waded into the fight over whether Alina Habba should keep her job as New Jersey’s U.S. attorney, arguing that the Trump administration’s “machinations” to keep her in office violate a federal law meant to reinforce the separation of powers required by the Constitution.
The brief filed Wednesday by Democrat Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, four other House Democrats, and a former Republican congressman comes one day before a federal judge in Pennsylvania will hear arguments in a criminal defendant’s challenge of Habba’s authority.
Lawyers are expected to square off Friday in Williamsport before U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann over Irvington man Julien Giraud Jr.’s effort to disqualify Habba. Federal judges tried to end Habba’s turbulent tenure last month by appointing her top deputy as her successor, but the Trump administration fired that replacement and reinstalled Habba, setting the stage for Friday’s showdown in Pennsylvania.

In Wednesday’s brief, the Congress members said they aimed to inform Brann of Congress’s intent and authority in creating the statutory framework that governs the appointment of U.S. attorneys. Besides Pallone, the other politicians on the brief are Reps. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), Stephen Lynch (D-Massachusetts), Bennie Thompson (D-Mississippi), and Nydia Velázquez (D-New York), plus former Rep. Wayne Gilchrest, a Republican who represented Maryland for nine terms until 2009.
The six voted in favor of the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act, a 2007 law that gives the Senate 120 days to approve a U.S. attorney appointed by the president or attorney general and allows federal judges to appoint someone if the clock runs out with no Senate action.
The law was meant to codify the checks and balances between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches that the Constitution’s appointments clause requires, the Congress members noted in the brief. They urged Brann “not to ratify the Administration’s attempt to sidestep the Appointments Clause with respect to Ms. Habba.”
Splitting the responsibility for appointments between the executive and legislative branches acts as a check on favoritism, prevents unfit people from being appointed, and ensures one branch doesn’t wield more power than another, they wrote. They quoted James Madison — the fourth U.S. president and an author of the Federalist Papers — to make their point.
“The founders believed that ‘the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands … may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny,’” the brief reads.
The brief was just the latest in a flurry of filings since the tug-of-war over the U.S. attorney position began earlier this summer.
Brann, an Obama nominee, two weeks ago rejected Giraud’s motion to dismiss his case, even as he agreed to hear his arguments that Habba has no authority to prosecute him because her appointment was unconstitutional. Giraud was indicted in November 2024 for various drug and firearm offenses. A second man, Cesar Pina of Franklin Lakes, who is facing federal money laundering and bribery charges, is also challenging Habba’s appointment.
The Justice Department argued in a brief this week that Habba’s appointment is valid because her post was “indisputably vacant,” referring to the Trump administration’s hasty maneuvering to oust Desiree Leigh Grace — the first assistant U.S. attorney the judges picked — and restore Habba.
That maneuvering relied on widely disputed math.
President Donald Trump named Habba, his former personal attorney, to the job on March 24, but she wasn’t sworn in until March 28. That led to disagreement over when her 120 days in office were up.
The timing matters, because the judges named Grace to the post on July 22 — 120 days after March 24. But the Trump administration insists Habba’s 120 days weren’t up until July 26, and during those extra four days, administration officials fired Grace, Habba resigned, and Attorney General Pamela Bondi named Habba first assistant U.S. attorney. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, the first assistant can serve as acting U.S. attorney for 210 days. That maneuvering essentially restarted the clock for Habba’s time in the job.
Administration officials have denied critics’ complaints that such maneuvering was an unconstitutional “workaround.”
Habba has drawn widespread criticism during her stint in the job, most rooted in her prosecutions of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver, both Democrats whose arrests stemmed from their May visit to an immigrant jail in Newark. Her office has reportedly subpoenaed Gov. Phil Murphy, also a Democrat, over comments he made in February that suggested he might hide an undocumented immigrant in his home.
New Jersey’s senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats, had objected to Habba taking the job permanently, accusing her of using the office to pursue “frivolous and politically motivated prosecutions.”

Some argue that the practice builds alumni tradition and a culture of financial giving, but it remains an affront to equity in education. 
The post Legacy admissions must go   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","HARVARD UNIVERSITY has been battling admirably in the courts to preserve academic freedom and precious research dollars in the face of government overreach. At the same time, it has bowed to pressure from the Trump administration to eliminate DEI programming—closing offices that support women, queer students, and students of color.  
The inconsistency of those stands is as apparent as it is troubling. But it’s not the only issue where the university has backed policies that are hard to square.  
Two years ago, Harvard defended race-based affirmative action in admissions before the Supreme Court in an effort to protect access for underrepresented students. But it continues to implement legacy preferences that limit access for those same students—even after the Supreme Court’s decision in SFFA v. Harvard led to a significant decline in Black student enrollment. 
Harvard is not alone in clinging to an antiquated admissions policy.  
In a state renowned for its world-class universities and at a time when programs that provide access for underrepresented students are under federal assault, it’s troubling that other Massachusetts colleges also still cling to legacy preferences—preferential treatment for applicants whose family previously attended the college. 
Legacy preferences are a relic from the 1920s when elite institutions sought to exclude Jewish and other immigrant students. Today, some argue that the practice builds alumni tradition and a culture of financial giving, but it remains an affront to equity in education. 
Harvard economist Raj Chetty and colleagues have demonstrated that legacy preferences contribute significantly to inequity in admissions. According to their research, legacy applicants are admitted at higher rates across all income levels, but the biggest advantage goes to wealthy families: high-income legacy students are five times more likely to be admitted to elite colleges than comparable non-legacy applicants. 
At Harvard, the disparity is even more striking. Court records showed legacy applicants were nearly six times more likely to be admitted. A 2021 study found that 70 percent of legacies were white, and 75 percent of white students admitted as ALDCs—athletes, legacies, dean’s interest list (often donors), and children of faculty—would have been rejected if they were nonwhite. 
Massachusetts institutions other than Harvard that still use legacy preferences include some of the most selective private colleges in the country—Boston College, Northeastern, Tufts, Smith, and Wellesley, among others. 
These institutions are increasingly out of step with the national landscape. The share of four-year colleges using legacy preferences has dropped from 49 percent in 2015 to just 24 percent today. Here in Massachusetts, Amherst College and Boston University have recently ended the practice. But while virtually all our public colleges and universities (Massachusetts Maritime Academy is an exception) have eliminated legacy preferences,  39 percent of our private institutions continue to use legacy admission. 
That’s why the Massachusetts Legislature must act. This session, the Joint Committee on Higher Education advanced S.2687, the Senate version of  An Act Relative to Higher Education Admissions Policy, which bans legacy preferences. The bill ensures that admissions decisions are based on merit and potential—not inherited privilege.  
This legislation isn’t controversial. Ending legacy preferences is supported widely by Democrats, Republicans, and three-quarters of Americans. Just one in eight admissions directors believe legacy status should play a role in college admissions. National groups like the NAACP and the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) favor ending legacy admissions. Nationwide, students across many college campuses have launched grassroots efforts to end the admission policy.  
Here in Massachusetts, organizations such as the Massachusetts chapter of the ACLU and United Auto Workers Region 9A support the bill. The Harvard Crimson editorial board, the Harvard Graduate Students Union, and even former Harvard presidents Lawrence Summers and Derek Bok have publicly called for an end to legacy admissions.  
Other states have already taken action. Colorado became the first to ban legacy admissions at public universities in 2021, followed by Illinois and Virginia. California and Maryland have gone further, banning the practice at both public and private colleges. It’s time for Massachusetts to join them. 
Legacy preferences have no place in a modern, equitable education system. Our colleges and universities should be engines of opportunity, not gatekeepers of privilege. At a time when the federal government is targeting diversity and inclusion efforts, Massachusetts must lead by banning this discriminatory, outdated practice once and for all. 
Lydia Edwards is Senate chair of the Joint Committee on Judiciary and the Senate lead sponsor of legislation to end legacy preferences. Raul Fernandez is a senior lecturer in educational leadership & policy studies at Boston University’s Wheelock College of Education & Human Development.

But an economic development watchdog said the episode illustrates how the frenzy to land electric vehicle jobs can leave economically distressed towns vulnerable to empty promises. 
Imola CEO Rodney Henry declined requests for an interview. He responded to Floodlight’s inquiries with a short statement, insisting the company had not given up on its plans, which have included a partnership with an Italian manufacturer of two-seat electric vehicles. 
“Our timetable has been modified due to matters outside of our control,” Henry said in a statement. “We are highly focused on bringing our goals into alignment. Due to proprietary consideration as well as NDA (nondisclosure) agreements, we are not at liberty to discuss specifics at this juncture.”
That’s a stark shift from the company’s earlier promises. In a press release issued in January 2024, Henry claimed the company had already secured land in multiple states to build half a dozen plants and create tens of thousands of jobs. 
Could someone with no experience in car manufacturing really deliver that?
“It’s ludicrous,” said Greg LeRoy, CEO of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks and analyzes economic development projects. 
Building large auto plants, he said, requires “a great deal of capital, a great deal of management skill, a great deal of engineering and marketing chops. And obviously, Tesla developed those, but they didn’t do it overnight, right?”
Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff weren’t the only towns swept up in the competition to attract electric vehicle plants. Spurred by federal policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, which unlocked billions in private investment and expanded government incentives, local officials across the country scrambled to land high-paying manufacturing jobs and a slice of the booming clean energy economy.
Since the IRA passed in 2022, more than 150 EV plants have been announced in the United States, according to E2, a nonpartisan group of business leaders who advocate for economic development good for the environment.
But that rush may be grinding to a halt. The recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which rolls back many federal tax credits and incentives for electric vehicles, is already throwing the EV sector into turmoil — threatening to stall or shrink the kinds of ambitious projects towns like Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff were counting on. E2 reports that plans for 14 EV-related plants have been canceled this year.
Bold promises, then silence
In three towns where Imola pledged massive investment, there’s no sign of construction and little more than confusion.
Langston — a town of 1,600 where more than 35% of residents live in poverty — never saw Imola’s plans take shape.
A 2023 letter to the city council from former Imola chief operating officer Eric Pettus stated that the company had run into “multiple obstacles,” including trouble acquiring enough land.
“In order for us to continue moving forward on the project we are requesting that the City of Langston convey to us any and all vacant properties owned by the city,” Pettus wrote.
Langston City Council member Magnus Scott said the company also asked the town to issue municipal bonds to help them build their plant. 
But before any land changed hands or bonds were issued, a company representative delivered unexpected news: The deal had been canceled. “I guess maybe they ran into financial problems,” Scott said.
Reached by phone, Pettus, of south Florida, said he’s no longer employed by Imola but instead works as a consultant for the company. Citing a nondisclosure agreement, he declined to discuss Imola’s plans.
Fort Valley gave its backing in early 2024 to Imola’s ambitious plan to build an EV plant that would employ 7,500 workers. 
A year later, with no sign of progress on the plant, the company came back to the Georgia town with an entirely different proposal. This time, instead of building an EV plant, they pitched a high-tech lighting system for the town. 
One city council member balked.
“You want us to sign an agreement for 99 years before you bring us the car company,” said council member Laronda Eason, according to minutes of the March 2025 meeting. “It feels like a bait and switch.” 
Eason did not respond to emails and text messages seeking comment on the Imola proposal.
In Pine Bluff, where per capita income last year was just over $21,000, city officials were initially all in. Writing to Henry in August 2024, then-Mayor Shirley Washington said the city of 39,000 stood ready to buy land, build infrastructure and issue industrial revenue bonds to support Imola’s vision. 
“With an anticipated employment base of more than 8,000 jobs,” Washington wrote, “we firmly believe this investment will marshal a pivotal turning point in our community.”  
But a year later, the project hasn’t moved. “We never did get off the ground with that,” Washington said in a brief phone interview. 
LeRoy said Imola’s pitch fits a troubling pattern.
“It grabs me as an example of how the craze among governors and mayors to get the next big thing has caused some sloppy vetting,” he said of the struggling communities courted by Imola. 
Such towns, he said, are “easy prey. …They’re desperate.”
Grand vision, missing details
Henry, who lives in Florida, touts a background as a longtime TV executive producer and the founder of Protégé, an athletic footwear brand. He claims on his IMDB profile that Protégé donated a million pairs of shoes to African nations.
But despite announcements of partnerships and promises of good-paying jobs, his EV company has yet to show any tangible progress. 
Floodlight found the website for Imola — named after the Italian city where Tazzari EVs are made — is no longer accessible without a password. A search of the Tazzari website found no mention of plants in the United States. But a 2024 version of the Imola site mentions the tiny vehicles “coming soon to America.”
In early 2024, Imola Automotive USA and the Tazzari Group — an Italian firm best known for its electric two-seater micro cars — jointly announced plans for a partnership. 
The EVs that Tazzari makes in Italy aren’t designed for highway driving. Top speed on the company’s Opensky Sport model is about 56 miles per hour, while maximum speed on the Opensky Limited is about 37 mph, according to the company’s webpage.
Tazzari didn’t respond to email messages from a Floodlight reporter.
Henry said at that time that the company chose Langston and Fort Valley because of their universities. 
“Both of these locations are ideal,” he said in the January 2024 news release, “as their proximity to communities with institutions of higher learning, will allow residents and students career opportunities in the fast growing EV Technology and Innovation Industry.” 
Many local officials in Fort Valley, Langston and Pine Bluff did not respond to interview requests. Few documents were provided in response to Floodlight’s public records requests.
But it’s clear from available records that Imola’s promises stirred hope. 
Langston Mayor Michael Boyles called the proposal “transformative” in a January 2024 news release.
But some local leaders soon began to question the details.
Erica Johnson, a real estate agent and former member of Langston’s economic development commission, said parts of the plan didn’t add up. How, for instance, would the company house more than 1,000 workers in such a small town? And how were they going to build such a large plant on land without utilities or water?
Her doubts deepened when she learned that Imola wanted to lock down land agreements without putting up any earnest money.
“My early feeling was that, ‘Something is not quite okay with this,’ ” she said. “But I think the hope for our community kind of outweighed the ability to just take things slow and look at them for where they are and what they are — versus where you hope them to be.”
Eventually, the promise fizzled. 
“It was disappointing,” Johnson said. “…We could have had our energy and time focused on something that seemed more valid and more substantial.”
Still waiting for the shovels
Some residents in Fort Valley are still holding out hope.
Mayor Jeffery Lundy said early last year that it was a “priority for my administration to land a company like Imola Automotive USA.” Local officials, he said, were looking forward to the economic boost the plant would bring.
At the time, Imola claimed it would break ground on a 195-acre site by the third quarter of 2024 and open the plant within 20 months, according to a report in the Macon Telegraph. 
During a February 2024 town hall meeting, Imola officials told residents that the plant would pay employees an average of $45 an hour, according to a Facebook post. Commenters buzzed with excitement, with one writing: “Application me !!!!” 
Pettus told a local TV station that most jobs would require only a high school diploma.
In early 2024, Fort Valley rezoned land to accommodate the plant, and the city council signed off on the deal. But more than 15 months later, there’s still no sign of construction. 
Council members were told that Georgia Power couldn’t provide sufficient power for the EV company, according to minutes of their March 2025 meeting. A spokesman for Georgia Power said that while the utility doesn’t discuss economic development projects, “We’re prepared and ready to meet the energy needs of any new customer.” 
Makita Driver, one of the Facebook commenters who’d voiced excitement about the proposed EV plant, said there’s no doubt she would have applied for one of the jobs there — had the facility ever been built.
“The pay rate was really what got my attention,” she said.
As a medical assistant, Driver said she earns far less than what Imola had promised. But she eventually concluded the promises were too good to be true.
“Who really makes that kind of money starting out?” she asked.
In a brief interview with Floodlight on July 11, Mayor Lundy said he’s still in contact with Henry.
“We are patiently waiting for that groundbreaking,” Lundy said.

An Alabama state representative made the case for state-supported early childhood education Wednesday during a meeting of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s Pre-K for All Advisory Committee in Kentucky.
Rep. Jeana Ross, R-Guntersville, a former educator and former secretary of the Alabama Department of Early Childhood Education, said the state’s pre-K program “has survived Democratic and Republican governors” and has “always been a bipartisan program with bipartisan support and strong local and community support as well.”
Ross was key in creating Alabama’s program at a time when research about brain development in young children was receiving more attention, she said.

“It became evident that (in) these early years, a lot was going on,” Ross said. “The brain development and the experiences that children had early absolutely set their trajectory for the rest of their lives.”
The committee also heard from Steven Barnett, the founder and senior co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, who said that children who attend pre-kindergarten are more likely to be ready for kindergarten, be healthier and live longer.
During the legislative session that convenes in January, Kentucky lawmakers will adopt the next two-year state budget. That probably will be Beshear’s last chance to win funding for pre-K for all Kentucky 4-year-olds, a proposal he has unsuccessfully pushed with the Republican-controlled legislature. Kentucky governors are limited to two terms, and Beshear’s second term ends in 2027.

In June, he signed an executive order establishing the advisory committee to explore support for universal pre-kindergarten programs in Kentucky.
During Wednesday’s Zoom meeting, the committee learned about what other states have done in public preschool programs.
Barnett said  pre-K has a domino effect on multiple parts of life.
“If you set those kinds of things up, you can then produce substantial improvements in later achievement, decreases in the need for special education, decreased failure and grade retention, and those things lead to increased educational attainment, more high school graduation, more post secondary enrollment,” Barnett told the committee.“Once you have that higher educational achievement, a whole host of other benefits follow: less crime, higher earnings, better jobs, better health. People will actually live longer.”
  Steven Barnett
During his weekly press conference Wednesday, Beshear said that since establishing the committee, people have sent more than 22,000 emails to legislators expressing support for universal pre-K in Kentucky.
The committee has also held town halls in Bowling Green, Morehead, Frankfort and Northern Kentucky, which were “incredibly successful” and “very well attended,” according to Sam Flynn, the executive director for the Team Kentucky Pre-K for All Program.
“It’s a no-brainer: Everybody wins by making pre-K accessible to every 4-year-old Kentucky child, including our businesses, our families, our kids and our economy,” Beshear said. One in five Kentucky children currently live in poverty.
Beshear also cited recently published research that found parents benefit in their careers by having access to universal pre-K for their children.
Flynn said “a significant number of” school superintendents in the state have “either reached out to us — or we’ve spoken directly to them — saying how much they support this.”

‘Be very brave’

From the beginning of Alabama’s work to make a successful pre-K program, Ross said, it was important to communicate “the importance of early childhood education and what it meant for our communities in our state as a whole.”
Additionally, she said, “we knew that if the quality was not there, you may be doing more harm than good. So the quality was critical, and we built that from day one.”
The committee chose to examine Alabama because of the state’s similar characteristics to Kentucky. It also looked at Georgia and Iowa.
Andrea Day, a division director for the Department for Community Based Services, within the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said that Alabama and Georgia residents spend the lowest percentage of their income on child care for 4-year-olds. Kentuckians, in contrast, spend the most — 10% of annual income for one child, Day said.
  (Source: Pre-K for All Advisory Committee)
To launch a successful pre-K program, Ross said, states have to “be very brave and take a few risks.”
In Kentucky, about 63% of Kentucky’s children ages 3 and 4 were not in school from 2019-2023, an increase from 58% from 2014-2018. In 2024, 67% of Kentucky’s fourth graders were less than proficient in reading. That’s up from 65% in 2019.
That same year, most — 76% — of eighth graders in the state weren’t proficient in math, up from 71% in 2019. From 2021-2022, 10% of high school students did not graduate on time, an increase from 9% in 2019, according to the report.
Alabama’s voluntary pre-K program has not achieved universal enrollment  despite being recognized for its high quality.
Alabama was able to show that students who went through pre-K education were less likely to need special education services and more likely to attend class when they entered K-12, Ross said.
“By the time they left that program, not only did they catch up, but they were ready for kindergarten,” Ross said. “And we could prove it.”

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.

“We’re in the worst hunger crisis that we’ve seen in nearly 20 years and with SNAP cuts that have been passed at the federal level, we’re going to see that spike in a way that we can’t fill the gap up,” Amy Beros, CEO of the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina, said during an interview with NC Newsline.
Beros said there are more than 600,000 people in the 34 counties her agencies serve facing hunger every day. That number is up from 450,000 people two years ago, she said.

The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.



This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

  Federal fallout: Medicaid and insurance in Montana 

The Daily Montanan is launching a series of articles that breaks down some of the biggest changes implemented by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump in the so-called “Big, beautiful bill.”
All four members of Montana’s Congressional delegation — Republicans Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, along with Reps. Troy Downing and Ryan Zinke — voted for these changes. 
Today’s stories are the fourth and final installment:
Community concerned: Throughout rural Montana, healthcare providers are concerned about a repeat of the past: Critical-access hospitals, which dot the Treasure State, will see fewer patients with insurance and have fewer ways to get reimbursed, even though the state has not seen a hospital close in more than a decade. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Mental health questions: As funding to Medicaid programs decreases, and as rural hospitals become particularly vulnerable, the gains and progress made at getting mental health services into rural areas could be among the first casualties of the new federal legislation (Story by Stateline)
Our previous stories have included:  
Another big change in the Big Sky: Whether you’re one of more than 100,000 people on Medicaid or whether you purchase your health insurance on the marketplace (healthcare.gov), recent federal changes will mean a decrease in people who qualify under expanded Medicaid, as well as hefty health insurance premium hikes from those who purchase a plan. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Is $50 billion enough: Congress has allocated $50 billion to be used for rural state hospitals, which had been identified as particularly vulnerable in the “Big, beautiful” bill. Republicans from rural states demanded the money in exchange for the support, but will the fund be enough? And, what happens after it’s depleted? (Story by Stateline)
Navigators no more: In February, Congress also voted to defund most of the health insurance navigators at the state level. In Montana, 90% of the navigators won’t be available after many of these changes become reality, leaving residents to answer questions on their own, or try their luck accessing one of the few left after the cuts. These navigators helped residents find insurance, understand their eligibility and explain policy differences. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Less leeway: States like Montana had previously come up with their own work eligibility and verification programs. But with the new Trump rules surrounding Medicaid, that means states have less flexibility and fewer resources to navigate the changes (Story by KFF Health News)
Redetermination redo: New work requirements put in place by the Trump administration and narrowly approved by Congress mean that states will now need more documentation and verification that those receiving Medicaid are eligible because they’re working or meet an exemption. Montana’s history with the “determination” and “redetermination” process means that residents who qualify could be accidentally left without insurance while the state must now be in a state of increased processing and reprocessing. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Reality check: About all those people watching TV. For years, many conservatives, including U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, have claimed legions of people were essentially freeloading off the government, collecting health insurance benefits without work. However, PolitiFact digs into that claim and finds the narrative, while politically satisfying, is a fiction. (Story by PolitiFact and KFF Health News)
Determining difficulties: The “big, beautiful bill” will require those who want Medicaid to undergo a process of determination for eligibility. The work requirements are new for many states, and they’ll require verification and documentation, which will substantially increase the workload for states, leading some to say the process could be too much to handle.

The spreadsheets aren’t even the most difficult part. It’s the questions from staff who have read headlines, know the industry, and wonder: “Will I have a job?”
  Kristi Gatrell (Photo courtesy of Montana Hospital Association).
When she ventures into the community nestled in southern Montana near two large American Indian reservations, she is often asked: “Will I have my hospital?”
Yes, she answers to both questions, but that doesn’t help her sleep any better as the leader of a healthcare institution affiliated with one of the larger organizations in the state. She began her medical career in the same facility as the radiology technician and worked to the highest position in Hardin.
“We’re hanging on by the skin of our teeth as it stands, and how much more can we afford for the patients who have no insurance coverage?” Gatrell asked.
Healthcare leaders from institutions of all sizes in Montana are in a frustrating waiting game: They understand the upcoming changes, while patients, staff and community members try to absorb the same information. How those radical changes will affect the state and the industry is, for a moment, a lot of questions with few definitive answers.
JJ Carmody, the director of health policy and government relations for Billings Clinic-Logan Health, said that administrators from all parts of the sprawling Montana operations are focused on the upcoming headwinds.
“Because of their (small) size and their volume of the market, it makes them more vulnerable,” Carmody said.
Gatrell has faced headwinds previous: She was the community face when the Hardin-based center announced it would be shuttering its nursing home.
“That was a big impact, and it was hard to be the face in the community that had to tell grandma that she had to find another place to live,” Gatrell said.
She knew the residents there by name and knew a lot of family members even as the staff attempted to find new placements.
For now, she’s encouraging staff to be proactive. She reminds them the only way to survive is working together. It means doing more with less, Gatrell said. Currently, the organization is looking into ways to cross-train staff.
Now, they’re scrutinizing staff training budgets and even equipment.
“We’re still in a wait-and-see mode,” Gatrell said.
That could be as simple as watching their own doors — seeing what the new changes truly mean.
“One of the ways we’ll be able to tell what it looks like is what comes through the doors of the emergency department,” said Zach Benoit, communications director for the Billings Clinic. “We never know what’s going to come through there.”
That could mean patients who have delayed seeking medical help for fear of bills and waiting until a medical concern becomes an emergency.
“At the end of the day, we’re just trying to take care of people,” Benoit said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Big-Horn-Hospital-1024x480.jpg,,,2025-08-14 11:57:05.553765

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The last Republican to serve as a Minnesota attorney general was Douglas M. Head, whose single term began before Americans stepped on the moon.
This is a huge GOP fail, for a number of reasons.
The Office of Attorney General can be immensely influential, as evidenced by the tenure of Keith Ellison. The Minnesota Constitution is mostly silent on the role of the attorney general, but statute gives the AG broad authority to “investigate violations of the law of this state respecting unfair, discriminatory, and other unlawful practices in business, commerce, or trade.” In other words, a broad remit that allows for high-profile investigation, civil litigation and even prosecution. Consider Ellison’s climate fraud lawsuit against Exxon, Koch and the American Petroleum Institute.
Ellison has also prosecuted former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for murdering George Floyd and represented the state’s interests against the Trump administration in about 30 lawsuits so far.
The office can be a springboard for a candidacy for governor or U.S. Senate, with almost limitless potential for media coverage — AG sues car dealer for selling lemons, news at 11! — as well as fundraising.
Although Minnesota attorneys general have all failed in their attempts for higher office in recent decades — from Lori Swanson and Mike Hatch all the way back to Head — it’s such a common occurrence in other states that the joke is that AG stands for “aspiring governor.”
So, which Republicans are in for 2026?
Here’s some names being discussed in GOP circles:
— Joseph Thompson, the acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, who’s won significant acclaim and media coverage for his prosecution of widespread fraud in Minnesota’s public programs.
— Ron Schutz of Robins Kaplan, former chair and current board member of the Center of the American Experiment and chair of Tim Pawlenty’s presidential campaign.
— Ryan Wilson, the losing 2022 candidate for state auditor.
— Tad Jude, the former legislator, judge and Hennepin County Board member who lost to U.S. Rep. Kelly Morrison in 2024. (Jude trivia: He was 20 years old when elected to the state House in 1972.)
— Rep. Harry Niska, who ran briefly for the 2018 AG contest. Niska didn’t vote for Donald Trump in 2016 and got in the 2018 race in April of 2017. “I have been working to help other House candidates and have had a number of discussions about the AG race, but haven’t made any final 2026 decision yet,” Niska said this week.
The most intriguing candidate would be Thompson, whose story would be easy to tell: He prosecuted the fraudsters that Ellison let get away. (Obviously Ellison, who’s racked up his own Medicaid fraud prosecutions, would rebut.)
“First I’ve heard of it,” Thompson said about AG speculation. When asked if he’d be interested in running, he didn’t reply.
Thompson’s party identity isn’t even known at this point. While heading up the Feeding Our Future cases, he worked closely with then-U.S. Attorney Andy Luger — the Obama and Biden appointee — and the two had a close working relationship. Any bid for the Republican nomination would draw questions about whether he supported President Donald Trump’s three candidacies.
On the Democratic-Farmer-Labor side, Attorney General Keith Ellison has not announced any reelection plans, according to a spokesman. He’s ruled out a run for Hennepin County attorney.
Ellison would seem to be awaiting a decision from Gov. Tim Walz about whether the DFL governor will seek a third term.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MG_1897-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-14 11:57:05.553765

The Hope Center, which has been assisting homeless and addicted men and women in the Hagerstown community since 1955, continues to see a steady stream of people in need. Hagerstown, like many rural communities in America, has witnessed a surge in addiction caused by economic hardship and a rise in the use of opioids and fentanyl. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Overdose Prevention Strategy recently announced the availability of $10 million in substance grant funding for rural communities. The Hope Center serves over 3000 meals a month three hundred and sixty-five days a year. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.
Cuts during the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.

“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling during the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University-Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it (coverage) goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.
Under President Donald Trump’s signature legislation, states that expanded Medicaid through the 2010 Affordable Care Act will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled in the program. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history.
The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.



Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services. That makes the problem even worse.


– Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors


“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Dr. Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”

Family medicine physician Dr. Ian Bennett sees Medicaid patients at the Vallejo Family Health Services Center of Solano County in California’s Bay Area. The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”
The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest [psychiatric bed] for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

About 10% of Missouri is now classified as abnormally dry, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a map that tracks drought and updates weekly.
“We hadn’t had a week in July or August with a map that had no (drought) since 2019, so it was almost kind of rare to have that little drought concern across the whole state for what we see there,” State Climatologist Zack Leasor said. “But if you look at the past 30 days, there are some spots that are starting to dry out.”
Most of the dryness is appearing in the southern part of the state. While the map as only recorded dryness in the state for about a week, Leasor said he thinks some areas, particularly in the southeast Missouri Bootheel, have been drier for longer.
As state climatologist, Leasor is tasked with drafting recommendations for Missouri’s weekly drought assessment. When he was in the region last week, he saw drier conditions than what the Drought Monitor had been reflecting. That’s because drought assessment involves a variety of factors – including rainfall, streamflow and soil moisture – and there’s some data gaps in the Bootheel.
“(The Bootheel) is really characterized by high concentration of agriculture, but also it’s characterized by really cheap access to groundwater that recharges quite frequently,” Leasor said. “So as a result, you have a lot of irrigated agriculture.”
By irrigating their land with more water, farmers can cause the data obtained from soil gauges to be unreliable, Leasor said.
“In addition to that, the Bootheel doesn’t have a lot of natural hydrology,” he said. “When we talk about lakes or river systems there, a lot of it is kind of engineered, so not a lot of stream monitoring.”
Leasor is involved in a project to install more soil moisture gauges across the state through a collaboration between the University of Missouri and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.

Source: Florida Department of Corrections.The state will “soon” open another immigrant detention facility, this one at Baker Correctional Institution, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Thursday. 
The governor made the announcement during a news conference outside the facility, which is listed as temporarily closed on the Florida Department of Corrections website.
The facility will be the second in the state, after the Everglades facility that opened in July.
Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said the unit will accommodate 1,310 beds and hold up to 2,000 people in a temporary capacity.
“This is definitely the right decision to do. We are going to be able to fulfill, utilize these resources. The demand is there and our guys are ready, willing, and able to help our federal partners in this really, really important mission,” DeSantis said. 
The correctional institute is situated about 50 miles north of Gainesville and 50 miles west of Jacksonville. 
Guthrie said the facility will provide the same services offered at the Everglades detention facility, including three meals per day, pharmacy, access to recreation yards, legal and clergy services, laundry, and “everything that is required under federal or state law.”
The facility is 15 minutes away from the Lake City airport, which DeSantis said “is good, something that will make a difference.”
“This will be operational soon. It’s not going to take forever but we’re also not rushing to do it right this day. They’re doing what they need to do to get it done in all deliberate speed,” DeSantis said. 
DeSantis said the projects, this one and the Everglades detention facility combined, will come under budget of what the federal government will reimburse. 
The project will cost $6 million to build out, DeSantis said, and would have cost “a lot more” if done at Camp Blanding, the Florida National Guard base in Starke previously proposed as the next immigrant deportation facility in the state. 
The Baker site was “very appealing” because it requires “a lot less in standing up than we would at Blanding and far less than we had to do at Alligator Alcatraz,” he said
The DeSantis administration has dubbed it “Deportation Depot,” taking on another alliterative name like the Everglades detention facility dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”
The National Guard said it will activate 200 additional guardsmen this month at 10 Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities across Florida.
Guardsmen will “support emerging requirements here in Baker County and other locations across the state as directed by the governor,” Major General John D. Haas said.

The Connecticut town profiles, released annually for the last decade, show the demographics for each town and city in the state. The profiles are produced as part of a partnership between the CT Data Collaborative and AdvanceCT.
One of the statistics that stood out to Michelle Riordan-Nold, executive director of CT Data Collaborative, was the increase in families who work from home.
In the most recent profiles, 39% of Weston’s population works from home. In 2019, 15% percent of the town worked remotely.
Westport also saw a drastic increase in remote work, with 36% of residents working from home, compared to 15% in 2019. Stamford, New Haven, Fairfield, Greenwich, West Hartford and Norwalk also have high rates of remote workers, Riordan-Nold said.
Many Fairfield County residents who previously commuted into New York City made the shift to remote work.
“They’re in the financial industry, insurance industry, so it allows for once the pandemic hit, those industries realized you can work from home and still, you know, do the same work, get the job done,” Riordan-Nold said.
Increasing the number of remote workers also led to a boost in Weston and Westport’s local economies.
Between 2021 and 2024, 11 businesses opened in Weston. Between 2016 and 2019, only four businesses opened in the town, according to CT Data Collaborative.
Westport saw a similar increase, with 59 businesses opening between 2021 and 2024, compared to 30 from 2016-19.
Data for the profiles is taken from the five-year American Community Survey, conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.
“When you’re looking at town-level data, you want to look at the five-year because the survey is conducted annually of about 20,000 residents in Connecticut,” Riordan-Nold said. “When you break it down to 169 towns, you want to look at a larger data set.”
Other data is acquired from the state Departments of Education, Labor and the state Office of Policy and Management.
The report also includes numbers focusing on median home value, rent and income, with the goal of helping residents better understand their communities.
“It’s just an easy way for people to grab a few statistics or get a better, high-level understanding of towns,” Riordan-Nold said. “Who lives in the towns, what’s the economic makeup of the towns, the educational success. It’s really just like a brief primer on our 169 unique municipalities.”
The original purpose of the profiles was to help municipalities in efforts to attract businesses, according to AdvanceCT Vice President Rachel Gretencord. The profiles help companies understand the makeup of the town before deciding where to move.
“Housing is included, as it is frequently asked about by the companies we work to recruit,” Gretencord said. “Housing availability is critical to companies’ ability to attract and retain workforce, and they want to make sure that housing options for both executives and workers are available within a reasonable distance of the site they’re considering.”

During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Tracking Medicaid patients’ work status may prove difficult for states

Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
Statehouse Democrats want to use Trump’s big bill to drag down Republicans

That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.

Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.










We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


–  West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw


New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

Will Mississippi follow Trump's lead?","Change occurs so quickly in the 249th year of our nation’s existence sometimes we feel the need to call timeout, survey the rapidly shifting landscape and wonder: What next? What in Hades happens next?

Rick Cleveland
We have a former Fox Network weekend host in charge of our military. We have a former professional wrestling promoter heading up the Department of Education (which she wants to scrap entirely). We have an anti-vaccine advocate leading the Department of Health and Human Services. Hard to tell these days who are our allies and who are our enemies. Few of our traditional allies trust us anymore. Our president creates, then delays, then reduces and then increases tariffs so often we can’t keep up. 
Indeed, what the heck comes next? 
Well, stop the presses. Now we know what’s next: Cage fighting on the White House grounds, UFC style. Trump has indicated he wants it to happen. His close friend Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), says unequivocally this is going to happen. Paramount, which has been so much in the news lately, will televise it. Millions of dollars will be made. Eyes will be blackened! Brains will be concussed!! Blood will flow!!! Ratings will soar!!!! MAGA!!!!!
Ancient Rome had the Colosseum and gladiators fighting to the death for the entertainment of the emperor. Washington will have cage fighting, no holds barred, at the White House, heretofore a National Historic Landmark so designated for its significance to American history, architecture, arts and culture. At least there will be no lions in the White House cage. Or will there be? Perhaps alligators.
The target date is July 4, 2026. As Trump put it in a speech in Iowa: “We’re going to have a UFC fight, think of this, on the grounds of the White House. We have a lot of land there. … We’re going to have a UFC fight, championship fight, full fight.”
Yes, he really did say we have a lot of land there, leaving out the obvious. It doesn’t take much land for a caged-in, 746-square foot UFC octagon. Besides, there’s not enough room for a golf course, which Trump might prefer.
U.S. presidents have dabbled in sports before, though not quite the way Trump, who owns 17 golf courses worldwide, has immersed himself in golf. Trump in his second term reportedly has played golf on a quarter of the days he has been president, costing taxpayers roughly $70 million in travel and secret service expenses.
Previous presidents have not been quite so active, although Nixon installed a bowling alley in the White House basement. Eisenhower added a putting green on the White House lawn. Clinton added a jogging track to the White House grounds. Obama loved to play pick-up basketball. Most all recent presidents have been huge sports fans. But, at least to my knowledge, Trump is the first UFC aficionado in the White House.
Which brings to my mind this question: Which president would have been best at UFC? My money definitely would be on sturdy Teddy Roosevelt, who boxed at Harvard and sparred at both boxing and judo while president. He was a fitness freak. He also found time as president to save college football, although I’m not at all sure President Teddy would fancy what college football has become.
There are other president-athletes to consider. Abe Lincoln was a champion amateur wrestler and would have had a decided advantage in reach over most presidents. Gerald Ford was a Michigan football star who played on two national championship teams and was the Wolverines’ MVP as a senior. Ford was in the trenches, a center on offense and a linebacker on defense. This was back before facemasks. Clearly, he was a tough guy.
William Howard Taft, our 27th president, was a varsity heavyweight wrestler at Yale. In retrospect, it seems a shame sumo wrestling wasn’t popular in the early 20th century. Taft, 5 feet, 11 inches tall and weighing just over 350 pounds, would have been a natural.
On the local front, you don’t have to read Mississippi Today daily to know that Mississippi’s current political leaders often follow President Trump’s lead. Indeed, there seems a highly competitive contest to see which Mississippi politico can get the tightest grip on Trump’s coattails. They all want to follow Trump’s blueprint and make Mississippi great again.
With that in mind, can UFC fighting at the Governor’s Mansion, right there on Capitol Street, be far behind?
Think of the possibilities. For starters, how about Shad White vs. Andy Gipson? Who you got?",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/14084953/AP25103118339111.jpg,,,2025-08-14 11:57:05.553765

The program, administered by the state Office of Higher Education, provides qualified borrowers with up to $20,000 in relief over four years.
“It’s an investment in people who want to stay in Connecticut, who go to college here, who attend school here and who stay here and work here,” said Noele Kidney, director of communications at the Office of Higher Education.
Kidney said after its initial application period in January, the program approved submissions from more than 500 borrowers, totaling roughly $1.5 million in payments.
To qualify, borrowers must have attended a Connecticut college or university or earned a professional or occupational license from an accredited program; have resided in Connecticut for five consecutive years; have completed at least 50 volunteer hours; among other criteria.
[CT student loan reimbursement program: What to know]
Kidney says the state knows some borrowers are struggling with their student loan debt.
“The state government is trying to help them,” she said. “We recognize that student debt is an issue a lot of people are dealing with, and, you know what, if you invest in your community with volunteer service, this is a reward for getting involved in your community and for staying in Connecticut.”
The reopening comes after the Connecticut General Assembly expanded eligibility to more borrowers this last legislative session.
“We’re proud to reopen the doors to this impactful program,” Gov. Ned Lamont said in a statement. “This is not just a reimbursement plan — it’s a strategic investment in our workforce, in our communities, and in the future of Connecticut. The adjustments made this year reflect our ongoing commitment to supporting those who choose to build their lives and careers right here in our state.”
“This expansion ensures that we are reaching more of the hardworking Connecticut residents who need relief,” Office of Higher Education Commissioner Timothy Larson said in a statement. “The enhancements, combined with a streamlined application process, reflect our commitment to making education more affordable and accessible.”
The program will review applications on a first-come first-served basis through December, “until funds are exhausted.”
Kidney said the program had been appropriated roughly $8 million.

Ann will be most remembered for her tenacious love of life and her devotion to those around her—especially her beloved family.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ann Dinse.","Born April 21, 1924
Rochester, New York
Died Aug. 10, 2025
Shelburne, Vermont


Ann Goodenough Dinse, of Shelburne, Vermont, died peacefully in her sleep on August 10, 2025,  aged 101. She is survived by her son, Jeffrey Dinse of Warren, Maine, and her daughter, Dede Johnston of Aspen, Colorado and London, England,  as well as her three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
Ann was born in Rochester, New York, on April 21, 1924, the daughter of Swayne Peters Goodenough and Ruth Thompson Goodenough. She earned a degree in Biochemistry from the University of Rochester in 1945. During the war, she supported the effort by volunteering and working in factories, and was eventually employed by the Manhattan Project in New York City as a research associate.
Ann was extremely adventurous; at 16 she hitchhiked with a girlfriend across the United States, stopping at Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show to raise funds to continue her travels. 
In 1948, Ann departed on a transport ship, sailing from New York to Beirut to help establish the first Red Cross blood bank in the Middle East at the American University of Beirut. The two years she spent in Lebanon were among the most formative and rewarding of her long and productive life. There, Ann developed a deep passion for the Middle East—its people, their generosity and courageous spirit, the food, the mountains, and the Mediterranean Sea. She delighted in being able to hike into the snow-capped mountains, ski down, and bathe in the sea all in one day. Ann also became a dedicated advocate for the Palestinian people, lecturing in schools and working to support their cause. She remained a lifelong supporter of both the American University of Beirut and the American Farm School in Thessaloniki, Greece.
After returning from the Middle East, Ann married John Dinse, also of Rochester. John, who served in WWII on the European Front, completed his law degree at Cornell University. Together they traveled around the United States to decide where they wanted to settle. They chose Lake Champlain for its ideal setting for their shared love of sailing and skiing. Settling in Burlington, John joined a local law firm, where he remained for his 65-year-long distinguished career. The firm’s name eventually became simply “Dinse,” a tribute to John’s legacy.
Following several years working in the biochemistry research lab at the University of Vermont, Ann dedicated her time to her children and to charitable causes. She was a longtime member and former President of the Klifa Club and a volunteer at the American Red Cross. Ann was involved with Planned Parenthood of Vermont and actively served on the board of the Lake Champlain Committee. An early environmentalist, she played a role in the implementation of Vermont’s billboard ban in the 1970s, supported the bottle deposit law, and championed “Green Up Day.” She was also a devoted Friend of Shelburne Farms, volunteering with its outreach committee.
A strong advocate for higher education in Vermont, Ann served on the Board of Champlain College and volunteered at The Echo Center Burlington.  She was also a longtime Trustee of the Turrell Fund, a foundation that provides financial support to organizations serving disadvantaged children in Vermont and New Jersey.
Ann is also survived by her sister, Sally Merrill of Pittsford, New York. She was predeceased by her sister, Pat.
Ann will be most remembered for her tenacious love of life and her devotion to those around her—especially her beloved family.

After 28 years of at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Matt Walsh now heads the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice.
Walsh began his career at the Lee County Sheriff’s Office. He joined FDLE in 2003, where he held leadership positions in Fort Myers, Jacksonville, and Tallahassee investigating violent crime, homicide, public corruption, and organized crime. Walsh most recently served as  deputy executive director at that agency.

This is the second time DeSantis has tapped Walsh to lead. The governor appointed Walsh interim sheriff of Clay County in 2020 after suspending then-Sheriff Darryl Daniels following his arrest connection to a sex scandal in which he had ordered deputies to arrest his mistress.
“With nearly 30 years of law enforcement experience, Matt will serve Florida well as the Secretary of the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice,” DeSantis said in prepared remarks. “He will continue the great work of the department to ensure the safety of those in their custody and care and improve outcomes for Florida’s at-risk youth.”
Walsh comes into the department as it faces scrutiny over its Florida Scholar’s Academy. The Florida Phoenix reported that the online education program has exceeded its  budgeted costs and that incarcerated students have been watching movies and porn on state-issued laptops and posted to social media during school hours. Former DJJ Secretary Eric Hall told lawmakers the access to explicit materials was part of “growing pains.”

Meanwhile, Walsh received attention from the Florida State University College of Social Work in 2020 for focusing on the mental health aspect in law enforcement.  He drew praise for his “dedication to helping law enforcement to maintain sound mental health while reducing troubling trends of increased deaths by suicide, the lead cause of death for those in law enforcement.”
Walsh, who will need to be confirmed by the Florida Senate, thanked the governor for the appointment.
“I look forward to working with DJJ’s dedicated staff and partners to build stronger youth, stronger families, and safer communities in Florida.”

It’s nighttime, and the 88-year-old house with hardwood floors and lots of windows is now a venue for an alternative music show where local artists shred electric guitar against recordings of cicadas and static.

The July 25 show was one of many in Jackson’s DIY scene. Jackson DIY is decades-old and encompasses a wide range of alternative music genres, including punk, metal, noise and hardcore, as well as independent publications, like zines.
DIY stands for “do-it-yourself.” According to Lucy Isadora, one organizer of Jackson DIY shows, the style is characterized by a lack of industry influence on artists. Local people organize shows and post flyers to Instagram. Isadora often hosts traveling artists at her house. Bands split money made from shows, which generally have an entry fee of $10 to $15.
Isadora has booked bands like Alien Nosejob at the bar and restaurant CS’s and annually organizes the punk show Brisket’s Birthday Bash to honor her dog, Brisket. 
“Obviously, my dog does not go to his birthday party because it’s a punk show, and, like, that’s not really fun if you’re a dog,” Isadora said. “But, every year that we’ve done it, we’ve been able to raise a decent amount of money for animal shelters.”

Arin, who goes only by her first name, started attending Jackson DIY shows two years ago and now covers the scene in her publication JXN Underground. She also books performances and hosts local artists on her podcast. She said traveling bands love Jackson once they play a show.
“I guess it’s that old Southern charm, but they’re always so pleased to be here. And I think it works out well that way, because this scene is so small,” Arin said. “It’s very intimate. Everybody really does know everybody.”
Though local and tight-knit, Jackson’s DIY scene has attracted bands from as far away as Poland. Punk artists have been playing in Mississippi’s capital city for decades.

JD Burns has attended punk and hardcore shows in Jackson for over 20 years. Arin called him an “old head.” 
Burns said some of his first shows were at a “really seedy, kind of dangerous bar” called W.C. Don’s. He explained how, unlike today, Jackson punk bands in the early 2000s had a reputation for being rowdy and intoxicated.
“They were much more bratty, drunk, older people, not quite street punk, not mohawks and chains and leather jackets, but just gnarly, gnarly people,” Burns said.
Bands used to appear in weekly show bills released by the Jackson Free Press, now known as the Mississippi Free Press.
Churches also served as DIY venues in the Jackson area in the early 2000s, when there was a boom in Christian metal and hardcore. Since the bands were Christian, churches allowed them to play.

W.C. Don’s and many of the old bars are closed, and churches no longer have metal shows, Burns said. Now, bands advertise themselves on Instagram, and many of today’s venues, like Sunflower Oven and Urban Foxes, allow fans of all ages.
“Right now, Jackson has the best, most diverse scene that it’s had in a long time, maybe ever,” Burns said. “We can also acknowledge that it’s all based on experience.”
The flyer for the July 25 DIY show at Urban Foxes depicted a black cat in an ornate flowery frame with the headline: “A Night of Noise Benefitting Animal Rescue Fund of Mississippi.” The show was pay-what-you-can, and attendees were invited to donate shelter supplies such as cat food instead of money.

The acts belong to the experimental noise genre, where artists integrate noises that are sometimes thought of as nonmusical into their work.

Before the first set, INDOLE, whose stage name refers to an aroma chemical found in both feces and flowers, sat by the front steps.
Show attendees could also pull zines from Landmass Library, which is run by Isadora and distributes free DIY publications. 
One zine, written by a punk ER doctor, discusses what to expect when visiting the emergency room. Other zines focus on immigrants’ rights, queer issues and Black Lives Matter – topics Isadora said “are really important to me but are getting squashed by the current administration.”
Many of the night’s music artists belonged to multiple projects at once. Burns, who runs the noise project “that which waits beyond sleep,” is also in the band Hammer and the Tools, with Isadora.

“Please put in your article that I think everyone should start a band,” Isadora said. “And, even if your band sucks, I will come see your band at least once. But, if you suck, I might not come back again.”
Isadora bought a guitar so she could learn to play for Hammer and the Tools. She is left-handed, but, initially, had mistakenly bought a right-handed guitar. She gave that guitar to Arin, who is now learning to play. 
Arin explained that, for people interested, the best thing to do is just go to a show.
“I certainly didn’t know that I was going to be doing all this when I went to my first show,” Arin said. “I was just trying to get out of the house, so it can really open up some doors that you might not even consider.”

(Photo from the Library of Congress)A federal appeals court affirmed a lower court’s preliminary injunction Wednesday, allowing two Hoosier mothers to continue providing state-reimbursed caregiving services to their medically fragile children. 
Plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana and Indiana Disability Rights, argued that the children’s care was too intensive to transition from attendant care to another state program last August. With a statewide shortage of nurses, mothers also said they couldn’t use state services to hire an outside caretaker and had to take on the 24/7 responsibilities themselves.
Judge hears oral arguments in attendant care lawsuit

“We are grateful that the courts have once again recognized that these children deserve to live at home with their families, not be forced into institutions,” said Gavin Rose, the ACLU’s deputy legal director. “Our clients have dedicated themselves to becoming specially trained in the needs of their children, and no one is better qualified to provide the round-the-clock care they require.”  
Responding to a nearly $1 billion projected Medicaid shortfall, state leaders with the Family and Social Services Administration made several changes in 2024 and halted a program that paid parents to be caregivers to their children with medically complex conditions. The attendant care program for Legally Responsible Individuals paid parents an hourly, livable wage but roughly 1,600 families were transitioned to another service that paid a per diem stipend at a far lower rate. 
Two mothers sued and were eventually granted a preliminary injunction, which the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this week. Previously, a federal judge in Indianapolis ruled that FSSA must secure in-home skilled nursing services for both children on top of program offerings. The state documented dozens of calls to nursing agencies, nearly all of which couldn’t do the work for one reason or another.
In filings, attorneys argued that the only other viable option for the mothers would be institutionalization, which one mother had previously tried and dismissed. The state has two such facilities equipped to handle such care.
“The Court’s decision recognizes the very real threat that these families faced following the changes to the Medicaid waiver in 2024, and the likelihood that these parents would have faced the unthinkable decision of having their children placed in an institution,” said Sam Adams, a senior attorney with Indiana Disability Rights. “This decision reinforces the understanding that children with complex medical needs are best served when they can remain at home with their families. The Court found that there are steps that FSSA can and must take to help ensure these children remain safely in their families’ homes.”

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)In South Dakota, independence isn’t just a value — it’s a way of life. We take pride in working hard, running our businesses, farms, and supporting our communities. We also enjoy being as independent as possible when it comes to how we chose to live.
Today, that way of life is being challenged by rising energy costs and increased pressure on our electric grid. One solution is the Solar for All program — a $7 billion grant program through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, with $62.5 million earmarked for South Dakota via the Coalition for Green Capital, who applied to administer the program in the state. These grants were awarded last year and were designed to bring renewable and affordable energy to low- and moderate-income households here. However, the EPA confirmed last week that it has formally ended the Solar for All grant program. 
Rescinding already obligated federal funds may violate existing contracts and statutory provisions, so it’s possible that legal challenges may occur. If the decision is not reversed, it will be a big loss to growing our independence and the many new opportunities it would provide to communities all across the state.
Trump EPA claws back $7B in solar funding already promised to states

South Dakota faces some of the highest per capita energy use in the country. Our cold winters and increasingly hot summers mean most homes rely heavily on electricity for heat, cooling, and daily essentials. That high demand drives up costs and puts pressure on a grid that wasn’t built for today’s energy needs. When the grid fails, a rural state like South Dakota is hit especially hard — losing heat, refrigeration, and even the ability to water livestock.
That’s why local, reliable energy matters — and solar power is a smart solution. In 2023, Dakota Rural Action conducted a study to look at how solar power could benefit South Dakotans. The results were clear: distributed solar (which simply means solar panels on people’s homes or businesses) reduces utility costs for all customers, even those who don’t have solar panels, by easing strain on the grid and cutting down on expensive peak energy demand.  
South Dakota is endowed with an abundant amount of solar radiation. Did you know that we used to be known as the “Sunshine State”? Yet less than 2% of electricity generated in South Dakota comes from solar. So we have an enormous untapped resource here that can be used to generate electrical power.
Another significant opportunity of solar is its economic impact. Developing more solar power means more local jobs right here in South Dakota. From installing panels to managing systems, repairing equipment, and overseeing projects, the solar industry creates good-paying, long-term careers right here at home. Solar for All funding would help expand job training programs, giving more South Dakotans the skills they need to enter this growing field and support their families without having to move away.
Beyond jobs, solar energy keeps more money circulating in local economies. We can generate more of our own electricity and keep those dollars in our local towns and counties. Solar systems can even be installed on farms and ranches, cutting costs and boosting producers’ bottom lines.
And importantly, solar is a clean, domestic resource. South Dakota is already a leader in providing clean renewable energy to our state’s energy mix through wind and hydropower. Solar power complements that strength, helping us stay on the leading edge of energy development while protecting the air, water and land our livelihoods depend on.
As South Dakotans, we know how to take care of our own and make the most of what we have. Investing in solar energy is one more way we can build a stronger, more independent future that supports our families, grows local jobs and keeps our communities thriving.

(Piper Hutchinson/Louisiana Illuminator)ST. BERNARD PARISH — Before being elevated by Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, the slave-owning new namesake of the state’s largest National Guard training facility was at best a footnote in history, according to a review of what few documents are available to trace his background.
Camp Beauregard, founded in 1917 in Pineville, was originally named after Confederate Gen. Pierre Gustav Toutant Beauregard, a St. Bernard Parish native who initiated the attack on Fort Sumter, South Carolina, to begin the Civil War.
Gov. Landry restores Beauregard name to Louisiana National Guard facility

In 2023, Beauregard’s name was removed from the facility amid a nationwide effort to remove monuments and honorifics to Confederate veterans and leaders.
Landry announced in July the facility would be renamed after the Confederate general’s father, Jacques Toutant-Beauregard.
The governor’s decision to restore the Beauregard name is in keeping with the style of President Donald Trump’s administration, which has restored the former Confederate names of military installations by selecting unrelated military heroes.
But Landry’s choice of honoree is different.
For starters, Camp Beauregard’s new namesake is shown in nearly every historical document and on his grave as Jacques Toutant.
According to a biography of his son, “P.G.T. Beauregard, Napoleon in Gray,” by historian T. Harry Williams, the future Confederate general began going by a single last name, Beauregard, when he enrolled at West Point in an attempt to Americanize himself.
Jacques Toutant is also different from Trump’s other restored honorees as he is related to the original namesake. He also does not have any distinctive military accomplishments and was a slave owner, which to many make him a worse choice than his son, who adopted more racially moderate stances after the war.
“It signals to the Black citizens in [Louisiana] that [Landry] thinks you’re second-class and he doesn’t care if you’re offended,” University of North Carolina Charlotte historian Karen Cox, a scholar on the legacy of Confederate monuments, said of Landry’s decision.
Landry spokeswoman Kate Kelly did not respond to a request for comment as to why the National Guard facility was being renamed, who was involved in the decision, or why Landry opted to name it after a slave owner.

Little is known about Jacques Toutant other than that he owned a sugarcane plantation in St. Bernard Parish that was later named Contreras. Enslaved people were forced to work on his fields and in his home.
Toutant also served as a captain in the Louisiana Militia, though historical records don’t tie him to any particular battle.
Six historians at four universities contacted for this report declined to comment on his history, citing how little they as individuals – and historians as a group – know about the elder Beauregard.
“Very little has been written on Contreras Plantation or on Jacques Beauregard, apart from brief mentions in biographies of P.G.T Beauregard,” LSU historian John Bardes said.
The most detailed records of Toutant’s life come in the Slave Schedules of the 1850 census, which list the age, residence and owner of each enslaved person in the United States.
Toutant is listed as the owner of 86 enslaved people, ranging from a 60-year-old Black woman to a 2-year-old mixed-race child. The names of the enslaved people Toutant owned were never recorded.

According to P.G.T. Beauregard’s biographer, T. Harry Williams, Toutant forced an enslaved woman to nurse his children, a practice that often forcefully separated Black women from their own infants.
Even on his home turf in St. Bernard Parish, the name Jacques Toutant is all but forgotten.
The site of the Contreras Plantation, where a large home burned down in the mid-20th century, is marked with a decrepit memorial to P.G.T. Beauregard. Enclosed on three sides by barbed-wire-topped fences, the grassy patches that surround the memorial were littered with empty beer cans and rotted picnic tables when visited by a reporter in late July.
The white brick pyramid memorial at the Contreras site was financed by Judge Leander Perez, according to local historian and author Sean Michael Chick.
Perez is remembered as a dogged segregationist who was excommunicated from the Catholic Church for his efforts to obstruct the integration of schools in New Orleans. He also attempted to stop civil rights workers from entering Plaquemines Parish to help Black residents register to vote.
Once pristine, the pyramid was covered in grayish muck during a reporter’s recent visit. It only mentions Toutant as among the general’s ancestors.
Less than 2 miles down the road, Toutant is buried in the St. Bernard Parish Catholic Cemetery. The engraved door to his tomb is broken in over a dozen places, his name hardly legible through the cracks and the wear of time.

The grave also bears a medallion commemorating Toutant as a veteran of the War of 1812.
It is on this veteran status that Landry chose to honor Toutant.
“By restoring the name Camp Beauregard, we honor a legacy of courage and service that dates back over two centuries,” Landry said in his announcement about the renaming.
Through a public records request, the Illuminator obtained the historical documents the Louisiana National Guard said it used to justify renaming its Pineville training base after Toutant. They included militia payroll records that span from Dec. 16, 1814, to March 20, 1815.
They indicate Toutant served under Col. Pierre Denys de la Ronde, who led the Louisiana Militia at the Battle of New Orleans and later earned the rank of major general.
The records do not definitively place Toutant at the site of any particular battle or indicate he earned any military honors.
A Louisiana National Guard press release announcing the renaming notes his regiment took part in a prelude to the Battle of New Orleans, although historians have noted only minor skirmishes along Lake Borgne before the war’s final conflict in Chalmette.
Despite having no details on Toutant’s militia service, Maj. Gen. Thomas Friloux, adjutant general of the Louisiana National Guard, praised him as an American hero.
“We’re naming our premier training installation after an American hero and patriot who fought for the freedom of the city of New Orleans, the State of Louisiana, and the United States of America against a foreign invader,” Friloux said.
When asked about this discrepancy, Louisiana National Guard spokeswoman Lt. Col. Noel Collins referred questions to the Society of the War of 1812’s Louisiana chapter, which she said was consulted for information about Toutant.
Chapter president Brig. Gen. Rodney Painting, who is listed online as an assistant adjutant general in the Louisiana National Guard, did not respond to a request for comment.

(Courtesy of New Mexico Envrionment Department)Blood tests from all but two of more than 600 residents around Cannon Air Force Base found so-called “forever chemicals” associated with firefighting foams, which have contaminated surrounding groundwater, according to a report released Thursday by the New Mexico Environment Department.
While the presence of the chemicals in 99% of the 628 samples is on par with national studies  showing the level the group of chemicals known as PFAS appears in most people’s blood, New Mexico environment officials said the key finding of the study was types of chemicals present.
“That shows a correlation between what’s in their blood and what came from military operations at Cannon Air Force Base,” Environment Secretary James Kenney said in an interview with Source NM ahead of the report’s release Wednesday.
Cannon Air Force Base officials when reached by phone Wednesday said they could not immediately provide a response because the report was not yet public. Source NM will update the story with any further comment.
Of the 33 compounds tested for in the blood of residents outside of nearby Clovis, the four most prevalent substances are ingredients found in currently or historically in aqueous film-forming foams, or the type of suppressant used to put out fires from flammable liquids like gasoline.
The report also found that 14 people tested had very high PFAS levels, similar to levels found in other states where the chemicals were manufactured or spilled. For comparison, only an estimated 9% of adults nationwide have those levels present.
“I think it’s profoundly disappointing that we have 14 New Mexicans who are in that highest national tier from the Cannon Air Force Base’s foams migrating offsite,” Kenney said. “We don’t make the chemicals in New Mexico, they’re only used here in that concentration and that significance in military operations, and they think this is that direct link that has been missing, but now proven.”
New Mexicans working or living closer to the PFAS-contaminated groundwater plume under Cannon had PFAS levels that were three times higher than residents not working or living near the plume, according to the report.

The blood test results are from a 2024 state program to collect samples in 2024 from residents in surrounding Curry County immediately surrounding the base, in partnership between environment officials and New Mexico Department of Health. Participants were alerted to their results in the spring.
There’s been a rising awareness to address contamination from PFAS, an abbreviation for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, a class of synthetic chemicals  used in the manufacture of everything from rugs to cookware to firefighting foams. The foams, first used in the 1970s are effective for fighting high-heat fires from jet fuel ignition, hence the prevalence of their uses on Air Force Bases.
PFAS were first detected in soil and groundwater in 2018 near Cannon Air Force Base, with state officials alleging that the military’s use of firefighting foams over decades seeped into the soils and water. A dairy with contaminated wells was required to euthanize more than 3,000 cows and brought the miles-long plume to light.
These chemicals resist breaking down in nature and can accumulate in water, soils and increasingly in the blood and bodies of humans and animals around the world. While their harms are still being studied, researchers have linked PFAS exposure to a wide range of health issues such as: decreased fertility, fetal developmental delays, increases in certain cancer risks, disruption of immune responses and more, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Efforts to address PFAS pollution nationally are estimated to cost billions of dollars as cleanup efforts stretch for years. New Mexico’s PFAS contamination is concentrated around military bases including Cannon Air Force Base, Holloman Air Force Base, Kirtland Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range and Fort Wingate.The state has spent more than $10 million between investigations, damages, legal costs and cleanup, according to court filings.
While the military has previously promised to end PFAS use, top officials are saying they cannot meet the deadline to find an alternative in 2026, according to U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hesgeth’s statements to the Government Accountability Office in July.
“If this can happen in Curry County, it can happen in Anywhere, USA,” Kenney said. “They’ve authorized the use of these firefighting foams for another year, and the Department of Defense is going to be releasing these into communities all over the country.”
New Mexico is embroiled in several lawsuits over PFAS contamination. New Mexico is part of multi-state litigation in South Carolina, which includes a combined 10,000-plus cases against military and civilian PFAS contamination.
New Mexico federal pollution case will pave the way for other states, officials say

The state is also involved in separate litigation in the federal court system, after the U.S. Department of Defense sued the state, claiming it overstepped its authority in mandating cleanup.
In a new case filed this year, state officials alleged Cannon Air Force failed to address contamination, including barring state inspectors entry to the base to test for PFAS. The Department of Defense requested the case move to federal court, which was granted in August.
Sen. Pat Woods, a Republican from Clovis, told Source NM the state appropriated $12 million to pay to connect residents to city water, replacing contaminated, private wells.

“In the short run, we’re going to do some of these shorter pipelines to help Clovis citizens that have contaminated water and high levels in their bloodstream,” Woods said. “We didn’t cause the problem, but we’re proposing a solution to the problem.”
The New Mexico Environment Department will hold a public meeting on Thursday Oct. 23 in Curry County to present the report’s findings.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — The founder of a large investment firm pledged $300 million to the University of Kansas in what was described as the largest gift in the university’s history and touted as one of the biggest single donations in the history of college athletics.
David Booth, the Austin, Texas, founder of Dimensional Fund Advisors, was responsible for a $50 million donation in 2017 to kick off renovation at what became David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium. In 2010, he presented KU with basketball inventor James Naismith’s original 1891 copy of the 13 basic rules of the game. The document is in Booth Family Hall of Athletics next to Allen Fieldhouse.
“One of life’s greatest privileges is being able to give back to the people and places that gave so much to you,” Booth said in a statement. “KU and Lawrence are a big part of my story, and it means a lot to support the community that invested in me.”
In terms of the $300 million contribution to KU, Booth established a $75 million challenge grant to help raise money for the next phase of construction at Memorial Stadium and the Gateway District development adjacent to the football complex. The overall commitment from Booth also provided an ongoing source of income for KU athletics.
“David’s unprecedented generosity is transformative now and for our future,” said Travis Goff, athletics director at KU. “There is no more generous and impactful Jayhawk.”  
The Gateway District’s second phase would add a hotel, retail and restaurant space as well as student housing, parking and an outdoor plaza.
“David has always believed in the power of athletics to unite communities, generate Jayhawk spirit and create lasting bonds between alumni, students and fans,” said KU chancellor Doug Girod.
Booth, 78, earned  a KU economics degree in 1968 and a KU master’s degree in business in 1969. Two years later, he completed a master’s degree in business administration at University of Chicago. In 2008, he pledged $300 million to the business school at University of Chicago. 
“Philanthropy, like investing, pays dividends over time,” Booth said. “Each gift compounds, creating opportunities not just for today, but for years to come.”
Booth grew up in Lawrence where his family lived on Naismith Drive near Allen Fieldhouse. At the age of 13, Booth attended his first football game by working as an usher. He later sold popcorn in the bleachers at Allen Fieldhouse.
He founded Dimensional Fund Advisors in 1981 to apply principles of financial science to asset management. In June, the firm had more than $850 billion in assets.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Booth-Hall-and-Allen-statue-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-14 09:57:33.300299

Line extension allowances – which allow gas companies to charge the cost of hooking up new customers to existing ones – may be on their way out in Massachusetts.
The post Massachusetts signals new gas customers may soon have to pay full hookup costs appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE DEPARTMENT OF Public Utilities has indicated that gas utilities may no longer be able to charge existing gas customers for the cost of adding new ones – one step among many that the agency is taking to wean the state off of natural gas to meet climate goals.
The agency is currently reviewing the climate compliance plans submitted by gas companies in April, to ensure their operations and future projects align with the state’s legally mandated climate goals. As part of this process, the DPU issued an order last week that new gas customers will be responsible for the entire upfront cost of connecting to the existing system unless the new customer has no alternative to natural gas. 
The order addresses the “line extension allowance”– a much-debated policy that lets gas companies subsidize new customer connections by spreading infrastructure costs to existing ratepayers. Utilities companies say this policy ensures equitable access, treats customers fairly, and lowers rates by sharing costs more widely. Environmentalists counter that it incentivizes natural gas infrastructure expansion, raises costs for current customers, and undermines climate goals.
“The DPU’s order establishes an intention to move away from line extension allowances for new gas hookups … to promote more affordable options for ratepayers,” a DPU spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Line extension policies, along with other elements of the plans submitted by the gas companies, will be reviewed by the DPU over the next several months.”
The new policy, if enacted, would start after the DPU issues final decisions on the gas companies’ climate compliance plans, the timeline of which is not clear as the agency doesn’t have a statutory deadline. DPU proposed an earlier version of this change in February that included more circumstances in which a utility could claim an “exception” to continue offering line extension allowances. The updated proposal narrows those circumstances, permitting allowances only when no “technically feasible” alternative exists.
Across the US, states are reassessing gas utility line extension policies amid climate and energy affordability concerns. California and Colorado have started to eliminate the practice. New York passed a bill this summer aiming to phase out line extension allowances. Overall, 12 states plus Washington, D.C. have either removed these policies or are actively reviewing them for reform, according to the Building Decarbonization Coalition, a national group that works on promoting fossil-fuel free buildings.
The DPU made this decision after stakeholders like the Department of Energy Resources, the attorney general, the Sierra Club Environmental Law Program, and Conservation Law Foundation shared public comment letters and testimony to the agency that eliminating line extension allowances would change the equation for developers when considering whether to add gas or electrification and decarbonized energy in new buildings. 
DPU also considered a 2022 study by Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), a nonprofit advancing clean energy solutions, which concluded that electrification of new buildings is the cheaper option for customers and developers. According to RMI, the line extension allowances distort the true costs of the system by making it easier for developers to hook up to the gas system.
Eversource and National Grid, the two biggest gas utility companies in the state, said that they are both “reviewing” the new DPU order on line extension allowances. 
“There is no legal authority for the DPU to prevent customers from taking gas service, where it is economic for the gas utilities to serve those customers, and as a result, we need to closely evaluate the issues that this could raise,” said William Hinkle, a spokesperson for Eversource, in an emailed statement. “Access to safe, reliable energy service is imperative to the health, well-being, and economic success of people and businesses alike, and customer choice is paramount to realizing an affordable energy transition.”
In the past, the two companies have argued that line extension allowances do not burden existing rate payers because there is an assumption that the new customer will eventually pay off the allowance and that having more customers in the system will lower the average service cost for all customers. Gas utilities only serve a new customer if the cost of adding that customer will be less than or equal to the revenue that the new customer will produce for the system. If a new gas hookup doesn’t pass this “economic test,” new customers must pay the difference between the cost and the revenue in order to join the gas system.
In a public comment letter submitted to DPU in April, the company urged DPU to not remove the line extension allowance policy. 
“The singular result from the Department’s decision to eliminate the economic test and to require a new customer to pay for any and all infrastructure upgrades needed on the system on an upfront basis, without any consideration that the customer’s future revenues will pay for that infrastructure in any event, will be to defeat any use of natural gas and to push customers and developers to fuel sources with more harmful environmental impact,” wrote Danielle Winter, representing Eversource in the comment document. 
Mark Dyen, a former program manager for the Massachusetts’s energy efficiency program and a volunteer with Gas Transition Allies, a coalition of climate groups, said that the current line extension allowance policy makes sense if the state is planning on staying on the gas system in the coming 50 to 90 years. 
“Why should we, the existing rate payers, invest in expanding a capital structure to this new customer who doesn’t have to burden the system?” said Dyan. “If the gas system is going to be there forever serving everybody, then it makes sense to spread these costs out. If people are going to be moving off the gas system as a state policy, then what you’re doing is burdening the existing rate payers with an expense that really doesn’t benefit them.”
According to a report by environmental consulting firm Groundwork Data, more than $160 million was spent in 2023 to connect new residential and commercial customers across the state to the gas system. In 2021, that number was over $120 million. Much of the upfront cost was borne by existing ratepayers because about 80 percent of all connections reported by National Grid, Eversource, and Berkshire Gas since 2018 have been free to new customers.
The NAIOP Commercial Real Estate Development Association of Massachusetts and the Greater Boston Real Estate Board submitted comments to DPU in opposition of the change in March. They argued that this change will increase already ballooning costs for building housing that is desperately needed in the state – especially lower- and moderate-income housing.
“Requiring project proponents to shoulder the entire upfront cost of new gas connections will simply halt new housing and economic development projects,” wrote Tamara Small, the head of NAIOP. “The uncertainty surrounding federal tariffs; existing state and local regulatory costs; and the cost of capital have already put projects across the Commonwealth at risk due to financing considerations. To then require a project proponent to incorporate potentially millions of dollars more in connection costs will mean that housing and commercial projects cannot be financed.”
Caitlin Peale Sloan, vice president for Massachusetts at the Conservation Law Foundation, an environmental advocacy organization, said that given the state’s climate goals, expansions to the gas system risk becoming obsolete in the future. As more and more transition away from gas, the ratepayers who are left on the system will end up paying for the entire cost.  This can potentially lead to a scenario where lower-income residents or renters – who are less able to transition to clean energy – are stuck on an increasingly more expensive gas system. 
“The companies are constantly adding new customers, and some of them have said that their business model is based on expansion,” said Peale Sloan. “That’s really the question being posed in the climate compliance plan process: Are utilities really planning for a future where they’re not growing anymore? What does that cost customers? How do we transition this fairly for their workforce and for their customers?”
DPU has also taken aim at a program that allows gas utilities to recover costs from ratepayers to replace leak-prone pipes. Gas utilities have spent about $5.6 billion dollars through the program – called the Gas System Enhancement Plan (GSEP) – in the last decade, according to the DPU. In April, state officials reduced the cap on GSEP spending from 3 percent of the companies’ revenues to 2.5 percent. They also ordered gas companies to prioritize fixing current pipelines instead of replacing them, and to investigate the feasibility of non-pipeline alternatives like network geothermal, solar, or air-source heat pumps when deciding whether to replace a pipe.
“The orders are an indication that we are moving,” said Dyen. “We in the Commonwealth are moving systematically towards compliance with the broad policy goals and the specifics of the [climate] legislation. There’s no backing off that you can see in this.”

Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin led a team that analyzed 15 months of prescription data from Aid Access, one of the largest online abortion telemedicine providers.
They found 84% of Aid Access’s more than 118,000 online prescriptions went to patients living in abortion-ban states.
The South and Midwest had the highest rates of patients accessing telemedicine abortion. Rates were also greater in high-poverty areas or where people would have to travel more than 100 miles to reach an abortion clinic, according to the report, which published this month.
Aid Access is able to mail abortion medications to residents in all 50 states — even those in states with abortion bans — thanks to shield laws in Democratic-led states. Shield laws are designed to minimize the legal risks for people who provide or access abortions across state lines.
Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have reproductive care shield laws, either through legislation or by executive order, according to a report from University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
Eight of those states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — specifically protect telehealth abortion providers regardless of where their patient is located.
Shield laws, along with difficulty accessing in-person abortion services in abortion-ban states, have contributed to a rise in medication and telehealth abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, clearing the way for state bans. With telehealth abortion, patients have a virtual appointment with a clinician who can prescribe abortion medication, which is then filled by a licensed pharmacy and mailed to the patient.
Research has shown telehealth medication abortion is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
But as abortion medication use rises, so have conservative efforts to ban it.
This year, more than a dozen states introduced bills to bar access to medication abortion by criminalizing its sale, purchase or distribution, according to Guttmacher.
One such bill in Texas, which could have been a blueprint for medication abortion restriction in other states, was specifically aimed at groups like Aid Access. It would have allowed private citizens to sue for at least $100,000 anyone who provided abortion pills in Texas. The bill passed the Texas Senate but died in the House in May.
Earlier this year, the state of Louisiana criminally charged a New York physician under its abortion ban law for allegedly providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teen via telehealth. New York, which passed a shield law in 2023, refused Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor.
Last month marked the first federal test of shield laws, when a Texas man sued a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to his partner.
This week, a Texas woman filed a federal lawsuit against Aid Access and against a man who she said impregnated her, then spiked her drink with abortion pills. She is also suing the Dutch doctor who founded Aid Access, alleging Aid Access and its founder mailed abortion-inducing drugs in violation of Texas and federal law.

He went on to pursue a career with a focus on the North — from Alaska to Washington, D.C. — working in various academic, policy research and international diplomacy roles. Sfraga chaired the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, and founded the Polar Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. Most recently, he served briefly as the first U.S. ambassador-at-large to the Arctic, appointed by former President Joe Biden. 
“All of my previous positions have, in one way or another, included areas that UAF has expertise in, and so I’ve been able to tap into that expertise, especially during my time in D.C. and elsewhere,” he said. 
Sfraga said continuing to grow student enrollment is a top priority. “The university has done a very good job over the past three to four years, increasing enrollment somewhere between 3% and 4% year over year,” he said. “That’s a strong trend line for the university. It shows us that we’re fulfilling our mission to our state across all programs. So that will be a priority to continue to help build upon our enrollment gains.” 
Secondly, Sfraga said “it should be no secret” he’s focused on the Arctic, and UAF’s place for climate science, policy and research, and political and international relations. He said UAF has a role to play in our understanding of the Arctic. 
“The Arctic has become an area of not just regional interest, but global interest, and this institution is poised very well to respond to a very, very strong demand signal for understanding the environment better, the domain better,” he said. 
“That would be from our national security and homeland security perspective, but also changing oceans patterns and ocean acidification and fisheries — something so close and near and dear to all Alaskans, especially those who live a subsistence lifestyle,” Sfraga said, “all those things that we need to have a better understanding of as Alaskans, a better understanding of as a nation, and a better understanding in the global community. 
“I will focus my time on places that I think I can help elevate those programs, enhance those programs, and further build upon those programs, because they are already world class.” 
Sfraga answered questions about changing national political dynamics, and the Trump administration’s array of executive orders related to higher education, including immigration enforcement; banning “DEI,”, or diversity, equity and inclusion efforts; cutting research grants; and cracking down on student protest. 
“We are in a very fluid environment. We need to be abreast of it. The team here is following these issues closely. We will deal with issues that come about as they come about,” he said. “I think it’s vital for us to reinforce the fact that we believe in academic freedom, serving all of our students, recognizing we have students from different backgrounds, from all over the state, all over the country, all over the world.”
In May, the University of Alaska system had seen more than $50 million in federal funding frozen, Pat Pitney, the university’s president, reported to the UA Board of Regents. This is part of a broader national freeze on certain categories of federal spending, including some money for research.
That included a $46 million grant for the Arctic Domain Awareness Center-ARCTIC Center for Excellence, focused on homeland security in the Arctic. 
“We’re all waiting for further clarity on this. We know that, you know, members of Congress are working on various levels of funding scenarios for the different federal agencies. I’m hopeful that a majority of that funding will be put back into the budget,” he said. 
He noted that the interview was being conducted during his first few days on the job.
“So we are working through the beginnings of scenarios, trying to understand what the implications could be …. We’ve watched this go on for the last several months, but I will be spending a great deal of time working with my colleagues here, along with President Pitney and the board of regents and the Alaska delegation (to Congress), to realize what the implications of these cuts could be to us, trying to mitigate those by communicating the value of research to our state and to our nation,” he said. 
When asked about the University of Alaska regents’ action earlier this year to scrub reference to “DEI” or “affirmative action,” and its impact on student services, Sfraga said he was just days into the job but would be looking into it. 
“The board of regents are in charge of our institution. They have oversight on that policy. So we’ll follow the board of regents policy, obviously, to answer your question about the ripple effects …. What I cannot give you yet is my read on all of the implications and everything we have done, because I’ve only been in the office a few days, and so that is on my list of issues that I will dig down on,” he said. 
Some students, including some Alaska Native students, have criticized the move to change programs and support services, like the University of Alaska Anchorage reorganizing the Native Student Services program into the Indigenous and Rural Student Center. University officials have emphasized that these changes were separate from the regents’ anti-DEI language policy.
“My understanding is that we serve all students,” Sfraga said. “It’s also a commitment that we serve all students. I cannot speak to service levels, what they were and what they are now, I’ve not had any discussions that have referenced the decrease in service, just a reaffirmation that we serve all of our students.”
On the university’s role in Arctic affairs, Sfraga spoke about bringing his experience as a former ambassador to the Arctic to the region, and changing international geo-political dynamics.
“So part of my role would be to leverage my former position. We are ambassadors for life, even though we’re not currently in a particular organization, or a particular mission. And so I will look for areas where I can help our Arctic research directors, our research directors, our faculty, link to other universities and other entities throughout the circumpolar north,” he said. 
“Our researchers already have longstanding, decades-long relationships. I’ll look for very strategic areas that I think I can help move their efforts forward. … So I’ll look to leverage a Washington, D.C., network in education and research — the same abroad, where we have some very strong partners and very strong opportunities.”
Sfraga said Alaskans should know there are many opportunities related to the Arctic. 
“We’ve got a lot of challenges, but being at the nexus of domestic and foreign policy, whether it’s our homeland security, national security, energy security, we have some opportunity here in this new Arctic that we should work together and realize,” he said. He added that the Arctic matters in U.S. domestic policy, “and, I would argue, a big part of the United States foreign policy, because of our geographic advantage.” 
“So as we think about this new Arctic, we need to seize this moment across our state and position ourselves very well for opportunities that will come our way, but they will be based on our ability to to actually move on those opportunities, and that’s going to take investment and smart planning.”

Though a bill that would make it easier for some Californians to kill swans has been flying through the Legislature, it may soon face backlash if animal welfare activists were to intensify their opposition to the proposal, writes CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow.
Native to Europe and Asia, mute swans are considered an invasive species in many regions across North America. They displace native birds, destroy plant species that other native animals rely on and are aggressive. In 2022 there were about 1,150 mute swans in California, according to state waterfowl biologists. This spring, scientists estimate there are more than 12,000.
To bring down their population, a measure currently before the state Senate would allow hunters and landowners to shoot swans through 2030. The bill uses a similar approach to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife’s $13 million campaign to control nutrias, a large invasive rodent from South America.

Mark Hennelly, a lobbyist for the California Waterfowl Association, during an Assembly committee hearing in March: “If the population gets too large and out of control, it may be beyond our ability then to really effectively manage them. So we want to get ahead of the problem.”

The bill has no formal opposition yet, but other states on the East Coast that have tried to enact the same eradication methods against mute swans were met with strong resistance from anti-hunting activists. 
Nicole Rivard, a spokesperson for Friends of Animals, said claims of the species’ environmental damage are exaggerated. Mute swans were also imported to the U.S. by humans through no fault of their own, and shouldn’t be killed for it. The bill, Rivard argues, serves as another avenue for hunters to have yet another bird to legally shoot.

UCLA gets some science funding back

In a blow to President Donald Trump’s administration, a California district court judge has ordered the administration on Tuesday to restore 300 federal science research grants it suspended at UCLA in July, writes CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.
The Trump administration suspended those grants by the National Science Foundation over claims that the university isn’t doing enough to curb antisemitism. The judge’s latest ruling says the administration violated a preliminary injunction issued by the same judge in June. That order directed the foundation to reinstate grants it had tried to terminate in the spring, and prohibited the foundation from terminating additional grants.
The latest order does not restore 500 other grants by the National Institutes of Health that the administration also froze in July. They weren’t covered by the June injunction. In total, the administration has frozen $584 million of UCLA’s grants in a bid to force the university into a $1 billion settlement.

The effect of LA immigration raids

As part of Trump’s plan to carry out the largest deportation campaign in U.S. history, immigration enforcement agents have detained about 3,000 people in California as of July. 
At the center of the immigration crackdown in the state is Los Angeles, where CalMatters’ Nigel Duara explores what has become of the city, which is now entering its third month since raids ramped up in the summer. 
What stood out most to Nigel was the city’s silence and empty spaces: Instead of raucous neighborhoods brimming with vitality, there are now shuttered restaurants, empty park benches and abandoned food stands. 
The emptiness is particularly acute for Yurien Contreras, a 20-year-old Nigel spoke with whose father was detained at a June raid in the Fashion District. Since his detention, the family has been sheltering in place in a two-bedroom apartment out of fear.

Contreras: “There’s like, no like happy things. And when there’s happy things like a birthday that just passed, we get even more sad because my dad’s not here.”

The shortfall is being created by the One Big Beautiful Bill and should be addressed by state lawmakers if a special session is held later this year, Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro said during an Interim Finance Committee meeting Wednesday.
Every month SNAP provides food assistance to around 505,000 Nevadans — 15.5% of the total population.
Nevada’s Division of Social Services (formerly known as Division of Welfare and Social Services) appeared before the legislative committee on Wednesday to request approximately $244,000 to address a current budget shortfall created by a new federal requirement that states pay the federal government to use an income verification system. Previously, the state did not have to pay for access to that system.
That immediate budget shortfall is minor in the scope of the overall state budget and was quickly covered Wednesday with reserve funding. But Cannizzaro emphasized the potential financial issues for Nevada SNAP are just beginning.
Starting Oct. 1 of next year, states will be required to pay 75% of the administrative costs for SNAP, up from the 50% they have been historically required to pay.
That means Nevada will need to come up with an additional $19 million to cover the cost of administering the program between Oct. 1, 2026 and June 30, 2027, Division of Social Services Administrator Robert Thompson told legislators.
Looking beyond the current fiscal biennium, the state can expect $25 million in additional administrative costs annually. At the same time, an estimated 130,000 Nevadans are at risk of losing benefits due to new requirements established in the One Big Beautiful Bill.
And Nevada could be on the hook for millions more in future years depending on its SNAP payment error rate.
The One Big Beautiful Bill requires states with error rates higher than 6% to pay for a percentage of the benefits people receive. Previously, the federal government covered all benefit costs.
Nevada’s Fiscal Year 2024 logged a 5.94% error rate, but the rate has fluctuated over previous years. Nevada was one of only eight states with a rate below 6%.
The state’s error rate is currently at 7%, according to Kelly Cantrelle, the deputy administrator who oversees SNAP. For that error rate, Nevada would be penalized by having to pay 5% of benefit costs.
Past data suggests that would be equivalent to $55 million annually, said Cantrelle. If the error rate were to rise, the state could wind up paying up to 15% of benefit costs.
All of that would be on top of the administrative costs already set to rise.
“We are working to get that error rate below 6%, of course,” Cantrelle added.
The Division of Social Services has already begun changing certain practices to try to avoid errors, including requiring case reviews twice a year instead of annually and adding additional verification requirements related to proof of shelter and utility expenses.
More than half of errors are “customer related,” according to Cantrelle. “Something they forgot to tell us. A piece of info they gave to us wasn’t accurate.”
The federal government “just moved the goal line on us,” she added.
Thompson told lawmakers that the agency intends to “stretch its resources” in anticipation of budget shortfalls but said there isn’t a lot of flexibility in their budget.
“We may have to let (employee) vacancy increase,” he said. “My office is scrutinizing every vacancy that comes forward, except for case managers.”
Salaries make up the bulk of the division’s budget, Thompson said, so “there is not another place in an agency like ours to be able to come up with that kind of money.”
Cannizzaro, who led lawmakers’ questioning about the impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill on SNAP, said the situation created by the federal legislation championed by President Donald Trump is “unfortunate and very disappointing.”
“Despite this legislature’s efforts over the last two legislative sessions, the last four years, to reduce (employee) vacancy rates, to increase salaries, to make sure we are taking care of state workers, to make sure they can do their job, we are not only going to ask them to do more, but we are going to leave these vacancies open in order to manage part of this shortfall,” she said.
Cannizzaro also briefly referenced reports about a possible special session this fall. Gov. Joe Lombardo last week told KTNV “the special session conversation is happening as we speak.” In that interview, Lombardo suggested a crime bill he proposed but that failed to pass earlier this year, as well as a revived film tax credit proposal, could be issues taken up in the session. But addressing the impact of federal funding cuts and changes could be put off until the next regular legislative session in 2027, Lombardo said.
“In whatever potential conversations about upcoming potential special sessions, there’s going to have to be action by this body for this biennium,” Cannizzaro  said Wednesday.
Cannizzaro said federal policy changes have forced the state to bear an “untenable” burden despite having a history of “doing its job and doing it well.”
“At the end of the day we are going to be taking away services from the most needy Nevadans. We, as a legislature, are now going to have to go find $19 million in order to make sure these programs stay afloat. … And in future biennia, we are going to have to find $50 million each session to continue these programs.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-1287472642-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-14 08:57:15.501765

Re: “LA County repealed its own justice reforms. Restoring them would require a shaky electorate“
Robert Greene’s recent column on Measure J rightly underscores its importance. However, I take issue with the seemingly blanket blame put onto the Los Angeles County Counsel’s Office, blatantly glossing over the root cause of this issue, which is simple: the failure of the prior Executive Office to update the county charter in Municode, the website that houses and codifies municipal laws nationwide, to reflect Measure J. 
The current executive officer, Edward Yen, has acknowledged this oversight.
The County Counsel’s Office followed protocol at every step. We notified the prior executive office of all court rulings on Measure J. When directed to draft Measure G, we followed instructions from the Board of Supervisors to rely on the proposed charter amendment from 2000 and the charter as reflected in Municode.
Our office has handled over 10,000 cases in the last four years. To suggest lawyers should rely on memory over the official charter record is not only unrealistic, it undermines legal procedures.
Scapegoating our office is inaccurate and sets a dangerous precedent.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/060620-Kenneth-Hahn-Hall-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-14 08:57:15.501765

Shooting destructive nonnative mute swans might be a tougher sell.,"In summary
California has tried to eradicate ugly South American swamp rodents called nutria. Shooting destructive nonnative mute swans might be a tougher sell.


On an early August morning, it didn’t take long to spot the first pair of huge white swans with orange and black bills and graceful, curving necks as they swam in the marsh along the side of a Solano County levee road.
They dabbled in the vegetation as a pickup drove through the Grizzly Island Wildlife Area. A short drive later, past a herd of a dozen tule elk, two more swans appeared in the marsh alongside the dirt road. Then four more. A few hundred yards down the road, out in the distance past a thicket of swaying reeds, dozens of swans swam in the water.
For casual bird watchers, the sight of all these majestic animals might be a pleasure and bring to mind swan-themed works of literature, such as “Leda and the Swan” and “The Ugly Duckling.”
But for wetland biologists and others with a stake in the health of the surrounding Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, the largest estuary on the West Coast, the birds represent the latest – and an exponentially growing – threat to the few remaining wetlands left in California.
These are mute swans, native to Europe and Asia. Weighing up to 30 pounds and with a wingspan of up to eight feet, they’re the biggest bird in the marsh, and they’re not the least bit shy about throwing their weight around. 
Fiercely territorial, especially during breeding season, they’ve been known to drown smaller animals and have killed at least one American kayaker. They’ve displaced colonies of nesting native birds in other parts of the U.S. they have invaded. Mute swans also feed gluttonously on submerged vegetation, destroying the plant life on which other native wetland species depend.
“They might be a pretty, big, white bird … and they may be charismatic, but they can be pretty nasty,” said Brad Bortner, a retired chief of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s migratory bird management programs in Washington D.C.
In 2008, California banned anyone without a special permit from keeping mute swans as pets or from importing them into the state. The hope was to head off yet another destructive invasive species taking hold in the state. 
It didn’t work. The mute swan population exploded in just a few years. In 2022, state waterfowl biologists estimated there were 1,150 of them. This spring, they estimated more than 12,000, nearly double the year before. Most of the mute swans are in the Suisun Marsh, a sprawling complex of public wetlands, agricultural lands and private duck-hunting clubs on the outskirts of the Bay Area near Fairfield.
“We keep watching them climb and climb and climb,” said Melanie Weaver, waterfowl coordinator for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

A measure before the state Legislature aims to allow hunters and landowners to shoot the swans for the next five years to try to bring their numbers down to more manageable levels in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and beyond. 
The hunting groups supporting Assembly Bill 764 essentially ask: If Californians are OK with spending more than $13 million since 2018 to kill nearly 6,000 nutria, the 20-pound, orange-toothed South American rodents that have invaded the same waterways, why not let hunters and land owners do the same to mute swans – but for free? 
“If the population gets too large and out of control, it may be beyond our ability then to really effectively manage them,” Mark Hennelly, a lobbyist for the California Waterfowl Association, told the Assembly Water, Parks and Wildlife Committee this spring. “So we want to get ahead of the problem.”
Animal welfare groups object 
That argument has so far been a surprisingly easy sell in the Legislature, despite California’s passionate and influential anti-hunting activists. Similar swan-killing proposals have led to protests in other states. 
The measure easily passed the Assembly without any lawmaker voting against it. It’s now pending in the California Senate. 
No group has opposed the measure so far, according to the CalMatters Digital Democracy database, but that might soon change.
Mute swans, unlike nutria, have a dedicated group of supporters, mostly on the East Coast. 
Nicole Rivard, a spokesperson for Friends of Animals, said she and fellow members of the animal welfare organization believe mute swans shouldn’t be treated like vermin.
The birds arrived here through no fault of their own, brought by humans, and they don’t deserve to be killed for it, she said.
Rivard believes the California legislation is motivated by hunters looking for an excuse to have yet another bird to legally shoot. Currently, mute swans can only be killed by landowners if the birds “are found to be injuring growing crops or property,” according to state regulations.
“We’re anti-hunting, so we don’t like the idea that (hunting) might be, you know, part of the reasoning behind this,” Rivard said. 
Arguing that claims of mute swans’ environmental damage and aggression are overblown, Friends of Animals and other groups opposed killing them decades ago, after Mid-Atlantic states proposed eradication when their populations began expanding dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The groups protested, filed lawsuits and proposed legislation to try to stop the killing. They had mixed success. Some states began killing the nonnative swans over the animal welfare groups’ objections. Notably, Maryland was able to knock the mute swan population down from around 5,000 birds in the early 2000s to around 200 by 2010.
“Continued control and maintenance operations have reduced that number to just a handful of birds today,” said Josh Homyack, the game bird section leader for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. 
In Maryland, government agency employees raided mute swan nests and destroyed eggs, captured and euthanized swans when they were flightless during their feather-molting season and shot them in carefully coordinated operations, Homyack said. The state also issued a few permits to kill the birds to local landowners. 
In New York, the mute swan lobby got a law passed that made it harder to kill the birds, requiring state officials to “fully exhaust non-lethal control measures” such as nest destruction and capturing birds and moving them to wildlife facilities “prior to any lethal removal.”
The mute swan population in New York has stayed steady at around 2,000 to 3,400 birds. 
Charisma matters with invasive species
On the East Coast, mute swans have been around since before the turn of the last century. They were first imported as ornamental livestock for zoos, parks and estates. 
Some of California’s mute swans likely came in the same way. Weaver, the California waterfowl coordinator, said others were likely brought in the past few years to chase away Canada geese that have increasingly become a nuisance at parks and golf courses. 
“People were buying these (swans), and they were just throwing them out there,” she said. 
Weaver noted their owners didn’t do the responsible thing and clip their wings to keep them from flying off. That’s hardly surprising. It’s no easy task to grab a hissing 25-pound swan, big and angry enough to swamp a kayaker. So with nothing to stop them, the birds flew to nearby marshlands and began reproducing.
“Here we are, not very many years down the road, with a population that is really increasing at a rapid rate,” Weaver said.
So far, California’s wildlife agency hasn’t enacted a mute swan eradication plan similar to the one it started almost immediately – and publicly promoted – a few years ago, after nutria first started turning up in the San Joaquin Valley.

Nutria are similarly destructive feeders on aquatic plants. The South American swamp rodents also burrow holes in levees, posing a threat to the state’s flood-control and water-supply infrastructure.
Dave Strayer, a retired invasive species expert with the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in New York, said he’s not surprised state officials haven’t been as aggressive with the beautiful mute swans, given the uproar over killing them in other states.
He said research has shown that when it comes to invasive animals, charisma matters. The more attractive a problematic non-native species is, the less appetite there is to wipe it out.  
Stayer gave an example: Few complain about killing common nonnative rats, but you’re apt to get death threats at even the suggestion of wiping out ecologically harmful feral cat colonies in the same habitats.
He noted that no one has ever complained about efforts to eradicate one of his research subjects, the nonnative zebra mussels that have also invaded California. 
“I never had even one person stand up for zebra mussels and say, ‘No, these are beautiful, elegant God’s creatures’ and so forth,” he said. 
Few wetlands and too many mute swans
Supporters of the swan-killing legislation say reducing the number of mute swans should be fairly easy since the giant white birds are easy to spot, identify and kill. Their size and the color and shape of their bills also reduce the risk they’ll be confused with other protected bird species, they say.
California’s native tundra and trumpeter swans would still be protected and illegal to shoot if the bill becomes law.

Despite their undeniable beauty, Weaver, the state waterfowl coordinator, sees mute swans similarly to nutria.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Donald Trump wouldn’t be ordering Texas to gerrymander its congressional district maps to hell and gone if Trump and Republicans thought they could beat Nevada Democratic U.S. Reps. Dina Titus, Steven Horsford, and Susie Lee next year.
Okay, it’s not just about Titus, Horsford and Lee personally, each of whom Trump may or may not have given much thought.
But they are among the three to four dozen Democratic members of Congress nationwide who hold districts viewed as competitive, which is to say districts Republicans have a chance of flipping from blue to red. 
Republicans, and Democrats too, routinely regard Nevada CD1, CD3, and CD4 as competitive. (Nevada Democrats have once or twice tried to make CD2, currently held by Republican Mark Amodei, competitive too. But they haven’t tried very hard; last year they didn’t even field a candidate in the district.)
As it has been in  every election cycle over the last decade, CD3,  currently held by Lee, is viewed by Republicans as their best chance of flipping a seat in Nevada in 2026. Lee is one of only 13 House Democrats nationwide representing a congressional district Trump won in 2024.
Lee is also one of several House Democrats whose district is rated (at this admittedly early stage) as “leaning” in the Democrats’ favor by two of the nation’s most cited political race rating outfits, the Cook Political Report and Sabato’s Crystal Ball.
The districts held by Titus (CD1) and Horsford (CD4) are among multiple Democratically controlled districts both Cook and Sabato rate as “competitive” but “likely” to remain in Democratic hands. (CD2 is perennially “safe” Republican by the way.)
And the reports rate between seven (Sabato) and 10 (Cook) Democratically held districts nationally as “toss ups.”
Totaled, there are between 39 (Cook) and 46 (Sabato) Democratic congressional districts the experts rate as competitive next year.
Notwithstanding the customary tendency of the party out of power to pick up seats, that’s a lot of Democratic vulnerability, and a lot of opportunities for Republican candidates to not only hold on to their House majority, but to strengthen it.
Of course some Republican-held districts are rated as competitive too. But they have substantially fewer districts to defend (Cook says 28, Sabato says 33).
In other words, Trump didn’t need to command Texas to get cracking on a nefarious mid-decade redistricting scheme to give Republicans a mathematical advantage in the contest to control the U.S. House. Trump and his Republicans already have one.
Sure, Democrats only need to flip a few seats to win control of the House. But Trump, via the aforementioned bootlickers, already has control of the House.
Singling out Nevada
Trump also single-handedly controls the national policy agenda, because Republicans who hold the majorities in both houses of Congress have spent the last few months sniveling and groveling and cowering before the executive branch like the pathetic bootlickers they are. When the U.S. Supreme Court’s subservience to Trump is taken into account, his control over the agenda is not merely single-handed, but autocratic.
If Democrats won the House (Republicans are generally expected to retain their majority in the Senate), that would mark the return of at least one part of the legislative branch attempting to carry out the duties assigned to it in the U.S. Constitution. 
Republicans losing control of one house of Congress would be a crucial step in what promises to be a long struggle to reverse the nation’s backslide into authoritarianism that voters in Nevada and other states approved last year.
So you can see why Trump turned to extraordinary means to prevent losing the House, and ordered Texas to get on the stick and rig this election.
It’s not a sign of Trump strength, but Trump’s weakness.
He assures everyone that all of his policies are “beautiful” and will bring prosperity “like nobody’s ever seen before.” And thanks to the sycophancy of Congress and the slogging nature of even those courts that aren’t kowtowing to him, he is largely free to implement those polices — to do whatever he wants whenever he wants. Which is largely what he’s been doing.
Yet Trump doesn’t trust his own policies and their consequences to inspire Nevada voters to turn blue congressional seats red.
To hear Trump tell it, “no tax on tips” alone should be enough to deliver Nevada’s three competitive congressional districts into his clutches. 
But whatever approval might have been created by providing a tax deduction on some tipped earnings for a couple years has been muzzled by dread of how painful the cumulative hit to Nevada’s economy will be as the result of the totality of Trump’s policies and actions.
Tariff chaos; alienating international travelers; disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars of federal investment in energy, industrial and infrastructure projects (and hence, hindered economic diversification); slashing the safety net for food, housing, and health care; even an inexplicable gambling tax provision in Trump’s one big grotesque bill … all will combine to inflict more damage to Nevada than most states. It’s like he singled us out.
And it is only thanks to Trump, coupled of course with the acquiescence of a Nevada governor every bit as lily-livered as his fellow Republicans in Congress, that members of the Nevada National Guard will be called up to help Trump’s shady ICE army break up Nevada families and arrest and detain hard-working taxpaying members of  the Nevada workforce.
Trump must know, if only subconsciously, something he would never say out loud or perhaps even admit to himself: He’s created a hot steaming pile only the rock steady MAGAfolk and corporate executives obsessed with tax cuts are willing to look on favorably. And there aren’t enough of them to hold on to the House. At least not in a fair election.
It took him three tries, but last year Trump finally won Nevada. Now he’s already afraid he can’t flip any of its congressional seats. So he’s ordering Texas to rescue him by ginning up some election jiggery pokery.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2206109475-1024x704.jpg,,,2025-08-14 12:58:47.391392

(Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) With his execution approaching, attorneys for death row inmate Ralph Menzies made what could be one of their final pleas for mercy on Wednesday, telling the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole that their client is already dying from a terminal illness. 
The board, Menzies’ attorneys said, should let the illness run its course, rather than end his life with a firing squad. 
“He’s confined to a wheelchair. He cannot walk more than a few steps without a walker. He’s tethered to an oxygen tank. He’s not presently, and will never be in the future, a threat to other inmates, prison staff or the public. The original rationale for the death penalty is therefore no longer a valid justification for execution,” said his attorney, Eric Zuckerman. 
Menzies, 67, is scheduled to die on Sept. 5. 
Wednesday marked the first day of his commutation hearing before the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole, where his attorneys argued his dementia, as well as issues with his sentencing and his “model” behavior as an inmate, warrant clemency.

But witnesses called by the Utah Attorney General’s Office, which included medical professionals and Department of Corrections staff, questioned the severity of Menzies’ cognitive impairment. 
Menzies’ attorneys presented first on Wednesday morning. On Friday, the family of Maurine Hunsaker — who was murdered in 1986 by Menzies after being kidnapped and tied to a tree in Big Cottonwood Canyon — will speak to the board. 
The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole can spare the life of death row inmates, instead imposing a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. The board, however, has never commuted a death sentence.
Commutation hearings are like a trial in some ways, and vastly different in others. There are no cross examinations or objections, meaning attorneys from both sides essentially have to let witnesses speak and cannot push back on their claims. Both sides often make legal arguments, but their overall presentations can include reasons that go beyond state or federal code. 
That includes one of the key arguments presented Wednesday from Menzies’ attorneys — the 67-year-old has vascular dementia that will likely kill him.
“Mr. Menzies will die in this prison,” said Zuckerman. “The question before this board today is whether he will die as a result of his terminal vascular disease, or whether the state of Utah will hasten his death by shooting him.” 
Expert witnesses testified to the extent of Menzies’ mental decline, a subject debated at length over the past year. Menzies underwent an evaluation to see if he meets the definition of “incompetent” — meaning he doesn’t understand why the state is executing him. A judge ruled that he does have dementia, but doesn’t meet the threshold to be deemed incompetent. His attorneys are appealing that ruling with the Utah Supreme Court, while also petitioning a lower court to launch another evaluation, claiming his dementia has worsened in the last year. 
Attorneys for Utah death row inmate worry a delayed ruling could deny him due process 

Health records referenced on Wednesday showed that, since 2018, Menzies has taken a number of falls where he hit his head and has suffered from incidents — one as recent as last week — where he had a shortness of breath, difficulty standing up, fraught balance and trouble with basic activities, like getting dressed or eating.   
“It’s like if you have an irrigation system in your lawn and one of those pipes gets ruptured or blocked. That area of lawn that was going to get water by that irrigation system is going to die. The same thing happens when there’s blockage in a blood vessel,” said Thomas Hyde, a neuroscientist.
Other corrections staff testified that Menzies, during his nearly four decades in prison, has been a model inmate who has recently shown signs of decline. 
“He was in my class for almost five months. Every lesson took him quite a bit longer than it took everyone else to do,” said Stephanie Callahan, a case manager for the Department of Corrections, who told the board she had numerous interactions where he wasn’t listening, couldn’t focus or pay attention, and “was just kind of starting off into space.”
Menzies also presents no threat to other prisoners or staff, said Lyle Richard Smith, a now retired, 20-year veteran with the Department of Corrections. 
“I’ve never seen him act out, ever … I’ve never seen him raise his temper,” Smith said. “I don’t think he would ever strike out to anyone at this point.”
Menzies’ death sentence was also scrutinized on Wednesday, with attorneys focusing on a statement from Judge Raymond Uno, who presided over the trial. Uno, in a sworn affidavit signed in 2010, said he misapplied the aggravating factor that ultimately allowed for the death penalty, stating that there was no evidence of torture in the death of Maurine Hunsaker. 
Plus, Menzies’ attorneys said, the trial was tainted by made up testimony from an inmate who knew Menzies. While awaiting trial at the Salt Lake County Jail, a fellow inmate claimed to hear Menzies bragging about the murder, telling him “it was one of the greatest thrills of my life.” 
But in a sworn declaration signed years later, the inmate admitted to making up the statements in an attempt to strike a deal with federal authorities. “That statement was false,” the inmate said.
A conviction integrity unit — which reviews post-conviction claims of innocence — wrote that it was “fundamentally unfair” for the state to execute someone based on perjured testimony. 
The same unit also pointed out that in 1988, when his trial occurred, Utah judges were not able to sentence inmates to life without the possibility of parole — the only two options for a capital case were death, and life with the possibility of parole. 
“Mr. Menzies’ death sentence lacks integrity,” the unit wrote. 
State doubts Menzies’ claim of incompetence
The state’s presentation was notably shorter than Menzies’ and focused on the claims of mental decline, painting the inmate as aging and suffering from some physical ailments, but not incompetent. 
That includes corrections staff who interact with Menzies, who told the board he doesn’t struggle with using his prison-issued tablet, has no issues with hygiene, and that they did not observe any changes in his ability to communicate or go about daily activities. 
“He’s very organized,” said Sgt. Joseph Torrence with the Utah Department of Corrections, when asked about Menzies’ job at the prison overseeing laundry. “He established a kind of organizational system for the socks, underwear, shoe sizes, jumpsuits.” 
Dr. David Thompson, a clinical and forensic psychologist who met with Menzies, said that he found little evidence of cognitive decline during his evaluations. 
Instead, he said any mental shortcomings could be a result of depression, made worse by the state ramping up its effort in the last year to execute him. 
“I think he would have reason to be depressed,” he said. “Many of the cognitive changes that were reported are very consistent with an individual who’s experiencing depression.” 
Dr. Ryan Green, a neuropsychologist and state witness who examined Menzies as part of last year’s competency review, pointed to phonecalls made by the death row inmate that suggest he is able to pay attention and concentrate. 
“He still is very intelligent,” Green said. “I would say he’s probably had some cognitive decline, consistent with a neurodegenerative process, but not to the degree that is written about in the reports.”

(Getty Images)A Jefferson County Circuit Court judge Wednesday denied a request from the University of Alabama at Birmingham to dismiss a civil lawsuit filed by the family of a federal inmate whose organs were allegedly harvested after their death without the family’s knowledge.
Judge Patrick Ballard dropped a fraud claim from the suit but allowed the case to proceed. “We are absolutely thrilled, overjoyed,” said Marion Harrell, the sister of Matthew Harrell, who died while incarcerated at Federal Correction Institution Talladega in March 2023, in an interview following the hearing. “We are making great progress. We are ecstatic about the judge’s decision.”
Lauren Faraino, the attorney for Violet Harrell and Jimmie Harrell, Matthew’s parents, who filed the lawsuit, said she will file additional information in the case for Ballard to reconsider his decision to exclude the fraud claim.

The lawsuit parallels another set of lawsuits filed in Montgomery Circuit Court against the Alabama Department of Corrections and UAB for also harvesting organs of people who died while in prison. Those cases have been temporarily suspended because of an appeal filed by one of the parties.
According to the complaint, Violet Harrell received a call in the evening of March 2023 from the chaplain assigned to the Federal Correctional Institution Talladega facility that her son died after he collapsed on a basketball court.
The complaint states that the chaplain said “he had not been attacked” but declined to give further details. Violet then called the warden’s office and one of the staff members told her that an autopsy would be performed and instructed her to provide information about where to send Matthew’s body after the autopsy was completed.
“At no point did Ms. Davis or anyone else give any information or ask plaintiff Ms. Harrell or anyone in the Harrell family to sign any releases, authorizations of other forms related to decedent Harrell’s death or remains,” the complaint states. “At no point did Ms. Davis or anyone else seek permission from the Harrell family for the autopsy, nor did they get permission for or even mention organ/tissue donation or retention.”
Matthew’s body was then transferred to the custody of the university. The autopsy report the family obtained months later confirmed that the university took custody of Matthew’s body; that the coroner declined to order an autopsy, but an autopsy was nevertheless done in the same month, and that another individual verified the procedure one month later. It is unclear when the Matthew’s organs were harvested.
The complaint alleges that the warden of the Talladega facility ordered the autopsy.
“Through deception and by conspiracy, acting in a concerted manner, defendants violated Alabama law when they (1) conducted an autopsy that was not ordered by the coroner; (2) wrongfully permitted a warden to consent to organ removal and retention during an autopsy; and (3) participated in and permitted the conversion of property (namely, the remains of decedent Harrell) belonging to the plaintiffs—all of which are against Alabama law,” the complaint states.
The complaint alleges that the university violated the Alabama Uniform Anatomical Gift Act and state law when it harvested Matthew’s organs without notifying his next of kin or obtaining their permission.
Along with that, the complaint alleges unlawful conversion, interfering with someone’s personal property, conspiracy among the defendants for their illegal conduct, and wantonness for reckless conduct when staff at the university performed an autopsy and harvested Matthew’s organs without his family’s permission.
UAB argued in its motion to dismiss  that federal law allows the warden to authorize an autopsy.
“The warden may order an autopsy in cases of homicide, suicide, accidents and unexplained deaths,” said Jay Ezelle, the attorney representing the university. “In this case, playing basketball.”
Faraino responded by telling the court that the warden may order the autopsy only during instances of that a crime is suspected or when disciplinary action is involved. None of that applies in Matthew’s situation.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Prison-cells-for-Aug-14-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-14 08:57:15.501765

There’s precious little Newsom and legislators can do about it since they face chronic budget deficits.,"If and when Gavin Newsom launches a campaign for president, economic and social conditions in the California he’s governed for two terms will be in the spotlight.
While Newsom brags incessantly about the state and its achievements, its chronic problems, such as a high level of homelessness, are obvious to anyone. Political media and his rivals will focus on them with laser-like intensity.
Given the dynamics of last year’s presidential contest, in which worries about rising costs of living played a role in Californian Kamala Harris’s loss to Donald Trump, California’s very high costs for housing and other fundamental living needs, would be fodder for attacks on Newsom in 2028.
Newsom has been trying to insulate himself, as much as possible, from such criticism. For example, he’s signed legislation aimed at increasing housing production and ordered his administration to crackdown on cities that impede construction.
Last October, just a few days before Harris lost, Newsom ordered California’s Public Utilities Commission, Air Resources Board and state Energy Commission to generate ideas on how high costs of energy, particularly electricity, could be mitigated.
“We’re taking action to address rising electricity costs and save consumers money on their bills,” Newsom said at the time. “California is proving that we can address affordability concerns as we continue our world-leading efforts to combat the climate crisis.”
California’s residential and commercial electricity rates are the highest in the nation’s lower 48 states, according to a monthly compilation by the California Center for Jobs & the Economy, an adjunct to the California Business Roundtable. Californians’ actual power bills are the ninth-highest due to the state’s relatively mild climate, the report found.
Power bills hit low-income families especially hard, especially those living in inland communities, where summer temperatures easily pass 100 degrees, requiring extensive use of air conditioning. This week, a report from the Public Policy Institute of California confirmed that observation.
“Rising household electricity costs in California over the past decade have largely outpaced rising incomes for low- and middle-income families,” wrote PPIC authors Tess Thorman, Patricia Malagon and Paulette Cha. “Just before the pandemic, income was beginning to catch up with costs for low-income households, but the high cost burden of electricity bills jumped between 2019 and 2021 — for everyone.
“Geography also plays an important role, highlighted in the California Public Utilities Commission’s efforts to monitor the affordability of utility bills. Electricity is least affordable to households in hotter zones — specifically in parts of the Inland Empire, San Joaquin Valley, and the state’s northern region.”
The CPUC and the energy commission responded to Newsom’s order in February but didn’t offer much in the way of effective steps to reduce utility bills. The CPUC noted that there are existing programs to help low-income families cope with power bills, financed mostly from utilities’ overall revenues, and suggested that they could be increased with non-ratepayer money, such as budget appropriations.
It also decried the fact that homeowners who install solar panels on their roofs tend to have high incomes but don’t contribute much to support the electrical grid — an issue that’s kicked around the Capitol for years. This year, legislation that would have hit solar panel owners in the wallet, Assembly Bill 942, was watered down to little more than a token after a fierce lobbying battle.
The energy commission’s report on power costs was even thinner gruel, mostly patting itself on the back for adopting standards for appliances and other power-using devices that reduced their demands.
The bottom line is that Californians’ power costs are very high, could go even higher as utilities are pressed to reduce the danger of power lines causing wildfires, and there’s precious little Newsom and legislators can do about it, since they face chronic budget deficits.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/111023_Angelica-Vasquez_MO_CM_016.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-14 08:57:15.501765

“It is not just a quilt, it is something that draws you to start the healing process if you are not already in the healing process, and to help you continue the healing process if you have already started it,” said Callie Greer, a community navigator with Alabama Appleseed and a designer of the quilt, on Saturday.

The quilt is one of several honoring gun violence victims. Separate quilts honor firearm victims from Montgomery and Birmingham..
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Alabama has the fourth-highest rate of firearm-related deaths in the country, at 25.5 per 100,000 people. The state, which has a population of 5.1 million, had more total gun deaths in 2022 (1,278) than New York State (1,044), which has a population of 19.9 million.
The quilt for Selma will highlight Zechariah Brown, 16, whose mother, Tenesha Brown, wanted him to be remembered. Teneshia Brown was getting food to feed her son and his friends one day in February 2020 when she received a call from her other son that Zechariah had been shot.
“When I got over there, I saw my son, face down on the ground,” Tenesha said. “I immediately hopped out of the car and grabbed my son and said, ‘Don’t die on me now.’ I just got to rocking my child while we were on the ground.”
Another person on the quilt is Taffine Renee Berry, whose sister Lashanda Smith, attended Saturday’s event in Selma. Berry died in March 2015 after she and her husband were shot while attending the reception for the funeral of one of her friends who had passed away.
“She got shot in the neck, and she didn’t make it,” Smith said. No one has been convicted of the crime.
“I am her only sister,” Smith said. “I am here to let everyone know; someone took a beautiful person from us, with a bright future ahead of her, with three kids and a husband, they took her away from us. I am standing here today to let everyone know, I am still standing. I am still fighting for justice for my sister.”
Remonia Minor also attended the event. Her son, Ryan Snell, 22, was visiting Troy in 2021 when he was shot and killed.
“It is like being stuck in that moment,” Minor said of the death of her son. “I describe it as being able to move one foot but not being able to move the other. It is like being stuck in that particular timeframe. You want to move forward, but it is a process, a very hard journey to move forward.”
Charlene Davison lost her daughter Nikita Walker, 26, in June 2024 when she intervened in a domestic dispute to protect her friend.
“She was trying to stop an argument because the guy was cursing out his kids’ mom,” Davison said. “She didn’t want the kids to be hearing that.”
Despite the losses, Alabama has some of the most permissive firearm laws in the nation. Everytown ranks the state 34th of all states in the country in terms of the strength of its laws pertaining to firearms.
No permits are required to carry a concealed firearm. During the most recent legislative session, Republicans in the Legislature voted against a bill that would have effectively required parents to safely store their firearms.
Victims can continue to be added as more families submit names and photos to add to the quilt. The quilts can be displayed at rallies and for different events.
“Don’t waste your pain,” Greer said. “Use it to create something terribly beautiful, like this quilt.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250809_150906-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-14 08:57:15.501765

Nationally, community college enrollment is climbing after a dip from the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Higher Ed Dive, community college enrollment had a 5.4% increase in spring enrollment from 2024 to 2025. The ACCS had a 9.8% increase over those two semesters, Scott said. 
“We appreciate the commitment that you have to make this system the change agent that it can be, and is already, that brings an opportunity for so many people to make their lives better,” Chancellor Jimmy Baker said.
Alabama’s enrollment has been higher than the national average in the past. In January, Scott reported that enrollment trends were about 3% higher than the national average. 
Baker said in an interview after the meeting that Alabama’s higher than average enrollment growth is attributable to the presidents and staff at its schools continuously recruiting students.
“We’ve got 40,000 students that are in dual enrollment,” Baker said. “It wouldn’t happen without a good group of presidents and good staff, and we’ve worked hard. Fortunately, a lot of our presidents were in the high school business, so they understand that process.”
Susan Price, Baker’s chief of staff, announced at the meeting that ACCS has partnered with the Alabama Weather Network, a free weather service provider started by Alabama meteorologist James Spann.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)With the 2025-26 school year starting next week in some counties, Maryland’s two top education leaders had a message for local school officials: Follow state law.
The calm, but stern warning came Wednesday during a back-to-school news conference in Baltimore with State Superintendent Carey Wright and state Board of Education President Joshua Michael. Neither named specific school districts, but when reporters asked about administrative and policy changes related to diversity, equity and inclusion programs in Calvert and Somerset counties, they did not hesitate to answer.
“In Maryland we have a state public education system. Local school board leaders who lead local school systems are actually state officials,” Michael said. “They have authority within the state system that Dr. Wright leads to really bring that local context into schools and ensure that the management day to day and the policy set for local school system are done well.
“But at the end of the day, it’s a Maryland public education system. It is not a specific county,” he said.
That was echoed by Wright, who said she meets monthly with local superintendents, when topics include changes to federal government policies on DEI, immigration and other topics.
“As Dr. Michael said, every district is so different, and the local politics are very different, but the state law is not different per district,” she said. “So that’s where we want to make sure that everybody is very clear on what the state law has to say about any issue.”
The Calvert County school board voted in June to remove an anti-racism resolution from its student code of conduct that began with a statement of outrage over the 2020 deaths of “George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, as well as countless other African Americans who have lost their lives as a result of racism and police brutality that persist in our country.”
The board also voted to remove the resolution from the school system’s website and social media platforms, reasoning that the previous board in June 2020 did not vote to add the resolution to the student code. That was done by staff without board directive, board President Jana Post said during the meeting this June.
On Thursday, the five-member board took less than 3 minutes to vote to repeal the school system’s antiracism policy, last revised in February 2024.
“I would like to be sure and make it clear that we have a discrimination policy in place that covers all forms of illegal discrimination,” Post said. “So having a separate antiracism policy is redundant. It sends the message that we are elevating one form of discrimination over all other forms of discrimination.”
In an email Wednesday, Post said the board’s “only comment is that we support the safety of all students and groups any discrimination, as outlined in our current discrimination policy and procedure.”
Last week’s decision will be posted for 30 days for public comment — and Calvert County resident Birgit Sharp has some comments she plans to share.
Sharp, a member of local community group CANDLE (Community Action Network for Democracy Liberties and Equality), and others protested prior to the board’s vote last week.
“It’s really scary to me that this happened,” Sharp said Wednesday. “This is a school [system] with not a lot of people of color. To not have the extra protections … put in there is scary.”
One next step, Sharp said, will be mobilizing residents who may want to run for school board in next year’s election.
Three current board members – Melissa Goshorn, Paul Harrison and Joseph Marchio – won in 2024 with the backing of Project 1776 PAC, a group that pushes for conservative education policies and parental rights in schools.
State stepped in
Project 1776 also helped Mary Beth Bozman and Matthew Lankford get elected last year to the Somerset County Board of Education. Lankford serves as school board chair.
For the past several months, the board pushed to cut $1 million for librarians from the budget and to remove alleged DEI policies, as first reported by The Baltimore Banner.
But when the school board sought to get rid of Somerset County Public Schools Superintendent Ava Tasker-Mitchell, who is Black, Wright stepped in.
The board tried to get rid of Tasker-Mitchell in June and sought to appoint David Bromwell, who is white and a former superintendent in Dorchester County, as interim superintendent.
The state reinstated Tasker-Mitchell for 60 days, which ended Aug. 5. But in an Aug. 4 letter to Lankford, Wright denied his request to have Tasker-Mitchell “vacate the [Somerset County] property on Aug. 6.”
The state board passed an emergency regulation that went into effect July 23 that allowed Wright to extend Tasker-Mitchell’s reinstatement until Jan. 19 or until a hearing occurs. The regulation was approved by the General Assembly’s Joint Committee on Administrative, Executive, and Legislative Review.
“It is my expectation that Dr. Tasker-Mitchell will report to work on August 6, 2025, and be allowed to exercise her lawful duties as county superintendent,” Wright wrote.
Wright’s letter also warned the school board that violating state law could result in funding being withheld, and noted that “the State Board is authorized to initiate removal of board members for willful neglect of duty.”
Tasker-Mitchell’s picture remains on the school system’s website. A representative with Somerset schools did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-Carey-Wright-and-Dr.-Joshua-Michael-8-13-2025-1024x545.jpg,,,2025-08-14 07:58:07.915620

But […],"Parents, staff and community members listen while Focus: HOPE Chief Executive Officer Portia Roberson addresses them about the organization being denied federal funding on Aug. 12, 2025. (Martin Slagter / For Chalkbeat)This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
Kyra O’Guinn and her young family have relied heavily on Focus: HOPE’s Early Head Start programming to help raise their daughter since she was just 4 months old.
But that safety net was eliminated when the longtime Detroit nonprofit announced that it has not received federal Head Start funding for the 2025–26 school year.
The closure of the Head Start program affects more than 300 Detroit-area children like O’Guinn’s, leaving her and other parents scrambling for alternative arrangements while as many as 70% of its 107 early learning staff members face layoffs, said Portia Roberson, CEO of Focus: HOPE, which provides early learning, job training, and food support to families.
For 10 years, Focus: HOPE’s Head Start programs were funded through a relationship with Starfish Family Services. Focus: HOPE was a subrecipient of a grant Starfish received from the federal government to provide the program. Last year, though, the two organizations agreed to apply for the funding individually, meaning Focus: HOPE would have to seek the federal money on its own. That funding request was formally rejected last week without explanation.
It isn’t clear whether the decision is connected to the uncertainty facing Head Start nationally due to the Trump administration’s temporary pause of funding and the closure of regional offices.
O’Guinn and her husband both work, and she’s also pursuing a degree in marketing and public relations. She said it’s difficult to consider next steps for their now 3-year-old daughter and another younger child with no nearby options for child care or family to pitch in.
“To take something away like this from us and our neighborhoods is you telling us that you want us to continue to be underserviced,” O’Guinn said during a Focus: HOPE town hall hosted on Tuesday. “It left us empty-handed, and we really needed that support.”
The loss of funding affects families in Detroit’s 48202, 48206, 48211, and 48238 ZIP codes, which are located in city neighborhoods like Midtown and Forest Park and includes neighboring cities like Hamtramck. In addition to having one of the highest rates of poverty in the state, three of the four ZIP codes were characterized as having “insufficient” licensed child care access, with three or more children for each available slot, according to data analyzed by Boston University’s Child Opportunity Index.
Roberson said Focus: HOPE will continue to operate some of its early childhood programming through state funding it receives for 4-year-olds enrolled in its Great Start Readiness Program, or GSRP, Michigan’s free prekindergarten program.
In the meantime, Roberson encouraged parents attending the town hall to advocate for restoring the agency’s federally funded programming provided by Head Start, designed to promote school readiness for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers from families that meet income eligibility requirements.
Roberson said Focus: HOPE plans to work with the city of Detroit, community partners, and other child care providers in the area to figure out where children can enroll without significant disruption.
In addition to educating children through its preschool program for 4-year-olds, Focus: HOPE’s early learning programs provided more than 250 mothers with peer-to-peer support for pregnancy, birth, breastfeeding, and early parenting — all services impacted by not receiving the grant.
“We’re actively working to figure out how many classes we can run with some of the other funding we receive,” Roberson said. “We’re looking for other funding sources so that we can try to serve as many of those 300 children as possible and then pivoting and trying to figure out where are some affordable, solid places that we can send other children that parents can access easily.”
The decision to seek the Head Start funding independently came because Starfish Family Services had indicated it no longer wanted to serve as a grantee with subrecipients, Roberson said. Starfish Family Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Focus: HOPE applied for the funding on its own in December, Roberson said, while continuing to operate under the Starfish’s grant funding that ran through the end of July. Expecting to hear from the federal government early in the year, Roberson said she first was updated in March that there could be a delay in decisions on funding due to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Head Start announcing it was shutting down five regional offices.
She said she contacted Michigan U.S. Sens. Gary Peters and Elissa Slotkin, both Democrats, in June to see if they could find out more after hearing rumors that some organizations might not be receiving funding.
Late last week, Roberson said she was informed by the federal Administration of Children and Families, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, that it had not received funding, but that Starfish and MiSide, another Detroit agency, had.
“We really don’t know why, because, to be honest, while it was a competitive grant process, it was not competitive in the sense that anyone else was applying to service the kids in the four ZIP codes we were currently servicing,” Roberson said. “So, essentially, by not funding us, it wasn’t as if they said, ‘Oh, we think that the application from some other organization was a better application, and we’re sending the kids there.’ They just said we’re not going to service you in these ZIP codes.”
Officials from the Health and Human Services department didn’t respond to a request for comment.
 ‘I don’t need a day care … I want her to be learning’

Roberson said Focus: HOPE applied for 100 additional Head Start slots and $14 million in total federal funding to serve around 400 children, a significant increase from the $6 million it operated on this past year. The intention, she said, was to see if it could accommodate children who were on a wait list.
“We were hoping this would be our opportunity to grow our program a little bit and have even more students participate in a Head Start program,” she said. “This obviously is not that and it’s going to be a significant hit to our overall Focus: HOPE budget.”
After enrolling her 4-year-old daughter in the Head Start program through Focus: HOPE a few months back, parent Sade Walker said she was concerned about having to potentially find a new place for her daughter this fall.
Though the Great Start Readiness Program might still be an option this fall, Walker said she’s concerned about receiving the news so close to the beginning of the school year.
“It’s probably going to be hard to find a school,” Walker said. “I don’t need a day care or a babysitter. I want her to be learning.”
Head Start overall has been dealing with uncertainty, beginning in January when the Trump administration paused federal funding for the program via an administrative order. That pause was eventually rescinded, but a later decision to shut down five regional offices raised more concerns. One of the regional offices that closed was in Chicago, which oversaw Head Start centers in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin.
In a statement about the closure of the Focus: HOPE programs, Peters said Head Start provides Michigan families with access to early childhood education while helping parents enter and stay in the workforce.
“That’s why we must ensure that every single community in our state receives the funding needed to administer this important program and support our working families,” Peter said in the statement. “I’ll keep working to ensure Focus: HOPE can continue serving children and families in Detroit.”
Democratic U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar, who attended Tuesday’s town hall, said the decision not to fund Focus: HOPE Head Start programming in some of the poorest ZIP codes in the country is another example of the administration’s “reverse Robin Hood” approach of “taking from people who need it and giving it to billionaires.”
“We cannot rest,” he said, “until this is reversed.”

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”
 Veterans depend on SNAP

Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
 A greater burden on states

In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.
“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SNAP-Chavis.jpg,,,2025-08-14 12:58:47.391392

Gov. Jeff Landry is now criticizing the Solar For All program that provided Louisiana with $156 million to support local renewable power projects and loans. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)Gov. Jeff Landry is voicing a change of heart regarding the Solar for All program, launched under President Joe Biden to provide cleaner power and reduce electric bills for some 900,000 low-income Americans.
After his administration initially supported plans for the $156 million given to Louisiana in April 2024 – and dubbed the state’s initiative Solar for Y’all – the governor now considers the program a “green pipe dream” of the left that he says would bleed taxpayers and drive up electricity rates.
The Trump administration announced last week it was ending the $7 billion Solar for All program. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin claimed in a social media post Friday that Congress “eliminated” the Solar for All program in Republicans’ recent tax and spending law, labeling it a “grift” from which middlemen have profited with very few projects have materialized.  
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Until Zeldin’s announcement, the Landry administration seemed fully onboard with the program. It saw the money as another pool of federal resources to put into storm resiliency and energy infrastructure. 
On Monday, however, the governor quickly turned against Solar for All. 
Landry took to social media to criticize the program and made similar comments when the Illuminator asked what he would say to Louisiana companies and community organizations that have already invested in the initiative.
“The left’s green schemes have only resulted in higher bills, weaker grids, and more debt,” Landry said Wednesday through a spokesperson. “Thanks to the leadership of President Trump and Administrator Zeldin we are ending wasteful spending and putting America first.” 

 The only thing that’s driven your electricity bills through the roof is the Democrat Party. Period. End of story.
From Obama’s unconstitutional Clean Power Plan… to the fantasyland Green New Deal… to Biden’s $156 million Louisiana “Solar for All” giveaway – every single…
— Governor Jeff Landry (@LAGovJeffLandry) August 11, 2025

There’s no data to back up the governor’s claims because Solar for Y’all projects have yet to take shape. Although the federal funds had been allocated to Louisiana, the state was still in the process of creating its program when Trump halted the grant with an executive order shortly after taking office in January. 
The governor’s current stance on Solar for All contrasts starkly with praise his administration had for the program last year.  
Tyler Gray, Landry’s handpicked secretary of the Department of Energy and Natural Resources, described Solar for All as a unique opportunity to build backup power systems in areas of the state at high risk from hurricanes and severe storms.
“Louisiana is in a uniquely positioned to benefit from this federal investment, with so much of its population in the areas of highest risk for devastating storms, such as Hurricanes Ida and Laura in recent years, that create widespread and long-lasting power outages,” Gray stated in an April 22, 2024 news release.
Backups for storm power outages in question
Created under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, Solar for All has spurred major investments in traditional and clean energy production in Republican-controlled states. The solar grants, one of many components of the law, provided funding to state agencies, municipalities, tribal governments and nonprofit organizations to deliver affordable energy to low-income households. 
The Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources was among its 60 grant recipients. A portion of its $156 million was slotted to pay for solar panels on single-family homes and small multifamily units, with the goal of helping residents save a minimum of 20% on their utility bills. Paired with battery storage systems, the household solar arrays were intended to reduce household grid dependence during peak electricity demand. 
Solar for Y’all also planned to offer low-interest loans for community solar projects, which provide neighborhood-level emergency backup power and can sell extra electricity to the larger grid.
Gray expressed support for using the federal money for these local solar hubs, which would help communities avoid long power outages after hurricanes and other severe weather. In 2021, the average Louisiana utility customer experienced more than 80 hours of power outages as a result of extreme weather, compared with a national average of seven hours, according to the Department of Energy and Natural Resources.
“Through this program, Louisiana can create a sustainable foundation for long-term impact and benefit for those most threatened and most in need,” Gray said last year.
Local solar hubs have already gained traction. The nonprofit civic and church coalition Together Louisiana has so far helped develop 15 “community lighthouses” and envisions more than 80 total around the state. Its idea caught on in 2021 after many household gas and diesel generators ran out of fuel or broke down in the wake of Hurricane Ida. The initiative is funded with a mix of federal, state, local and private dollars.  
One such “lighthouse” is at a Catholic convent in New Orleans East, where the Sisters of the Holy Family operate one for the surrounding neighborhood and want to build a separate, larger-scale community “solar garden” on an adjacent tract of land. The solar garden, which is slightly smaller than a solar farm, would deliver power to about 700 nearby homes in the low-income area. 
The nuns were counting on a loan from Solar for Y’all to help pay for their $15 million project, according to Nathalie Jordi, a New Orleans hotel owner who is helping develop the project. With planning completed and construction contracts secured, the convent was likely going to be the program’s pilot project, she said. 
“This kinda pulls out the rug from all of us,” Jordi said. “It’s definitely a stressful time.”
The nuns have been able to find financing elsewhere and are on track to close their loan this month.
Economic models expected the $156 million in federal funding would be paired with roughly $74 million in private capital, according to the Louisiana Clean Energy Fund, a nonprofit grant subrecipient that was going to manage solar program loans. The Gulf States Renewable Energy Industries Association estimated the $156 million in federal money would yield a total economic impact between $468 million and $780 million in Louisiana.

Louisiana could keep federal dollars
Although the Trump administration claims Solar for All was repealed, Congress rescinded only the funds that had not been obligated at the time the One Big Beautiful Bill was approved, according to lawyers with the program. 
The Congressional Budget Office analyzed the legislation’s fiscal impact at the time and determined only $19 million was still uncommitted. The vast majority of the Solar for All funds, including the $156 million slated for Louisiana, was already allocated through contracts with the grant recipients.
Attorneys for nonprofit groups invested in the program are urging grant recipients to enforce those contracts. 
Jillian Blanchard, an attorney with the advocacy group Lawyers for Good Government, said language in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is very clear – it does not touch obligated funds. The Trump administration knows it would probably lose in court, so they make these shocking announcements just to try to scare the grant recipients into folding, she said. 
“This is legally completely unfounded what they’re doing,” Blanchard said. “It’s really, really important for states, no matter their political leanings, to protect the rule of law …This should not be a political analysis by the state. This should be pure economics.”
Blanchard said Louisiana could easily keep the money if Gov. Landry wanted it. The state has just less than three weeks left to file a legal challenge against the EPA’s decision, she said. 
If the state refuses to act, Blanchard said grant subrecipients could mount their own legal challenges against the Trump administration. 
“They’re setting a terrible precedent right now for businesses and industries,” she said. “If this [president] does not stand by its contracts and promises … complete markets are created and ruined by these types of things. … For people who care about this, now’s the time to make their voices heard.”

(Provided/Mac Stone, Southwings)GEORGETOWN — Santee Cooper can’t dump scalding water into a Georgetown river as part of a legal settlement with Lowcountry conservation groups.
Santee Cooper will also provide $250,000 to conservation group Open Space Institute to buy land preserving habitat for federally endangered sturgeons that would have been harmed if the utility had followed through with dumping hot water into the river, according to the settlement agreement.
“The North Santee River will have increased protection against super-heated water, and endangered fish get permanent habitat protection that will endure long after the aging coal plant finally retires,” Nick Torrey, an attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, which represented the conservation groups in the case, said in a statement.
The state-owned utility asked the state’s environmental agency in 2021 for permission to dump water reaching temperatures as high as 115 degrees Fahrenheit into the North Santee River from its coal-fired electric power generating station in Georgetown, according to a permit application. It was approved, but environmental groups immediately sued in the Administrative Law Court.
Under the agreement that went into effect this month, Santee Cooper will not dump water into the river above 100 degrees during the summer and 95 during the rest of the year. If the utility exceeds that limit, it will pay a fine to the Open Space Institute for further conservation efforts. The punishment is $5,000 for every day the temperature is above limits, according to the agreement provided to the Daily Gazette.
SC utility seeks to upgrade powerline through ancient cypress forest

The proposed temperature was far above the previous maximum temperature of 98 degrees, which the utility has followed since 2000. Although the utility never exceeded that temperature, the temperature limit hobbled power generation, Santee Cooper argued in filings to the Administrative Law Court, which handles disputes with agencies.
Santee Cooper sends its hot water into a cooling pond, where it sits until reaching the maximum temperature. Contaminants in the water can wear down the utility’s equipment over time, requiring the station burn more coal to produce the same amount of power, according to the filings.
The utility also raised concerns about the cooling pond overflowing during heavy rains. If employees can’t dump the water often enough, polluted water could overflow into nearby Turkey Creek, according to the utility’s legal filings.
Lowcountry conservation groups Winyah River Alliance and the Coastal Conservation League pushed back, saying warmer water would harm the local population of Atlantic and shortnose sturgeons that travel and forage in the river. The Department of Environmental Services dropped the maximum temperature on the permit to 110 degrees last year, but conservationists contended that was still too high.
Hot water can harm endangered species of sturgeon that travel up and down the North Santee River, an expert hired by the conservation groups said. When temperatures reach above 86 degrees Fahrenheit, some species of sturgeon go into distress, causing them to stop foraging for food or traveling along the river, wrote Boyd Kynard, a Massachusetts-based fish researcher.
Sturgeons usually return to the same feeding and mating spots throughout generations. When a river becomes unusable, including because the water has gotten too warm, many fish never find a new place to eat or mate, Kynard wrote.
Surges of hot water can also kill the fish outright. While traveling upstream, the sturgeons typically stay out of the dumping zone, but they swim straight through it on the way downstream. A sudden stream of 110-degree water in a migrating sturgeon’s path could kill it, Kynard wrote.
The settlement brought the maximum temperature to a level conservationists were satisfied would protect the endangered fish, as well as others that live in the river, said Faith Rivers James, executive director of the Coastal Conservation League, in a statement following the settlement.
“The Atlantic and Shortnose sturgeon are ancient species that for millennia have been part of the Santee River watershed,” James said. “This agreement is a significant conservation outcome for this river’s wildlife, helping to preserve the unique ecosystem of the Santee River Delta that they depend on.”
Water above 104 degrees can be dangerous for people as well, especially children, pregnant women and the elderly, the conservation groups argued. If Santee Cooper drained 110-degree water straight into the river, that could burn swimmers, kayakers and crabbers who frequent the nearby boat ramp, according to their legal filings.
The conservation groups couldn’t prove the river’s water would reach dangerous temperatures for fish or humans, Santee Cooper responded. State officials who reviewed the application determined the increase would have little impact on the sturgeons in the river, the utility said in its own court filings.
Other solutions to the cooling problems the conservation groups proposed were not feasible, either for practical reasons or because they would be too expensive, the utility argued.
“Cost-effectiveness is a heavy consideration as operational costs are borne by ratepayers, as Santee Cooper is a public utility and not for profit,” the utility’s legal filings read.
The utility was pleased with the agreed upon changes to its permit, spokeswoman Emily Tyner said in an email.
The new permit “allows us the operational flexibility and regulatory certainty necessary to continue to provide low-cost, reliable power to South Carolinians, as we have done at Winyah for decades,” Tyner said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MacStone_240815_1382-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-14 07:58:07.915620

Earl Harris, Jr., D-East Chicago, speaks at a gathering with other Indiana lawmakers and Texas House Democrats in Chicago. (Courtesy of Indiana House Democrats)A half-dozen Indiana House Democrats met with their Texas colleagues Wednesday in Chicago to oppose unprecedented mid-cycle redistricting efforts, a process that typically occurs once in a decade. Earlier that same day, national nonpartisan election advocates softened their uniform opposition to gerrymandering, saying they recognized the “wide-reaching crisis in our democracy.”
Rep. Ed DeLaney, of Indianapolis, likened the effort to “congressional-level shoplifting.”
The nation’s top elected leader, President Donald Trump, has pressured GOP-led states to redraw the boundaries of their congressional districts in the hopes of keeping the slim Republican majority, starting with Texas. Republicans in the Lone Star State unveiled maps that could net their party an additional five seats but many House Democrats fled to Illinois, preventing the maps from advancing. 
Vice President JD Vance traveled to Indiana last week to make a personal redistricting pitch to Gov. Mike Braun and Republican legislative leaders, who haven’t publicly committed to moving forward.     

 
 

“Never in my life, did I think that the vice president of the United States would come to my state and ask our legislature to shoplift congressional districts; to steal them off of the shelf, run outside and wave them in front of the whole country,” said DeLaney. “We cannot have this kind of conduct.”
He noted that former House Speaker Brian Bosma, a Republican, has shared his opposition to redistricting, telling the Indiana Capital Chronicle earlier this week it was in “bad form.” DeLaney openly wondered if Indiana Republicans would simply revisit redistricting every time they lost a seat in Congress. 
Texas Rep. Gene Wu, the minority leader, accused Republicans of trying “to cheat, to rig the system so they can stay in power” and using the “D.C. swamp” to dictate state-level elections.
“… we have heard from California; we have heard from New York; we have heard from Illinois that people are ready to stand up,” said Wu. “People are ready to fight back.”
Republicans hold seven of Indiana’s nine congressional seats while Democrats control districts in Indianapolis and northwestern Indiana. 
Rep. Earl Harris, Jr.’s East Chicago seat sits within that latter congressional district and he said, “My job is to help the people I represent, not the guy in Washington D.C.”
“My district has a big population of Blacks and Latinos. Why are we disenfranchising the voters of Black and brown people who choose who we want to represent us?” Harris asked. “… Texas is here not only fighting for Texas. They’re fighting for Indiana; they’re fighting for Illinois. They’re fighting for states all over this country.
“It is important that we representatives from the State of Indiana show up and show them that we have their back.”
 Standards for mid-cycle redistricting

Earlier that afternoon, national advocates with Common Cause detailed their own set of standards for redistricting while warning that the country was sliding into authoritarianism. Though previously against gerrymandering in all forms — including those potentially occurring in blue states to counter the actions of Texas — the organization softened its stance.

“The political situation we find ourselves in is unlike anything we have seen before in modern history. What President Trump and his supporters have done in Texas is straight out of an authoritarian playbook,” said Virginia Solomón, the president and CEO of Common Cause. 
The nonpartisan organization has long been a key player on the national scene when it comes to redistricting, filing lawsuits in various states to challenge allegedly unfair maps filed by both Republicans and Democrats. One such challenge made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that it had no role in policing partisan gerrymandering.
Common Cause has laid out six ways to evaluate the fairness of mid-cycle redistricting: 

Whether the process is proportional, meaning the process “should be a targeted response proportional to the threat posed … in other states.”
Whether the process included “meaningful” public participation. 
Whether the maps were drawn in a way that is racially equitable and don’t “dilute the political voice” of communities of color.
Whether leaders “publicly endorse the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.” The federal bills would ban mid-decade redistricting and partisan gerrymandering.
Whether leaders endorse independent redistricting, or citizen-led, independent redistricting commissions as a long-term solution.
Whether the maps are time-limited, meaning that “Any new redistricting maps must expire following the 2030 Census.”

The organization has vowed to oppose maps that don’t meet the criteria.
“…We’re not acquiescing. I think we’re just being realists in this moment. We can have a purist mentality and say all gerrymandering is bad — which is where we actually stand — but we also recognize the political moment that we are in,” said Solomón. “… Common Cause has not shifted, the landscape has. And we will continue to hold true to our values in this political upheaval, but we refuse to carry the water for any political party.”

Day is a kindergarten teacher at Hillsboro Primary School during the academic year, but has spent her break as a summer school teacher and mentor while also preparing for the upcoming school year.
She said one of the misconceptions about being a teacher is that they have the entire summer off. In reality, Day doesn’t have the opportunity to take much of a break outside of the weeks that bookend summer school activities.
“That’s only for four weeks off, which is what most people get off for vacation,” Day said.
Though she loves her job, Day said it can be frustrating.
Missouri had a total teacher turnover rate of 14.6% during the 2023-24 school year, according to a May 2025 report led by Cameron Anglum, a researcher affiliated with St. Louis University’s PRiME Center. That’s more than double the national average of 7% during the same school year, according to research organization RAND.
Anglum defines total teacher turnover as teachers switching districts within Missouri and teachers leaving Missouri public education altogether. He said both the pandemic and the years following were rough for teachers as online accommodations were limited and the ensuing global inflation made teacher salaries even more dismal by comparison.
“You mix all of those things together, and it was an enormously difficult two- or three-year period for teachers,” Anglum said. “Teaching in general is an enormously difficult profession, but over the pandemic, working conditions worsened pretty significantly.”
The National Education Association ranks Missouri as the 49th state in the nation in both average teacher starting salary and average educator salary, as of the 2023-24 school year. As teacher turnover rates remain high, Anglum said the pressure of filling in the gaps weighs on educators and school districts.
“When schools see an increase in teachers leaving, that places a much larger burden on recruiting new teachers, and we often don’t have the supply of new teachers to fill those vacant positions,” Anglum said.
As issues with teacher retention and recruitment continue, the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and the state legislature have implemented policies to improve teacher pay before classes begin next month.
During the 2024 legislative session, lawmakers passed Senate Bill 727, which requires the minimum salary for teachers to increase from $25,000 to $40,000 for the 2025-26 school year, with a minimum salary of $46,000 for educators with master’s degrees and at least ten years of experience.
“This hopefully will be part of one of several strategies that will help us get more qualified teachers into the field and keep the ones that we have,” said Kari Monsees, former deputy commissioner of the Division of Administrative and Financial Services at DESE, who retired in June.
To facilitate this, lawmakers created and have provided funding for an initiative known as the Teacher Baseline Salary Grant Program. While these grants existed before, the same legislation that implemented higher minimum teacher salaries also created the formal program that will provide school districts paying wages below the minimum with funding to comply with the new state policy.
While the intent is good, some experts said the grant program could cause uncertainty for continued funding in future school years.
Caitlin Whaley is the senior director of advocacy and governmental relations for the Missouri School Boards’ Association. Whaley said that because the grant is subject to annual state appropriations that are not mandated by law, it may not be a reliable funding stream.
“We certainly appreciate that the legislature is willing to put their money where their mouth is and fund that program, but it’s just hard to rely on it year over year, when you don’t know when that funding could potentially not be renewed,” she said.
Rebeka McIntosh, president of the Missouri National Education Association and a former educator, said that increasing the teacher salary and funding certain aspects of education like transportation and the foundation formula is a good first step, but it’s the bare minimum. She said the state also made several cuts and withholdings for educational programs recently.
“Those have direct impact on our public school classrooms, and that is of great concern,” she said. “To say we need to recruit, retain, and then to cut the legs off from underneath … that will then fall again onto districts to find some sort of avenue to have to Scotch tape it together again, and our students deserve better.”
Even more, Todd Fuller, spokesperson for Missouri State Teachers Association, said the increase in minimum salary still leaves Missouri behind its neighboring states, which have also been increasing the minimum salaries for their educators.
“It’s felt like a battle to try to get us to a point where teachers are adequately compensated and we’ve finally gotten to a starting salary of $40,000, [but] the frustrating part of that is when you look at us and all the states bordering Missouri, we’re still last,” Fuller said. “Just as soon as we increase that salary, everybody else has increased their salary, and it keeps us still toward the bottom of starting salaries.”
While organizations like MSTA have been advocating for an increase in the minimum salary, Fuller said the results of an annual survey from the group show that the reason for high teacher turnover rates is not entirely because of pay, though it is a contributing factor for some.
“Salary is not the number one reason that teachers are leaving,” Fuller said. “Teachers are leaving because of discipline issues. They’re leaving because of unrealistic expectations for classroom management, especially when they don’t have backing from the administration.”
As an educator for 30 years, Aimee Epley, a kindergarten teacher at Hillsboro Primary School, feels that those outside of education may not realize the challenges that teachers face in their profession.
“I think they think that we’re glorified babysitters, so they don’t feel that pay is low because they don’t have an understanding of what we actually do,” Epley said. “Once you have somebody come in and observe, people are in awe of how a classroom is handled and ran.”
As rewarding as her career has been, Epley was relieved when her daughter didn’t pursue work in education despite being interested in that vocation.
“I knew she had the heart of a teacher. I was afraid of that, because I didn’t want her to be a teacher, because I didn’t want her to struggle financially in ways I have had to struggle,” Epley said.
Still, Epley remains hopeful for the future of education.
“I think we’re going to be on a struggle bus for a while, and then I think it’ll eventually swing back,” Epley said. “I don’t think there’s a point where we’re not appreciated for the job we do. I [just] don’t think we’re fiscally supported for the job that we do.”

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.


This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

(Photo by Minnesota Reformer)The Minnesota Department of Education notified Minneapolis Public Schools that it’s in violation of state and federal law for overidentifying Black students in the category of “developmental cognitive disability” for the past three years. 
The notification is part of an annual review process conducted by the state, as required by federal law, to determine what’s known as “disproportionality” in special education. The review compares identification, placement and discipline for students with disabilities across racial groups.
Disproportionality is particularly concerning for Black families and their children because they are more likely to be identified in disability categories that are socially stigmatized, like developmental cognitive disabilities or emotional behavior disorder. Students placed in these categories are often placed in separate classrooms or schools, which may limit their access to rigorous coursework, electives and other opportunities open to students without disabilities. 
Under federal law, the district is now required to set aside 15% of its federal special education funds to address the disparities through a process called coordinated early intervention services, or CEIS. Using $1.2 million from its federal special education funds, the district’s plan must provide services to students without disabilities to prevent overidentification in the future.
The district has selected six elementary schools that account for a substantial part of the disproportionate identification. One position will be added at each school. 
MDE has also notified the district that it’s at risk of violations in two other categories. For the past two years, Black students with disabilities in the district have been suspended, expelled or otherwise removed from school for disciplinary issues at more than three times the rate of other students with disabilities. And, in the 2023-24 school year, Black students with disabilities were suspended for more than 10 days more than three times as often as other students with disabilities.
The district will hire one person who will assist nine elementary schools — which the district didn’t identify — with student behavior to reduce disproportionate suspension of Black students with disabilities.
“I’m almost embarrassed that we needed to wait for MDE to tell us we needed to come up with a plan,” said Kim Ellison, vice chair, during a board meeting Tuesday. “My guess is these numbers aren’t new.”
Ellison was on the school board when the district entered voluntary agreements with the federal Office of Civil Rights in 2014 and the state Department of Human Rights in 2018 to address disproportionately high suspension rates for Black students.
In 2023, the state began requiring districts to notify the public when they reach mandatory CEIS status, even though MDE itself does not report on its website when districts have been notified of the CEIS violations. MDE notifies districts of disproportionality in special education annually, around March.
The most recent federal data show that in the 2020-21 school year, 31% of Minnesota school districts had been identified for significant disproportionality in special education. This is the third highest of all fifty states, behind only Wyoming and Rhode Island.
Audit critical of special education services
Separately, the school board on Tuesday discussed an audit that found the district is failing students who need extra help by not providing instruction and support they need to meet grade-level academic standards. 
The special education audit was conducted by the Council of Great City Schools at the request of Superintendent Lisa Sayles-Adams. The district received the 178-page final report five months ago, but it was shared with just a few district leaders. The report has been circulating among district families and advocates in recent weeks, and the district recently shared the report with the public in advance of a school board discussion. 
The report focuses on the district’s failure to use what’s known as a multi-tiered systems of support, or MTSS, a framework commonly used by school districts to identify students who need additional academic or behavior support. When implemented correctly, district staff would review student data regularly to identify students needing support; determine appropriate supports for students; review data on the impact of the supports; and adapt supports as necessary. The review cycle can also highlight district-wide issues that need addressing.
The MTSS framework is most effective when all students have access to high-quality instructional practices in regular classrooms. This is known as “Tier 1” or “core instruction” under the MTSS framework. Additional support will be less effective without effective core instruction. 
Many of the district’s classrooms lack high-quality instruction, and regular classroom instruction “is often far below grade level standards,” according to the report. 
Many of the district’s teachers are in the middle of two years of intensive training to improve how they teach reading, as required by the state law known as the READ Act. The district also adopted a new literacy curriculum for early elementary students. The hope is that the additional training and new curriculum leads to improved academic outcomes. 
Dr. Liz Keenan, who joined the district at the end of June in the newly created role as associate superintendent of special education and student support services, said the district has recently made some progress in improving academic outcomes for students with disabilities, particularly elementary students. She attributed the success to a new literacy curriculum and teacher training in elementary schools.
Board Director Greta Callahan challenged this assertion and attributed the improving academic outcomes to class size caps and higher educator pay that started with the collective bargaining agreements Callahan helped negotiate as teachers union president in 2022.
There is no similar professional development initiative for mathematics, where student proficiency also lags behind state averages. The district has implemented new math curriculum for elementary, middle and high schools in recent years, however. 
“There is an increased sense of urgency to provide (professional development) for both veteran and new teachers who have insufficient understanding of mathematics content, pedagogical content knowledge and require support to deliver core instruction to all students in inclusive classrooms,” the report says.
Board Director Joyner Emerick questioned why the audit shows no review of “specially designed instruction,” which is modification to regular instruction to meet the unique needs of students identified for special education.
“Why is it absent? Because it is absent,” Keenan said. 
Keenan said the district lacks a well-defined process around specially designed instruction. 
In response to the audit, the district has created a new central office position, executive director of MTSS, and is currently trying to hire someone for the role.
Board member Lori Norvell expressed concern about whether the district should use MTSS in its schools. She recalled her previous experience as a district math specialist and middle school math teacher working under MTSS.
“I don’t know how it’s supporting them [students] and not a burden on our adults who are working with our most vulnerable kids,” Norvell said.
MTSS interventions are not the same as special education and do not replace special education services, but for some students effective MTSS services may prevent the need for special education. Because Minneapolis Public Schools lacks consistent and adequate MTSS services across its schools, many parents — sometimes at the behest of teachers — request special education evaluations because they view this as the only way to get students the academic and behavioral support they need.
The report also identifies district problems with staff professional development. The district doesn’t make it mandatory, doesn’t commit enough time to it and doesn’t differentiate professional development based on educator needs. 
The district also lacks a structure to support so-called positive behavior intervention for students whose behavior interferes with academics. The absence of behavior support is at least partly to blame for the disproportionate use of suspensions to discipline Black and American Indian students without disabilities, according to the audit.
The district has implemented “procedural safeguards” to limit the use of suspensions for students with disabilities when their disabilities are related to their behavior. Because of this, students with disabilities are suspended at half the rate of students without disabilities. 
On average, Black and American Indian students without disabilities are around four times as likely as other students to be suspended for one to 10 days. Black students without disabilities are 15 times more likely to be suspended for more than 10 days.
The district lacks internal processes to regularly review this data, determine its root causes, and develop and implement plans to reduce these disparities, according to the audit. This applies to discipline data as well as data related to absenteeism and placement of special education students in separate classrooms or schools.
The audit shows about a quarter of elementary students with disabilities miss more than 10 days of school. For middle school students with disabilities this rate rises to about a third. By high school, nearly 4 in 10 students with disabilities miss more than 10 days of school each year.
An analysis of district data also shows that the district disproportionately assigns students receiving special education services to restrictive settings. Under federal law, special education students are entitled to receive education in the least restrictive environment. Overuse of restrictive placements is a violation of students’ rights. 
The audit also finds that once students are assigned to specialized classrooms or separate schools, there does not appear to be a regular pathway back to more inclusive educational settings.
Keenan told the board that the district can improve special education by providing students with disabilities more access to general education classrooms. 
The audit also describes dysfunctional district administration: Key staff members fail to collaborate, and important policies are not documented. The report includes at least a dozen references to policy and procedure documents that the auditors were unable to review because they were password protected. The auditors said many of the documents should be readily accessible to the public, as well as the district’s employees, to bring transparency to policies and procedures.
The CEIS notification and audit come amid significant fiscal challenges, which will likely limit the district’s ability to respond to the audit’s findings. The district closed a $75 million budget deficit for the upcoming school year by making significant cuts to central office staff, and continues to rely on its dwindling reserves to balance its budget. In the next budget cycle, the district anticipates needing to cut at least $25 million, a figure that could increase if federal funding is reduced.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MinneapolisSchool_1-1068x712-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-14 07:58:07.915620

(Getty Images)A federal judge has rejected several New Jersey parents’ claims that the state’s practice of retaining blood samples from its mandatory newborn disease screening program violates their constitutional rights.
U.S. District Court Judge Georgette Castner dismissed a lawsuit, first filed in 2023, that sought to stop the state from storing leftover “blood spots,” which hospitals take by pricking the heels of newborns, for uses beyond disease detection.
Castner agreed in her Friday ruling that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees parents’ right to the care, custody, and control of their children, but she declined to extend parental rights “to the mere retention of residual dried blood spots.” Such storage is not a “medical choice,” as the parents argued, so it doesn’t violate their right to direct the medical care of their children under the Fourteenth Amendment, she added.
The parents who sued — Erica and Jeremiah Jedynak of Boonton and Hannah Lovaglio of Cranbury — also failed to prove that they have a possessory interest in their children’s blood spots under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures, Castner added.
While state law requires authorities to obtain informed consent before taking someone’s genetic material, the statute has several exclusions, including for the newborn disease screening program, the judge said.
She also pointed to legislation now stalled in Trenton that would limit law enforcement’s use of DNA samples taken from newborns and crime victims.
“The fact that there is legislation regarding the retention of genetic information in the state of New Jersey in relation to the newborn screening program persuades this court, even more so, that such issues are better suited for public debate and legislative action and that judicial restraint is proper,” Castner wrote.
Castner gave the parents 30 days to respond to her ruling and warned that her dismissal would be final if they do not respond.
Robert Frommer, the attorney who represents the parents, said they disagree with Castner’s decision and will respond.
The judge largely focused on the blood spots’ retention in her ruling, rather than the initial blood-taking, but hospitals have not gotten voluntary informed consent from parents for either of those things, Frommer said.
“We fully believe that taking children’s blood without parental consent and then holding on to it for God knows how long is a violation of New Jerseyans’ constitutional rights,” Frommer said.
It’s “bizarre” to conclude that people don’t have a possessory interest in their own blood, he added.
“If parents have the right to direct the medical care of their children, that means you have to ask them for permission to take their blood. And that also means that they have a right to say what you can do with that blood. ‘Sure, you can use it to test for diseases for my kid, but no, you can’t hold on to it forever for scientific research,’” Frommer said.
The case stems from a discovery the state Office of the Public Defender made in 2022 that state police used a baby’s stored blood spot to charge the child’s father with a crime. The office and the New Jersey Monitor filed a separate lawsuit after learning the state retained such spots for 23 years without informing parents that they were stored and how they might be used. The Institute for Justice, the Virginia-based public interest nonprofit law firm where Frommer works, joined the cause in 2023.
The lawsuits drove the state attorney general’s office to agree last summer to shorten retention to two years for healthy babies and 10 years for newborns who test positive for disease. Officials also revamped the program’s public messaging, set new limits on how blood spots could be used (although they did not bar their use by law enforcement), and agreed to destroy all previously stored blood spots of children older than age 2. That destruction began in November, and the state reported that over 60% of such spots have been destroyed since then, according to Castner’s ruling.
But the parents refused to drop their lawsuit because they said the state’s concessions fell short of what they sought — voluntary, informed consent before any blood draws and the destruction of all blood spots immediately after disease screening. Absent that, they want the state to shift to an opt-in policy, in which parents would have to agree to spot storage, rather than the current approach that mandates retention and only permits parents with religious objections to opt out.
They will continue to fight for that “gold standard” of a policy, Frommer said.
“Even if seizing the blood to test the kid for diseases is reasonable, once that’s done, the state doesn’t have any further justification to hold on to the blood,” Frommer said. “To do so is constitutionally unreasonable.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin could be facing a more difficult budget than it has seen in recent years with recently approved spending and tax cuts consuming most of the state’s historic surplus, according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum.
The research organization described the state’s most recent budget as an “all of the above” plan in its recent report. Mark Sommerhauser, communications director and policy researcher at the Wisconsin Policy Forum, said the previous budgets showed more restraint from policymakers when it came to spending and tax cuts. 
“There were some tax cuts, there were some spending increases, but certainly not of the magnitude that could have occurred,” Sommerhauser told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview. “In this budget, we saw a lot more of both.”
Sommerhauser said it was “clearly a budget that was much more focused on the here and now than on where the state’s finances would be in two or four years.”
“There’s an argument that ‘hey, this money should be returned, either back to taxpayers or spent on programs that benefit our state’s residents, rather than just sitting in the general fund,” Sommerhauser added. “That’s what policymakers opted to do with this budget.”
The $111 billion state budget passed by the state Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Tony Evers in early July increased spending by 7.7% — an increase of $3.3 billion — allocating $46 billion to fund a number of priorities.
The budget also included more than $1 billion in tax cuts over the next two years. 
One major cut comes from a change to Wisconsin’s income tax brackets. The new budget expands the state’s second tax bracket, with a 4.4% tax rate, and shrinks the third bracket, which has a 5.3% rate. Wisconsin residents on average will see a $188 cut per filer — affecting more than 1.5 million tax returns. Sommerhauser described the change as a “modest but still notable income tax cut for almost everybody that has some degree of income tax liability, except those folks that have very, very little.” The change will cost the state about $320 million in each year of the budget.
The second major cut created an exemption from income taxes for the first $24,000 for single filers over 67 and $48,000 in retirement income for married filers over 67.
The new state spending in the budget covers an array of priorities including over $500 million for special education, over $80 million in state general purpose revenue for the University of Wisconsin system, over $380 million for wage increases for state employees and additional funding for child care.
Most Republican lawmakers voted for the budget apart from four Senate Republicans and one GOP Assembly member, celebrating the tax cuts as well as some of the investments in the budget and hailing it as a compromise. Most Democrats voted against the final proposal, saying it inadequately invested in education, child care and other priorities, though five Senate and seven Assembly Democrats joined Republicans in support.
With this budget, the state has now used most of the surplus that has formed the backdrop for the last few budgets. The surplus, Sommerhauser said, was mostly the result of federal pandemic aid and was also created in part by an increase in tax revenue, especially through the sales tax, as a result of inflation. At one point the surplus had grown to over $6 billion. 
“[A large surplus is] not business as usual in Wisconsin,” Sommerhauser said. “More often you see the opposite. You see shortfalls that lawmakers are having to scramble to figure out a way to bridge.”
Sommerhauser said that with the smaller reserves, the next budget is likely “going to be kind of coming back to Earth.”
By July 1 2027, Wisconsin’s general fund balance is projected to be $770.5 million — a drop of about $3.6 billion and the lowest balance since 2018. The state will also have $2.1 billion in its rainy day fund.
This leaves Wisconsin with a projected $2.8 billion in its reserves — about 11% of Wisconsin’s net general fund appropriations in fiscal year 2027, Sommerhauser said.
“That’s certainly not disastrous. It’s not cataclysmic at all. It is more than the state has had in reserve for many years prior to the pandemic,” Sommerhauser said. “Of course, it’s a lot less than the last couple of budgets here.”
Wisconsin isn’t the only state to be on this trajectory. At its annual summit in early August, the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) gave an overview of state budgets and asked whether it is time for states to “tighten the belt.”
Erica MacKellar, program principal of NCSL’s Fiscal Affairs Program, said during the presentation that, overall, states ended fiscal year 2025 in a “fairly strong position.” Looking back to the pandemic, she said state revenues didn’t take as big a hit as they were initially expecting. 
“As states recovered, they unexpectedly saw these big revenue surpluses, and that was due to a number of factors, including the large amount of aid that the federal government sent to states,” MacKeller said. “Revenue growth jumped to around 15%, but states always knew that that level of growth was really unsustainable, and have been really planning for a return to normal of state revenue growth and a revenue slowdown that I think we’re seeing now.” 
MacKeller said that prior to the pandemic, state year-end balances as a percentage of state spending were about 10% on average — an increase from the low of about 4% during the Great Recession.
“In fiscal year 2023, after we saw those record surpluses, that percentage soared to over 30%, and now that number has started to come back down,” MacKeller said. “The preliminary average from our survey shows about 16[%] for fiscal year 2025, so that’s putting most states on pretty firm footing at this point.” 
Sommerhauser said the bigger issue now is that Wisconsin is spending more than it brings in through taxes — creating a projected structural deficit. He said it’s something policymakers will have to grapple with in the coming years.
Under the new budget, the state’s general fund will spend about $24.4 billion and bring in $23.1 billion in tax revenues in 2027. The projected gap “would be one of the largest of the past generation,” according to the Wisconsin Policy Forum.
The state could use the reserves for the additional spending, but it wouldn’t be a long-term solution, Sommerhauser said. 
“The state can do that on a one-time basis if it’s got a bunch of money in the bank, which it does right now,” Sommerhauser said. “The issue with that is that you can only spend that money in the bank one time.”
If spending and revenue remain the same, Wisconsin would have an imbalance of -$727 million and an imbalance of -$1.4 billion by the end of 2028-29, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. 
Sommerhauser noted that unlike the federal government, Wisconsin can’t run a huge deficit year after year. The state constitution requires lawmakers pass and the governor sign a balanced budget.
“The state can do these things, whether it’s drawing money out of reserves or sometimes there are other little tricks that the state can kind of pull out of its hat on a one-time basis,” Sommerhauser said. But, he added, “if your ongoing revenues are significantly out of alignment with your ongoing tax revenues, you’re gonna have a headache to deal with every two years, and you’re setting yourself up to have some really challenging budgets that could eventually make you have to do something really, really painful — whether it’s a big tax increase or some sort of big spending cut.”










If your ongoing revenues are significantly out of alignment with your ongoing tax revenues, you're gonna have a headache to deal with every two years. . .


– Mark Sommerhauser, Wisconsin Policy Forum


Sommerhauser said the Great Recession was the point in recent memory when the state dealt with the greatest budget shortfalls.
“There were some significant tax increases that were put into place in 2009, when we had Democratic controlled state government,” Sommerhauser said. During the 2009-2010 budget (the last time there was a Democratic trifecta), former Gov. Jim Doyle and the Legislature created a new tax bracket of 7.75% on married couples filing jointly with taxable income above $300,000 to help close the budget gap the state was facing. The state’s highest bracket is currently 7.65%.
“You had the big election in 2010 where everything flipped, and then you have Gov. [Scott] Walker and Act 10, and everything happening in 2011 which brought about some really large spending cuts in the state,” Sommerhauser said. At the time, Walker’s administration was projecting the state would have a $3.6 billion deficit and the Republican trifecta took the route of drastically cutting public employee benefits to address it.
“We obviously are hopeful that we’re not going to see a recession again anytime soon… but this is our best sort of attempt to give a sense of what the Legislature might be needing to grapple with in two years,” Sommerhauser said.
The partisan composition of Wisconsin’s state government could also look quite different by the next budget. 
Evers announced that he won’t be running for reelection just a few weeks after wrapping up the 2025-27 state budget, making the 2026 election the first open race since 2010.
The Republican and Democratic fields of candidates are still shaping up. Some of the announced candidates have made comments signaling what they would like to see from a budget. 
Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, the first Democratic candidate in the race, has said she would invest additional state funding in Wisconsin’s schools. Republican Washington Co. Executive Josh Schoemann has said the recent budget spends too much and is taxing people too much. Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is still considering a run, noted the potential deficit on social media when he said that Wisconsin “must change course before we end up like MN and IL.” 
The state Senate and Assembly will also be up for grabs in 2026.
Sommerhauser said it’s likely the next governor and state Legislature could be dealing with a challenging state budget, though it’s still unclear how challenging.  
“If economic growth is really strong for the next two years, we could be in a position where we have a projected shortfall, but it’s quite manageable… That’s kind of the best case scenario,” Sommerhauser said. “Worst case scenario is if we would see a recession in the next couple of years, that could be setting us up for a very challenging budget.”

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.

Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States ‘in a very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
Amid federal economic uncertainty, Maine ends fiscal year with $152 million surplus

That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.

Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.










We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw


New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

Hill died last month of cancer in his home state of Alabama. He's survived by 10 of the Black 14.
The post Remembering Ron Hill, one of the University of Wyoming Black 14 appeared first on WyoFile .","The University of Wyoming football team hosted the Arizona Wildcats in the first game of the 1969 season. It was college football’s centennial year, and 20,000 fans packed Memorial Stadium in Laramie on Sept. 20 of that year. In the second quarter, split end Ron Hill, a transfer from Northeast Junior College in Sterling, Colo., caught a pass from quarterback Ed Synakowski for the Cowboys’ first score of the season.
Less than a month later, Hill and the other 13 Black varsity players were purged from the team when they came to Coach Lloyd Eaton’s office on the Friday morning before the Brigham Young University game. The Mormon Church, which owns BYU, did not permit African Americans to become priests, and the Black 14, as they came to be known, wanted to protest the policy by wearing black armbands. But as soon as Eaton saw the players’ armbands, he took them to the fieldhouse bleachers and told them, “You’re no longer Wyoming Cowboys.”
Hill, age 77, died last month in his home state of Alabama after a battle with cancer, leaving only 10 of the Black 14 surviving him.
Hill was born and reared during his early childhood in Bessemer, Ala., along with eight siblings, where his father worked in a steel mill. When Hill was about 15, he went to live with his oldest brother, Roosevelt Hill, in Denver. He starred as an athlete at Manual High School and was a teammate of Don Meadows, another future member of the Black 14. 
After playing at Sterling, he transferred to UW in the fall of 1968, but was redshirted that season. In May 1969, Powell Tribune editor Dave Bonner traveled to Sheridan to cover a Cowboys’ intra-squad game and three Black players caught his eye. “Among the other standouts were split end Ron Hill, tailback Rick Marshall and defensive back Ivie Moore,” Bonner reported. “Hill caught four passes for 174 yards and showed great speed in taking two of the tosses for TDs.”

Moore was also part of the Black 14 with Hill. 
After the University of Wyoming trustees and Gov. Stan Hathaway supported the coach’s decision to remove the players for the season, Hill finished the semester and then left UW. 
Nine months after he was dismissed from the team, he suffered a devastating blow in his young life when his brother, who was the director of the Black Studies program at Colorado University-Denver, was shot and killed. Roosevelt Hill had taken a couple of his students and his wife to the Colorado State Penitentiary to talk to the Black prisoners there on the topic “Awareness of the Black Man.” On the way back, they stopped at a gas station in Colorado Springs to fuel the Colorado University vehicle they were driving. He handed a CU credit card to the attendant, a soldier just back from a tour in Vietnam who was stationed at nearby Fort Carson and working part-time at the gas station.
The attendant apparently suspected the car and credit card were stolen and went inside to make some calls. When the attendant did not come back out for an extended time, Roosevelt, his wife and one of the students, all unarmed, went in to see what was happening. The attendant was in a little office and accounts of what happened differ, but tempers flared. The attendant pulled a .38-caliber revolver from the drawer and shot Hill dead. Within a few days, a grand jury was called by the county prosecutor and after hearing testimony from witnesses, including Roosevelt’s wife, the jury declined to bring charges, apparently accepting the attendant’s claim of self-defense.
Two Black state senators and civil rights groups protested, calling for an investigation by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. They also demanded that the prosecutor bring charges directly, but that did not happen. The soldier was quickly transferred to another Army base.
Six months later, the Hill brothers’ mother died, another blow to Ron. But he persevered. He worked for the Burlington Northern Railroad for 13 years, earned a degree in education and taught and coached physical education at two middle schools in Denver, according to his friend and Black 14 roommate John Griffin, another 1969 junior college transfer to UW who was UW’s leading receiver when he was purged from the undefeated and 12th-ranked Cowboys.
Hill was the father of a son and daughter.
In September 1993, Ron Hill participated in a “reunion” of the Black 14 players and some of the administrators from 1969, organized by the head of UW’s newly established Black Studies program. 
In a 2010 interview, Hill said he and Moore worked in Denver for a time after leaving UW. He was best man at Moore’s wedding. “Me and Ivie figured [the dismissal from the team] was something that happened at a time and place and we went on. We left there knowing we were winners. It was all just a lesson. It made me more mature, but the struggle goes on still, not just in Laramie but across this nation.”
Hill kept up his participation with the Black 14, attending the 50th anniversary commemoration in September 2019, when UW’s president and athletic director issued an apology to the players expelled from the team.
Hill renewed his friendship with Black 14 teammate Lionel Grimes of Ohio at that event. In a recent email, Grimes said, “Ron and I grew very close by talking non-stop on the phone after meeting in Laramie in 2019, and he was so thrilled when he and I started FaceTiming.”
In recent years, Hill had worked at a plant that converted plastics into fiber. For a time, Moore came from Arkansas and lived and worked with Hill.
Hill died on July 5 in Florence, Ala. A private memorial service will be held by the family, according to Hill’s page on the Thompson & Son Funeral Home’s website.
The first of the Black 14 to pass away was the only one from Wyoming, James Isaac of Hanna, son of a Union Pacific railroad worker. He died in California in 1976. Don Meadows, who returned to the team in 1970 and was selected to the All-Conference first team, passed away in 2009. Earl Lee, a well-respected teacher, coach and principal in Maryland, died in 2013.

Navigating the world by bike has its ups and downs, literally and figuratively, and offers key lessons for life in and out of the saddle, writes columnist David Romtvedt. 
The post What I’ve learned bicycling appeared first on WyoFile .","I became a serious bicyclist after my first year of college when I had a summer job in a ski pole and bindings factory. I rode seven miles to work in the early morning, the air cool but humid. In the afternoon, it was still humid and now hot, so the seven miles home ended with me drenched in sweat. I loved the daily rides on the two-lane curving roads, the dappled sunlight coming down through the tree canopy.

Opinion

In my late 20s and early 30s, I did a little criterium racing. What I liked best about racing was the sound made by the bikes as we went around a corner in a group — the slight whir of the chains moving over the sprockets, the hum of the tires on the road — and the way the individual riders became a single being. But the actual racing wasn’t really for me. I hated losing and I hated winning just as much.
Racing over, I started touring and, with a friend, rode from Vancouver, Canada, to Guaymas, Mexico. Later, I rode for three months through England and France and over the Pyrenees Mountains into the southern Basque Country. Shorter rides have included two weeks in New England and two weeks in central Texas. Now I ride regularly for pleasure and to do my daily errands. Hot, cold, rain, snow, sun — I’m on the bike.
My wife, who is a bit of a worrier, tells me that cycling is the most dangerous sport I could take part in. It’s the cars. Every bicyclist has stories of untoward encounters with cars. Once as I pedaled along a bridge, a driver slowed and the passenger leaned out and shoved me into the guardrail. I was lucky not to go over the side and into the river below. On a country road, someone threw an open can of Coca-Cola out the window, hitting me in the helmet, soda spraying everywhere. Forced off the road by a delivery truck, I tumbled down an embankment into a mass of brambles. A policeman chasing a speeder ran a red light as I was crossing on the green. When I slammed on the brakes, I went over the front of the bike, landing on the asphalt. I don’t think the policeman ever saw me. Perhaps more disturbing than the accidents and near misses is unkindness — a car going by and the driver shouting, “Get the f*** off the road.”
But for every unkind person there’s a kind one, too. Once commuting during rush hour, I was hit when the door of a parked car opened as I passed. I flew through the air with one finger completely severed but jammed down in my hand, so the surgeons were able to later reattach it. Landing on a new VW Bug convertible whose owners, a recently married young couple, had received the car as a wedding gift, I crushed the car’s hood. Without a hint of complaint, the couple helped me get to a hospital. They also took my mangled bicycle to my house and never asked for money for the damage done to their car. 
There’s a 15-mile road ride I regularly take that runs north from my house, turns west toward the Bighorn Mountains, then south along the range, and finally southeast home. While the road is entirely up and down, I end where I start, so there is no overall elevation gain or loss. But it feels like I have to pedal uphill an awful lot more than down, which has led me to wonder how much time I spend slogging upward versus cruising down. To find out, a friend and I used the stopwatch function on two cellphones to measure the two times. It took 55 minutes and 34 seconds to ride the 15 miles that day, pedaling uphill for 37 minutes and 11 seconds, and downhill for 18 minutes and 23 seconds. That’s slightly more than 2/3 of the time uphill. 
So what have I learned bicycling? Life doesn’t have to be a race. The world is large and the road long. For every unkind act, there’s a kind one waiting. A policeman can make the same mistake I might. And it’s exciting to ride downhill, but you have to go uphill first and you’ll spend more time climbing than cruising down. 
Attending to these lessons, I’ve discovered I’m a better rider and a happier person.

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)As History Colorado researchers enter the ninth month of work on a state-mandated racial equity study, they are analyzing the discrimination faced by — and the contributions of — Black residents, starting in Colorado’s mid-1800s territorial days and going through to the present.
Existing documentation of such history is fragmented, but researchers are working to fill in the gaps, the study’s leaders said during a Wednesday presentation at the Colorado Capitol to the Black Coloradan Racial Equity Study Commission. The commission was established in June 2024 and oversees the History Colorado study.
“Being in this work really means being in this work, and while we’re finding all of these stories of heaviness, but also resilience, it’s crucial for us to really share this with the public,” History Colorado Program Manager Chloé Duplessis said.

The three-year study focuses on the harms of racist practices, including those previously sanctioned by law, in areas like housing, banking, employment, education, health care and criminal justice. 
Duplessis and a team of researchers are conducting the study by poring over newspaper clippings and archives, interviewing longtime Black residents about their family histories and analyzing data.
“The study is very special in the sense that it is a historical study that’s chronological, but it’s also very important because it’s kind of making history in its own way,” Duplessis said.
The study has uncovered that 10 leaders from the territory of Colorado owned slaves, including Territorial Gov. William Gilpin, several territorial legislators and two territorial Supreme Court justices. It has also found that dozens of former state lawmakers were raised in slave-owning families.
Criminal justice is a central part of the study, and researchers have found that Black residents were disproportionately represented in the first 100 people arrested in Colorado history. Black Coloradans on death row were also more likely to experience botched executions, and some were executed just one to two days after being convicted, often without comprehensive trials.










We tend to celebrate a lot of Black firsts in the civil rights era, in the 1960s, but there was an earlier point in time, when we had Black representation, and immediately after, there was this huge backlash and we didn’t see representation until the middle of the 20th century.


– Rep. Jennifer Bacon, vice chair of the racial equity study commission


Study leaders are also documenting the progress spurred by Black Coloradans. One focus of this work is the legacy of former Rep. Joseph Stuart, who was elected in 1895 as Colorado’s first Black state lawmaker. Stuart introduced a law that banned racial discrimination in public places — and it passed. Several Colorado cities, however, did not comply with or enforce the law until decades later.
“We tend to celebrate a lot of Black firsts in the civil rights era, in the 1960s, but there was an earlier point in time, when we had Black representation, and immediately after, there was this huge backlash and we didn’t see representation until the middle of the 20th century,” said Rep. Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat and the vice chair of the commission. “But also, he is an example of what happens when you have Black representation, and I want to highlight that.”
Legislative recommendations to come
The commission was established by Senate Bill 24-53. The law did not come with any state budget allocation. Instead, the study derives its funding through grants, foundations and donations. The study will cost a total of $1.8 million, and more than $1 million has already been raised.
The commission will make legislative recommendations based on the study’s findings, once it is complete in 2027. During the Wednesday meeting, several commissioners and members of the public reflected on their experiences as Black Coloradans.
“I am the 55th Senate president in the state of Colorado, and if you have a chance to stop by the Senate president’s hallway inside of this building, you will see 53 portraits of individuals who are not Black,” said Colorado Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat who chairs the commission. “Every time I sit this in the president’s office, an office for each of those individuals at one point in time, I wonder what they would think about me being in there.”
To applause, Duplessis responded, “You are not sitting in their seat. That is your seat.”
Study leaders plan to host listening sessions providing opportunities for Colorado residents to share their experiences, input and questions in the fall. Sessions are scheduled for Denver on Sept. 13 and Pueblo on Oct. 4.

Wendy DeBoer of Omaha will look to trade her legislative experience next year for a seat on Nebraska’s regulatory-focused Public Service Commission.
DeBoer announced her candidacy this week to seek the Democratic nomination for the Public Service Commission’s seat in District 2, which consists of the eastern half of Douglas County. DeBoer was first elected to the Legislature in 2018. She has served the past seven years on the Transportation and Telecommunications Committee, which intersects with the PSC.
That committee and lawmakers generally often look at the state’s regulatory structure and laws around broadband, pipelines, taxi cabs, railroads, 911 and more. The laws the Legislature passes often leave the crafting of related regulations to the Public Service Commission. 
“There’s a real synergy between the work that I’ve been doing the last seven years and what happens over at the PSC,” DeBoer told the Nebraska Examiner. “It seemed like a natural fit, and there’s some things I want to continue to work on.”
PSC priorities
DeBoer highlighted her work around 911 emergency communications services and efforts to defend broadband programs. This spring, she passed a bill to modernize the state’s 911 laws, passed a bill to reduce “anti-competition red tape” in the transportation industry and prevented cuts to broadband programs after discovering some supposedly unspent funding could not be repurposed.

Among DeBoer’s priorities, she said she has seen an “urgent need” for improved and modernized broadband, transportation and infrastructure.
Also under Public Service Commission jurisdiction: grain, manufactured homes and recreational vehicles, modular housing units, transmission lines and rights-of-way and water or natural gas utility services.
An Omaha native, DeBoer was raised in northwest Omaha’s Maple Village. She is a 1996 graduate of Hastings College, before going on to earn four advanced degrees: a law degree from the University of Nebraska College of Law, a master’s degree in English literature from the University of Nebraska at Omaha, a master’s degree in theology from Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago and a master’s degree in religious studies from Syracuse University.
DeBoer had also begun work on a doctorate degree on the philosophy of religion prior to becoming a state senator.
In the Legislature, DeBoer has served on the Judiciary and Rules Committees during her tenure, including her current role as vice chair of both committees. She chairs the Legislature’s Planning Committee that helps the state identify emerging trends, assets and challenges, as well as assess long-term implications of legislative decisions.
District 2 partisan makeup
Commissioner Christian Mirch, a Republican appointed to the post by Gov. Jim Pillen after a vacancy, represents District 2 on the PSC, which now consists of all Republicans. He succeeded Democratic Commissioner Crystal Rhoades in January 2023 after voters elected Rhoades clerk of the Douglas County District Court.

Mirch, a 2022 legislative candidate, is a former Omaha police officer and former clerk to now-former Nebraska Chief Justice Mike Heavican. He is serving the remaining four years of Rhoades’ term.
Mirch told the Examiner this week that he hasn’t made a decision about whether to run in 2026 but welcomed DeBoer to the race.
“I’m just focused on ensuring that we’re doing the best work that we can for our constituents,” Mirch said Wednesday.
Public Service Commissioners are elected to six-year terms with an annual salary of $75,000. The office is established in the Nebraska Constitution.
This will be the first time the Public Service Commission’s 2nd District will face voters since the latest redistricting in 2021. 
The new 2nd District is the only Public Service Commission district to skew blue, according to an Examiner analysis of precinct-level voting patterns in Douglas County.  As designed, its voters have heavily favored Democratic candidates for president and Congress and embraced progressive-leaning ballot measures in recent elections.



 
Pledge to ‘fight’ for constituents
This will be the first time DeBoer has run in an officially partisan race. Legislative races are officially nonpartisan, meaning lawmakers don’t caucus by political party. Party identity doesn’t appear next to those candidates’ names on the ballot, and the top two candidates advance from the primary election, regardless of party.
DeBoer said she wants PSC District 2 constituents, some of whom she already represents, to know she’ll work to ensure efficiency and continue to “fight for them and their needs.”
“I’ve brought bills to reduce red tape, lower fatalities on our highways and keep our transportation and road construction workers safer,” DeBoer said. “On the floor, I have stood up against cuts to broadband programs and worked towards infrastructure that moves our state forward. I’m running to continue this work on the Public Service Commission.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Milwaukee County continues to process the aftermath of a historic flooding that swept through the area  last weekend. Although much of the flood water, which exceeded 10 inches in some areas, has receded, emergency shelters are still  providing services to people displaced by the extreme weather, and community clean-up efforts continue. 
At a press conference Wednesday, Mayor Cavalier Johnson said residents should call 211 to report property damage, which he called an important  step towards achieving an official disaster declaration, which in turn could provide additional resources. Johnson said local officials continue to work with state and federal partners to access resources from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and noted a recent visit to the city by Gov. Tony Evers.

“We’re asking for the federal government to do their part and issue some relief to the folks here in Milwaukee with some assistance from FEMA,” Johnson said. The city continues to wait for President Donald Trump’s administration to respond to Milwaukee’s calls for support. Johnson encouraged residents to report downed trees, abandoned vehicles, standing water and to check on neighbors or loved ones. 
The mayor praised Milwaukeeans for “stepping up,” helping senior citizens to clear out basements and  clearing out storm drains. “We really appreciate the efforts of people all across our city who are stepping up to make this a safer place for everybody as we work to get through the aftermath of the storm,”  he said. “We’re a resilient city, we always have been, we always will be, and we will get through this together.”
Johnson was joined by Mike Totoraitis, commissioner of the Milwaukee Health Department. Totoraitis said that calling 211 “is your best connection to resources at this point,” noting that “there are some large wait times on 211 during those peak hours.” Like the mayor, Totoraitis said that calling 211 is also one of the best ways to essentially convince the federal government to send assistance. “We know that many people have lost water heaters, furnaces, furniture, personal effects, there is a lot of damage that has happened,” he said. “Drive through neighborhoods across the city and see just debris and items out on someone’s driveway. So this is a critical moment to get those damage reports in, and then we’re also using that to help prioritize where we’re going to bring additional resources.”
Working with the Red Cross and other partners, Totoraitis said that the city is deploying hundreds of cleaning kits and other supplies. Meanwhile, the health department is monitoring signs of disease. Totoraitis said residents should assume any standing water in the streets or in homes is contaminated with sewage and avoid it.

The Red Cross has established two shelters, one on the near North Side and another on the South Side, to help people displaced by the flood. Dozens of people sought assistance from the shelters, a Red Cross worker told Wisconsin Examiner. The two locations have recently been consolidated into one shelter now operating out of Marshall High School, according to a Red Cross worker.
On Monday, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley thanked first responders, Evers, and the National Guard for assisting. “I know this is an incredibly challenging and devastating time for many of our residents, but I’m inspired seeing neighbors helping neighbors, businesses stepping up to support those in need, and the tireless dedication of our first responders and emergency management personnel,” said Crowley. “Milwaukee County is a strong and resilient community, and I know that by coming together, we will persevere.” On Tuesday, Crowley walked through storm-damaged neighborhoods near Brown Deer with officials from the county’s Office of Emergency Management.
On Wednesday, Wisconsin Policy Forum released a report warning that severe flooding could become more frequent. “Over the past 45 years Wisconsin has seen a dramatic increase in damage caused by flooding, as the climate has warmed, extreme rains have become more common, and urban development has continued,” the report states. “Increased flooding in turn has resulted in larger payouts on flood insurance claims, as well as increased federal and state payments for disaster recovery. With projections suggesting that continued climate change will further increase the likelihood of extreme rains, federal, state, and local governments will need to deal with the consequences.”

The report shows that during the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, flood insurance damage claims for property in Wisconsin exceeded $40 million. Severe floods that struck Milwaukee in 2008 caused nearly $50 million in flood insurance damage claims. “Current projections show that the frequency of heavy rain events and the potential for devastating floods will continue to grow over the coming decades,” the report states. “Property owners, along with state and local governments, will be on the hook for the costs of cleaning up and rebuilding after these floods occur. As costs grow, they may begin to stress state and local budgets, especially if state leaders decide to cover a growing share of the rebuilding costs. In addition, there are some questions about the federal government’s long-term commitment to covering these costs, which may push additional costs onto the state.” 
Taking care of each other
Many people are continuing to wrap their minds around the scale of the flood damage. When Evers visited Milwaukee County, he was joined by Rep. Robyn Vining (D-Wauwatosa) on a tour of  the area Vining represents. Wauwatosa produced some of the most dramatic images of flood damage, with most of Hart Park seemingly underwater and overflowing wetlands in the County Grounds natural area. 
Vining said in a statement that “the damage is serious, and the pain across the community is real. Let’s be good neighbors and take care of each other during this difficult time.” 
Anne Tuchelski, a 29-year-old lifelong resident of Milwaukee in the Bay View neighborhood, saw people stepping up to help one another as a summer’s-worth of rain fell in the middle of the night last weekend across Milwaukee. Tuchelski realized something was wrong after her neighborhood’s main intersection was completely flooded. “I’ve never seen it like this,” she told Wisconsin Examiner. “My gutters were just pouring out and just slamming on the pavement…I’ve never seen this before.”

Tuchelski’s 85-year-old grandmother, who has also lived in Milwaukee for her whole life, had never seen such a storm before either. Tuchelski drove to her grandmother’s house in the middle of the night to check on her. The water was rising dramatically. 
“That was really the kicker, was that it was happening in the middle of the night,” she said. Driving down the darkened, flooded roadways, Tuchelski saw people stranded in their cars. From 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. she used her SUV to offer people rides and to push stalled vehicles out of the water, “helping wherever I could.”
Tuchelski recalled one woman whose car was stranded in floodwater near the freeway. She’d left home to pick up her son, and needed her car to go to work in the morning. Tuchelski tried to get her to understand that her vehicle was flooded, and that the tow truck she’d decided to wait for likely wouldn’t come because of the scale of the disaster. 
“It was just really heartbreaking to see her try to come to terms with the fact that the next day is going to change greatly,” Tuchelski said. She offered her a ride, but the woman refused. “It’s like she wasn’t grasping that nobody can come right now. Everybody’s overwhelmed, everybody’s doing their best, and the car’s gone. And you’re standing in the middle of the intersection at 3 o’clock in the morning. She just couldn’t grasp it, and I ran into multiple people like that who just could not grasp it.”

Another person Tuchelski encountered was in a U-Haul truck attempting to move their things, and seemingly unable to accept that it was all already gone or ruined. “I kept saying to her, ‘You have to leave it,’ and she’s like, ‘My stuff, my stuff,’ and I was like, ‘We can’t. It’s underwater.’ So it was just a repeated thing with people, where they just could not come to terms with leaving their belongings behind for their own survival, and their own well-being.” 
Tuchelski herself lost many family tapes, pictures and dresses in the flood. Tuchelski’s family has lived in Milwaukee for over a century. Her grandmother’s basement is still flooded, and so is Tuchelski’s aunt’s basement. “My grandmother’s home has raised five generations of family,” said Tuckelski. “And just to see things float by and be damaged, it was really heartbreaking … Things that make our family, and have recorded these moments, and have become important to us, just floating by.”

During a meeting at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, the America250 in Idaho Advisory Council voted to spend the money through an ambassadors program that Idaho State Treasurer Julie Ellsworth is heading up. 
The advisory council is focusing its time and funding on promoting and supporting celebrations planned for next summer that are tied to the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence being signed in 1776. 
“This is such a big deal for us as a nation,” said Rep. Brandon Mitchell, a Moscow Republican who serves as co-chair of the advisory council. “In our state we want to really lead the nation and show what we can do here in Idaho.”
 Funding America250 celebrations across the state of Idaho

The committee also approved a similar $20,000 funding request from Ellsworth at its previous meeting in June, Ellsworth said. So far, money has gone toward printing and promotional materials like a video, buttons, binders, cards, pouches, cellophane bags and other materials.

In addition to the $20,000 for the ambassadors program, the America250 in Idaho Advisory Council is also awarding $250,000 through its celebration fund via grants of up to $2,500 each to support local cities’ and counties’ America 250 celebrations in Idaho, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane said the city of American Falls recently became the first Idaho community to submit an application for grant funding. Applications are still being accepted, and information about how city and county officials can apply for grant funding is available on the America250 in Idaho website. 
The focus on community celebrations and events promoting America250 in Idaho represents the new direction the advisory committee has been heading since spring. In March, legislators serving on the advisory committee cancelled grants for 29 different nonprofits and arts organizations after they said they wanted to be hyperfocused on America250 celebrations and patriotic celebrations of the founding of this country, the Sun previously reported.

As part of the ambassador program, Ellsworth has also designed and made costumes for nine Revolutionary Spuddy Buddy plush dolls by hand. 
The Revolutionary Spuddy Buddies travel with legislators or members of the advisory committee to public events around the state like Fourth of July parades, rodeos, fairs and festivals to generate hype for the America250 in Idaho celebrations. 
At each event, the Revolutionary Spuddy Buddies’ ambassadors travel with a piece of a symbolic Declaration of Independence scroll that Idahoans can sign their name to before it is unfurled from the top of the Idaho State Capitol next year. 
The Revolutionary Spuddy Buddies have their own names, like Spud Revere; trading cards; and back stories. 
Ellsworth admits it sounds silly, but she said people are going crazy for the Revolutionary Spuddy Buddies, and everybody always wants to take their picture with them.
“It’s our way to heighten America 250,” Ellsworth said. “It’s been very, very fun, very loved and very responded to by everybody.”

Ellsworth told the Sun she spent her own money making the Revolutionary Spuddy Buddies and buying the materials for their custom costumes. 
The Revolutionary Spuddy Buddies are based on the Idaho Potato Commission’s Spuddy Buddy mascot. 
Each Revolutionary Spuddy Buddy is about two to three feet high and takes up to 10 hours to make and dress, said Ellsworth, who learned to sew as a child and said she has a knack for making dolls and costumes. 
Eventually she plans for there to be 16 Revolutionary Spuddy Buddies in her collection.

(Christiana Botic/Verite New and CatchLight Local/Report for America)Alexander Sanchez had only been in the United States for two months when police officers pulled him over one morning in December near a major intersection in Kenner, about 10 miles outside of New Orleans.
It was a routine stop — the Kenner Police officers who pulled him over said Sanchez had run a red light — but it ended with Sanchez in a federal immigration detention center.
According to the police report, when an officer asked Sanchez for his driver’s license and his car’s registration and insurance information, Sanchez – who was undocumented and could not obtain a driver’s license in Louisiana – handed him a Honduran passport.
Speaking through an interpreter in a phone interview in June, Sanchez said he told the officer, “No tengo permitido” — I’m not permitted. 
Sanchez was booked into the Kenner jail for driving without a license and the traffic signal violation. He said he spent three days in jail and then he was taken to federal immigration detention in rural Louisiana.
Hours after his arrest, Kenner, officers filled out a second arrest report for Sanchez based on a procedural request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — called an immigration detainer. Detainers are used to request that local law enforcement either let ICE know when they’re going to release detainees who may be subject to deportation or to hold them for 48 hours beyond when they would otherwise be released to facilitate their transfer to immigration detention.
Sanchez would be held for months inside a notorious former state prison in Winnfield — now used for immigration detainees — with a history of alleged human rights abuses.  (Sanchez is no longer in immigration detention, he asked that his current location not be disclosed. He is identified by his middle name and second last name for the same reason.)
Sanchez’ case is hardly unique in Kenner, a suburb of New Orleans with a large Hispanic population.
Gulf States Newsroom and Verite News analyzed Kenner Police Department arrest records for the first five months of this year and found that traffic arrests from stops and crashes in that city are serving as a gateway to immigration detention — and possible deportation — for many.

President Donald Trump came into office this year promising a nationwide crackdown undocumented immigrants. Among the tools his administration has used more extensively are detainer requests, which were up more than 60 percent in the first five months of 2025 compared to the same period last year, according to federal data reported by the Deportation Data Project.
But in Kenner, the increase has been even more dramatic. ICE issued at least 129 immigration detainers through Kenner PD between January and May, a more than sixfold increase from the 20 detainers issued through Kenner PD during the same period in 2024.
The vast majority of people booked on immigration detainers after being arrested by Kenner police from January through May were born in Honduras, according to the data shared by the Deportation Data Project.
According to Kenner arrest records, at least 75 of them, more than half, were initially booked for traffic-related offenses following a stop or collision.
The most common traffic offense linked to an immigration detainer was driving without a license — under state law, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Louisiana licenses — often accompanied by other traffic-related charges.
More than half of the people whom Kenner PD arrested for unlicensed driving between January and May 2025 became subjects of immigration detainer requests, like the one issued for Sanchez.
Asked for comment on Sanchez’s case, an ICE spokesperson said the agency “defers to KPD.”
Rachel Taber, a member of New Orleans-based immigrants rights group Union Migranté, said she has been consulting with people whose loved ones have ended up detained and in some cases deported after traffic stops in Kenner. She stressed that the arrests can traumatize families who may be separated over a traffic offense.
“The penalty doesn’t fit the crime,” Taber said. “A minor traffic infraction does not merit … never being able to hug your kids again.”
As of Tuesday (Aug. 12), it was not clear how many of the people for whom detainers were issued had more serious criminal records. Verite News and Gulf States Newsroom have requested all criminal background check information obtained by Kenner law enforcement.

ICE issued at least 129 immigration detainers through Kenner PD between January and May, a more than sixfold increase from the same period in 2024.

As more local departments, encouraged by Trump, are partnering with ICE, similar patterns are emerging throughout the country. In June, The Washington Post reported on how expanding partnerships between ICE and police agencies around the country have deployed traffic arrests as part of the machinery of immigration enforcement.
Though Louisiana law enforcement agencies have partnered with ICE in the past, no such formal partnerships were in place at the beginning of this year, when Trump took office. This year, however, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry and his conservative allies in the state legislature have strongly pushed for their adoption. And in March, Kenner PD became one of the first Louisiana departments to ink a new agreement with the federal agency, although as of last month, that program had not been fully implemented, Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley said in an interview.
To Conley, ICE’s increased reliance on local law enforcement, and its use of detainers, shouldn’t come as a surprise, given the emphasis on local-federal partnerships from both Trump and Landry, who has pushed local agencies in Louisiana to cooperate with federal immigration agencies.
“I think it was the perfect storm, with a governor coming in that’s very law-and-order, and then you have the president coming in that ran on immigration reform and border security. So I don’t think it’s a coincidence now that we had these spikes,” he said.
Conley said traffic enforcement is the “number one” concern for Kenner constituents. Driving without a license is a particular concern because of the risk that unlicensed and uninsured drivers may cause an accident, and the other drivers involved may “never get made whole,” Conley said.
Michele Waslin, assistant director of the Immigration History Research Center at University of Minnesota, said that scenario is why some states have expanded eligibility for driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants.
“Obviously, people are driving without licenses. You’re not stopping them from driving,” Waslin said. “We want them to be licensed and insured … so in the case that there is an accident, what you described won’t happen.”
Waslin, who has studied the intersection of driver’s license policy and immigration enforcement, said laws blocking undocumented immigrants from accessing licenses “very clearly intersect with agreements with state and local police to identify people for deportation.”
Conley said his agency is not enforcing immigration law, but making arrests based on criminal laws.
“They’re in our lockup based on a lawful criminal arrest. If [Homeland Security Investigations] calls and puts a detainer on them, I’m going to honor the detainer,” Conley said, referring to a branch of ICE that investigates immigration violations.
‘You’re going to get brought to jail’
Sanchez fled Honduras after receiving death threats, according to his immigration attorney, Jeremy Jong. In October, he settled in the New Orleans metro area, near his aunt, Judith Cruz.
On the morning Sanchez was arrested, he was driving to Cruz’s house in St. Rose, which borders Kenner, to take her to church, Cruz said in an interview.
Sanchez couldn’t get a driver’s license because Louisiana requires applicants for driver’s licenses to show proof that they are in the country legally.
Driving without a license is considered a misdemeanor in Louisiana. According to a Kenner city ordinance, the penalty for driving without a license is up to $500 in fines and no more than 60 days behind bars, The state penalty is more stringent , with possible fines and a maximum of six months behind bars.
Though it is a crime, not all law enforcement agencies routinely arrest people for driving without a license. In Kenner, however, it’s required. For undocumented immigrants like Sanchez, an arrest can lead to an ICE detainer request, then a lengthy stay in immigration detention and possible deportation.










Mothers have no choice but to work to provide for our families. And when you drive to work, you're taking your life in your hands.


– Judith Cruz


Conley said police in Kenner have long been required to arrest anyone suspected of driving without a license. In an interview in May, the police chief said his department has been “transparent” about its policy.
“Here in the city of Kenner, it’s very well known that if you’re operating a vehicle and you’ve never been issued a license, you’re going to get brought to jail,” he said.
Kenner PD is a potential outlier. Verite News and Gulf States Newsroom asked 10 law enforcement agencies in the region, including the Louisiana State Police, about their policies and practices for encounters with unlicensed drivers. Of the seven that responded, only one other agency – St. Charles Parish Sheriff’s Office – has a mandatory arrest policy on suspicion of driving without a license.
Through a translator, Cruz said she knows many immigrants in her community who have been arrested by Kenner Police and booked into the city’s local jail for traffic violations. She said some of them, like her nephew, ended up in the hands of immigration agents.
She said mothers who need to provide for their children and cannot always get a ride will take the risk of driving without a license in order to get to and from work.
“Mothers have no choice but to work to provide for our families. And when you drive to work, you’re taking your life in your hands,” Cruz said. “It’s just very painful to think about all the children that could be left home without their families.”
There are two main ways that ICE learns of people in local jails who may have violated federal immigration law.  When someone is booked into jail, that person’s information is often electronically shared with multiple federal agencies, according to Lindsay Williams, a public information officer for ICE.
If agents at ICE find the person is suspected of immigration violations, they’ll contact the ICE office responsible for the region where the arrest was made, and that office will issue a detainer, Williams said. Local or state agencies can also inform ICE agents in their area about people in custody.  Williams said officials in the New Orleans ICE office learn about arrests by Kenner PD through both methods.
The records obtained by the newsrooms do not shed light on why authorities requested an immigration detainer for each individual in Kenner.
Boom in federal-local partnerships under Trump
The jump in detainers issued to Kenner PD aligns with a national increase in ICE’s use of these requests that may be attributed to pressure from the Trump administration to ramp up immigration arrests in order to fulfill his campaign promise of mass deportations.
In the early days of his second term Trump urged homeland security officials to secure more agreements with local agencies to collaborate on immigration enforcement. These partnerships – called 287(g) agreements  – deputize local officials to perform some ICE duties.
“If you want to increase the number of deportations, if you want large numbers, then you’re going to use these partnerships more and more,” Waslin said.
In Louisiana, Landry, an immigration hardliner and Trump ally, began laying the groundwork for increased state and local participation in immigration enforcement in 2024. During that year’s legislative session, Landry worked with Republican lawmakers on a civil law that prohibits law enforcement agencies from following so-called “sanctuary” policies that limit cooperation with ICE. This June, Landry signed a new piece of legislation with sharper teeth into law, making it a crime, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, for local officials to refuse to comply with immigration detainer requests.

As of mid-August, ICE has 897 active partnerships with agencies around the country for the 287(g) program, according to the agency – compared to 135 in December near the end of the Biden Administration. In Louisiana, which had no participants enrolled in the program at the end of last year, 17 agencies, including Kenner PD, have signed up.
While the department is not yet fully accredited in the program, Williams, the ICE representative,  said Kenner PD’s existing relationship with the agency was a “main contributing factor” to securing the partnership.
“The relationship is a stellar example of state and local cooperation with ICE for upholding public safety and has been for many years across multiple presidential administrations,” Williams said in an email.
Once accredited, Kenner PD will operate under what is called a “jail enforcement model,” which authorizes police officers to investigate immigration statuses of people booked into the city’s jail, place them into immigration proceedings and issue immigration detainers themselves.
‘A failure to yield upended her life’
In some cases in Kenner, people were involved in traffic crashes other people had a hand in — only to be arrested and later booked by immigration agents, Kenner PD records show.
In an incident on March 7, a woman spoke to police as the victim of an alleged hit-and-run, according to a probable cause statement in arrest reports.
Police arrested her for driving without a license, and she was booked on an ICE detainer the next day. Conley said people involved in an accident will be asked if they have a driver’s license and will “be held to the law.”
In Kenner, records do show arrests of some people who were accused of crimes with serious penalties and then booked on immigration detainers. For example, between January and May, 2025, Kenner police took at least three people into custody who were suspected of sex-related crimes and then booked on detainers.
Nationally, the share of people arrested by immigration officers who also have past criminal convictions has fallen when compared to the previous presidential administration, one recent analysis showed.
Jong, an attorney at immigrants rights organization Al Otro Lado, said he’s had a few clients who have been detained after being arrested for traffic offenses in Kenner.
He still thinks about a client, a woman from El Salvador, who was arrested by Kenner police officers for allegedly failing to obey a traffic sign back in 2017. Jong said the woman’s family was “ruined” by her deportation.
“A failure to yield upended her life and split up this family,” Jong said. “Her husband was torn up.”
Jong said knowing the possible consequences for arrests of immigrants in Kenner, he doesn’t understand the department’s policy of arresting people who are unable to obtain driver’s licenses in the state for not having them.
“There’s so much discretion for a police department to determine what laws you’re gonna put people in jail for,” Jong said. “It does seem like they are making the conscious decision to do something that is gonna lead to many of their residents getting deported.”
In an email, Conley said the responsibility lies with the individual who isn’t licensed, and that Kenner is “diverse and inclusive.”
Sanchez was detained for five months at Winn Correctional Center. He said near the end of his time there, he experienced headaches daily and became paranoid – fearful of the danger he said he escaped in Honduras.
He said he thinks fondly about his time in Louisiana before he was arrested because he felt safe.
“Things were going pretty well for me,” he said. “I wasn’t in danger.”
He said he tries not to think about his time in immigration detention

Bill Lee said he's willing to send National Guard troops to Washington, DC to aid with a federal takeover. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said Wednesday he is ready to deploy National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. as part of President Donald Trump’s federal takeover of the police force there.
Lee said he spoke with U.S. Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll, who told him the military could be requesting states to send troops to the nation’s capital for law enforcement.
“I told him we would be obviously willing to work with them on whatever they needed. The current status, I cannot speak to, but the request … of interest was made, and I expressed interest,” Lee said in a press conference following a groundbreaking for Australian-owned Barrett Firearms south of Murfreesboro.
The governor’s statement provides another example that he is prepared to use Tennessee National Guard personnel for nearly every request the president makes.
Recently, Lee mobilized Guard members to provide backing for federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement as it continues efforts on mass deportation. Guard personnel are to help with paperwork and logistics to give ICE agents more time to concentrate on arresting immigrants who lack documentation for permanent citizenship.
In addition to deportation efforts, Trump ordered the feds to wrest control of the Washington, D.C. police department using National Guard troops in a purported emergency move to cut crime in what he called a “lawless city.” Local officials criticized the move, saying the city has seen a major decrease in crime in the last year. 
Under federal law, the president could run the police department for 30 days, though the time frame could be stretched.

Piles of sawdust sit just downhill from the Peshawbestown Gitigaan, the farm of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, where local commercial fisheries drop off all the parts of a fish they don’t sell — heads, bones, organs, tails.
A delicate, fishy smell emanates from the mounds; the few decomposing fish strewn on the ground are unusual, according to Will Derouin, the agricultural manager for the Grand Traverse Band.
“It’s typically not even this messy,” he said. “We typically have it all covered up.”
 Lots of material

Every week from April through October the tribe’s agriculture department accepts between 3,000 and 5,000 pounds of fish waste, delivered by local companies such as Carlson’s Fishery in Leland, which dropped off about 3,000 pounds the day before.
The Grand Traverse Band is turning that waste into a compost and fertilizer called Gigook and Gitigaan, or Fish and Garden. They can be used to grow food and cut down on what it sends to the landfill, and are part of the Grand Traverse Band’s efforts to strengthen its food sovereignty.
In the field, Caleb Anderson is pulling weeds and tilling the soil. His family had used fish products to help fertilize their hemp farm in the past, but he wasn’t familiar with making the fertilizer until he started work with the tribe.
“Initially, a lot of people are pretty drawn back by just the smell, the look of it,” he said. “Like, ‘Oh, my God, it’s a pile of guts.’ Okay, this is a pile of guts. But what can we do with this? What is it going to be and, like, what does it mean to us?”
The project is partly fueled by Michigan’s goals to reduce waste going to landfills and cut emissions. The state’s climate plan aims to boost its recycling rate to 45% and cut food waste going to landfills in half from 2005 levels by 2030.
The goal is to divert materials away from landfills, where they decompose and emit large amounts of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. A few years ago, the tribe received a state grant for the fish fertilizer program of $400,000, and this year it got another for $205,000.
“Prior to this project, all of this waste was going to landfill, and this was a great way to utilize waste and create a pretty valuable product” in a region where compost can cost about $100 per yard, Derouin said. And while the tribe only just started selling the finished fertilizer this year, the project has saved them the work and money needed to bring the fish guts to the dump.
 The process, and controlling the smell

To properly handle the fish, Derouin said, they use a tractor to make an indent in a heap of sawdust, put the fish waste inside, and then cap it with more sawdust. That sawdust acts as a filter, keeping the odor down, and is critical to addressing other concerns, such as animals like bears, raccoons and vultures.
Along with the more conventional compost, the tribe is working on a liquid fertilizer.
Next to the farm sits a warehouse funded largely through a state grant where Derouin points to big plastic jugs of brown liquid that sit along one side of the room.
For one batch, they grind up about 50 gallons of fish waste and mix it with molasses and water (one part fish, one part molasses, and three parts water). Those batches will sit for two to three months.
“We’re standing next to probably about 1,200 pounds worth of rotting fish here in this barn,” Derouin said. “And it’s amazing — you can’t smell it.”
The project has led to a variety of collaborations. This summer, the agriculture department is working with a Michigan State University grad student, using both types of fertilizer at differing times and amounts to see how their squash plants will be affected. It’s also been informed by an international effort to use the entire fish.
 Using the whole fish

The 100% Great Lakes Fish Initiative, run by the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Governors & Premiers, aims to grow the region’s economy and protect its environment. More than 40 companies have signed on to its pledge to use all of the commercially caught fish, including Treaty Fish Co., a local fishery that delivers its waste to the Grand Traverse Band.
The initiative invited officials from the Great Lakes, including Derouin, to Iceland to learn about what other places were doing with their fish waste and share their own efforts. It also connected Derouin with a biochemist in Canada to work out the process for creating the hydrolysate, called enzymatic fermentation.
“It will liquefy all of the bones, the scales,” Derouin said. “The enzymes that are actually present in the fish gut utilize the molasses as an energy source to chew through all those complex proteins and fats and try to break them down and turn it into a more bio-available fertilizer product.”
Concerns that the fish would introduce heavy metals like mercury into the soil led them to get samples tested at a lab in Texas. Those tests did detect mercury in the fertilizer, and while Derouin said the levels were relatively low — with averages less than .2 parts per million over — they’ll likely keep testing.
This work also draws on Anishinaabe traditions. The Grand Traverse Band’s food sovereignty program started in 2019. Tina Frankenberger, a tribal councilor, said the Agriculture and Food Sovereignty Department has grown since it started in 2019.
“We’re there, we’re providing food for us and for the local food pantries outside of [Grand Traverse Band] that the public also utilizes when people need food,” she said. “And that’s huge, because it’s that relationship of, we all live here together, and we need to work together to make big things happen,” including the fish fertilizer project.
Frankenberger, who worked as a fisheries biologist and has been growing food since she was a kid, said using fish to nurture plants is a longstanding practice. People’s grandparents would talk about planting corn when fish called suckers were running, taking the fish, “put them in the ground when they would plant their corn.” They also told her “how that was used to fertilize the ground and that relationship.”
Anderson, the farm hand, wants to see how projects like this can help Native farmers in the area, including his family. They plan to use the fish fertilizer on their hemp farm this year.
Anderson thinks about it this way: ‘Okay, we made this, and now we can take it and feed it to our plants. And it’s just awesome.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/peshfarm-1024x683.webp,,,2025-08-14 06:56:13.572760

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom has been illegal in Indiana since 2014, but Hoosier lawmakers have recently filed legislation to reverse that. In 2023 the bill narrowly passed the House 53-40 but never received a hearing in the Senate. Legislation did not move earlier this year.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.










This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.


– Christopher R. McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida


Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

“It has increased treNC food banks can’t fill the hunger gap caused by federal cuts, state and nonprofit leaders saymendously in what people are needing,” Gregory said. “They need food, and we’re right down from Fort Bragg, so back in the past, soldiers, they didn’t need to come get food, but now we have lines and lines and lines of soldiers waiting to receive food as well.”
At the same time that the number of military families coming in has increased, Gregory said, there has been a dramatic decrease in Hispanic families visiting the nonprofit.
“They don’t come at all,” Gregory said. “I think they’re afraid we’re going to turn them in [to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers] or something.”   
Gregory spoke with NC Newsline Wednesday at the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina in Raleigh ahead of a press conference where state Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) and several nonprofit leaders discussed federal cuts to food assistance programs and how those cuts will affect families that receive help through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
SNAP benefits help 1.4 million North Carolinians put food on the table.
“We’re in the worst hunger crisis that we’ve seen in nearly 20 years and with SNAP cuts that have been passed at the federal level, we’re going to see that spike in a way that we can’t fill the gap up,” Amy Beros, CEO of the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina, said during an interview with NC Newsline.
Beros said there are more than 600,000 people in the 34 counties her agencies serve facing hunger every day. That number is up from 450,000 people two years ago, she said.
“Our partners are saying that they’re seeing anywhere from a 20% to 50% increase in just the past year of people receiving services and that’s without the cuts that have happened,” Beros said.

She said there’s no way nonprofits can fill the gap created by the budget cuts.
“It doesn’t matter how charitable a community is, we can’t fill a gap that large,” Beros said. “We are asking our state and federal leaders to understand what they’re doing, understand the ripple effects of what they’re doing and the harm it’s going to have to the whole community — not only to people facing hunger, but to retailers, our grocery stores, our healthcare system and the overall health of the community.”
Meanwhile, Grafstein said the federal cuts will devastate low income families already struggling to make ends meet.
“I don’t know how we got to the place where we have to have a press conference about the fact that it’s a good idea to make sure children have food,” Grafstein said.
Ensuring North Carolinians have food security should not be a partisan issue, Grafstein added. “These are our neighbors, there are our students, these are veterans …” she said.
Grafstein said it would cost more than $420 million to continue to provide food assistance to North Carolinians at the current level.
“Don’t trade food security for more tax cuts for the wealthy,” Grafstein said. “The $420 million that we’re talking about is less than half of what you’re [state lawmakers] are giving away in school vouchers.”
Across the country, the Trump administration is cutting a projected $300 billion from SNAP over 10 years.

Tamara Baker, project and communications director of Carolina Hunger Initiative, noted that the state received $11 million for SNAP-ED, a federally funded program that helps people learn to use limited resources to produce and prepare nutritious meals and to grow their own food to improve health and physical fitness.
Baker said the federal budget does not include SNAP-ED funding for next year.
“That investment seeded the community gardens, brought fresh produce to families and seniors and supported local farmers and taught families how to stretch their limited budgets and taught kids and all ages how to cook,” Baker said.
Gregory Jones, a member of the N.C. Child Parent Advisory Council, said he’s benefitted from SNAP as the caregiver for five grandchildren, as a college student and as a child growing up in a working household that “still needed help to put quality food on the table.”
“It was a lifeline,” Jones said. “It didn’t solve every problem but it provided just enough relief to keep us from having to make impossible choices.”
Ahead of the press conference, Neil Harrington, research director at NC Child, said that in 2022 the number of children living with food insecurity spiked by about 4 percentage points. The number has declined but still 1 in 6 children live in homes where they can’t access nutritious, adequate food on a consistent basis, Harrington said.
“Some of it is the inflation that we’ve seen over the past several years coming out of the COVID pandemic,” Harrington said. “We know food prices increased, and that was really hard for families to kind of deal with and that certainly contributed to that spike in food insecurity.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSCN0397-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-14 06:56:13.572760

One that is likely to stay with her comes from Jessica Flynn, a long-time friend and associate.
“It’s truly in my head to be like Bea,” says Flynn, the president-elect of the WCA board. “Her ability to be in a room and figure out points of collaboration is impressive. She doesn’t make it about her … she’s a connector.”
  Women’s and Children’s Alliance Executive Director Bea Black
Flynn says her nearly decade of involvement with the WCA has been because of Bea’s influence. “Domestic violence and sexual assault are uncomfortable topics, but they have to be spoken about. Part of Bea’s legacy is she has made it a topic of conversation, and that’s a credit to her.”
Another strong quality that Flynn highlights: Bea doesn’t normally use the words “I” and “me” in conversations. “We” and “us” are more to her liking when talking about the success of the WCA.
“Every person that has come in contact with her – whether it’s an employee, a board member or volunteer – leaves better for it, because they have a greater compassion for their community and a desire to give back in any way they can,” Flynn says.
Under Bea’s leadership with WCA for 17 years, there’s no telling how many lives have been drastically changed, or saved. The mission is to provide “safety, healing and freedom from domestic abuse and sexual assault.” 
The WCA operates Ada County’s only secure shelter and offers professional counseling, case management, court advocacy and other support services to survivors. With it’s 24-hour hotline, WCA’s reach goes beyond Ada County. The WCA will assist victims with finding resources anywhere in the Gem State.
Bea’s accomplishments are a mile long. She was instrumental in the building of a transitional shelter (Laura’s Home) in 2017, growing the WCA’s endowment fund to more than $3.4 million and providing services for expanded needs during the COVID crisis. The crisis hotline, which started in 2012, fields more than 4,400 calls annually.
Much will be said in the coming months about all those achievements. But there are human victories worth celebrating as well.
“Through her leadership, countless domestic violence survivors start new lives filled with dignity and hope,” says Debra Leithauser, the board president. “It’s impossible to quantify her impact.”
Now it’s time for Bea to focus on other life ventures, such as spending more time with her growing number of grandchildren. Her husband is retired, and they’d like to do some traveling.
Good for her.
“I’ve been honored and humbled to do this important work for almost two decades,” she says. “I am so proud of the impact the team at the WCA has had on the lives of so many. Letting survivors know they are not alone has inspired me every day.”
And the inspiration will continue right to the end. Retirement comes in June, which gives the board time to find another CEO. Bea has established a history of success at the WCA, and she’s seeing to it that the organization – if anything – will become better.
“That tells something about her character,” Flynn says.
I have a hunch that my friend, Jess, isn’t the only one who wants to be like Bea.

(Quenton King | Courtesy photo)A federal rule to limit coal miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust — which was set to go into effect next week after already being delayed for months — is expected to be further postponed following a joint status update filed in federal court this week.
Now, the rule’s implementation will be pushed until at least October, according to the court filing.
Silica dust exposure is a significant driver of black lung disease among coal miners. 
The silica dust rule was initially finalized last spring and was meant to go into effect for coal mines in April 2025. But that didn’t happen. 
That month, several industry groups filed a request with the federal 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to block the rule’s implementation, citing the high costs for mine operators to comply and challenges posed by turnover within the Trump administration. 
A federal judge granted an emergency stay to postpone the rule until August.
According to the joint status report filed this week, the parties in the case — led by the National Sand, Stone and Gravel Association against the federal Department of Labor and the Mine Health and Safety Administration — “are still discussing potential settlement of the petitions, and those discussions are ongoing.” 
The implementation will be suspended until at least Oct. 17, with another status update scheduled on Oct. 10. MSHA, according to its website, has yet to publicly alert stakeholders of this second postponement. Representatives for MSHA could not be reached for comment.
The finalized rule would be the first of its kind for silica dust in mines, despite evidence existing for decades showing the dangers of exposure and other industries already enforcing exposure limits due to these risks. 
It would cut silica dust exposure limits in half for miners and implement new action levels when a certain amount of silica dust is present in mines. It would also require mine operators and companies to offer free medical monitoring for their workers with the hope of detecting black lung and other respiratory diseases earlier.
‘The wind is out of my sails:’ Advocates frustrated, discouraged over pushback on rule
The further delay of the rule is a serious concern for advocates and others who work with people diagnosed with black lung. 
Lisa Emery, director of the New River Health Breathing Center and Black Lung Clinic, has worked on black lung as a registered respiratory therapist in Southern West Virginia for nearly 10 years. This summer, Emery was selected to serve as the chair for the National Coalition of Black Lung and Respiratory Disease Clinics.
When the silica dust rule was first finalized last year, Emery said it felt like “finishing a marathon.” So much work and time had gone into developing the rule — from miners, from care providers, from researchers and more over several years. Seeing it finalized and actually about to go into effect was a relief, Emery said.
“We were crossing that finish line. We had so much hope and this was one of the biggest steps toward improving coal miners’ health that we could have hoped for,” Emery said. “It needed to happen and it did. We were just so excited for it.”
But now, as the government continues to delay implementation and the courts consider reviewing the rule, Emery said it’s hard not to feel discouraged.
“Now, I feel like the wind is out of my sails,” Emery said. “We were crossing a finish line, we were about to win the race, right? And in that last stretch, the wind is just totally out of our sails. It’s hard not to be upset about that.”
Gary Hairston, president of the National Black Lung Association, said the disappointments from elected officials and the government generally are becoming more difficult to bear. 
A miner for 30 years, Hairston was diagnosed with black lung in his late 40s. 
He kept working underground even after the spot on his lung was found by doctors. One day, running up the stairs to avoid rain at his mine, he ran out of breath so severely he thought he was going to die. Soon after, he fell ill with pneumonia.
“For almost a year, I was in and out of the hospital every week, back and forth,” Hairston said. “When I got better, everything had changed. I tried to go back to work, but the [doctor] told me I wouldn’t get better — I’d need oxygen all the time, it was going to only get worse.”
There is no cure for black lung disease. The best way to prevent it from developing into a more complicated form is to limit exposure to silica dust.
Hairston has now been retired from coal mines for almost two decades. Over that time, he’s transitioned from working for mine operators to working for coal miners, advocating wherever and whenever possible for better protections and services for people with and at risk of developing black lung.
Hairston said he used to have faith that the political system — or at least representatives within it — wanted to help coal miners like him.
Now, though, that faith is becoming harder and harder to keep, Hairston said.
“The [people] at the agency meant to protect us [MSHA] are the same ones who [historically] served coal companies,” Hairston said. “How do you trust that, have faith in that? How can you think that’s someone who wants us safe and healthy?”
James McHugh, the deputy assistant secretary for MSHA, was formerly an attorney with the Charleston-based Pence Law Firm PLLC, where coal companies were often clients, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail. 
He also served as an executive at an industrial trade group that filed formal comments against the silica dust rule, namely its strengthened exposure limits and new penalty provisions for mine operators that fail to comply, while MSHA was drafting it in 2023.
Last month, seven of the 21 Republican members of the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce sent a letter to McHugh at MSHA asking him to consider amending the silica dust rule as it “places undue and excessive burdens on the mining industry.”
They said doing so would be appropriate given the Trump Administration’s focus on industry deregulation and — while noting nothing about the health risks and outcomes of black lung disease — said the rule “excludes commonsense practices” like rotating shifts in dustier parts of mines and enforcing the use of respirators in areas with high dust.
Emery said such protections aren’t exactly practical; something shared numerous times by leading respiratory experts in public comments given to MSHA during the creation of the silica dust rule.
Rotating shifts, for example, would mean exposing even more miners to silica dust over time. Those who work in other parts of the mine without dust would have to then be in dustier parts, increasing their exposure, and workers would need to be trained on numerous jobs instead of focusing on the ones they are best equipped to do.
And for respirators to work adequately, miners would have to get a proper fit test to ensure their efficacy. Anyone with a beard would not have an adequate fit and someone would need to be responsible for enforcing their use — which could potentially interfere with communication critical to protecting safety and performing jobs while workers are underground in a loud environment.
Emery also said she’s assessed miners with black lung who have used respirators while underground.
“Their scans still came up positive,” Emery said.
For Hairston, the lack of urgency expressed not only by MSHA but also elected officials who he feels should prioritize miners’ safety is disconcerting. Miners, he said, are the only ones who make coal mining and the economic and energy benefits that politicians say come with it possible.
“None of these things they want to happen work without miners and they just use us and use us as props,” Hairston said. “They say they want more coal, want more workers, want more mines — they promise it [in] their campaigns. Well, who are those workers going to be? We only hear them talk about us when the elections come around. They don’t care about the coal miners, only the coal mines. When does that end?”

Protecting the next generation and learning from the toll put on the past
Today, Hairston is facing a difficult decision: whether to commit to using an oxygen tank full time in order to maintain his breathing.
He currently uses oxygen while sleeping. Sometimes throughout the day, especially if doing laborious activities, he’ll use it as needed.
“It’s hard for me to think about being tied to that thing all the time; It’ll completely change my life again,” Hairston said. “I’m still very active — as much as I can be. That’s a big change to how I can move and what I can do if I’ve got to pull around a tank with me everywhere I go.”
It’s a balancing act, Hairston said, to decide when he’s hit his limit. He knows he’s living with a lifelong condition and 24/7 oxygen will be inevitable one day. He’s just not ready to accept that today is that day.
He wants to see younger miners — those just entering the industry or who will in coming years — not be faced with the same inevitability.
But the more time that goes by without regulation on exposure to silica dust means more miners will develop the disease early, Emery said.
More than 40% of the black lung screenings done at her clinic last year came up positive for the disease. 
“If you think about the numbers that we’re seeing right now, we haven’t peaked,” Emery said. “Even if [the silica dust rule] gets implemented tomorrow, there’s still going to have to be massive changes.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of coal miners in Central Appalachia are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
Emery sees firsthand what a diagnosis can do to people. In the worst cases, it means lives are cut short. In cases caught earlier, the diagnosis still can mean lifestyle changes and adjustments that can be hard for many to accept.
In her office in Oak Hill, West Virginia, she said a regular part of her job is delivering this kind of bad news. She sits and consoles miners — and their families — who are struggling to come to terms with having the disease.
Through tears, she said it never quite gets easier hearing people talk about the parts of their lives that are being robbed from them by black lung and the complications that come with it.
In recent years, these conversations have become more frequent with younger miners. It’s not just grandparents struggling to keep up with young grandchildren anymore; it’s fathers in their 40s and 50s unable to play with their own children, keep up on family vacations or participate in activities their healthy peers enjoy — playing sports, yardwork, home projects. 
Miners across Appalachia are being diagnosed with black lung at younger ages than their predecessors due to a lack of easily accessible coal. Now, they must dig through more silica-rich sandstone to reach the coal that remains.
“This is not just your grandfather’s disease anymore,” Emery said. “It’s your husband’s disease, it’s your brother’s disease, it’s your son’s disease right now, and it’s affecting all of them.”
As time goes on, the consequences of this will grow.
That’s what is so critical about the silica dust rule, Emery said. It’s already too late to protect many of the miners who are working underground now, but the future generations and those recently entering the industry could be saved from developing black lung.
“When the rule is in effect, it will take a while but we will start to see the trail off of disease,” Emery said. “But it is going to take a while to start seeing true change from a newer generation of coal miners coming in. That’s the immediacy here.”
Knowing there is something that could be done to stop this disease from impacting younger generations in the same way as their predecessors is frustrating, Emery said. 
At 48 years old — the same age Hairston was when he was first diagnosed with black lung disease — she foresees many more years in the respiratory health field. Already, she’s seen so many changes occur; miners are more likely to get screened now than in the past, stigma is slowly dissipating over receiving such screenings and, when they do come back positive, there’s more of a willingness for miners to practice their Part 90 rights to transfer to a different, less dusty part of a mine to protect themselves.
But still, she sees so much more that could be done if the willingness to do so existed.
She hopes that, when the time comes for her to retire, she’s treating people in a different environment. One where there’s widespread acceptance and recognition of the importance of preventing black lung and what the costs are if it isn’t stopped.
“I’m hoping by the time I retire, that I’m not giving as much bad news in my line of work, that’s what I wish for,” Emery said. “I love the work I do, I know I’m helping this community and I want to do that as long as I can — I will do that. I want to see us trend in the right direction instead of the wrong direction. We know it’s possible.”

Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.
In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
‘The world has changed’
While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.










Everybody understands what’s at stake now.

Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
Free speech argument
Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
A Republican loss
In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

Mike Flood.","Eric Moyer is running against Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Flood. (Courtesy of Alyson Edie Photography)LINCOLN – The Nebraska Democrats have their man in eastern Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District: Eric Moyer is running against Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Flood. 
The bid by Moyer, who works in the renewable energy industry, comes shortly after Flood’s town hall in Lincoln, which drew national headlines and attention on social media for Democratic frustration with him. 
Moyer said he is running because the district isn’t getting “adequate representation.” He is formally announcing his bid Thursday evening in Lincoln.
“I think folks are hungry for an alternative to the status quo,” Moyer told the Examiner.
Economic focus
Moyer is running as an outsider, on a platform that focuses on building an economy that works for all Nebraskans, pushing back against trickle-down economics, advocating for affordable healthcare as a right and exploring alternative energy sources.

The 1st District comprises 12 Nebraska counties, including Lancaster County, home to Lincoln, the state’s second-most populous. But Lincoln’s heavily Democratic area is drowned out by more conservative rural and suburban regions, including Flood’s home turf of northeast Nebraska. 
The seat is considered safely Republican by the nonpartisan Center for Politics, The Cook Political Report and Inside Elections. Flood has won his past two elections by 20 and 16 percentage points. But Moyer said he is confident that he has a path to victory.
“Nebraska is a challenging state to develop renewable energy projects. I’ve been doing it for eight years,” Moyer said. “Don’t tell me I can’t do something.”
‘Secret Sauce’
Moyer won’t reveal the “secret sauce” of campaign strategy he plans to use, but points to the current political climate surrounding President Donald Trump’s budget and tax bill that passed earlier this summer, the one the president calls “big” and “beautiful.”
Republicans in Congress are currently trying to sell Trump’s domestic agenda to constituents, which polling indicates is unpopular among Americans. Flood faced jeers as he defended voting for the Trump mega bill, which may have helped his standing with Republicans. Moyer called Flood’s vote “tone deaf.”
“He’s doubled down on policies that do not meet the expectations of voters,” Moyer said. “By voting against the interests of the people of this district, it’s pretty doggone clear that he is not representing the needs of the folks in Lancaster County or the other 11, for that matter.” 
Trump’s performance will likely be a main focus of the 2026 midterms. State and national Republican strategists said focusing on specific provisions could help improve the public’s perception of the law, as they bank on the idea that long-term messaging about the bill could turn around public perception.  
“Nebraska can lead the way,” Moyer said. “We have the ability to do so much more as a state and have so much more of a voice in national politics, and I hope to give us that.”

Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.
In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
 ‘The world has changed’

While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.












Everybody understands what’s at stake now.

Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
 Free speech argument

Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
 A Republican loss

In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

(Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images)The White House recently announced a review of Smithsonian museums and exhibits, stating, “As we prepare to celebrate the 250th anniversary of our Nation’s founding, it is more important than ever that our national museums reflect the unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story.” As a West Virginia native, such an audit makes me uneasy. It reminds me of the censorship enacted upon our state’s labor history. And as a current West Virginia studies teacher, it reminds me of the importance for all social studies educators to teach hard, honest history in our classrooms, devoid of propaganda or a political agenda. 
A 2023 op-ed in the New York Times explored how West Virginia’s history was censored. In the piece, Cassady Rosenblum, another West Virginia native, discusses the history of 1921’s Battle of Blair Mountain, when union coal miners in West Virginia took up arms against coal operators and the lawmen in their pockets. Nowadays, the battle is remembered as the largest armed uprising in our nation’s history since the Civil War. 
However, as Rosenblum points out, in the initial decades following Blair Mountain, state officials did everything they could to erase it from public record. “Following the Battle of Blair Mountain,” Rosenblum writes, “West Virginia kept any mention of labor conflict out of its textbooks for more than 50 years, and in many schools it is still absent.”
Whether knowingly or unknowingly, the state’s history teachers themselves played a major part in this cover-up. Rosenblum cites a 2020 paper, “Forgetting the Mine Wars: Erasing Insurrection in West Virginia History,” which explains how, in the 1920s, Phil Conley developed a West Virginia state history textbook at the behest of coal operators and leaders in state government. In addition to the textbook, Conley also created the Golden Horseshoe test, which measures a West Virginia student’s knowledge of state history. The test is still administered today. Interestingly, though, Conley’s textbook made no mention of the Battle of Blair Mountain or the broader conflict known as the Mine Wars, instead only focusing on the vital necessity of the coal industry to the state’s economy while ignoring its costs for working people.
In her autobiography, Mary Harris “Mother” Jones described the control the coal companies had over the miners in those days, a control that only seemed to grow stronger throughout the 20th century. “Men who live up those lonely creeks have only the mine owners’ Y.M.C.A.s, the mine owners’ preachers and teachers, the mine owners’ doctors and newspapers to look to for their ideas,” Jones wrote. “So they don’t get many.” Worth noting is that Jones was arrested multiple times in West Virginia while helping miners unionize and protest.
What did all of this censorship lead to? It led to the coal industry’s stranglehold on West Virginia. It led to deaths in the mines, like the Farmington Mine Disaster or the more recent Upper Big Branch Mine Disaster. It led to the death of 125 people in the Buffalo Creek flood. It led to countless more deaths from black lung and a lack of economic diversification that now has given way to poverty and addiction, resulting in “diseases of despair.” It led to a foster care crisis, in which West Virginia’s number of children in foster care is four times higher than the national average. It led to West Virginians believing that a billionaire from New York had their best interests at heart because he visited the state and donned a hard hat. A hundred years ago, West Virginia workers fought such billionaires; now, they applaud them.
And what does all of this look like when played out on a national level, as we are starting to see now with the censorship at museums and national parks? We can look to countries like North Korea, Saudi Arabia, China, and Cuba as examples, all of which were ranked in the top ten most censored countries by the Committee to Protect Journalists. In China, that has meant an increase of arrests and deportations for foreign teachers. In Cuba, a teacher was sentenced to 20 years in prison because he was labeled a dissident. In Saudi Arabia, a retired teacher was sentenced to death for criticizing the Saudi government on social media.
Of course, some people will likely think I’m exaggerating. They may say, “Those countries aren’t like the United States. That can’t happen here.” 
Look at West Virginia. It already has.

This image is known as the ""lost ambrotype."" (Library of Congress)There’s historical precedent for Texas House Democrats vamoosing to deny Republicans the quorum they need to carry out President Trump’s order and redraw the Lone Star State’s congressional map to flip five seats from blue to red before next year’s midterm elections. 
Some of the Texans fled to Illinois, where in December, 1840, a 31-year-old Kentucky-born Whig state representative jumped out a window to thwart a quorum House Democrats needed to pass a bill undermining the Bank of Illinois, a Whig pet.
The solon’s name was Abraham Lincoln. 
His unorthodox exit went for naught because he had been marked present. The majority Democrats corralled enough members for a quorum, and the anti-bank bill passed 46-15.
Understandably, it’s been claimed that Lincoln leapt from the Illinois statehouse, which is preserved as the Old State Capitol Historic Site. He didn’t. He bailed from a church window. 
Springfield is the capital of Illinois. But in late 1840, the legislature was meeting in the old First Methodist Church while work crews were putting the finishing touches on the Capitol a block away. (The building was replaced by the current Capitol in 1876.)
The church was too small and ill equipped to adequately accommodate the lawmakers, which “added to the confusion Lincoln encountered as leader of the minority Whig party,” explains a plaque on a downtown building now on the church site. 
The blue-framed “Looking for Lincoln” tablet is titled “Leaping Lincoln.”

Trey Martinez Fischer, right, listen as Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu speaks to reporters during a press conference on Aug. 3, 2025 in Carol Stream, Illinois.

On Dec. 5, 1840, the Democratic majority was set to approve the bank-busting bill. The Whigs decided to make themselves scarce, thus preventing a quorum. “Only Lincoln and a few lieutenants remained to observe,” according to the plaque. 
When Lincoln and other Whig bigwigs discovered the Democrats had a quorum after all, they ran for the door, which was barred. In desperation, Lincoln leapt, followed by Joseph Gillespie and Asahel Gridley. 
The State Register, a devoutly Democratic newspaper in Springfield, gleefully reported the incident: “A laughable circumstance took place while the yeas and nays were being called on the passage of the resolution. Mr Lincoln of Sangamon (Lincoln lived in Springfield, the Sangamon County seat), who was present during the whole scene, and who appeared to enjoy the embarrassment of the House, suddenly looked very grave after the Speaker announced that a quorum was present. The conspiracy having failed, Mr Lincoln came under great excitement, and having attempted and failed to get out of the door, very unceremoniously raised the window and jumped out, followed by one or two other members.”
It was a first floor window, said to be only 4 or 5 feet from the ground. 
According to the paper, “This gymnastic performance of Mr Lincoln and his flying brethren, did not occur until after they had voted! and consequently the House did not interfere with their extraordinary feat.” 
Why congressional redistricting is blowing up across the US this summer

The State Register confessed, “We have not learned whether these flying members got hurt in their adventure, and we think it probable that one of them came off without damage, as it was noticed that his legs reached nearly from the window to the ground!”
The paper further lampooned the 6-foot-4 Lincoln, declaring it had heard “that a resolution will probably be introduced into the House this week to inquire into the expediency of raising the State House one story higher, in order to have the House set in the third story! so as to prevent members from jumping out of the window! If such a resolution passes, Mr Lincoln will in the future have to climb down the spout!” 
The plaque also says that “an embarrassed Lincoln ever after resented references to what he called that ‘jumping scape.’ ” But he had the last laugh 20 years later when Free State voters sent him to the White House. (He polled just 1,366 votes in slave state Kentucky.) 
Historians rank “The Great Emancipator” as one of our greatest presidents because he led the Union to victory in the Civil War and put slavery on the road to extinction. (Illinois towns were named for Gillespie and Gridley.)

The latter have asked for the highest rate increases in more than a decade, anticipating major financial losses after federal tax credits expire.
“It’s always a very complicated balancing act,” King said in an interview Tuesday. “If premiums are too low, insurers risk substantial losses, which could undermine their financial condition and force them to cut reimbursements to providers, or limit care. Neither of those are good for consumers.”

Indeed, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island and Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island used this logic to ask King to approve their requests for double-digit rate increases for the more than 50,000 people combined who buy insurance through HealthSource RI.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha says the exact opposite: letting insurance companies raise insurance prices for consumers will undermine, and potentially cripple, the already fragile health care system. 
“For a long time, this process has focused too heavily on making sure our insurers have everything they need,” Neronha said in an interview. “Insurers just keep on winning.”










For a long time, this process has focused too heavily on making sure our insurers have everything they need. Insurers just keep on winning.


– Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha on Rhode Island’s annual insurance rate review 


If granted, Blue Cross’ proposed 28.9% increase would increase individual, annual premiums by $2,500, with a $7,000 average hike per household, according to analysis by Neronha’s office. Neighborhood asked for a 21.2% increase, which translates to a $1,000 average annual increase in individual premiums and nearly $4,000 more per household, as calculated by Neronha’s office. 
“It cannot be the sole obligation of individual health care consumers to pay more every year into a system that is failing,” Neronha wrote in the July 30 briefings, urging King to reject Blue Cross and Neighborhood’s proposed hikes for individual insurance coverage. “Granting the proposed rate increase would exacerbate the current, dire situation of health care in Rhode Island and ripple through the system.”
Ahead of an early September decision on requested rate hikes, King said he could not comment on Neronha’s objections.

A delicate dance 
It’s hardly the first time King has contended with dueling narratives between insurers and Neronha’s office. Every year, insurers ask for permission to increase annual premiums on the 170,000 Rhode Islanders covered through insurance-funded plans. (Self-funded insurance in which employers assume the financial risk for the medical costs are not subject to state review on rate hikes). And each of the last four years, Neronha urged King to deny the requested increases entirely.
The approved rates usually fall somewhere between the opposing sides: granting some increase, but less than what insurers wanted. 
Neronha expects the same result again this year.
“There’s no doubt in my mind that the commissioner will not give them a 30% increase,” he said in an interview. “The insurance companies will silently cheer because even if they don’t get 30%, they will get 20% or something like that.”
The state health insurance commissioner is required by law to guard the solvency of insurance companies. But they also cannot legally approve a requested rate hike not proven to be “consistent with the interests of the public.”
At least twice in King’s 11 year tenure as health insurance commissioner, he has approved lower rates than the prior year. More often, he trims from the portion related to non-medical expenses; for the last two years, for example, fully-funded insurers were forced to limit growth in administrative costs to match the rate of inflation.
When OHIC unveiled the proposed 2026 rate hikes in June, Neronha’s office initially declined to weigh in, opting to forgo its usual independent, actuarial analysis of the financials.
Instead, the AG hired a health economist, with the hope that the contextual expertise might break through the cacophony of competing numbers.
“Actuarial analysis is a very numbers driven, data driven, narrow view of the world,” Neronha said. “It doesn’t make sense in the broader context of how we view health care. An economist can tell us what’s affordable, and what isn’t.”
Yet numbers are, ultimately, the only concrete source for the health insurance commissioner to determine what’s the right balance between insurance companies’ solvency and consumer costs, said Robert Hackey, a health sciences processor at Providence College.
“You can’t make public policy based on what you wish the world looked like,” Hackey said. “You have to make policy based on what the conditions are on the ground.”
And all sides agree, the conditions are expensive.

The cost of care
The end-of-year expiration to federal tax credits under the Affordable Care Act will cut off nearly $40 million in subsidies for Rhode Island, increasing the average monthly premium for covered residents by 85%, or $104, according to analysis by HealthSource RI.
As premiums rise, HealthSource estimates 13,000 people will be unable to afford coverage, or opt to forgo it — the latter mostly younger, healthier ones who feel more comfortable taking the risk. That increases the concentration of older, sicker — and more medically expensive — people left for insurers to cover.
“The principal cause of rising costs isn’t price gauging or greedy insurers,” Hackey said. “It’s the fact that insurance costs continue to rise.”
Nearly one-third of Blue Cross’ requested rate hike and 25% of Neighborhood’s proposal stem from losing participants after federal tax credits expire, according to analysis from King’s office.
At the same time, medical treatments — from routine visits to prescription drugs and the increasing prevalence of specialty treatments like GLP-1 drugs most commonly used for weight loss and diabetes — have soared. More than 10% of Blue Cross’ proposed rate increase — the largest chunk — comes from increasing health care costs. A new state requirement calling for a 30% boost to commercial reimbursement rates to primary care providers starting in January accounted for another fifth of Blue Cross’ requested increase.
“The requested rates reflect the true cost of healthcare and are critical to protect BCBSRI members’ access to high-quality, affordable care,” Rich Salit, a spokesperson for the insurance company, said in an emailed statement.
Elizabeth McClaine, vice president of commercial and Medicaid products for Neighborhood, also defended the company’s proposed 2026 rates in a statement.
Insurance companies nationwide are facing similar challenges. On average, Affordable Care Act marketplace insurers have proposed raising premiums by 26% next year, according to an analysis by KFF of 312 insurers across 50 states and D.C. The proposed rate hikes range widely, from over 50% by five separate insurance companies in Arkansas, to a 10% drop by one Pennsylvania marketplace insurer. 
 In Massachusetts, proposed rates by marketplace participants ranged from 7-12%, while Connecticut insurers requested increases of 4.7% to 28.6% for marketplace plans.
“We look good compared with a lot of states,” Hackey said.

Approaching the brink 
Yet Rhode Island’s health care system is more precarious than some, with lower provider reimbursement rates relative to neighboring states sapping its workforce and flooding the remaining providers, including hospitals, with sick patients.
Commercial insurance premiums influence how much providers get reimbursed; cut too much off of insurers’ rates, and providers will suffer, Hackey warned. That, or they will walk away — either from specific providers, or the state altogether.
Just look to UnitedHealthcare and Brown University Health, which were unable to reach agreement on reimbursement rates for Rhode Island Medicare Advantage patients. The contract ended on June 30, prompting confusion and chaos for thousands of seniors and disabled residents no longer covered for non-emergency visits at four major hospitals.
Two other safety net hospitals, Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital, remain at risk of closing if the prospective new owners can’t sell the bonds needed to finalize the deal, or subsequently shore up the lopsided balance sheets.
Reconciling the competing interests and preserving critical care is not a simple, or easy task. But Hackey was confident King was up to the challenge
Neronha, not so much.
“Part of me thinks this whole thing is ridiculous and illegitimate that we shouldn’t be doing a review at all,” he said.  
Neronha pointed to Blue Cross’ balance sheet, with more than $1 billion in assets, in juxtaposition to working families facing health care costs that could swallow one-third of their annual income if proposed rate hikes are approved, according to his office’s analysis.
The state health insurance commissioner will also issue a decision in September on requested increases for employer-sponsored coverage through small and large group plans. In the small group market, Blue Cross requested a 22.2% increase, Neighborhood asked for 20.3% premium increase and UnitedHealthcare submitted a range of 20.3% to 21.2%. For plans purchased by businesses with more than 100 employees, rate hikes range from 13.5% to 26.4% across five insurers: Blue Cross, UnitedHealthcare, Harvard Pilgrim, Aetna and Cigna.
The AG’s office has not weighed in on small and large group rate requests.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Just minutes from luxury downtown and university campuses in downtown Providence, lies a starkly different reality in the city’s North End. Providence is made up of 25 neighborhoods. The North End — which includes Wanskuck and Charles — houses nearly 19,000 people. Once home to factory workers, the area’s social demographics have shifted after years of underinvestment and aging infrastructure. It has become a refuge for vulnerable communities seeking affordable housing, including older adults, minorities, immigrants, and low-income families.
Disparities and social service gaps here were identified in a recent community needs assessment (CNA) conducted by the local nonprofit organization, the DaVinci Center for Community Progress. 
Let’s take a look at the data:

Poverty: Rhode Island’s poverty rate is 10.8%; in Providence, it’s 17.5%. In Wanskuck and Charles, it rises to 33% (2023 U.S. Census Bureau; O’Brien, Bates College). 
Uninsured residents: About 5% of Rhode Islanders are uninsured, compared to 9% in Providence and 12% in Wanskuck and Charles (CNA, DaVinci Center, 2024).
Eviction rate: The statewide average is 4%, while in North End Providence, it exceeds 7% (CNA, DaVinci Center, 2024).
Rent burden: Approximately 30% of Rhode Islanders spend more than 30% of their income on housing. In Providence, this number rises to 44%, in Wanskuck and Charles, it is 52% (CNA, DaVinci Center, 2024).

It is no surprise that this part of the city also experiences safety issues. The community needs assessment revealed that residents reported seeing signs of drug use and violence on the streets, which discouraged them from leaving their homes. Street safety concerns were consistent across all age groups, including youth, adults, and seniors.
These disparities are not random; they are interconnected and rooted in the social determinants of health: access to housing, education, employment, language, and social services. When these needs remain unmet, the result is not just poor health, it’s a cycle of deepening crisis. And it is precisely the barriers that were identified by residents themselves. Out of 388 survey participants, 50 focus group attendees, and 12 key stakeholder interviews, the most frequently requested services were:

Youth programs: after-school support, career exploration, internships, safe spaces for teen socialization, programs to address mental health and bullying in schools, and technology training (including AI and digital literacy) 
Seniors programs: social activities to reduce isolation, health and wellness checks and services, home visits, access to dental care, technology and digital literacy classes to access digital health services, and reliable transportation
Family support: counseling, referrals, parenting classes, culturally sensitive outreach, English language classes, financial literacy workshops, family-strengthening initiatives, workforce development
Basic needs: access to food, hygiene products, diapers, and personal care services

  Preventive care is especially crucial for older adults. That’s why the DaVinci Center is exploring ways to offer on-site health-related programs, says Executive Director Norma Gonzalez. (Photo Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)
“These findings aren’t just data for us – they tell the stories of our neighbors and serve as a guide for action,” DaVinci Center Executive Director Norma Gonzalez said. “For example, CNA showed that transportation issues are widespread, and most preventive care facilities are not within walking distance of many residents. We all understand the importance of preventive care at any age, and it is especially crucial for older adults. The DaVinci Center is now exploring ways to offer on-site health-related programs.
The DaVinci Center is the only community center in the neighborhood. Its current focus is providing food-related services to senior residents. Our community needs assessment showed that it carries the responsibility to increase services provided and to advocate for the community.
“We have to break this cycle of trauma and neglect,” Gonzalez said. “But we can’t do it by ourselves. We need our leaders to act now and develop a community plan that is actionable and sustainable”.
There is a gap in addressing social determinants of health in neighborhoods like the North End of Providence. Even more concerning is the absence of sustained, long-term policies to support essential infrastructure — neighborhood centers, job readiness programs, and access to health services. It is worth emphasizing that all residents of Rhode Island — regardless of ZIP code — deserve access to nutritious food, stable housing, preventive care, and opportunities across generations. All of us at the DaVinci Center hope that our leaders will pay attention not only to new research in academia or downtown development, but also to neighborhoods like the North End of Providence. 
After all, policies are not just plans — they are commitments to dignity, equity, and the future of our communities.

Raised in northern Virginia by a single mother while her father was incarcerated for most of her childhood, Higgins had graduated high school but was stuck — “feeling stagnant,” she recalls — without the money, guidance, or stability to take her next step.
What she found at Job Corps was more than a career training program. It was housing, meals, structure, and a support network — the basics she needed to focus on learning skills and rebuilding her confidence.
“Job Corps bridged the gap between high school and the next chapters of my life,” she said. “This program doesn’t just teach trades; it saves lives by meeting people where they are, providing stability, and instilling the belief that they can succeed.”
Fifteen years later, Higgins is a licensed social worker with a doctorate, a U.S. Army veteran, and an adjunct professor at three universities. She’s also a wife and mother of two.

And now, as the U.S. Department of Labor presses forward with plans to pause operations at contractor-run Job Corps centers nationwide — including Old Dominion and Blue Ridge in Virginia — she’s worried the same lifeline that helped her could be ripped away for thousands of young people.
“The proposed closure of Job Corps centers would be devastating,” Higgins said. “Closing the doors will close doors on countless opportunities for individuals to gain the tools and resources they need to turn their lives around. The ripple effect of that loss would be felt for generations.”
 A sudden national directive

On May 29, the Department of Labor (DOL) verbally notified all Job Corps contractors that operations at 99 centers across the country would end immediately “for convenience.” Written orders followed within hours, instructing operators to start dismissing students by June 2 and fully close by June 6.
The move would have displaced roughly 35,000 students nationwide — about one in five of them homeless or housing insecure — along with thousands of employees.
The DOL framed the decision as a “phased pause” to allow an “orderly transition,” citing a $140 million program deficit in 2024 and a projected $213 million deficit in 2025. An internal review, officials said, had raised concerns about safety incidents, low graduation rates and high costs.
“Job Corps was created to help young adults build a pathway to a better life,” Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in the announcement. “However, a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes students deserve.”
The department pointed to 2023 metrics showing an average graduation rate of 38.6% and an average annual cost of over $80,000 per student. Chavez-DeRemer said the administration remains committed to helping affected students connect with other education and employment opportunities.
 Court steps in

The closures haven’t happened — yet. On June 3, a federal judge granted a Temporary Restraining Order halting the DOL’s action.
Later in June, the court issued a national preliminary injunction keeping the centers open while lawsuits proceed. More than 20 state attorneys general filed briefs supporting the challenge, arguing the closures would cause “devastating harm” to vulnerable youth and local economies. Members of Virginia’s congressional delegation are also weighing in.
U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, chair of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said the abruptness of the DOL’s decision raised serious legal and ethical concerns.
“The decision was made abruptly without notice and put a lot of people kind of in a lurch,” Scott said in an interview with The Mercury shortly before he hosted a workforce community forum in his district earlier this week.
“Many people participating in Job Corps actually live on campus,” Scott said. “So when you close the campus, you really put them out on the street.”

Scott noted that Job Corps is funded by law and that the administration has a legal duty to operate it.
“These are opportunities people have been given,” he said. “To qualify for Job Corps, you have to be out of school, not working. You’re given an opportunity to develop skills for high-demand jobs. To take that away overnight makes no sense.”
 Three centers, hundreds of students

Launched in 1964 as part of then-President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty campaign, the Job Corps program was created under the Economic Opportunity Act to provide free education and vocational training to disadvantaged young Americans.
Designed as a residential program modeled partly after the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s, it aimed to tackle both youth unemployment and skills shortages in the economy.
Over the decades, Job Corps has evolved to meet shifting workforce demands, adding training in fields like health care, information technology, and advanced manufacturing while maintaining its original mission of lifting young people out of poverty through hands-on skills training and supportive services.
Virginia’s three Job Corps facilities — Old Dominion in Monroe, Blue Ridge near Marion, and Flatwoods Civilian Conservation Center in Coeburn — collectively serve hundreds of students each year. Between July and April, Old Dominion and Blue Ridge enrolled 308 students.
Together, they house about 163 at a time, many of them without stable housing or family support. Each center specializes in training tied to regional job markets, from construction and manufacturing to health care and conservation work.
The pause order immediately threatened two of those facilities — Old Dominion and Blue Ridge — which fall under the contractor-run category targeted by the DOL. Flatwoods, run by the U.S. Forest Service, remains unaffected.
For rural communities like Amherst County and Smyth County, these centers are more than education hubs. They pump an average of $10 million a year into their local economies, employing about 150 people each, and contracting with dozens of local vendors. Graduates contribute millions more through their increased earning potential.
 Economic shockwaves

Scott said shutting down centers wouldn’t just hurt students — it would ripple through local economies.
“In the communities where they exist, you’ve got a lot of people not working who are on the way to having high-demand jobs where they can contribute to the economy,” he said. “You have employers who rely on Job Corps to fill vacancies that are otherwise hard to fill.”
U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Virginia Democrats, blasted the administration’s move as “incredibly short-sighted.”
“For decades, the Job Corps program has transformed lives in Virginia and across the country by helping to equip young people with the skills and resources they need to succeed,” Warner said in a statement in May. “We should be investing more in opportunities that lift up our young people, strengthen our workforce, and have a tremendous economic impact in the commonwealth.”
Kaine called Job Corps “a lifeline” for at-risk youth. “Instead of working to further invest in the program, the Labor Department has made the shameful choice to give up on thousands of vulnerable young Americans,” he said.

Nationwide, Job Corps trains tens of thousands of young adults annually in more than 100 trades across 10 industries — from welding and construction to nursing and homeland security.
Over 80% of graduates find employment within six months, according to federal data.
Scott said that the pipeline is critical for Virginia industries already struggling to find qualified workers. In Hampton Roads, for example, shipbuilding and repair companies face chronic shortages. “Job Corps is very helpful in providing employees that can help in high-demand areas,” he said.
Without it, Scott warned, “you’re not just hurting the individuals. You’re hurting businesses that can’t meet their work requirements.”
The DOL’s Transparency Report, however, painted a grim picture: high per-student costs, low graduation rates, and more than 14,900 “serious incident” reports in 2023, including 372 sexual assaults, 1,764 acts of violence, and 2,702 drug use cases.
Supporters acknowledge the program isn’t perfect but say its flaws should be addressed through reform, not elimination. Warner and Kaine both said fiscal and safety concerns “need to be addressed” — but argued the answer isn’t closing doors on those who have nowhere else to go.
Scott echoed that sentiment. “If you’re going to phase out a program, you do it in a way that people aren’t harmed,” he said. “This was just an order to shut down without any consideration of the consequences.”
 Political and legal stakes

With the injunction in place, Job Corps centers remain open — for now. But the reprieve is temporary, and the legal battle could drag on for months.
Scott said Congress already acted to protect the program by funding it in the current appropriations bill. “That’s the law of the land,” he said. If the Trump administration wants to rescind the money, “there’s a process for that, and I can pretty much guarantee it wouldn’t pass. There’s too much bipartisan support.”
The Mercury has reached out to Republican members of Virginia’s congressional delegation — U.S. Reps. Ben Cline, John McGuire, and Morgan Griffith — for comment on the Job Corps pause but has not received a response.
Supporters point to letters signed by hundreds of lawmakers from both parties in June urging the administration to reverse course. One, led by Reps. Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., and Sanford Bishop, D-Ga., described Job Corps as a program that turns “homeless youth into the welders, electricians, nurses, and mechanics of the future.”
 The human cost

For Higgins, the numbers and policy debates matter less than the people she knows will be left behind. She remembers arriving at Old Dominion and feeling, for the first time in years, that her life was on a track.
“You can’t expect anyone to better their situation, let alone help others, when they don’t have their basic needs met,” she said, referencing the “Maslow’s Hierarchy Of Needs” pyramid taught in social work.
“At the very bottom are the basic necessities to survive with self-actualization at the top where we are free to become the most complete and authentic versions of ourselves. Once you have those basic needs met, it’s a bit easier to work on other things like friendships, education, or careers.”
Higgins said the friends she made through the program remain some of her closest allies. Many, like her, have gone on to careers and families they never imagined before Job Corps.
“Without Job Corps, I might have never joined the military, pursued higher education, or found the career I have today,” she said. “The ripple effect of that loss would be felt for generations, as fewer people are given the stability, skills, and confidence to reach their full potential.”
As the legal case moves ahead, Virginia Career Works and other local partners are working with students to prepare for the possibility of disruption — finding temporary housing, arranging transportation and helping with job placement.
But for now, students at Old Dominion and Blue Ridge are still in class, still living on campus and still hoping the fight in Washington will keep their futures intact.
Scott said that hope is well-placed — but warned the threat hasn’t passed.
“The injunction is good news, but it’s temporary,” he said. “The ultimate decision will be in court, and Congress needs to keep making clear this program is here to stay.”
Higgins is holding on to that same hope, even as she fears for those still searching for the sense of purpose she once found in Monroe.
“The proposed closure of Job Corps centers would be devastating,” she said.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)As the demand to pump power to energy-thirsty data centers concentrated in Northern Virginia swells, a debate about where to put  towering high-powered transmission lines in populated areas has put one Loudoun County community on the defensive.
Dominion Energy is working to bring a reliability loop of power to the so-called Data Center Alley in Ashburn. Two routes that will connect substations to over 100 data centers in the area are already approved and in the process of being built. To complete the last portion of the loop, the utility, state regulators, local leaders and community members must determine which route is most palatable for the more developed areas of town.
  Photo of Dominion Energy’s proposed transmission lines for the Golden to Mars substations in Loudoun County.
A group of neighbors in Loudoun Valley Estates in Ashburn have banded together to try and prevent the 165 foot, 500kv high-voltage transmission lines from being built in their backyards as part of one of the routes proposed by Dominion. One homeowner said she was blindsided by the new route being added to the proposal this year, which moved the transmission line from the Rock Ridge High School grounds up the nearby hill, cutting her backyard in half.
“I mean, we’ve got so many memories in our house, the same as our neighbors. And this thing just shattered our life. We haven’t put everything on hold because we just don’t know what’s going to happen,” homeowner Vicky Hu said.
Hu has lived in the Loudoun Valley Estates neighborhood for 20 years. She raised her daughter there and enjoys the forested look of the area – which is what drew her from Fairfax County. She also sold many of the homes in the community. 
Her yard is projected to have one of the massive towers placed in it under proposed route 3a. There is the possibility that eminent domain laws, with approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, could remove her from her home if the State Corporation Commission (SCC) approves the 3a route and the lines come too close to her house.
Even if she is able to stay, she and her husband fear it could mean major property devaluation, with the tower looming over the house and trees cleared away from the cliffside.
“The house is going to be worthless, if they put a power line there. Because we want to live next to a power line?” Hu said, “And the whole reason we bought the house in Ashburn is because of the view, the nature, the wildlife.”
Dominion said they would assess the fair market value of the property they would need for the project and try to come to a deal with the impacted homeowners along that route. They do not plan to approach the owners unless 3a is selected.
“We would approach the resident and say we are requesting to negotiate with you on an easement on your property. That means the property is still yours, you still own it,” Robert Richardson, an electric transmissions communications consultant for Dominion, said. “An easement gives us certain rights and restricts the use of the property in certain ways.”
The Loudoun County School Board voted against two of the proposed routes that touch the grounds of the Rosa Lee Carter Elementary School and the high school, saying they wouldn’t approve unless the lines could be buried. Route 3a was then added to the proposal, which impacts Hu and her neighbor’s properties.
The Loudoun County Board of Supervisors voted to support route 4 that runs parallel to the high school. They also requested that no power lines be built within 500 feet of any residence or public school without being buried, but they have no enforcement authority.
In response to the board’s concerns, Dominion spokesperson Aisha Khan said a feasibility study was done on 500kv power lines being buried. The only other place in the country that has done a project like that is in California. There are several factors that make burying the lines in Ashburn impossible, Khan said, from acreage needed for the entry point into the earth for the lines, water supply, and other challenges.
“However, we think it’s the right thing to do. These houses, these neighborhoods were built prior to knowing we’re going to have these huge electrical power lines in our neighborhood,” said Kerry Canfield, a Loudoun Valley Estates resident. “All of Loudoun County needs to know what’s coming, and we need to push them to go underground.”
Many of Hu’s neighbors attended a Loudoun County School Board meeting on Tuesday. They wanted the school to play a role in the SCC case in order to gain details on the proposed routes and file comments in the case before the board rules on which route will be selected.
“We are concerned about the long-term safety, property values, not to mention the impact on our children. If these power lines are not good for the school property, it’s definitely not good for the residents. So we urge you to support us here by filing a notice of participation in the (SCC case),” Loudoun Valley Estates resident Ravishankar Krishnamoorthy said at the meeting.
Eight supervisors voted in favor of participating in the case, with one abstaining. 
Richardson said they hope to talk with the school board again about the possibility of the two routes that touch their property.
“Route 3a is not our preferred route, 3 remains our preferred route. The problem with Route 3 is we can’t build Route 3 unless the school system says, ‘you can,’” Richardson said.
One of the proposed routes mostly runs along the Loudoun County Parkway. The board of supervisors voted against supporting that one because they did not want the power lines along the road. But the SCC could still select that route as the best option after hearing the case.
In a hallway outside the school board meeting, Hu said she feels her residential area is the easiest way for Dominion to get around the school and county concerns. Now her and her neighbors are stuck in limbo until the SCC decides which route is selected.
If the power lines are not built it will create a major energy gap for the data centers in the area. Dominion said there could be violations brought down by regional grid operator PJM Interconnection if they don’t supply the needed power by June 2028, the projected date that the project will come online.
“That’s where you would expect problems on the grid by that date if this project isn’t energized. If you’re providing too much, if you’re serving too much load with not enough transmission lines, you can damage equipment,” Richardson said. ”You can damage conductors. And so then, you start having other challenges with serving the greater region.”
There is a public hearing scheduled September 18 at Rock Ridge High School near Loudoun Valley Estates. The official SCC hearing where both sides will present their arguments for the project will be on Dec. 15.

(Photo courtesy of Chesterfield County Public Schools)Some Virginia classrooms are embracing top-tier teaching tools — but others are barely touching them. A new statewide survey finds wide disparities in how English and math teachers use high-quality instructional materials (HQIM), underscoring the challenge of lifting student performance.
With a 23% response rate, the survey by the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy found that 37% of Virginia’s K-12 English teachers are partially using materials that partially align with high-quality, while only 10% of math teachers report doing so. 
HQIM, used in states like Florida and Texas, is identified through a rigorous process to ensure alignment with state learning goals and research-based practices. The study comes as Virginia continues efforts to improve assessment testing.
Chad Stewart, policy analyst for the Virginia Education Association, told The Mercury that the state’s involvement would be crucial because teachers — including VEA members — want access to the best curricular materials.
“They’re in the classroom and they can’t do all the work to sift through the 10 curricular textbook options out there and identify what is the best material and the best lesson plans,” said Stewart. “They need a little bit of flexibility to differentiate for their kids in the context of what  they’re teaching; but most teachers do want handed to them some high-quality templates to build off of for their lesson plan.”
Last year, K-12 English and math teachers participated in an anonymous Teacher Survey of Curriculum Use to determine what materials are in use and how they are applied  in the classroom.
The 10- to 15-minute online survey, conducted from Sept. 5 to Oct. 16, 2024, was presented to the Board of Education on July 30.
The survey revealed stark differences within districts. In Fairfax County, 88% of English teachers reported using HQIM, compared to just 2% of math teachers. In Virginia Beach, 31% of English teachers use HQIM versus 34% of math teachers.
During the 2025 General Assembly session, lawmakers proposed ways to help teachers gain better access to these resources. In April, they passed House Bill 2777, which updates the review process to ensure HQIM aligns with state assessments and teaching strategies, ultimately creating a state-vetted list of such materials.
Dr. David Steiner, founder of the Institute for Education Policy at Johns Hopkins, recommended that Virginia provide professional development, which he said is “crucial.”
“The implementation of HQIM is useless if teachers don’t use it,” Steiner said. 
He added that research suggests that teachers resist HQIM because “they don’t believe their students can use the materials, because they themselves are nervous about the level of their knowledge in the subjects, and therefore they water them down, they leave them on the shelf.” 
Steiner also noted that when students are not proficient in English and math, as is the case in Virginia, additional support is needed for students with special needs and English Language Learners. He called teachers the “best ambassadors” for promoting HQIM.
“It is important that principals and teachers get exposure to why they should be using this material, the persuasive stories of its use, the success stories,” Steiner said. “It’s teacher to teacher, principal to principal, superintendent to superintendent. We cannot just think that we can parachute this stuff in and it will somehow blossom and be used effectively.”
Board of Education President Grace Creasey, an appointee of Gov. Glenn Youngkin, said the state can offer the tools, but one challenge is maintaining continuous professional learning for teachers and instructional leaders.
Teacher evaluators, including principals, should also know and understand the curriculum being delivered in every classroom, Creasey said, “deeply enough so that they’re not simply going into a classroom to evaluate a teacher on their ability to manage their classroom.” 
She said that while classroom management is essential to a teacher’s evaluation, another critical component is how effectively they teach content.
“We are very intent on ensuring teachers know how to deliver their content,” Creasey said, “and that’s something that I think we’ve got to start with in our classroom, our building principals, assistant principals and evaluators on before we can move into really aiming at continuous professional learning at our teachers.”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Virginia Tech, partners design blueprint to improve self-driving vehicles with $7.5 million grant

Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)On Wednesday, Gov. Kelly Ayotte said New Hampshire has “open arms” for visitors from Canada. The data suggests that gesture hasn’t been enough to persuade them to cross the border. 
New Hampshire business officials say tourism from Canada is down roughly 30% amid rising tension between the Trump administration and Canadian government.
“Absolutely the Canadian numbers are lower,” Taylor Caswell, commissioner of the state’s Department of Business and Economic Affairs, told the Governor and Executive Council during a meeting in the border town of Pittsburg last month. “I mean, they’re running at about 30% underneath what we’ve seen in prior years.”
Though the commissioner couldn’t say for sure what’s driving this decrease, he floated the strained relations between the U.S. and Canada as a possible culprit.
“It could be weather,” he said. “It could be basic economics. It could be gas prices. It could be, as we are seeing now, some difficulty and volatility between the Canadian government and the United States government.”
Customs and Border Protection data reflects this, too. The number of passenger vehicles traveling into New Hampshire, Vermont, or Maine from Canada was about 228,000 in July. That’s down about 105,000 vehicles over last year, a 32% drop. That number has been down from last year every single month since January. In total, the number of vehicles traveling into northern New England from October (the start of the agency’s fiscal year) through July was about 1.8 million. That same time period last fiscal year, it was 2.1 million.
New Hampshire’s outdoor recreation economy, particularly its mountains and lakes, have long brought tourists from both Massachusetts in the south and Canada in the north.
Since re-entering the White House in January, President Donald Trump has frequently floated the idea of annexing Canada as the “51st state,” at one point alluding to the possible use of military force. The idea has offended Canadians and prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to rebuke it repeatedly.
At one point in a May Oval Office meeting between the two leaders, Carney told the American president Canada is “not for sale, won’t be for sale, ever,” to which Trump replied, “Never say never.”
Trump has also imposed hefty tariffs on Canada, as part of his controversial campaign to eliminate trade deficits with other countries. At the beginning of this month, Trump increased those tariffs from 25% to 35%. The tariffs are ostensibly meant to curb what Trump argues is a fentanyl and drug trafficking issue at the northern border. Goods that fall under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement are exempt from the 35% rate. 
For her part, Ayotte is scheduled to visit Canada in September for a trade mission. Asked Wednesday about her level of concern about the hit to tourism, she emphasized that “we certainly welcome the tourists from Canada.”
“That’s one of the things I’m going to just continue to promote on behalf of New Hampshire,” she said. “Not only that they’re welcome here — the Canadians — but we have open arms to them.”
She said her team is also going to be emphasizing business opportunities and relationships between New Hampshire and Canada during her visit next month. The trip is scheduled for Sept. 7-11, and Caswell will be joining her.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AyotteSkiLift-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-14 05:56:57.845323

Doctors warn that raw milk causes foodborne illnesses, and the product is banned for a reason.

Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images.A pair of Ohio Republican lawmakers have introduced a bill that would legalize the sale of unpasteurized milk. Doctors warn that raw milk causes foodborne illnesses, and the product is banned for a reason.
The Everson Jersey Dairy Farm gets visitors from a hundred miles away for their milk.
“It’s gone up probably 110% in people coming here,” owner Jamie Everson said. “We have families that come every week, an hour and a half away, to come get milk.”
Everson has 40 milk cows on her Northeast Ohio farm, where she gets her products tested every few days and sends them to large dairy companies. However, she says visitors really want one thing.
“There are always people calling and looking for raw milk,” she said.
Selling raw, unpasteurized milk is illegal in Ohio, which Dr. Anita Somani, a Democratic state representative from Columbus, said is for good reason.
“In the simple case of food poisoning, you may end up with diarrhea, dehydration, nausea and vomiting,” Somani said. “But if you’re a young kid, if you’re an elderly person, if you’re immunocompromised, those bacteria can be life-threatening.”
As an OB-GYN, Somani warns her patients about the risks that E. coli, salmonella and listeria can have during a pregnancy, which includes stillbirths. The Ohio Department of Health and the CDC back her warnings.
“Listeria is one that for pregnant women can be very, very, very damaging to the fetus,” the doctor said.
But there is a loophole in the law against selling raw milk in the state.
Everson is able to provide raw milk with her herdshare program. Through an agreement, consumers can purchase a “share” of the cow, allowing them to obtain the raw product.
“You’re gonna purchase part of a cow in the herd, which is 14% of one of our cows, [it] makes a gallon a week,” Everson said. “So you purchase the cow for so much money and then you pay a monthly boarding fee.”
Another legal way to sell raw milk is if the retailer says it is for pets.
“If you do it the proper way, you can’t really get in a whole lot of trouble,” Everson said.
State Rep. Kellie Deeter (R-Norwalk) said this process could be improved, and wants to legalize raw milk for farm-to-consumer.
“We’re just trying to help regulate the folks that are already doing it and actually make it healthier, not unhealthier,” Deeter said.
She and state Rep. Levi Dean (R-Xenia) introduced House Bill 406, which requires liability waivers for raw milk sales and establishes guidelines for monthly testing of food-borne bacteria and diseases, such as listeria.
“If you test milk today, does that mean that a week from now that bacteria hasn’t grown?” Somani asked rhetorically. “The point of pasteurizing and sterilizing milk is to prevent bacteria from growing.”
Florida health officials report a recent E. coli outbreak stemming from raw milk has made about two dozen sick, including six children, and seven of the 21 ill are hospitalized. Somani said this is why pasteurization is so important.
“I don’t think there’s anything that’s foolproof, now, but it would certainly be better than the way it’s currently being done without regulation,” Deeter said.
Deeter said she is communicating with the Ohio Department of Agriculture and the Ohio Dairy Association — ones who “weren’t excited,” she said — to create a safer environment for the growing raw milk market.
She credited MAHA, the “Make America Healthy Again” movement, led by U.S. Health and Human Services Department Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to an increase in awareness of the unpasteurized product.
“We have legalized marijuana in the state of Ohio, so I don’t think it’s unreasonable to legalize raw milk for the consumer in a very narrow lane in a regulated fashion where it is actually safer for folks than I think that it might be currently unregulated,” Deeter said.
Everson said that some people aren’t as stringent as her on the rules, and this could give consumers more choices.
“People wouldn’t be so nervous about even asking,” Everson said.
Somani said that science moves humanity forward, and she doesn’t want to move backward.
“From a purely evidence-based decision-making process, I think it’s a mistake to try to legitimize raw milk,” the doctor said.
The bill will be heard in the coming months.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Tracking Medicaid patients’ work status may prove difficult for states

Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
Statehouse Democrats want to use Trump’s big bill to drag down Republicans

That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.











We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw



New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

(Photo by Dennis Tangney Jr./Getty Images)August is an anxious month for parents preparing to drop off their young adults at the University of New Hampshire.
Most years, the UNH parent Facebook groups are filled with logistical questions: How much stuff will fit under the bed? How big are the closets? What size rug should we buy? And, to be honest, a lot of the questions suggest the parent is, understandably, having a very hard time letting go of the day-to-day management of their child’s life. There’s still a lot of that type of question this year, but there are more pressing concerns represented, too.
Why is the Philbrook Dining Hall going to be closed on weekends?
Why is the library closing early on Sundays — and not opening at all on Saturdays?
Why are UNH students now quite literally paying more for less?
And here’s the big one: How is it that a public university could be so punishingly expensive for in-state students who would very much like to be here?
There’s not one answer to that last question, but there is a really good place to start. On Thursday, the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute released updated numbers revealing that “New Hampshire consistently trails all other U.S. states in public higher education funding.” Note that NHFPI said “trails all other U.S. states.” It doesn’t trail “some” or “many.” New Hampshire trails them all.
If you are a University System of New Hampshire student or parent, the figures don’t exactly feel like an open door and a warm hug: “The Granite State appropriated $4,629 per full-time student while the national average of all U.S. states was $11,683.” Again, I want to draw special attention to what NHFPI is saying here: The $7,000 per-student gap isn’t between No. 50 (New Hampshire) and No. 1 (Illinois). Seven grand is the distance between New Hampshire and the average of the 50 states.
The new state budget, in place since July 1, adds to the strain. Funding for the university system — which also includes Keene State College and Plymouth State University — was cut by $35 million (a 17.6% hit, according to NHFPI) in the new biennium. For UNH, that contributed to the cuts mentioned above (the dining hall and library hours), as well as the first in-state tuition hike in six years, 23 layoffs, and the elimination of 13 positions.
All of that means tuition plus mandatory fees for an in-state student to attend UNH in Durham now sits at $19,682 a year. If your in-state student plans to live and eat on campus (well, not at “Philly” on the weekends), that’s another $14,700 or so, plus another $5,000 in “miscellaneous” and other costs, according to UNH’s financial aid breakdown. So, about $40,000 a year, or $160,000 per undergraduate degree, for a New Hampshire kid to get a University of New Hampshire education.
Oh, and then there’s the interest payments.
Add it up, and that’s an awfully big debt hole for a 22-year-old, highly educated adult to start out in, isn’t it? Especially in a state with some of the most unaffordable housing in the country and a top-10 national ranking when it comes to states with the highest cost of living. Also there’s that pesky “New Hampshire Advantage” problem, where homeowners pay the fourth highest property taxes in the nation and landlords shift that burden to renters young and old.
On top of all that, New Hampshire has the second oldest population in the country, just behind Maine, and offers by far the lowest minimum wage in all of New England — tied to the federal rate of $7.25 (less than $300 a week), which hasn’t been raised since 2009. And please spare me the “nobody pays the minimum wage” anecdotal argument — if that’s the case then why not just raise it and move us closer to the rest of the region? If you’re wondering what “closer” might mean compared to the other New England states, the next lowest wage belongs to Vermont, at $14.01. Maybe (hopefully?) you’re starting to see a pattern to our “advantage” when it comes to attracting and keeping younger people here, whether they’re college educated or not? 
In New Hampshire, you can pick an industry, any industry, and odds are you’ll find mention of a “severe workforce shortage.” It’s no wonder why, is it? You can’t roll out the red carpet if you already sold it to pay for tax cuts.    
I know that’s a lot of statistical doom and gloom, but there’s good news, too. New Hampshire’s real “advantage” isn’t whatever tax-cutting (or tax-elimination) scheme the state’s conservatives pitch next in an effort to increase wealth inequality and downshift costs to those who can least afford to pay them. The real advantage is part geography, part vibe. This is a place where many people want to be — because they love the lakes, mountains, beaches, and proximity to all of the other special nearby places, such as Boston, Portland, and Burlington. They love the change of seasons and the historical character here, and they love that diversity is trending in a positive direction. They love that this state was the setting for their childhood, and many of them dream of a Granite State sequel for their own kids someday.
You see, a whole bunch of our youngest people want to stay — and others would love to move here — if only the state would have them.
To be fair, it’s been well documented that college affordability is far from just a New Hampshire problem. Universities throughout the country are facing budget cuts, declining enrollment, and revenues that are failing to keep up with expenses. To add to all of those challenges, President Donald Trump and the Project 2025 architects operating his brain strings are putting their hostility toward higher education — and public education as a whole — into alarming action.
So, New Hampshire’s not alone when it comes to the increasingly prohibitive cost of college amid a designed crisis of educational accessibility and opportunity. But as the latest numbers show, and to our great discredit, we don’t have nearly as far to fall.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/unhdurham-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-14 04:57:05.794732

(Stock photo by Matt Gush/Getty Images)The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio is suing a second county, accusing it of violating the state’s open-records law. 
The records are contracts and memoranda between the Seneca County Sheriff’s Office and federal agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Marshal’s Service and the Department of Homeland Security. 
As with some other counties in Ohio, Seneca has contracted with the federal government to detain those swept up in the Trump administration’s mass deportations. The ACLU filed a similar suit against Geauga County in May.
Seneca County is claiming that it’s not allowed to release the records because they “are federal records subject to the Federal Records Act (FRA) and thus not subject to disclosure under state law,” according to the lawsuit filed by the ACLU. 
However, open-records laws are intended to combat corruption and other secret dealing by giving the public access to the inner workings of government. As a general matter, government documents can usually only be withheld or redacted if they contain sensitive personal information, business secrets, would compromise a law enforcement investigation or if their disclosure would endanger public safety or national security.
“The Seneca County Sheriff’s Office has a clear legal duty to provide the requested information,” Freda Levenson, legal director of the ACLU of Ohio, said in a written statement. “The sheriff’s office has never denied that they possess such records, and there is no provision in Ohio public records law that exempts them from the obligation to produce these records.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXLevenson also said the federal statutes cited by the sheriff’s office don’t exempt the information from disclosure. 
“The public has a right to this information,” the statement continued. “Local law enforcement must be accountable; it cannot shroud itself in secrecy.” 
The sheriff’s office didn’t immediately respond to a message sent Tuesday afternoon.
Advocates for immigrants have argued that jails are not appropriate places to hold people detained by ICE. For one thing, many — those not accused of illegal entry — are not criminal suspects. For another, there were lawsuits and other problems at Ohio jails under the arrangements during the first Trump administration.
Lynn Tramonte, founder of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance, in April listed the harms done to those held in county jails on immigration matters. Such detentions mean “taking them away from their families, jobs, and communities, making them rot in jail, while their immigration cases are pending. Making it harder for them to work with lawyers and win their cases. In the United States, you can be eligible for deportation and legal status at the same time.”
The ACLU of Ohio is asking the state Supreme Court to issue an order mandating that the records it asked for be released. Jocelyn Rosnick, its chief policy and advocacy officer, said sheriffs have to be accountable under state law. 
“The ACLU of Ohio is deeply committed to protecting immigrants’ rights and our organization serves as a watchdog for government transparency and accountability,” she said. “Ohio counties like Seneca and Geauga cannot hide behind federal immigration officials to avoid obligations under Ohio law. Our lawful demands for timely and accurate information must not be ignored.”

Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd), Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-7th) speak to reporters after touring an ICE facility in Baltimore Wednesday. (Photo by Lauren Lifke/Maryland Matters)Two weeks after they were turned away from the same site, Maryland lawmakers toured an Immigration and Customs Enforcement holding facility in Baltimore Wednesday — but said they left with more questions than answers.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Reps. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) and Kweisi Mfume (D-2nd) said their tour of the ICE facility in the George H. Fallon Federal Building in Baltimore provided no opportunity to talk to detainees and few answers to questions they posed to their ICE handlers.
The visit came two weeks after those three, along with Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Reps. Johnny Olszewski Jr. (D-2nd) and Glenn Ivey (D-4th), were told they were not allowed to inspect the facility, despite their claim of congressional oversight authority to do so, because the Baltimore site was an office, not a detention center.
But that’s not what they said they saw Wednesday.
“Anytime you detain anybody overnight and for one, two or three days — it’s a detention center,” Mfume said. “They can call it what they like. In many respects, the Justice Department has become the ‘Just – ICE’ Department.”
Requests for comment from ICE officials were not immediately returned Wednesday.
The lawmakers said last month’s attempted inspection was a follow-up to a March visit, in which Van Hollen staffers were among those who saw up to 54 people in holding rooms with no medical staff.
On Wednesday, the lawmakers said they were told by ICE officials that they were not allowed to talk to detainees, though Van Hollen said he believes it is allowed under Maryland law.
Baltimore County designated only ‘sanctuary’ jurisdiction in Maryland, says it’s a mistake

Mfume said he was able to see detainees through the glass window to one holding area, which he said looked like it could  accommodate up to 30 people. There were dozens of mattresses in the pen but little else by way of furnishings, they said.
“It has the kind of cold feeling that you find in any waystation,” Mfume said.
He said he was concerned about detainees who might have medical needs, those dealing with menstrual cycles or others who might not have access to their daily medications. The facilities were designed as a short-term holding area, Van Hollen said, but have far exceeded that.
“It’s really important to understand that this was designed for 12 hours,” Van Hollen said. “They’ve blown away from that, when they have an average of 72. This is why anybody with common sense would know this is a detention facility.”
Van Hollen said that national ICE data from the end of July showed that 84% of those in detention across the country pose no public threat.
“When the president says he’s focused only on the worst of the worst — that’s just a lie,” Van Hollen said. “Clearly, they’ve not gotten anything from the president that defines the ‘worst of the worst.’”
Elfreth said there is danger for detainees if they don’t get access to due process.
“They can be shipped off to anywhere in this country: Louisiana, Texas, Alligator Alcatraz — without access to an attorney, their medication, contact with a family member,” Elfreth said.
Mfume said the group was not given any specifics. When he tried asking about the nationality of the detainees, he got no answer, he said.
“If you’re not doing that in intake, it’s because you are inefficient,” Mfume said of the detainees’ nationalities.
Nationality and other information about detainees should be collected on intake and should be readily available, Mfume said, but ICE did not provide the lawmakers with the data, nor did they respond to more than 20 other  questions the lawmakers had.
“By and large, it was: ‘We’ll get back to all of you,'” Van Hollen said.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Drive up and down Coastal Highway in Ocean City during the Maryland Association of Counties convention this week and you’re sure to see at least one.
Whether it appears on an electronic sign or tacked to a hotel, the message is usually simple: “Stop offshore wind.”
Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Eastern Shore), who represents Ocean City and opposes offshore wind development, noted that the signs were also out in force as hundreds of anglers descended on Ocean City last week for the 52nd annual White Marlin Open.
“We hope you enjoyed the view. It’s about to be ruined,” read a more descriptive sign, affixed to a box truck. “Join the fight!”
The sign directs viewers to StopOffshoreWind.com, which argues that the offshore wind projects will harm local wildlife, commercial fishing, tourism and utility ratepayers. It lists sponsors including the town of Ocean City, Worcester County and the Ocean City Chamber of Commerce.
Carozza said the local movement feels as though it’s picking up steam, with an apparent friend in President Donald Trump (R), an outspoken critic of wind projects who has placed them under added scrutiny.
But after about a decade of build-up, US Wind is busy amassing the final permits it needs to begin construction on what would be the first offshore wind farm off the coast of Maryland.
Granted, there’s also local officials’ active legal challenges against both a federal and a state permit issued to US Wind, a private company headquartered in Baltimore.
Just last month, Ocean City filed in two different places to challenge an air pollution permit issued by the Maryland Department of the Environment, among the final permits that US Wind needs in order to begin construction. It came after a dust-up between Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency and MDE about how appeals should be filed.
Ocean City filed its other appeal, challenging the federal permit issued to US Wind at the end of President Joe Biden’s (D) administration, in 2024, with the Worcester County commissioners and Delaware’s Fenwick Island town council, among a host of Ocean City businesses.
Pittman and the Democratic resistance 
The new head of the Maryland Democratic Party is wasting little time setting a more confrontational tone with Republican President Donald Trump.
In press releases and social media, the party led by Steuart Pittman, is taking a more aggressive posture. Pittman, who is also wrappig up his final term as Anne Arundel County executive, acknowledged the tone but seemed initially surprised when a reporter asked if it could be characterized as a change.

“I do think members of the Democratic Party in Maryland want their party to stand up and fight,” Pittman said outside a reception in Ocean City. “We feel like we’re in the fight of our lives.”
Last month, Pittman and the party responded to the passage of Trump’s signature budget policy bill he has called the “Big Beautiful Bill.” The party press release renamed the bill using a bovine scatological term.
This week, the party fired off an angry retort to Trump’s comments about possibly calling up the National Guard and sending them to Baltimore as a crime enforcement measure.
The now-deleted post started with a F-bomb directed at the president and dismounted by referring to the president as a “sex pest with daddy issues.” The post was deleted from the party’s official account shortly after it was put up.
Pittman did not comment directly on the post but said he is involved in approving party communications.
Next week, the party will take the show on the road with a “Talk-Back Tour.”
Pittman said the plan is for party officials to travel to all 24 political subdivisions in the state for unfiltered forums where residents will be encouraged to “speak honestly about what matters and what needs to change.”
“It’s a more aggressive way of characterizing a listening tour,” Pittman said.
The first of those meetings is set for Aug. 18 in Frederick County and will feature Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin.
Housing a grudge?
Were officials at the Maryland Association of Counties conference deliberately iced out of an event with housing officials to discuss future housing policies? Some at the conference believe they  were explicitly not invited to attend.

	Officials with the Department of Housing and Community Development disagree, saying the event is not exclusive and that all were welcome to attend the discussion — which will take place at a nearby Hilton, not at the Ocean City convention center where MACo is held each year.
But tensions may be running high following a contentious 2025 legislative session where the Moore administration pushed priority legislation to tie housing development to areas with high job growth. MACo expressed significant concerns for the viability of the legislation, which died in committee.
MACo officials feel that the lack of invitation to the event may be in response to that opposition, among other concerns. They also expressed concern that Housing Secretary Jake Day declined their offer to speak during a panel Friday.

(Photo by Westend61/Getty Images)Christopher Gibbs wants to start rebranding the Ohio Democratic Party by the time fall rolls around.
“I’ve got corn to shuck, and beans to cut, and cattle to take care of,” the Shelby County resident said.
Ohioans with those same priorities, based around the hard work of the harvest, are the people Gibbs thinks can bring about more success for Democrats in the state.
As the newly elected chair of the Ohio Democratic Party’s rural caucus, it’s the perspective of the rural voter that Gibbs wants to hear from the most right now.
“Rural Ohio and rural America in general, I believe, is an untapped resource, certainly for the Democratic Party,” he told the Capital Journal on Tuesday. “There’s a feeling that it’s been ignored.”
The 2020 U.S. Census found that Ohio had the fourth largest rural population in the country, with nearly 2.8 million residents in the state’s rural areas.

Gibbs is the owner of more than 500 acres of Ohio farmland, and also happens to be the former leader of the Shelby County Republicans. He thinks he can use both of those perspectives as a bridge to voters who might have fallen out with the Democratic Party in the state, or who did’t think it was for them in the first place.
“For far too long, I don’t believe voters have been heard in rural America,” Gibbs said. “Many times, candidates blow into an area with ideas and policies, but they don’t listen to the voters.”
The Ohio Democratic Party is trying to figure out its next steps in a state with a Republican supermajority in the Ohio General Assembly, and conservative candidates readying themselves for gubernatorial and other races in the next few years.
Also on the horizon is a redraw of the state’s congressional district maps that will determine competitive races on the federal level.
That could play into the Democrats’ strategies and their likelihood of success as Ohio’s former Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown reportedly confirmed a run for another Senate seat. He’s eyeing the seat currently held by Republican (and former lieutenant governor) Jon Husted.
Brown was ousted from his long-time seat in the U.S. last year by Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno, the Trump-endorsed candidate in the race.
In his new position, Gibbs and fellow caucus members Jordan Horstman and Troy Scott plan to travel across rural Ohio for a listening tour to “identify, discuss and address rural issues and accurately represent the needs of rural Democrats at all levels,” according to a press release announcing the new leadership and the listening tour.

“These individuals will serve as vital liaisons between the rural caucus and local Democratic parties and clubs, ensuring that every voice in the rural community is heard and represented,” the release stated.
The details of the tour haven’t been ironed out. Gibbs said the caucus is working with a consultant to choose venues and organize the process.
But the main goals of the listening tour are already formed in Gibbs’ head: to give a venue to current Democrats, disillusioned Democrats, “legacy Republicans” and independent voters.
“We need to be honest brokers, we need to be on the ground and we need to show up,” he said.
The “town-hall-ish” events will be centered around public comment on the core values of rural Ohioans, the expectations voters in that area have for their candidates and even their perspective on the Democratic Party.
“Good or bad, I want to hear it all, I want the truth,” Gibbs said. “Something about rural voters is if you ask them a question and shut up, you’re going to get the answer if you listen.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXAs for those “legacy Republicans” Gibbs wants to see at the events, he thinks there’s a group on the GOP side who aren’t happy with what their party is doing, and are “out there looking for a place that is safe to park their vote.”
To reach a place where every perspective is heard, the rural caucus leader said the needs common to all rural Ohioans must be a part of the discussion, from good schools and health care access to the role of the agriculture community, a piece the Ohio Democratic Party has perhaps not been good at connecting with in the past.
After seven years as the chair of the Shelby County Republican Party, Gibbs said he can also speak the language of the Republicans he thinks could find their fit on the other side of the aisle.
“I speak legacy Republican, I do not speak MAGA,” he said.
The Capital Journal reached out to the Ohio Republican Party to ask about any planned outreach to rural voters. The party has not responded as of Tuesday afternoon.

Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson, attends an election objections hearing on June 21, 2024, in Topeka. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)“This is the highest level of hypocrisy and apparently it knows no bounds,” bellowed Kansas GOP executive director Rob Fillion this week after a confrontation between current and former Hutchinson representatives at a state fair fundraiser.
So let’s talk about hypocrisy, then.
State Rep. Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson, accused former state Rep. Jason Probst, a Democrat from Hutchinson, of making “homophobic remarks” while he “reeked of alcohol.” Probst told Kansas Reflector senior reporter Tim Carpenter that the younger man was exaggerating. I’m not sure what to make of these dueling accounts, but I sure don’t recall Kansas Republicans being concerned about homophobia before.
How anti-gay are they?
This year, they imposed a budget proviso banning preferred pronouns in state employee signature blocks.
GOP legislators’ first bill of the 2025 session targeted transgender youths at their most vulnerable, forbidding them from accessing gender-affirming care.
Back in 2024, they voted down a bill that would have recognized same-sex marriage in same statutes.
Earlier that year, Republicans’ proposed party platform called for marriage exclusively between men and women.
And hey, they also passed a bill that defined any depiction of same-sex couples as pornography.
Even today, Republican House Speaker Dan Hawkins’ website says the state must “defend the unborn and protect traditional marriage.” For those keeping track, Hawkins, R-Wichita, also serves as Sweely’s boss in the House of Representatives.
Now, I can condemn homophobia with the best of them. I’ve been out of the closet as a gay man for longer than Sweely has been alive. Harassing or catcalling someone for their perceived or actual sexual orientation has no place in society, polite or otherwise. But let’s take a step back for some perspective here. Kansas Republicans have outright bullied transgender people and refused to pay proper respect to other members of the LBGTQ+ community.
You don’t get to vote for stripping rights away from people and then act insulted by homophobic comments.
The actual, concrete actions of Kansas GOP members have done far more real, lasting damage to gay (and straight) people than any epithets.
Trust me, we old gays have appallingly long memories.
But lest you think I’m carrying water for any single party, I don’t give Probst a pass either.
Last year, he wrote a couple of lengthy posts on his Substack blog taking issue with a column of mine about an anti-pornography bill. I had not mentioned him by name or singled him out among Kansas House members.
Probst was not pleased with the piece, criticizing its premise and my past work. What’s more, his prickly first response used problematic language. He referred to me as “hysterical” — a gender-coded word used often to dismiss women — and minimized the fact that I had actually spoken with a lawyer.
In essence, I was being asked to step aside for the enlightened opinion of a straight white man, and his response irked me at the time.
It irks me still, because (see above) we old gays have appallingly long memories.
I don’t know what went down between Probst and Sweely. The former lawmaker’s statement to Carpenter doesn’t quite include a denial: “If his feelings get hurt so easily, perhaps public service isn’t for him. He is grossly exaggerating the exchange, which isn’t surprising coming from someone who can’t even be honest about something as simple as his address.”
Republicans have made no secret of their contempt for Probst, either, joking on the House floor about blowing him away with a tank. No one apologized for that exchange between Sweely and former Rep. Patrick Penn, R-Wichita.
Feelings are bad, then, and likely to remain so.
At the very least, Kansas Republicans should take a step back and wonder about whether their plaintive claims of discrimination really land. A lot of mud has been spread around by a lot of people, and no one looks especially clean right now.

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)As conservative lawmakers work to restrict online access to abortion medication, a new report shows how popular it has become for women who live in states that have outlawed abortion.
Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin led a team that analyzed 15 months of prescription data from Aid Access, one of the largest online abortion telemedicine providers.
They found 84% of Aid Access’s more than 118,000 online prescriptions went to patients living in abortion-ban states.
The South and Midwest had the highest rates of patients accessing telemedicine abortion. Rates were also greater in high-poverty areas or where people would have to travel more than 100 miles to reach an abortion clinic, according to the report, which published this month.
Aid Access is able to mail abortion medications to residents in all 50 states — even those in states with abortion bans — thanks to shield laws in Democratic-led states. Shield laws are designed to minimize the legal risks for people who provide or access abortions across state lines.
Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have reproductive care shield laws, either through legislation or by executive order, according to a report from University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
Eight of those states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — specifically protect telehealth abortion providers regardless of where their patient is located.
Shield laws, along with difficulty accessing in-person abortion services in abortion-ban states, have contributed to a rise in medication and telehealth abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, clearing the way for state bans. With telehealth abortion, patients have a virtual appointment with a clinician who can prescribe abortion medication, which is then filled by a licensed pharmacy and mailed to the patient.
Research has shown telehealth medication abortion is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
But as abortion medication use rises, so have conservative efforts to ban it.
This year, more than a dozen states introduced bills to bar access to medication abortion by criminalizing its sale, purchase or distribution, according to Guttmacher.
One such bill in Texas, which could have been a blueprint for medication abortion restriction in other states, was specifically aimed at groups like Aid Access. It would have allowed private citizens to sue for at least $100,000 anyone who provided abortion pills in Texas. The bill passed the Texas Senate but died in the House in May.
Earlier this year, the state of Louisiana criminally charged a New York physician under its abortion ban law for allegedly providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teen via telehealth. New York, which passed a shield law in 2023, refused Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor.
Last month marked the first federal test of shield laws, when a Texas man sued a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to his partner.
This week, a Texas woman filed a federal lawsuit against Aid Access and against a man who she said impregnated her, then spiked her drink with abortion pills. She is also suing the Dutch doctor who founded Aid Access, alleging Aid Access and its founder mailed abortion-inducing drugs in violation of Texas and federal law.

He may now be 83, but few if any American political leaders do a better job of truth-telling and connecting with young people than Vermont’s sagacious Senator Bernie Sanders.
Sanders was in Asheville this week as part of a national “Fight the Oligarchy” tour and as NC Newsline’s Clayton Henkel reported, the senator pulled no punches in blasting the ruthless and un-American authoritarianism that President Trump and his minions are seeking to inflict on the nation.
As Sanders rightfully observed, quote “we are living in a nation in which in many respects we have become an oligarchic society, where our country is being run by a handful of multi-billionaires, and these people worship wealth and they worship power and they could care less about how they get what they want.”
Sanders noted further the scandalous fact that one man – Elon Musk — owns more wealth than the bottom 52% of American households.
The bottom line: Sanders is too old to run for president again, but his message is fresher and timelier than ever. The nation needs to hear it repeatedly.

Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.
In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
 ‘The world has changed’

While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.
Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
 Free speech argument

Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
 A Republican loss

In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The gerrymandering drama in Texas – and beyond – has continued to unfold after Democratic state legislators fled the state. The Democrats want to prevent the Republican-controlled government from enacting a mid-decade gerrymander aimed at giving Republicans several more seats in Congress.
The Texas GOP move was pushed by President Donald Trump, who’s aiming to ensure he has a GOP-controlled Congress to work with after the 2026 midterm elections.
Other Republican states such as Missouri and Ohio may also follow the Texas playbook; and Democratic states such as California and Illinois seem open to responding in kind.
But there are a few factors that make this process more complicated than just grabbing a few House seats. They may even make Republicans regret their hardball gerrymandering tactics, if the party ends up with districts that political scientists like me call “dummymandered.”
Democrats can finally fight back
Unlike at the federal level, where Democrats are almost completely shut out of power, Republicans are already facing potentially consequential retaliation for their gerrymandering attempts from Democratic leaders in other states.
Democrats in California, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, are pushing for a special election later this year, in which the voters could vote on new congressional maps in that state, aiming to balance out Democrats’ losses in Texas. If successful, these changes would take effect prior to next year’s midterm elections.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXOther large Democratic-controlled states, such as Illinois and New York – led by Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Gov. Kathy Hochul, respectively – have also indicated openness to enacting their own new gerrymanders to pick up seats on the Democratic side.
New York and California both currently use nonpartisan redistricting commissions to draw their boundaries. But Hochul recently said she is “sick and tired of being pushed around” while other states refuse to adopt redistricting reforms and gerrymander to their full advantage. Hochul said she’d even be open to amending the state constitution to eliminate the nonpartisan redistricting commission.
It’s unclear whether these blue states will be successful in their efforts to fight fire with fire; but in the meantime, governors like Hochul and Pritzker have welcomed the protesting Democratic legislators from Texas, in many cases arranging for their housing during their self-imposed exile.
Dummymandering
Another possible problem for either party looking to gain some seats in this process stems from greediness.
In responding to Democrats’ continued absence from Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott threatened even more drastic gerrymanders.
“If they don’t start showing up, I may start expanding,” Abbott said. “We may make it six or seven or eight new seats we’re going to be adding on the Republican side.”
But Abbott might think twice about this strategy.
Parties that gerrymander their states’ districts are drawing lines to maximize their own advantage, either in state legislatures or, in this case, congressional delegations.
When parties gerrymander districts, they don’t usually try to make them all as lopsided as possible for their own side. Instead, they try to make as many districts as possible that they are likely to win. They do this by spreading groups of supportive voters across several districts so they can help the party win more of these districts.
But sometimes the effort backfires: In trying to maximize their seats, a party spreads its voters too thin and fails to make some districts safe enough. These vulnerable districts can then flip to the other party in future elections, and the opposing party ends up winning more seats than expected.
This phenomenon, commonly referred to as “dummymandering,” has happened before. It even happened in Texas, where Republicans lost a large handful of poorly drawn state legislative districts in the Dallas suburbs in 2018, a strong year for Democrats nationwide.
With Democrats poised for a strong 2026 midterm election against an unpopular president, this is a lesson Republicans might need to pay attention to.
There’s not much left to gerrymander
One of the main reasons dummymandering happens is that there has been so much gerrymandering that there are few remaining districts competitive enough for a controlling party to pick off for themselves. This important development has unfolded for two big reasons.
!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var t in a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[“datawrapper-height”][t]+”px”;r.style.height=d}}})}();
First, in terms of gerrymandering, the low-hanging fruit is already picked over. States controlled by either Democrats or Republicans have already undertaken pretty egregious gerrymanders during previous regular redistricting processes, particularly following the 2010 and 2020 censuses.
Republicans have generally been more adept at the process, particularly in maximizing their seat shares in relatively competitive states such as Wisconsin and North Carolina that they happen to control.
But Democrats have also been successful in states such as Maryland, where only one Republican serves out of nine seats, despite the party winning 35% of the presidential vote in 2024. In Massachusetts, where Democrats hold all eight seats, Republicans won 37% of the presidential vote in 2024.
!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var t in a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[“datawrapper-height”][t]+”px”;r.style.height=d}}})}();
There’s also the fact that over the past half-century, “gerrymanderable” territory has become more difficult to find regardless of how you draw the boundaries. That’s because the voting electorate is more geographically sorted between the parties.
This means that Democratic and Republican voters are segregated from each other geographically, with Democrats tending toward big cities and suburbs, and Republicans occupying rural areas.
As a result, it’s become less geographically possible than ever to draw reasonable-looking districts that split up the other party’s voters in order to diminish the opponents’ ability to elect one of their own.
Regardless of how far either party is willing to go, today’s clash over Texas redistricting represents largely uncharted territory. Mid-decade redistricting does sometimes happen, either at the hands of legislatures or the courts, but not usually in such a brazen fashion.
And this time, the Texas attempt could spark chaos and a race to the bottom, where every state picks up the challenge and tries to rewrite their electoral maps – not in the usual once-a-decade manner, but whenever they’re unsatisfied with the odds in the next election.

But at a time when 10,000 Americans a day are retiring, we need to make sure the trust fund is healthy and operations are fully funded to keep providing benefit for many more years, writes Hank Greenberg.","Social Security turns 90 on Aug. 14, providing benefits to 67 million Americans, including 1.1 million in Maryland. But the benefit program will need our attention to keep going, writes Hank Greenberg. (Photo illustration by iStock/Getty Images Plus)Today, Social Security – the vital lifeline for tens of millions of Americans everywhere, including 1.1 million Marylanders, used for housing, groceries, gas and the other everyday necessities – is marking its 90th birthday.
And with that anniversary comes a responsibility to strengthen the program – and determine how we can help it age in the healthiest way. As the bedrock of retirement in America, our financial future depends on protecting Social Security for decades to come.
Social Security will face challenges in the years ahead, but it’s incumbent on us to ensure the program continues to work for the 67 million Americans across the country who rely on it. The history of the program shows us how necessary it is for the healthy retirement of Americans everywhere.
On Aug. 14, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act, and in January 1935 Ida M. Fuller, the first person to receive Social Security, collected a monthly check of $22.54—that’s $518.58 in inflation-adjusted dollars. From that beginning, the program now provides $1.4 trillion in retirement security. It is the only inflation-adjusted retirement program, and it guarantees that Americans everywhere know they can plan soundly for retirement.

Here in Maryland, more than 1.1 million residents collect Social Security benefits, and 186,000 are lifted out of poverty every month. Social Security helps Marylanders live and retire with dignity, offers crucial support to those with disabilities and serves as a financial lifeline for families navigating the loss of a loved one.
Social Security will never “go broke.” That’s a fact. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system. As long as there are workers paying into Social Security, there will be Social Security for those collecting benefits. The program is funded by payroll taxes, and will continue to pay benefits.
But the program does face funding challenges. The most recent Social Security Trustees’ Report finds that the surplus will run out in 2035, if not sooner. To prevent that shortfall, Congress must once again step up – as it did when it reformed the program in 1983 – before millions of Americans face a 20% loss in earned benefits.
Customer service is another area where Social Security is facing challenges, with office closures and staffing shortages. Many Americans who need access to the program face long wait times on the on the phone or long distances to reach local offices.
This year, wait times are on the rise, fewer people can reach a Social Security representative to meet their needs and this challenge emerges just as more people – approximately 10,000 people every day – are retiring.
Congress must provide SSA with the resources necessary to provide timely, efficient and effective customer service. And Congress needs to provide oversight to ensure that customer service is prioritized.
Throughout our history at AARP, we have worked with every administration and Congress to advocate for the protection of Social Security. More than 67 million Americans everywhere rely on this vital program, and for 90 years, Social Security has been the foundation of retirement in the United States. It’s imperative to ensure that Social Security remains not just for another 90 years, but for generations to come.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/socialsecurity_cropped-e1755125081113-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-14 01:56:52.864366

So imagine how excited I am to tell you about all the scrappy underdog stories that are going on in Florida right now.
All over the state, local governments are pushing ahead on common-sense changes to their growth plans, wetlands protection, and impact fees. They’re doing so despite warnings from big, bad opponents that what they have in mind will violate a new pro-developer state law that limits city and county governments’ authority on new land-use or development regulations.
It’s happening in big counties like Orange and small cities like Edgewater. And everywhere it’s happening, it’s bad news for Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Legislature, because it shows that local governments are tired of being pushed around by developers and their toadies and are ready to push back.
  Manatee County Commission Chairman George Kruse via Manatee County
“This is one of those tipping points,” Manatee County Commission Chairman George Kruse told me.
As my colleague Mitch Perry reported last week, the law they’re challenging has “become the most controversial new measure” of the 2025 legislative session.
People are now realizing what this law really demonstrates: Tallahassee is tightly controlled by campaign donors who don’t care about what’s best for Florida’s people, only what boosts their private profits, Kruse said. That’s why they wanted to handcuff the local officials who might object.
The bill was passed on the pretext of providing emergency help for hurricane victims. But it contained a poison pill benefiting no one but big developers.
  Kim Dinkins via 1000 Friends
“It’s important to realize that this was described as an emergency bill that goes far beyond an emergency to actually attack the basis of democracy,” said Kim Dinkins, planning and policy director for the smart growth group 1000 Friends of Florida. “It allows a popular vote to be overturned.”
With so many people lining up to resist, I’m thinking we should change our state song from “Old Folks at Home” (yawn!) to the far more appropriate “Fight the Power” by the Isley Brothers.
180 degrees from smart
This was supposed to be the year for our fine Legislature to pass laws promoting Florida’s “rural renaissance.”
Instead, this new law is being used as a steamroller to flatten advocates of protecting rural areas from runaway development.
  Nick DiCeglie via DiCeglie campaign
The law was originally known as Senate Bill 180, as in “180 Degrees from Smart Growth.” It was sponsored by Sen. Nick DiCeglie of Indian Rocks Beach.
Most of the bill talks about helping victims of Helene and Milton, last year’s one-two punch of destructive hurricanes fueled by that thing that the governor and Legislature are scared we’ll talk about.
But it also contains a section that says no local government is allowed to pass any new local land-use or development regulations that could be considered “more restrictive or burdensome” than what was already on the books. And that part isn’t tied to any emergency.
The law covers every part of the state, not just the ones clobbered by the two storms. Even worse, it starts retroactively from August 2024 and stretches on to October 2027. And if another hurricane hits, then the no-regulation time clock starts all over again.
It also says anyone — not just affected parties — can serve a local government with notification of intent to sue if they think the local government has violated the law. The local government then has 14 days to correct any problem. If it refuses, the lawsuit can proceed.
SB 180 didn’t come out of nowhere. It grew out of similar legislation passed in early 2023, a few months after Hurricane Ian slammed into the Southwest Florida coast and killed 149 people, making it one of the deadliest hurricanes to hit the U.S. in the past 20 years.
  Sen. Jonathan Martin via his website
When the Legislature met in special session the following February, Sen. Jonathan Martin of Fort Myers, sponsored a bill that said local officials in the area hit by Ian could not impose any new development rules deemed “more restrictive or burdensome” than what was already on the books. Sound familiar?
During debate, one member of the Florida House, Bob Rommel, applauded that section of the bill and added, “There is nothing more important than protecting private property rights.” Oh yes, that’s MUCH more important than saving people’s lives.
Martin’s bill passed the Legislature and was signed into law by DeSantis, who never says no to whatever developers want. It covered a 100-square mile radius affected by Ian. Also, it was set to expire in 2024.
  Rep. Jason Shoaf via Florida House of Representatives
Months later, though, the Big Bend area was ripped apart by Hurricane Idalia. So, during a special session in November 2023, a new bill, sponsored by Rep. Jason Shoaf of Port St. Joe, extended the ban on any commonsense regulation changes on development through 2026.
Worse, it expanded the area affected to list 10 specific counties that had to wear the Legislature’s handcuffs: Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Glades, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands, Lee, Manatee, and Sarasota.
But those were all just warm-ups for SB 180 and its attempt to halt any new regulations on destructive development.
  Susan Trevarthen via the Weiss Serota law firm website
Susan Trevarthen, a Fort Lauderdale attorney, remembers reading through all the bills that passed in the final rush of the session and when she got to SB 180, she recalls thinking, “Wait, this can’t be right.”
When she read it again, she realized what it meant: “Everyone in the whole state of Florida just lost all their zoning power for the next three years.”
If local governments don’t object to this, she told me, they will lose the power to object to anything else.
Now she’s gathering city and county government clients from across the state to file suit to overturn the law as unconstitutional. 
Orange you angry about this?
Think I’m exaggerating about the danger this poses? Look at what’s happened with Orange County.
The county spent eight years refining its plan for future growth, taking comments from all sides as it proceeded. What they finally came up with, called Vision 2050, was so popular, 73% of all voters said yes to its rural boundary in November.
And then the DeSantis administration said no way, forget it. All because of SB 180.
“The Florida Department of Commerce cited the language of the statute, signed into law last month by the governor, as a reason for declaring Vision 2050 to be ‘null and void ab initio’ — a phrase meaning the 615-page document was deemed invalid from the outset,” the Orlando Sentinel reported.
Apparently DeSantis prefers Vision 1950, from back when nothing restricted Florida developers.
Then, after the DeSantis administration slammed them from above, Orange County commissioners got attacked from beneath, too.
The Texas-based developer behind a piece of sprawl with a particularly ridiculous name, the 2,000-home Sustanee project, filed suit against Orange County seeking to overturn its growth plan and citing SB 180 as its legal justification.
After hearing from a crowd of about 50 fired-up people, the commissioners announced that they planned to stick to their guns. They’re joining the group that’s suing to overturn the law.

SB 180 “is giving special interests a veto power over what the voters decided,” Orange County Commissioner Kelly Martinez Semrad told me. “Essentially it’s a crap shoot for developers who can say, ‘Oh, I don’t like that, it’s too burdensome so I’ll sue you over it.’”
Or consider what’s happened to Deltona, over in Volusia County. Flooding has become so bad there that the city council was considering a moratorium on further development until it could get a better handle on how to fix its stormwater woes.
A developer sent the council a letter threatening to sue under SB 180 if the city voted for the moratorium. City officials voted to go ahead with the moratorium anyway.

“This bill was about helping people rebuild from the hurricanes,” Deltona Commissioner Dori Howington told me. “But this [development] has nothing to do with the hurricane.”
The city hasn’t raised its development impact fees in a decade, she said, but now they’re being told that raising the fees would also violate SB 180.
“What we’re seeing is that any land-use ordinance change we want to put in place, it violates SB 180,” Howington said. The developers knew this law was coming, she said, adding, “They were waiting for it.”
The billionaire who benefits
When I talked to Kruse, the Manatee County commission chairman started off with a good-humored brag: “We’re both the catalyst and the cause of this.”
The poison part of SB 180 has been widely blamed on Pat Neal, a former legislator who’s built 25,000 homes in Florida, most of them in Manatee and Sarasota counties. He’s now a billionaire, according to Forbes. (Semrad also cites a couple of Central Florida developers.)
Like Deltona, the Manatee County Commission was alarmed by flooding from last year’s hurricanes, so it has been considering a development moratorium while they figure out how to build subdivisions and other projects that will drain better. Neal has been one of the more vocal opponents of a moratorium.
The commissioners who were in office until recently would have kneeled to Neal’s wishes. After all, they were so pro-development that, in 2023, they trashed the county’s wetlands protection rules.
But that was such an unpopular move that last year the voters tossed out all but one of the incumbents. The voters replaced them with people who aren’t afraid to tell guys like Neal “no.” In fact, the commissioners just rejected a development proposal from Neal that would have made flooding worse for its neighbors.
Now the commission is ready to bring back those wetland protection rules they used to have. Suddenly they’re being warned that might violate SB 180. But being scrappy underdogs, they’re not backing down.
“We believe the intent of SB 180 was to only cover storm-damaged properties,” Kruse said. “Plus the bill is super-vague about what ‘more restrictive and burdensome’ means.”
Doing nothing will destroy the state, he told me. He and his colleagues aren’t afraid to take the consequences of doing what’s right.
“So any developer who wants to spend their money suing us,” he said, “I’d tell them to go right ahead.”
Repeal vs. rejection
I asked the folks I interviewed if they want the Legislature to repeal SB 180, or at least the part that ties the hands of the local governments. That’s what 1000 Friends of Florida hopes will happen.
Semrad, the Orange County commissioner, said she had talked to the House sponsor of the bill, Rep. Fiona McFarland, who assured her that what was happening was not what the Legislature intended. She said she’d be okay with repealing the bill.
DiCiglie, in an emailed statement, told me he’d be open to at least reopening the discussion. He didn’t say whether he was aware of what this provision would do?
“I’ve heard concerns from local leaders about provisions affecting municipal authority, such as post-storm land-use restrictions,” the senator said in an emailed statement. “I value this feedback and will continue engaging with stakeholders. If there is an opportunity to improve current law during the next legislative session, I will not hesitate to do that.”
But several folks told me they can’t wait a year for the Legislature to act. They don’t want to gamble on Neal and other developers buying — er, excuse me, I mean “influencing” — our elected officials to do their bidding. They need relief right now.
That’s why they’re pursuing what I like to think of as the Warren Zevon Option — send lawyers, guns, and money and get a judge to throw out the law.
Gov. DeSantis — who never served a day in local government — has been making a lot of noise about cracking down on wasteful spending by local governments. He’s even sicced the Florida version of the Department of Government Efficiency on several of them, including Orange and Manatee counties.
But it seems to me that making these local governments sue to toss out a law that DeSantis should have never signed is a pretty wasteful expense for the taxpayers. It’s his fault this Bad News Bill became law.
That’s why I would encourage those local governments, when they win, to send all of their legal bills to the governor’s mansion for payment. They should also attach a note signed, “Warmest regards from the under-DOGE.”

While these positions may seem different, they represent interconnected aspects of the progressive evolution of our city.
Both roles spring from the same fundamental conviction: meaningful projects don’t happen by accident. They emerge when neighbors step up, listen to one another, and work together to strengthen our community. This duality allows me to serve the wider community by bridging formal governance with grassroots advocacy, essential elements in building the Danbury of tomorrow.

The vision: more than just a trail
The Margerie Reservoir Trail embodies exactly that collaborative spirit. For decades, residents have dreamed of safe access to this beautiful space that has quietly sustained our city for more than a century. Now, with $2.28 million in state funding secured for study, design, and construction, we’re closer than ever to turning that dream into reality, without asking for new local taxes.
This project begins with respect for what Margerie already provides. Like Kenosia, East Lake, and West Lake, all part of Danbury’s water supply, the reservoir will remain fully protected under strict environmental standards. But protection doesn’t have to mean isolation. The trail is being designed as an accessible, carefully managed pathway that allows families, seniors, and residents of all abilities to safely enjoy the reservoir’s beauty while safeguarding our water supply.
The vision extends far beyond recreation. Once secured as a trail, this land cannot be sold or developed, preserving open space permanently in a region where development pressure never stops. Studies consistently show that trails increase nearby property values while drawing customers to local businesses. For walkers and cyclists who currently brave dangerous conditions along Route 37’s narrow shoulders, the trail offers a safe, dedicated alternative that connects residential neighborhoods to natural spaces.
The design also honors our environmental and historical legacy. Protective buffers will safeguard sensitive habitats, including bald eagle nesting areas, while celebrating the reservoir’s historic role in Danbury’s growth. Most significantly, the trail will physically link Danbury and New Fairfield, transforming decades of discussion between our communities into tangible cooperation.


The question of fairness
Indeed, beneath this vision lies a fundamental issue of equity that we cannot ignore. Danbury owns the land, but most of it sits just across the municipal line in New Fairfield. Danbury is among the top 25 taxpayers in New Fairfield. Every year, our residents pay property taxes on that land to our neighboring town. In just the past three years, we’ve paid nearly $150,000 in taxes for property the public cannot access.
Think about what that means: Danbury’s working families are already funding this land through their tax bills, yet we cannot safely enjoy what we’re paying for. Creating a managed public trail isn’t just reasonable; it’s a matter of basic fairness. We’re not asking to be given something at no cost; we’re asking for access to something for which we already pay taxes. >
A turning point approaches
After years of studies, planning, and community input, the Margerie Reservoir Trail has reached a critical juncture. The design phase is nearly complete, and the Margerie Reservoir Trail Advisory Committee is preparing to present its findings to both the Danbury and New Fairfield legislative bodies. The committee and the professionals have done the technical work, evaluating feasibility, incorporating environmental safeguards, and refining designs based on public feedback.
Now comes the moment when community support matters most. The trail will be built, but the timeline and final details depend on showing that residents care deeply about this opportunity. Every voice that joins the conversation helps ensure the project reflects our community’s values and priorities.
Your voice matters: Join us Aug. 19
On Tuesday, August 19, we have two important opportunities to demonstrate that support and learn about next steps for this transformative project.
At 5:30 p.m, we’ll gather on the steps of Danbury City Hall for a rally that sends a clear message: Danbury wants safe, beautiful public spaces and fair access to land we already fund. This isn’t just a gathering —it’s our chance to show decision-makers that this project has deep community backing.
At 6:30 p.m, the Advisory Committee meeting begins. This is your opportunity to stay engaged in the civic process and learn about the next steps for bringing this trail to life. These meetings shape the project’s future, and our presence demonstrates that residents are paying attention and invested in the outcome.
Building community for generations
The Acquaintances of Margerie Reservoir Trail has been formed to sustain this momentum, not just for this pivotal moment, but for the long path ahead. We’re building a community of neighbors committed to stewardship, equitable access, advocating for maintenance efforts, and fostering the local pride and support systems that sustain trails throughout our region. Like the “Friends of…” organizations that champion other trails, we’re ensuring this trail fulfills its promise for future generations.
We often say we’re still getting to know Margerie, and that captures something essential about this process. Every meeting, every conversation, every shared vision deepens our connection not just to this remarkable place, but to each other. That’s what makes this project special; it’s creating community even before the first shovel breaks ground.
The Margerie Reservoir has sustained our city for over a century. Now it’s time for this precious resource to sustain our community in new ways, bringing neighbors together around shared appreciation for the natural beauty that makes Danbury our home.
This is about more than building a trail. It’s about fairness for taxpayers who deserve access to land they fund. It’s about community, creating spaces where residents can connect across neighborhoods and generations. And it’s about legacy, ensuring future Danbury families inherit public spaces that reflect our values and vision. A hometown for everyone.
Join us on August 19. Your presence, your voice, and your commitment to Danbury’s future can help turn decades of conversation into the reality our community deserves.

(Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)When the peak of the annual glacial outburst flood hit early Wednesday morning in Juneau, newly installed flood barriers stacked along the Mendenhall River largely prevented flooding of the nearby residential area.
The flooding reached a record-breaking 16.65 feet at 7:15 a.m., but nearby homes, businesses and three schools were mostly spared. On Wednesday afternoon, Juneau officials announced the flood threat was over.Officials reported there were no rescues overnight or emergency evacuations during the flooding. There was some flood damage to a bridge, which had already been closed to the public Tuesday and was undergoing repairs. 
Residents reported some seepage through the semipermanent HESCO barriers into neighboring yards and homes, and some streets were flooded through water rising through storm drains. 
Keeping watch
Israel Katzeek helped his brother-in-law monitor his home in the Mendenhall Valley, on Lakeview Court and Meander Way, across the street from homes adjacent to the river. On Wednesday morning, water levels rose through the storm drains filling the intersection to about a third of the way up their driveway.

“At the peak, it was deep enough on this corner for paddle boarding, believe it or not. I wasn’t paddle boarding, but neighbors were,” he said.
They had prepared a two-foot wall of sandbags around the front of the home. Katzeek’s sister and her children had evacuated, but he and his brother-in-law stayed to monitor the house. Last year, the house had some partial flood damage to the garage so this year, the family took extra steps, with a sandbag barrier. Many homes on the street had sandbags and plastic liners along garage doors. Talking around midday on Wednesday as the flood waters were subsiding, Katzeek described what it felt like.
“Definitely relief. We were kind of bracing for the worst, obviously, with the barriers and elevating things and evacuating. It’s like ‘relief’ is just like the best way to put it,” he said. 
Researchers and local officials have been analyzing data to better prepare for flood risks. It appeared that work was paying off.
This year, Katzeek said the emergency preparedness effort and alerts were helpful. “I think the neighborhood was well informed. I think there was better advance notice about the dam breakage at Suicide Basin,” he said. “Like thoughtful advisories in place well in advance of the flooding.”
A closely monitored flood
The Mendenhall Glacier’s ice-dammed lake burst Tuesday morning, prompting an emergency alert and following evacuation advisory for some downriver Mendenhall Valley neighborhoods. Waters swelled throughout the night, carrying trees, debris and glacial melt swiftly downstream.

The Mendenhall River reached the record-breaking level Wednesday morning. “So this is a new all time record, high crest for the Mendenhall lake and river system,” said Nicole Ferrin with the National Weather Service.
Since 2011, the area has seen flooding from Mendenhall Glacier outburst events, as global climate change accelerates ice melting, more precipitation and increased flooding. Last year floods reached a then-record 15.99 feet, flooding the area and damaging more than 290 homes.

	Throughout Wednesday the river continued to slowly recede; many onlookers came out to see the fast-moving, muddy waters carrying whole trees and debris downriver. 
Juneau officials warned it was still an active flood zone and cautioned the public to avoid the river areas, as damage was still being assessed.
“The barriers are, by and large, holding together. We are seeing a small amount of seepage in the HESCO barriers in certain locations, and that’s still very much being assessed,” said Ryan O’Shaughnessy, director of emergency programs for the City and Borough of Juneau, at a news conference on Wednesday morning. 
There were some reports of trees striking the barriers and causing damage, he said, and some were repaired or fortified with sandbags further, but the extent of damage is still being investigated. 
“Assessment is happening via drones and will soon start to happen in person, as we make assessments that the water on the river side of the barriers is dropping to a point where our personnel can be safe and make those in-person inspections,” he said.

Sabrina Grubitz, safety manager with the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska, emphasized the flood barriers were effective. “We can definitely say that if the HESCO barriers were not placed, we certainly would have seen a considerable amount more damage than we saw now,” she said. “They certainly have been doing their job.”
Juneau officials reported no emergency rescues, and about 75 calls were answered at an emergency hotline. An evacuation shelter set up at the Floyd Dryden school building assisted nine people. 
“Most folks evacuated the area and stayed out of the area. We didn’t have any significant incidents with the water,” said Assistant Chief Sam Russell of Capital City Fire and Rescue. “And so we didn’t have to do any work last night, which was kind of nice.”
Christopher Goins, director of the southcoast region of the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, reported some damage to the bridge across the river on Back Loop Road, which was closed for repairs through Wednesday afternoon. 
“We saw a power pole and our wing abutment on the southeast side of the (Back Loop) bridge basically began to lean into the water,” Goins said. “And we are beginning to lose portions of the road associated with that abutment there …. The bridge itself is in great condition. We’re not concerned about that at this time, but that does mean we are going to have an extended closure while we repair that fill material behind the bridge, where it meets the land.”
The U.S. Coast Guard is actively monitoring outflow debris and potential pollution, and are broadcasting advisories to mariners. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also have crews onsite monitoring the area. They assisted in repairing a break in the flood barrier at Dimond Park on Wednesday morning, officials said, and would respond to any other areas as needed.

The U.S. Forest Service closed the Mendenhall Recreation Area on Wednesday, and the visitor’s center was closed to the public.
The first day of school for Juneau students has also been postponed, said Superintendent Frank Hauser, from Thursday to Friday. 
On Wednesday afternoon, areas of the Mendenhall Valley that had been evacuated were opened to residents to return, and municipal crews continued to assess damage in the area.
The nonemergency hotline remained open at (907-500-0890). Flood recovery resources, including debris disposal information and safety tips for re-entering a home with flood damage can be found at bit.ly/JuneauFloodRecovery.
As the flood waters receded from Meander Way, with the help of municipal crews pumping a nearby storm drain, Israel Katzeek began starting the clean up process at his sister’s home. He expressed uncertainty about preparing for what could become an annual flood. 
“It’s hard to say because even this year, we kind of pulled all the stops to be prepared. And, yeah, you know, even in the 11th hour, we still weren’t sure if we prepared enough,” he said. “It seems like there’s a lot of variables.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, visiting Alaska this week, said he hopes to learn about challenges facing both the state’s urban centers and remote rural communities.
“I came here to be a great listener, to understand the needs of the people of Alaska, to understand the challenges of the people of Alaska and particularly when it comes to homelessness and affordable housing,” Scott Turner, the Trump administration’s HUD secretary, said at a news conference Tuesday in Anchorage.
Turner is among several Trump administration cabinet members touring Alaska this summer.
He spent part of Tuesday meeting with Anchorage municipal officials who discussed the challenges of homelessness in the state’s largest city.
It is a national issue, Turner said.
That 770,000 people identified as homeless in the nation “is unacceptable to me, it’s unacceptable to my colleagues and I know it’s unacceptable to you,” he said.
In Alaska, he said, almost 2,700 people are homeless, with about 1,700 of them in Anchorage. “That’s something that we want to attack and eradicate,” he said.
Those numbers show that past efforts by HUD to address homelessness have not been effective, said Turner. To make his point, he referred to his background as a professional football player.  
“One of the things that holds you accountable in the NFL is called game film,” he said. “You can say what you want to on Sunday during the game. You can say, ‘Well, I did the right thing,’ but on Monday, the film will tell the story, and the film does not lie.”
On Wednesday, Turner was touring Bethel, in Western Alaska, to learn about rural Alaska housing problems.
Crowding is a dire concern in rural communities, according to the Alaska Housing Finance Corp., a state agency. Conditions are most severe in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region, where Bethel is located, according to AHFC. Crowded conditions are linked to poor health, including transmission of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.
Turner said HUD wants to add 7 million more units of affordable housing to the national supply and is focused on reducing regulations that reduce housing access in rural areas as well as in urban areas.
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, accompanied Turner and asserted at the news conference that overregulation by HUD is one of the major impediments to housing availability and quality in rural parts of the state.
“You can send all the money you want to rural Alaska, but it’s so smothered in red tape that it costs a million bucks to build a duplex. One duplex. A lot of that, I think, is self-inflicted,” Sullivan said.
Other analysis identified different problems for rural Alaska housing.
The high cost of energy in rural communities, which are unconnected to larger power grids, is one problem that for years has been cited as a key factor making rural Alaska housing unaffordable.
However, the budget reconciliation bill passed by Congress at the end of June, along with various actions by the Trump administration, has created new barriers to renewable energy development in rural Alaska and elsewhere.
Climate change has also exacerbated rural Alaska’s housing crisis, according to reports by government agencies.
A 2019 statewide assessment by the Denali Commission found that 144 rural communities are threatened by increased erosion, flooding, permafrost thaw or some combination of those factors.
More frequent flooding in the Yukon-Kuskokwim region, for example, is attributed to climate change and has affected housing quality and safety.
But the Trump administration is seeking to halt in-state policies intended to mitigate and adapt to climate change, including those in Alaska.
The administration also abolished the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Building Resistant Infrastructure and Communities program. The program provided grants to help communities prevent damage from natural disasters, many of which are linked to climate change.

John Hoeven lead a roundtable discussion on enhanced oil recovery on Aug. 13, 2025, in Grand Forks, N.D. (Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) GRAND FORKS, N.D. — North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven urged the state’s coal and oil industries to work together to thrive in the long term and meet the increasing demand for energy.
Hoeven on Wednesday touted an effort to have the state’s coal plants supply carbon dioxide to the oil industry to help improve the productivity of oil wells and extend the life of coal-fired power plants.
“Today is about linking our coal plants and the Bakken,” Hoeven said, referring to the Bakken shale formation that has helped make North Dakota the nation’s No. 3 oil-producing state.
Hoeven hosted U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright at the Energy and Environmental Resource Center in Grand Forks, which performs research for the coal and oil industries.
Hoeven and Wright were joined by energy industry and government representatives, including Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., to discuss how to speed up the development of enhanced oil recovery. The technology uses carbon dioxide or other gases are pumped into an oil well to help force more oil to the surface.
Hoeven likened enhanced oil recovery to horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, technologies that helped launch the Bakken oil boom more than a decade ago. Wright was part of the boom as the founder of Liberty Energy.
Using enhanced oil recovery has the potential to improve how much oil can be recovered from an oil well, which currently is between 5% and 15% in the Bakken.
Pilot projects seek to unlock enhanced oil recovery in North Dakota

The EERC this year estimated that injecting CO2 could lead to an additional 5 billion to 8 billion barrels of oil from the Bakken Formation over the next 30 to 50 years. The extra oil production would help ensure steady tax revenues for the state from the oil and gas industry.
Wright credited Hoeven with pushing through changes in the Republican-led megabill  that improve the tax incentives available for using carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery.
The bill included a provision increasing the 45Q tax credit for enhanced oil recovery from $45 per ton of CO2 used to $85 per ton. The increase puts it on par with the tax credit for permanent underground storage of CO2.
Coal plants are seen as one potential source of CO2 but roundtable participants said it will take substantial investments to implement the carbon capture technology.

Robert “Mac” McLennan is the CEO of Minnkota Power Cooperative, which has been developing a carbon capture and sequestration project known as Project Tundra.
Carbon capture and enhanced oil recovery both have been done in North Dakota.
Basin Electric Power Cooperative captures CO2 at its coal gasification plant near Beulah and sends it through a pipeline to an oil field in Canada where it is used for enhanced oil recovery.
“We would rather keep our CO2 in the United States than having to ship it to Canada,” said Ryan Norrell, Basin’s vice president for government relations.

Oil prices have been on the decline in recent months and the Energy Information Administration on Tuesday released a forecast of declining oil prices through the end of the year.
“We still have some economic uncertainty right now that I think will be cleared up in the next few months,” Wright said. But after that, he predicts a “much more bullish outlook for global demand for oil.”
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who has a background in the oil industry, said there will never be a perfect time to push ahead on enhanced oil recovery.
“If we wait for it to be perfect, it will never happen,” he said.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)More prison beds will be needed as a result of recent legislation, further exacerbating current overcrowding issues in state and county facilities, according to a forecast presented to Arkansas lawmakers Wednesday. 
Wendy Ware, senior vice president of Research, Analysis, and Forecasting for CGL Companies, told a joint meeting of the City, County and Local Affairs Committee the state’s inmate population is projected to grow by an average rate of 2% annually over the next 10 years. Arkansas’ inmate population would increase from about 20,000 today to around 25,000 in 2035, according to the CGL analysis. CGL is a criminal justice facilities management, construction and consulting firm based in Miami, Florida.
The state will need an additional 1,500 to 2,000 through 2040 once the Protect Arkansas Act is fully implemented, Ware said. Among other things, the 2023 law removes the possibility of parole for the state’s most serious offenders. 
Ware discussed CGL’s study during a legislative meeting at the Rogers Convention Center, which was the site of the Arkansas Association of Counties’ annual conference. Sebastian County Sheriff Hobe Runion said county jails have had no choice in holding inmates when there’s no room in state prisons.
Since 2016, county jails have added more that 3,000 beds across the state, partly to accommodate an overflow of state inmates, according to Runion. Yet, they’re still “bursting at the seams” with a backlog of around 1,900. While he’s not sure of the answer, Runion asked lawmakers to help create more bedspace. 
“The wheels, they haven’t come off yet of our criminal justice system, but they are wobbling really hard,” he said. “I’ve been doing this for 35 years, and it scares me.”
Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, noted that many of the county jails that have added space on their own have done so by asking voters to approve new taxes. 
“So I think as legislators, we just need to keep in mind that when we continue to kick the can down the road and don’t figure out ways to solve problems, that what we’re doing ends up raising taxes on a lot of our citizens,” Ray said. 
Many state officials have supported increasing prison capacity, but have disagreed on how to achieve that goal.
Arkansas legislators to hold hearing on Franklin County prison

The biggest source of controversy has been the proposed construction of a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has said the prison is needed to address overcrowding in county jails. Local residents and lawmakers decried the state’s lack of transparency in selecting an 815-acre site near Charleston and have pushed back against the project. 
Sen. Bryan King, a Green Forest Republican and outspoken critic of the Franklin County prison, again raised concerns about the project’s costs Wednesday. The preliminary cost estimate of the prison is $825 million, according to the project’s construction management company, California-based Vanir. 
King specifically discussed concerns about an increase in cost due to a lack of infrastructure for providing enough water to the site. 
“We cannot continue to afford what we’re doing and what we’re spending,” he said. 
The Legislature previously set aside $330 million for the proposed penitentiary, plus another $75 million. Arkansas lawmakers rejected a bill that would have appropriated an additional $750 million for the project during the 2025 legislative session. 
Corrections Secretary Lindsay Wallace told lawmakers Wednesday more than 1,400 beds have been brought online since Sanders took office in 2023, and officials are exploring more options. 
A women’s health unit with 50 beds is scheduled to open next month, Wallace said. The Board of Corrections also approved an expansion of the Mississippi County work release facility, which will net 100 additional beds, she said.

Instead of giving any real sense of when that impasse might end, the leaders of those respective chambers spent the day pointing fingers and answering lingering questions about the behind the scenes talks – or lack thereof – that might bring it to a close.
On Wednesday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) held a planned news conference with other Senate Democratic leaders to again note their position that they were ready to negotiate and wanted get to work on a roads plan, but they could not because House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland) was refusing to show his cards on the full budget. 
That led, in their view, to a communication breakdown in actually negotiating the few House budget ideas that have been reported over the last several months. Still, the House has yet to present its full budget outlook aside from its education plan passed in May, and that was a point of concern.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Later in the day, the Senate Appropriations Committee met to discuss the impacts of the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act budget on Michigan’s economy and its own budget process – a drum the Democrats have been steadily beating since details of the bill emerged. The volume of that cadence has only increased since the bill was signed into law by President Donald Trump in July. 
Senate Democrats have said they fashioned their budget in a way that contemplated the anticipated impact of Trump’s budget bill, with massive cuts to Medicaid and other key funding. Still, it was possible that new considerations might be made in the negotiating room given the dire circumstances brought on by the federal cuts.
The rallying cry for Senate Democrats on Wednesday was that Hall and his colleagues also now know what the federal budget will mean for the state, and that it was time for them to act with a full budget in tow.
At some point on Wednesday morning, Hall and his Republican colleagues decided to up the ante by announcing an impromptu press conference with the speaker in the afternoon, which included a surprise visit from state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton), chair of the House Appropriations Committee.
Hall’s main message was his belief that the Democrats were breaking under the weight of their initial opposition to work with the House on roads and that the impasse would soon be over based on pressure from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, whom Hall has previously said was more in line with the House Republicans on the budget’s progress than Senate Democrats. But Whitmer last week undermined that narrative, telling Michigan Advance that it was pure posturing.
Despite the day’s verbal grenade throwing, the upshot remains the same: Six weeks have passed since the Legislature’s self-imposed July 1 budget deadline without a new deadline to get it done. Although both chambers readily agreed on Wednesday that schools need to know how they are going to be funded and that a government shutdown would be a loss for both sides, the war of words was far from over.
Brinks and company blast Hall for stalling negotiations – again
In the opening salvo of the day’s budget statement blitzkrieg, Brinks said Democrats in the Senate have done their jobs regarding the budget and that the ball remains in Hall’s court to get a full proposal to the table.
The majority leader said that despite all the political theater and Hall’s sabre rattling on roads, what he was putting at risk was the well-being of children and students across the state.
“Our kids deserve better,” Brinks said. “We have done our part. We’ve crafted a thorough, intentional education budget in a timely manner, without compromising on the priorities that matter most to our schools and to our students.”
The Republican education funding bill, Brinks added, would make deep cuts to areas like literacy supports and free school meals, creating uncertainty and an “impossible situation.”
Brinks laid all that blame at the feet of Hall, as did Democratic state Sen. Darrin Camilleri of Trenton, Sen. Dayna Polehanki of Livonia and Sen. Jeff Irwin of Ann Arbor.

Camilleri said it was mid-August with no budget and no answers for the people of Michigan.
“It’s pretty embarrassing that we’re in this situation,” Camilleri said, again blaming Hall. “If you act like this at any other job, your boss will put you on a performance improvement plan. But because he’s in a position of power and we are in politics, he thinks his obstruction and arrogance will be rewarded. We cannot let that happen. Matt Hall is losing respect daily in Lansing and across Michigan, and I urge him to get out of his own way for his own benefit, not ours.”
To that point, Camilleri said that Hall was standing in the way of his appropriations chairs and preventing them from having worthwhile discussions with their counterparts to get the budget moving along.
“Hall has tied the house’s hands, blocked us from reaching a compromise, has bottlenecked the entire process, and instead, here we are today without a budget,” Camilleri said. 
Bollin says Hall is not standing in her way
Hall hardly took the bait and remained unfazed in his position that it was the Senate and House Democrats who have thrown schools and the state into perpetual worry, and mostly because he believed the opposing party was unable to get it together on a road funding plan.
Hall’s list of grievances were similar to those expressed in past news conferences, but said the stalemate would end tomorrow if Democrats just took the time to execute on roads. 
He also said that it was not his intention to shut down the government, noting that the House’s supposed government shutdown prevention plan died without action from the Senate.
During the end of the press conference, Bollin walked in the door. It is unclear if her appearance was planned or if it was spurred by the comments from Brinks and other senators earlier in the day.
Either way, the move opened up Bollin to answer questions about whether she truly felt sidelined by Hall in the negotiation process. Bollin, of course, said she was not hindered in any way.
“We are in step with what we’re trying to accomplish with this budget,” Bollin said. “Our subcommittee chairs have had more autonomy and more input in this budget process than in years past. As far as my counterpart in the Senate, I do regularly communicate with Senator Anthony and also talk to the budget director. The speaker is talking on a different level with Senator Brinks, or attempting to, and the governor. We’re all trying to do our work.”
Bollin said people – primarily Democrats – may not like the House Republicans’ new process, and maybe don’t like their current timeline, but Bollin said the caucus’ budget was “going to be realistic.”
“It’s reestablishing priorities, and it’s going to be good value for the taxpayers,” Bollin said. “We’re able to fix the roads, we’re able to put forth sound education dollars without raising taxes, making sure with Medicaid, we have a lot to incorporate.” 
Bollin also defended Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, saying the state will see positive results from that plan.
“I have no doubt that we can put forward a very, very good budget that is realistic and will not be leaving people behind,” Bollin said. “And I hope that the Senate can join us in that effort to get it done soon.”
A possible break in the line of demarcation: ticked off constituents 
For Brinks and her colleagues, the prospect of a government shutdown made them uneasy, but they said the continued pressure on Hall from outside groups was likely a means to break the border line between the two parties.
When asked if it was impossible to get a budget done by the end of August, Brinks said no, and she was hopeful that things would start to turn around. 
On Hall’s insistence that the roads issue was holding everything up, Camilleri said it was a non-starter for his caucus to take billions of dollars from education and put it toward road funding, which he said appears to be the implication of the House’s education cuts.
The effects of Trump’s federal budget could also have an impact on breaking down the wall of stalled progress, as the leaders of the House and Senate have both said they were reexamining the budget outlook in light of federal budget cuts.
Members of the Senate Appropriation took the lead on that Wednesday.
During discussion of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, state Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), the committee’s chair, said that it was important for her to convene a group of experts to examine what it all means for Michigan as the budget waits in limbo.
A recent Citizens Research Council report said that the federal bill is projected to blow a $1 billion hole into Michigan’s budget, declining immediate revenues by at least $677 million or upward.
“While President Trump’s actions have made the job of serving Michigan’s people far more challenging – we’re not ones to give up when the going gets tough,” Anthony said in a statement following the meeting. “We’re re-examining the numbers and adjusting our budget to make sure we’re doing everything in our power to keep hardworking Michiganders from bearing the brunt of these dangerous federal cuts.”

In Hall’s view, the will of Senate Democrats has already been broken, at least in his estimation, because they have begun to pass key House policy bills unrelated to the budget.
However, when pressed on the matter by several reporters, including one from the Advance, Hall could not say exactly how the passage of the chamber’s policy bills meant there was now a willingness in the Senate to start having meaningful talks about roads, or the larger budget. He again rested on his belief that Whitmer would corral them into the negotiating room, particularly on the road funding issue.
No matter what happens over the next few weeks, business and school associations appear to have had quite enough.
In a statement that was geared toward the impacts of the federal budget bill and the Senate’s discussion on Wednesday afternoon, Robert McCann, executive director of the K-12 Alliance of Michigan, said the state’s budget breakdown would make those consequences worse, noting that the state’s schools relied on more than $170 million in Medicaid funding last year to deliver “vital” services to students. 
“Unfortunately, Lansing lawmakers are only compounding that damage by refusing to pass a budget that gives our schools even the most basic of funding security for the new school year, even as they reopen their doors to students in the coming days and weeks,” McCann said
Additional pressure came from a coalition of four Michigan business groups, who in a letter sent to Anthony and Bollin on Wednesday, pleaded with the Legislature to not keep funding education programs that help growth, keep students in the talent pipeline and move young people into the much-needed tech jobs of the future.
Leaders from the Detroit Regional Chamber, the Small Business Association of Michigan, TalentFirst and the Michigan Manufacturing Association signed the letter, which noted that education priorities should not become a footnote in the ongoing clash over the budget.
“Michigan still ranks around 33rd in educational attainment, which now leads to a ranking of 39th in income. There is no longer any such thing as a prosperous state that is not also highly educated,” the letter said. “In light of that reality, our concern is growing as Michigan continues to rank toward the bottom of the nation in many key educational metrics.”
Among the talking points in the letter were requests to continue Michigan’s goal of reaching 60% statewide educational attainment by 2030; support efforts to improve a culture valuing education in the state; refocus efforts on improving third-grade reading and math scores; and to expand incentives for dual enrollment and apprenticeship programs.
“To put it in stark terms, when it comes to educational outcomes, Michigan is in dire straits,” the letter said. “Without a significant long-term educational investment and strategy that transcends election results, our state, businesses, and students will continue to fall further behind.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8134881-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-13 20:56:22.911133

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Wednesday announced an emergency declaration aimed at dealing with rising crime in the small northern New Mexico town. (Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham issued an emergency declaration for the small city of Española and the surrounding area Wednesday, saying local police are overwhelmed with rising crime and drug overdose deaths. In an executive order, the governor authorized state resources, including the National Guard, to help after city, county and Pueblo leaders requested the assistance.
According to the executive order, police calls in Española and surrounding areas have doubled in the last two years, and police dispatches to businesses have quadrupled in that same period. She also cited Rio Arriba County’s high overdose death rate, “with residents struggling with addiction to fentanyl and other illicit substances.” Lujan Grisham’s order also authorized $750,000 in emergency spending.
“When our local leaders called for help to protect their communities, we responded immediately with decisive action,” Lujan Grisham said in a news release announcing the executive order. “We are making every resource available to support our local partners on the ground and restore public safety and stability to these areas that have been hardest hit by this crisis.”
Lauren Thorp, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, told Source NM the order is meant to help local, county and tribal police pay for “officer overtime, public safety equipment, and multi-agency interventions to address the surge in violent crime and drug trafficking.”
“This coordinated approach addresses the interconnected challenges of crime, overdoses, and community instability that have strained local capacity beyond their limits,” Thorp said in an email. 
There is no “immediate” assignment to deploy the National Guard, Thorp said, but that standard language in the governor’s executive order “is there if needed.” 
Guard spokesperson Hank Minitrez also confirmed that. “Guard hasn’t been tasked with any mission,” he said in a text message.
The governor signed a similar executive order in April that authorized National Guard troops to assist law enforcement in Albuquerque, the state’s biggest city. The governor’s April declaration in Albuquerque drew denunciations from the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico.
In that order, she also authorized $750,000 in emergency spending because she said Albuquerque was “experiencing a significant increase in crime” and requested help because it, too, did not have adequate resources to respond.
But unlike the Albuquerque executive order that directed the emergency funding directly to the National Guard, the Española order directs the funds to the state Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, an agency that typically helps residents respond to wildfires, floods or other natural disasters. 
Thorp provided Source recent letters from the Santa Clara and Ohkay Owingeh pueblos, along with Española and Rio Arriba County officials, asking the state to assist. She also forwarded along a series of charts from the Española Social Services Department director, Michelle Fraire, who said that the city has already seen 49 overdoses, compared with 40 in all of 2024.
“I predict this number will continue to increase and more than double,” Fraire wrote, according to the materials the governor’s office provided.
Danielle Silva, a spokesperson for Homeland Security, told Source that the department is receiving the funding to coordinate various state agencies, like it does after a natural disaster, to assist local officials dealing with the increased crime.
“We’re kind of dealing with the state as a whole trying to figure out a multi-faceted response,” she said. “The details on that need to be fleshed out with the locals, but they asked for help so we’ll figure out how to do it.”
Silva said “housing and other public safety” are examples of how the state’s various agencies might be able to assist the communities.
Española Police Chief Mizel Garcia told Source the reason why the city asked for help is because it doesn’t have enough police officers to respond to a spike in crimes committed by young people and crimes involving guns.
“We lose a lot of officers to bigger agencies that pay more and offer more benefits,” Garcia said in an interview. “The issue for us is the availability of resources.”
The city of just over 10,000 people cannot generate as much in tax revenue as larger cities, he said.
Española borders the Pueblos of Ohkay Owingeh to the north and Santa Clara to the south, which the order says are also experiencing “a significant increase in crime.”
Garcia said it is premature to say what the funding will be used for, and that will be determined once his agency can have a meeting with the Rio Arriba County Sheriff’s Office and the Ohkay Owingeh and Santa Clara tribal police departments to develop a plan of action.
“Many parts within the city of Española are within the jurisdiction of our tribal agencies, so this isn’t just for my department, this is something that’s joint,” Garcia said. Including the New Mexico State Police, there are five different police agencies that can respond to calls in the city, he said.
Española officials said at a town hall meeting on crime and organized by the governor last summer that they were having trouble recruiting local police officers, given that Los Alamos National Laboratories offered similar candidates much higher pay.
At the same town hall, residents were divided about what the city should do about an unhoused encampment that grew alongside the Rio Grande in town. City officials cleared the encampment shortly after the meeting, drawing an outcry. 
In the Albuquerque executive order, the governor authorized up to 70 National Guard soldiers to arrive in the city of about 560,000. They were dressed in plain clothes and were instructed to help APD with “non-law enforcement” activities including traffic control, administrative duties, transporting incarcerated people, court security, emergency response and “other critical functions that allow local law enforcement to focus on crime reduction efforts.”
The National Guard remains in Albuquerque, since the governor reauthorized its presence. The state has spent at least $2 million to keep it there.

(Alabama Reflector photo by Stew Milne)A Republican legislator from Alabama made the case for state-supported early childhood education Wednesday during a meeting of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s Pre-K for All Advisory Committee in Kentucky. 
  Alabama state Rep. Jeana Ross
Rep. Jeana Ross, a former educator and former secretary of her state’s Department of Early Childhood Education, said Alabama’s pre-K program “has survived Democratic and Republican governors” and has “always been a bipartisan program with bipartisan support and strong local and community support as well.” 
Ross was key in creating Alabama’s program at a time when research about brain development in young children was receiving more attention, she said. 
“It became evident that (in) these early years, a lot was going on,” Ross said. “The brain development and the experiences that children had early absolutely set their trajectory for the rest of their lives.” 
The committee also heard from Steven Barnett, the founder and senior co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, who said that children who attend pre-kindergarten are more likely to be ready for kindergarten, be healthier and live longer. 
During the session that convenes in January, Kentucky lawmakers will adopt the next two-year state budget. That probably will be Beshear’s last chance to win funding for pre-K for all Kentucky 4-year-olds, a proposal he has unsuccessfully pushed with the Republican-controlled legislature. Kentucky governors are limited to two terms, and Beshear’s second term ends in 2027. 
Democrat Beshear renews push for universal preschool in Kentucky

In June, he signed an executive order establishing the advisory committee to explore support for universal pre-kindergarten programs in Kentucky. 
During Wednesday’s Zoom meeting, the committee learned about what other states have done in public preschool programs. 
Barnett said  pre-K has a domino effect on multiple parts of life. 
“If you set those kinds of things up, you can then produce substantial improvements in later achievement, decreases in the need for special education, decreased failure and grade retention, and those things lead to increased educational attainment, more high school graduation, more post secondary enrollment,” Barnett told the committee.“Once you have that higher educational achievement, a whole host of other benefits follow: less crime, higher earnings, better jobs, better health. People will actually live longer.”
  Steven Barnett
During his weekly press conference Wednesday, Beshear said that since establishing the committee, people have sent more than 22,000 emails to legislators expressing support for universal pre-K in Kentucky. 
The committee has also held town halls in Bowling Green, Morehead, Frankfort and Northern Kentucky, which were “incredibly successful” and “very well attended,” according to Sam Flynn, the executive director for the Team Kentucky Pre-K for All Program. 
“It’s a no-brainer: Everybody wins by making pre-K accessible to every 4-year-old Kentucky child, including our businesses, our families, our kids and our economy,” Beshear said. One in five Kentucky children currently live in poverty. 
Beshear also cited recently published research that found parents benefit in their careers by having access to universal pre-K for their children. 
Flynn said “a significant number of” school superintendents in the state have “either reached out to us — or we’ve spoken directly to them — saying how much they support this.”

‘Be very brave’ 
From the beginning of Alabama’s work to make a successful pre-K program, Ross said, it was important to communicate “the importance of early childhood education and what it meant for our communities in our state as a whole.” 
Additionally, she said, “we knew that if the quality was not there, you may be doing more harm than good. So the quality was critical, and we built that from day one.” 
The committee chose to examine Alabama because of the state’s similar characteristics to Kentucky. It also looked at Georgia and Iowa. 
Andrea Day, a division director for the Department for Community Based Services, within the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said that Alabama and Georgia residents spend the lowest percentage of their income on child care for 4-year-olds. Kentuckians, in contrast, spend the most — 10% of annual income for one child, Day said. 
  Source: Pre-K for All Advisory Committee
To launch a successful pre-K program, Ross said, states have to “be very brave and take a few risks.” 
In Kentucky, about 63% of Kentucky’s children ages 3 and 4 were not in school from 2019-2023, an increase from 58% from 2014-2018. In 2024, 67% of Kentucky’s fourth graders were less than proficient in reading. That’s up from 65% in 2019. 
That same year, most — 76% — of eighth graders in the state weren’t proficient in math, up from 71% in 2019. From 2021-2022, 10% of high school students did not graduate on time, an increase from 9% in 2019, according to the report. 
Alabama’s voluntary pre-K program has not achieved universal enrollment  despite being recognized for its high quality.
Alabama was able to show that students who went through pre-K education were less likely to need special education services and more likely to attend class when they entered K-12, Ross said. 
“By the time they left that program, not only did they catch up, but they were ready for kindergarten,” Ross said. “And we could prove it.”

And with no action, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) says they’ll move forward with planned cuts to service later this month. The reductions could impact up to 800,000 people who use the transit system daily. 
House Democrats shot down a $47.6 billion budget proposal Wednesday that had cleared the GOP-controlled Senate late the night before by a party line vote, effectively prolonging the stalemate. 
The Senate’s proposal is about $3 billion less than the one that passed the House last month. The big differences include how to fund public education and different mechanisms for public transportation funding. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
House Appropriations Committee Minority Chair Ryan Bizarro (R-Erie) described the GOP-backed budget as more or less a stop-gap, allowing school districts and safety net services to continue functioning. 
To Appropriations Chair Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia), the proposal shows his Republican colleagues lack urgency, even as the threat of a prolonged standoff has community service providers and county officials scrambling.
“The only time you use numbers from last year is early on in the process, to move the process forward until you get an agreed upon number,” Harris said. “This is not something that you do a month-and-a-half after that. Literally last year’s numbers –  [that’s] a spending plan that says, ‘We’re not serious.’”

“I would not say that we’re far apart,” Shapiro said. “I spent a good bit of time last night with the leader of Democratic caucus, and I spent two hours this morning with the Senate Republican leader, Senator Pittman.”
“We’re making progress,” he added. “I actually thought that the move yesterday in the Senate brought us closer, because what it did was it made clear that the Senate is committed to funding mass transit, which has been a priority of mine.”
House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford/Fulton), however, said Shapiro should get more involved with negotiations. 
Though Topper acknowledged urgency may be increasing, he said that no budget would be passed until lawmakers embrace “a sense of reality … We’re getting a state budget when the realism sets in for everyone as to what the state can afford moving forward.”
The proposal rejected by House Democrats funneled $300 million in state gaming revenue to help prevent SEPTA service cuts and pay for road and bridge projects throughout the commonwealth. 
Public transportation entities in rural, suburban and urban areas get money from the Public Transportation Trust Fund earmarked separately for operations and capital.
Under the Senate’s plan from Tuesday, they could transfer some of those capital funds to pay for operations.

Absent a deal by Thursday, SEPTA’s planning to reduce service by 20 percent starting Aug. 24. But according to General Manager Scott Sauer, the Republican-backed bill would not have staved off the cuts. 
“The use of capital dollars for operating does not solve our problem,” Sauer told the House Rules Committee Wednesday afternoon. “It creates a new one.”
Namely, delaying crucial operating initiatives, he said. 
Among the projects that SEPTA says they fund with the money that would have gone to their operating budget, are a long-term train car modernization project. Some of their regional rail cars are more than 50 years old, and, according to Sauer, have led to fires and potentially unsafe conditions for riders. The multi-year replacement project is expected to cost around $1.8 billion over roughly 10 years, according to Sauer. 
They’d also have to increase fares – unless they can get a waiver – in line with the Consumer Price Index next year, in 2027 and then biannually. SEPTA and Pittsburgh Regional Transit would face more stringent accountability and performance requirements as well.

The bill has criminal justice components, too, including making the SETPA special prosecutor role permanent and cracking down on drug dealing and assaults on operators.
Transit funding under the latest House proposal would entail diverting another 1.75 percent of sales tax, which Republicans oppose.
The two proposed budget plans also differ on education, with the Senate’s proposal keeping funding at a flat rate. 
Specifically, it would distribute $500 million through a funding formula established last year to benefit underfunded school districts, after the Commonwealth Court found the previous funding method unconstitutionally inequitable. Democrats say that last year’s funding was only a first step towards remedying the situation, and that flat funding might run afoul of the court’s ruling. They called for an additional $526 million in the House budget.
It’s unclear what will happen next, or when a budget will be ready. The House has scheduled Appropriations Committee meetings every day through the rest of the month, though it’s unlikely they will meet for them all. 
House leaders and Shapiro have also said negotiations continue. But as it stands, both sides, while acknowledging they’ll have to compromise, appear to be dug in for now.
The longer the fight drags out, the more transit agencies in rural, urban and suburban areas, government services and county operations will face cuts, impacting Pennsylvanians and their communities
“There’s a willingness now, it looks like, in both chambers, to recognize the challenge,” House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) told reporters. “Now we’ve gotta fill in some of the blanks and realize not everyone’s going to get what they want.”

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall has issued yet another call to the Utah Legislature to more seriously consider funding requests to bolster the state’s homeless system. 
The mayor held a news conference on Wednesday hours after the Utah Office of Homeless Services released its annual report — which showed an 18% increase in the number of Utahns experiencing homelessness on a single night in January, according to the 2025 Point-in-Time Count. 
That number “should be heard as a battle cry,” Mendenhall said outside City Hall, “to bring more energy, focus and leadership to this issue by our state Legislature.” 
Utah homelessness rose 18% in 2025, state report says

“I want to be clear that I’m standing here before you today because I’m deeply concerned about the trajectory of homelessness in the state of Utah and in our capital city,” she said. “And once more, I’m extremely concerned by the lack of forward momentum from legislative leaders to address this growing statewide crisis.”
On Wednesday, Mendenhall pointed to the state’s newly released homelessness data as evidence that the state’s homeless system is facing growing needs. That report also showed the number of Utah children experiencing homelessness increased by 22% and the number of unhoused Utahns over the age of 64 rose 42%.
“To our state leaders, your partners are here. We are ready and willing to work with you. And the changes that are needed are clear,” Mendenahall said, noting that city leaders have made a proposal to increase homeless shelter capacity, but it lacks state funding. 
“As your partners, we have a plan for 1,300 more shelter beds. We have made land available, yet as of today, we have only one-third of the capital funding needed to build the first phase, and not a penny of operational capital.”

‘Our citizens expect results, not finger-pointing,’ governor and legislative leaders say
In response to Mendenhall’s call, however, Utah’s top Republican leaders — Gov. Spencer Cox, Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper — issued a joint statement saying the state has invested hundreds of millions in homeless services in recent years. And they urged Mendenhall to “turn down the politics.”
“Over the past five years, the state has made the largest investment in homeless services in our state’s history, spending more than $266 million on addressing homelessness. That includes setting aside $25 million to build a transformative campus,” Cox, Adams and Schultz said.
They added that across the nation, “addressing homelessness is primarily a city and county responsibility, but in Utah, the state has stepped up as a committed partner, working alongside local governments and the private sector to find real solutions.”
“The state remains committed to enhancing public safety and maintaining order, but lasting solutions require collaboration and partnership from the city, county and private sector leaders,” they added. 
While Cox, Adams and Schultz said they’ve been “encouraged” by newly-appointed Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd’s efforts to improve safety in Salt Lake City, “it’s frustrating to continuously take one step forward and two steps back with Salt Lake City.”
“The city needs to stay focused on its core responsibility of protecting its citizens, keeping streets safe and clean and making our capital a place Utahns can be proud of and visitors want to experience,” they said. “We urge Mayor Mendenhall to turn down the politics and keep working with us to find practical and lasting solutions to this complex issue. Our citizens expect results, not finger-pointing.”

‘Salt Lake City is making good on our part’
This marks the second time in less than a month that the mayor of Utah’s capital city has called on the Republican-controlled Legislature to take city requests more seriously for more funding to more holistically address crime, substance abuse, affordable housing and homeless services.
Last month, Mendenhall said she was “disappointed” in the lack of progress from the Legislature to adhere to a list of recommendations she included the public safety plan she presented in response to demands from state leaders, who had grown frustrated with crime, drugs and illegal camping in Salt Lake City ahead of the 2025 Legislature. 
With public safety update, ‘disappointed’ SLC mayor asks state to take city requests more seriously

The mayor on Wednesday again pointed to her public safety plan and the actions the Salt Lake City Police Department took to increase enforcement and address homelessness.
“Salt Lake City is making good on our part,” she said. “But the reality is, this is a humanitarian crisis. This is not something we can police our way out of. … Salt Lake City is taking enforcement as far as we can, and to little avail.”
The mayor said Salt Lake City police are on pace to set records for total arrests this year, “thanks in part to increased proactive policing by our officers.” She also noted that overall citywide crime remains at or below a 16-year low.
“We are enforcing our laws,” she said, “but the sad reality is that without more mental health treatment, more shelter beds, more permanent supportive housing and more capacity in our jails, too many people remain on our streets.” 
Mendenhall said it should come as no surprise that the state’s homeless population is increasing “due to financial and economic pressures” along with a longstanding housing shortage and home and rental prices that have skyrocketed over the past five years.
“There are simply not enough options for housing, shelter beds, treatment centers or social services to meet the demand in this state,” she said.
The 2026 Utah Legislature’s general session is scheduled to convene on Jan. 20. Acknowledging that’s months away, Mendenhall said the need is “startling,” so she’s issuing the call now. 
“I’m telling you now, in the middle of our warmest months, that the situation is dire,” she said. 
Funding for winter shelter beds expected to run out in April
Mendenhall said local leaders have already started trying to prepare for this winter’s emergency shelter response, but they’re anticipating a lack of funding to open enough beds, which she said “should be upsetting to all of us.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“There won’t be enough beds,” she said, adding that counties are submitting winter response plans for state approval, but “I’m very doubtful that those beds will be available. So we almost assuredly will have people on the streets with no option of space to go.”
Mendenhall, who sits as a voting member on the Utah Homeless Services Board, said the Utah Office of Homeless Services “does not have funding to continue those beds” beyond April, though that office has kept about 900 winter shelter beds open into this summer “because they had the funding from the Legislature to do so.”
But beyond this coming winter season, the money will dry up — unless lawmakers approve more. 
“So come the end of the winter shelter season, everyone who’s in one of the 900-plus beds that were created this year would be out on the streets,” she said. “And the impact in our downtown core, throughout our neighborhoods and parks and trail system, of 1,000-plus people flooding out with no option of places to go is very alarming.” 
There’s not enough money to build homeless campus, mayor says
Mendenhall also reiterated her warning last month that “progress has stalled” in the effort to create a 1,200- to 1,600-bed homeless campus “due to inadequate funding to build and non-existent funding to operate a new campus shelter.” 
State can officially use eminent domain to site a new homeless campus. What now?

“This is unacceptable,” she said. “I’m calling on our state leaders to recognize the crisis at hand. Step in to join your willing partners in local government, and lead the passage of legislation that will invest both the capital and ongoing operational funding for a new shelter space.”
Efforts to site and build that homeless campus are still ongoing, but state officials don’t expect it to be built in time for the coming winter. Last fall, the Utah Homeless Services Board set a deadline of Oct. 1, 2025 for the campus to be built, but State Homeless Coordinator Wayne Niederhauser said the siting process is taking longer than expected.
“We are working hard,” Niederhauser told Utah News Dispatch earlier this week, but he said it could be a matter of months before state leaders can finish environmental evaluations on properties they are considering — something he said must be done before state leaders decide whether to move forward with eminent domain powers granted by the 2025 Utah Legislature specifically to site the homeless campus. 
Niederhauser, however, acknowledged the “need is huge.” 
“We appreciate the acute need, the serious need of this,” he said. “So we’re not letting grass grow under our feet. We’re working hard to find a pathway.” 
The Utah Office of Homeless Services is also working on drafting funding recommendations to include in Gov. Spencer Cox’s budget proposal that’s usually issued in December. But in recent years, the Utah Legislature has only funded a fraction of what the governor has requested for homeless services. 
Cox calls for mental health care expansion on Utah State Hospital’s 140th anniversary

For 2025, Cox initially sought $128 million for homelessness, but in the end lawmakers funded $50 million in additional state spending for emergency shelter, including $25 million for “low barrier shelter.” Some of that was used to keep winter shelter beds open, while some is also supposed to be used to site and build the new homeless campus. 
But that’s not enough money to both build and fund ongoing operations for the new homeless campus, Mendenhall warned, urging lawmakers to appropriate more. 
She said over the coming months, city leaders will work with the Utah Office of Homeless Services, the courts system, and Salt Lake County officials will be working to “bring legislative requests that are needed to right the wrongs in the system that exist today.” 
“But,” she said, “there are no wheels on the bus that we present unless the state moves us forward. We must see action from legislative leadership and our governor to create the change that we know is not only possible, but is desperately needed.”

A federal judge in Rhode Island has sided with a coalition of domestic violence support groups, including one in Pennsylvania, in momentarily barring the federal government from enforcing a newly imposed set of restraints on Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants.
Senior District Judge William E. Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued his 27-page ruling on Friday, Aug. 8, granting the preliminary stay requested by the plaintiffs — an assembly of 17 state-level coalitions who work with domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence is part of the suit.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The preliminary stay halts the Office on Violence Against Women, an agency within the U.S. Department of Justice which distributes the VAWA grants, from instituting conditions the agency was set to apply to grant applications starting Tuesday, Aug. 12. The funding policy change would require grant applicants to align their projects and services with President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging directives to discontinue federal funding of DEI and what the administration calls “gender ideology.”
“This order is a critical step toward protecting survivors and ensuring that communities across the country can continue to provide the services Congress mandated,” the plaintiffs said in a joint statement issued Friday. “The administration’s attempt to politicize essential funding that supports survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault was not just unlawful, it was cruel.”
The plaintiffs’ legal team included attorneys from Democracy Forward, the ACLU of Rhode Island, the National Women’s Law Center, the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, and Daniel Jacobson, a former counsel for the U.S. Office of Management and Budget during the Biden administration, and now head of Jacobson Lawyers Group.
Jacobson and Democracy Forward’s Kristen Bateman made their case during a July 29 hearing before Smith, arguing that the Office on Violence Against Women violated the Administrative Procedure Act by unlawfully instituting the new funding conditions.

The organizations who rely on these funds, the attorneys argued, would see their work imperiled if they had to forgo federal funding critical to their operations. Applicants also had to certify adherence with the new restrictions, which attorneys argued could trigger future federal prosecution under the False Claims Act.
Smith agreed in his ruling that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on at least one of their Administrative Procedure Act claims. There was not enough evidence for the court to conclude whether or not the restrictions are fundamentally invalid, Smith wrote. But, the judge argued, administrative law is designed to provide clear reasoning for the actions taken by federal agencies — something absent in the office’s adoption of the new funding conditions.
“The Court understands that this matter arises on an expedited basis, and perhaps a fuller administrative record will disclose more of the Office’s decisionmaking process,” Smith wrote. “But on the present record, the Court can only conclude that the Office engaged in a wholly under-reasoned and arbitrary process.”
Smith’s ruling returned several times to a court document he had discussed at the July 29 hearing: a declaration from Ginger Baran Lyons, the deputy director of the Office on Violence Against Women, that was filed on behalf of the federal government’s case.
“The Office provides, as the only basis for its decision, a single declaration by an Office supervisory official,” Smith wrote. “While helpful, that declaration is not a substitute for an administrative record.”

During the hearing, Smith noted that Lyons’ declaration painted a vastly different landscape of how her office would interpret the new funding conditions, compared to the conditions’ actual language. Smith underlined that disconnect in his ruling, writing that the plaintiff groups would only find “cold comfort” in the agency’s reassurance that it would not treat survivors of violence differently than it has in the past.
“In the context of this case and the present Administration,” Smith wrote, “the words of President Ronald Reagan have never rang more true: ‘The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I’m from the Government, and I’m here to help.’”
Smith was also unmoved by the feds’ arguments that the office “would be ‘unlikely to recover the grant funds once they are disbursed,’” and that “the public . . . has an interest in the judiciary respecting the Executive Branch’s ability to lawfully direct and guide agencies’ spending decisions.”
The relief sought by the coalitions, Smith noted, did not require any disbursement of grant funds, just a shift in the conditions attached to them.
“And speaking of respect,” Smith added, “the public has an interest in the Executive respecting the Legislature’s spending decisions.”

(Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife/Flickr)Conservation groups are again going to court as part of a nearly two-decade-long fight to protect a small forest-dwelling rodent native to the Oregon Coast.
The Center For Biological Diversity, Cascadia Wildlands, Oregon Wild and the Bird Alliance Of Oregon sued the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on July 17 in U.S. District Court in Portland over the agency’s decision not to provide the north Oregon Coast red tree vole federal Endangered Species Act protections. The suit names the agency’s director, Paul Souza, and Doug Burgum, head of the U.S. Department of the Interior, as defendants.
The suit is the latest in an ongoing effort since 2007 to protect red tree voles, which live in the canopy of old growth conifer forests and feed on the needles of Douglas fir, Sitka spruce and western hemlock trees.
The small, mouse-sized animals with reddish-brown fur traditionally lived in forests along the coasts of Northern California and all along the Oregon Coast. But they’ve seen their habitat reduced by roughly 65% since 1986 due to logging and wildfires in the forests they depend on, according to a 2023 study from the U.S. Forest Service’s Pacific Northwest Research Station, which Trump officials announced they will close. The protections conservationists seek are for a distinct population of red tree vole that now only lives in northwestern Oregon.
“Red tree voles have graced Oregon’s coastal old-growth forests for thousands of years, but we could lose them forever if they don’t get Endangered Species Act protections soon,” said Ryan Shannon, attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement.
The group in 2007 petitioned Fish and Wildlife to add the vole to its Threatened and Endangered Species List, which would have applied a number of protective measures meant to preserve the voles’ habitat, likely including logging restrictions in old growth areas along the northern Oregon Coast. Four years later, agency officials agreed that protecting the voles was “warranted” but ruled that other species had higher priority for listing.
For about a decade between 2011 and 2019, Fish and Wildlife continued to consider adding the red tree vole to the Threatened and Endangered Species List, insisting on five separate occasions that listing it was “warranted” but precluded by higher priority species that needed more urgent protection. But in 2019, the agency officially reversed course and denied listing it. The Center for Biological Diversity sued, and Fish and Wildlife officials agreed in a settlement to reconsider listing the vole.
But in February of 2024, Fish and Wildlife officials again determined the Oregon Coast red tree vole did not warrant listing as an endangered or threatened species, in part because the species is considered adept at moving to find new habitat when it loses its current habitat.
The lawsuit against the agency argues the decision deprives the population of coastal voles of “critical protections necessary to ensure its continued survival and recovery, fails to follow the best available science, and is arbitrary and capricious.”
The decline in red tree voles has cascading effects. The voles are prey for northern spotted owls, who are federally listed as threatened and also rely on old-growth forests for their survival.
“Red tree voles are an important indicator species of forest health,” said Bethany Cotton, conservation director for Cascadia Wildlands, in a statement. “Their decline should be a wake-up call to us all to better care for our remaining mature and old-growth forests.”

According to a press release from the company, the 186,000-square-foot facility will be the largest of its kind in the JBS portfolio and will create approximately 400 jobs, once fully operational.
The purchase and required facility enhancements represent a $100 million investment, according to the release. The plant is expected to be operational by mid-2026 following capital investments and construction.

The facility was previously the Fresh Commissary, which made sandwiches, salads, bakery items and take-and-bake pizzas for Hy-Vee stores. Hy-Vee announced in April it was closing the facility that employed more than 300 people.
JBS plans to hire employees who previously worked at the facility under Hy-Vee, “due to the type of work,” the press release said. 
JBS is also planning a sausage-making facility in nearby Perry. With the two new locations, JBS will have five plants in Iowa. Other plants are in Council Bluffs, Marshalltown and Ottumwa.
“This facility in Ankeny will not only expand our prepared foods business in the U.S., it will also benefit from synergies and strategic supply of product from our other plants in the region,” Rick Foster, JBS’s U.S. head of prepared foods, said in a statement. 
According to the release, the Perry location will supply raw sausage to the Ankeny facility to be cooked and packaged as ready-to-eat. 
Wesley Batista Filho, CEO of JBS USA, said the company is “proud to grow our operations in Iowa.” 
JBS also operates a ready-to-eat bacon facility in Moberly, Missouri, and said there is “increasing consumer demand” for the ready-to-eat pork products. 
“Today’s announcement aligns with our long-term strategy of offering more value-added and prepared foods products to meet the needs of our customers and consumers,” Batista Filho said in the release.

(Tim Hawk for New Jersey Monitor)TOMS RIVER — The detention hearing for the undocumented immigrant accused in a deadly Lakewood crash was delayed Wednesday after his lawyers asked for more time to address immigration issues tied to the case, which has been the focus of White House attacks on Gov. Phil Murphy.
Raul Luna-Perez, 43, is accused of driving drunk on July 26 and crossing into oncoming traffic, causing a head-on collision that killed a woman and her 11-year-old daughter. The Trump administration has said Murphy, a Democrat, is to blame because of a state sanctuary policy for undocumented immigrants.

Appearing before Superior Court Judge Guy P. Ryan in Ocean County, attorneys for Luna-Perez said Wednesday they wanted to delay the detention hearing “in light of immigration issues.” Ryan rescheduled it for Monday afternoon.
New Jersey’s bail reform law requires prosecutors to argue to a judge that defendants in some criminal cases should be jailed before trial. A separate judge on July 31 freed Luna-Perez and ordered him confined to his home pending trial, but a second detention hearing was scheduled after Ocean County prosecutors filed additional charges against him.
“Our attorneys are committed to fulfilling their obligations under the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Padilla v. Kentucky and are diligently working to provide Mr. Luna-Perez with the required legal advice to fulfill that obligation,” Cristina LiBassi of the state Office of the Public Defender, which is representing Luna-Perez, said in a statement.
In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that defense attorneys must inform non-citizen clients about the immigration and deportation consequences of guilty pleas.
Luna-Perez was initially charged with two counts each of vehicular homicide and assault by auto, and prosecutors later charged him with two counts each of aggravated manslaughter and strict liability vehicular homicide. Police say his blood alcohol content was nearly three times the legal limit at the time of the crash.
After Luna-Perez’s arrest, the Trump administration pinned the blame for the deaths of Maria Pleitez, 42, and her 11-year-old daughter, Dayanara, on Murphy. The state’s Immigrant Trust Directive, which restricts cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents, is to blame for shielding Luna-Perez from deportation, the Trump administration has said. Luna-Perez has two prior arrests from earlier this year on drunken driving charges, and he was the subject of a 2023 domestic violence complaint that was later withdrawn, according to court officials.
“Governor Murphy and his sanctuary policies released this serial criminal into New Jersey communities,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said last week.
Murphy, asked about the Trump administration’s criticism at an unrelated event Wednesday, called the fatal crash “a tragedy that should have been avoided.”
“He shouldn’t have been on the road, and frankly, he shouldn’t have been in the country. I’ve been unequivocally firm about that. So, frankly, I don’t have a lot of disagreement,” he said.
Murphy declined to comment further.
The state Attorney General’s Office said last week that the Immigrant Trust Directive did not bar state law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials to deport Luna-Perez. The directive allows for cooperation regarding undocumented immigrants facing some serious and violent charges, including assault.
Luna-Perez’s immigration status was not discussed at the July 31 detention hearing.
A driving record for Luna-Perez obtained through a public records request shows his driver’s license was in good standing. He was cited for speeding in November.

(Christina Lords/Idaho Capital Sun)A legislative audit found that Idaho State University likely misused funds intended for a never-realized forensic pathology center in Pocatello.
The report found that the university appeared to pay Bannock County funds improperly in order to avoid reverting the unspent money to the state. The issue may go to Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador for further investigation.

The Legislative Services Office released the audit report Wednesday, which was too limited in scope to conclude malfeasance, Auditor April Renfro wrote in the audit summary, but facts that “may indicate misappropriation of public funds” were forwarded to the state’s chief litigator for further consideration. 
Labrador’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on if an investigation will be pursued. 
“ISU paid an invoice for $853,700 from Bannock County that was not supported by evidence of allowable expenses and appeared to have been directed and submitted to avoid reverting unspent general funds to the State of Idaho, as required,” the report said. 
ISU President Robert Wagner and Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Steele responded in a letter that the university “takes seriously the findings of the audit and its recommendations for use of public funds.” 
“We acknowledge the concerns raised in the report and agree to continue to implement measures to ensure appropriate accountability for financial transactions,” the university leaders wrote. 
 Audit spurred by Idaho senator and a conservative think tank IFF article 

The funds originated from a 2022 budget bill to the university for a proposed East Idaho Forensic Pathology Center, which would have been built on ISU’s campus and operated by Bannock County. 
The Legislature provided $900,000 for initial costs incurred on the project; ISU spent $46,300 in design consultation and cost estimates, ISU spokesperson Emily Frandsen told the Idaho Capital Sun for a previous story. 
The university on April 20, 2023, paid Bannock County the remaining $853,700 for the project but didn’t specify what those costs related to, the report said. The project eventually stalled because of the high costs for construction and to run autopsies, the Sun reported. 
Idaho senator alleges misuse of funds from ISU, Bannock County over forensic center

In November 2024, the conservative think tank Idaho Freedom Foundation published an article citing public records showing that the funds were never reverted back to the state. Sen. Glenneda Zuiderveld, R-Twin Falls, that same month sent out a press release alleging ISU misappropriated the funds for the defunct project and calling for an investigation, the Sun reported. 
The report cited the IFF article and emails showing that the university appeared “concerned about ensuring appropriation was not reverted to the Idaho State General Fund by stating that ‘“we need to expend the $900K state appropriation to ISU by June 30, 2023. We think the cleanest path forward is for the county to invoice us for the $900K.’” 
The invoice did not include details on what costs were incurred that it was for, as required by the bill providing the funds, House Bill 776. 
“We found no evidence that ISU attempted to obtain additional documentation to support the
expenditure or to recover the funds until after the media and Legislature began asking questions,” the report said. 
 ISU has taken steps to address findings in report

The report found that ISU employees interpreted the money as “pass-through” funds for the county, which was “problematic” because that is not how they were indicated on the legislation appropriating the money. 
Bannock County in late 2024 and early 2025 returned the money through two checks totaling $853,700, to ISU, which then sent the money back to the state treasury, the report said. 
The audit provided two recommendations to the university: develop and follow written procedures for proper monitoring and compliance with appropriation laws, and improve internal controls to ensure payments are supported by appropriate documentation and actual expenditures. 
In February of this year, the university created an Appropriations Tracking and Oversight Team, meant to ensure state money is expended in full compliance with the legislative intent and law. University leaders cited the new team in its response letter and said they had implemented “new procedures.”

The state Democratic Party called on McLeod to suspend his campaign after reviewing the video. (Screenshot from Charleston Police Department dashcam)The chair of South Carolina’s Democratic Party is calling on Mullins McLeod to discontinue his campaign for governor and focus on his mental health after his 35-minute, profanity-laden rant in the back of a police cruiser became public.
“It is clear the Mr. McLeod is navigating profound challenges and should focus on his mental and emotional well-being instead of a campaign for governor,” state Democratic Party Chairwoman Christale Spain said in a statement Wednesday.
Her plea came hours after The Post and Courier first reported on the dashcam video and two days after McLeod became the first Democrat to enter the 2026 governor’s race.
It appears McLeod is not heeding Spain’s advice, with his campaign manager telling the SC Daily Gazette he won’t back away.
“Everything is straight ahead,” said Democratic strategist Cary Cranford. He declined to address McLeod’s mental health.
McLeod did not respond to messages Wednesday left by the SC Daily Gazette. Nor did his criminal defense attorney.
The dashcam video comes from McLeod’s arrest in May on disorderly conduct charges. In it, the 53-year-old personal injury attorney jumps incoherently from one grievance to the next — shouting expletives and accusations for the entire ride against a variety of state and federal lawmakers and using a racial slur. He repeatedly threatens people he doesn’t like — saying he’ll kick their teeth in or let someone else do it — and occasionally yells out “McLeod for governor!”
The high-profile lawyer’s arrest, which made headlines in May, did not stop the Democrat from launching his bid Monday for the Governor’s Mansion. In his three-minute campaign video posted to YouTube, he rails again “corruption” at the Statehouse. Asked Monday about his arrest, he disputed the police report but declined to go into details. However, he pledged to fully explain what happened before voters go to the polls.
Dash camera footage released from Charleston Police showed what happened after he was placed in the back seat of the cruiser. The department released the video, first to The Post and Courier and then to the SC Daily Gazette, in response to public records requests.
Charleston lawyer becomes first Democrat to enter 2026 SC governor’s race

The video starts with McLeod rambling about class-action lawsuits and little money going to victims. When an officer asks for his name, he says all that matters is that he’s “one of the most just humans to ever walk this soil.” When the officer calls him John Doe, McLeod says he’d rather go by Superman.
Once the door closes, he seemingly tells himself, “I can’t connect these dots yet, but if this is going where I think it could be heading, I think I just figured out the president of the United States is my cousin. So, trust me at this point, nothing is crazier either than you and me either being related or you being not guilty. That’s just the way may brain has been trained.”
Then the shouting starts. 
The video was taken after officers responded to The Battery at the tip of Charleston’s peninsula about 9:30 p.m. May 14 and found McLeod wearing just underwear and shoes and “yelling at the top of his lungs,” according to the police report, obtained by the Gazette. The video shows him obviously shirtless. During the ride, officers turn up the radio to a Taylor Swift song, seemingly to try to drown out his ranting. It ends with him reluctantly getting out of cruiser. Whether he’s wearing boxers or shorts is unclear. His shoes appear to be loafers or slippers.
“I’m not getting out of this car. I’m not doing it,” he says when they arrive at the jail. When the officer asks why he says “because it’s time to go to bed. I’ll sleep right here.”
During the ride, McLeod used partial or full names of a long list of South Carolina officials for what he deems “corrupt” behavior. At one point, he used a vulgarity to describe a Black man.
One of his repeated targets is state Attorney General Alan Wilson, who he references by his full name. The state’s top prosecutor was one of the first Republican candidates to enter the 2026 governor’s race.
“Allen f****** Wilson, I’m daring you right now,” McLeod shouts on the video before calling the attorney general out for not doing “the people’s work.”
McLeod then launches into a tirade against “Nancy” — presumably U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, another governor hopeful. He calls her a “b****” and says she’s using the playbook of Lee Atwater, a former Republican political operative notorious for using dirty campaign tactics.
“Tell the world right now, what you did in the halls of Congress was the greatest sin ever committed in the history of this nation,” McLeod continues.
He doesn’t say exactly what he’s talking about. But in February, Mace accused her ex-fiancé and three other men of recording incidents of sexual exploitation and assault involving multiple women without their knowledge during a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.
Neither Mace nor Wilson’s campaigns responded Wednesday to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.
Other politicians McLeod mentions include Gov. Henry McMaster, former Gov. Nikki Haley and President Donald Trump.  McLeod calls Trump a “racist a**,” refers to Haley as a “b****” and appears to call on McMaster to sell the state plane.
He raves about Elon Musk and the Tesla billionaire’s space travel attempts: “I don’t ever want a billion dollars,” he said. “If I had a billion dollars, my stupid a** would try to do something like going to the moon.”
McLeod also rails against Republican donor Wallace Cheves and his efforts to build a casino near the small town of Santee, telling him repeatedly to pack his bags.
Sometimes he praises people. He seems to call former President Barack Obama a smooth talker and endorses former Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer for the U.S. Senate. (Bauer suspended his challenge to U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham last week.)
And he refers to his “friend Bakari,” former Democratic state Rep. Bakari Sellers, who he worked alongside to negotiate an $88 million settlement for victims of the 2015 shooting at Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. He describes Sellers as someone who can “kick (people) in the gums.”
“The only reason I didn’t let Bakari do the people’s work is because I like a little heavy lifting,” McLeod said.
Asked about the video Wednesday, Sellers said McLeod “needs to explain it” for the sake of the lawyer’s personal and professional relationships.
“I don’t know if there is an explanation,” Sellers told the Gazette. “But that’s on him.”
In a bond hearing following his arrest, McLeod’s lawyer told a judge the erratic behavior stemmed from a mental health episode and exhaustion, The Post and Courier reported.
In her statement, Spain said the party offers McLeod compassion and prays he finds the mental health support he needs.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-13-at-4.06.49 PM.png,,,2025-08-13 18:57:00.301414

Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks is failing to enforce water rights on behalf of the public to the detriment of rivers and healthy aquatic life including wild trout — and contrary to its constitutional duty — alleges a new lawsuit.
Last week, Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, Alliance for the Wild Rockies and Save the Bull Trout filed a complaint in Lewis and Clark County District Court asking a judge to find the state is failing in its duty to enforce its water rights.
The lawsuit asks the court to declare FWP is negligent in its duty to “maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment” as the state Constitution mandates by not asserting its water rights.
The complaint also asks the court to find FWP’s new protocol for stream flows under the Gov. Greg Gianforte administration is unscientific and is being used unlawfully.
It also alleges the protocol for determining water flow, created outside the rulemaking process, hinders the agency from exercising its constitutional duty to protect aquatic life.
FWP declined to comment on the lawsuit, and the Governor’s Office said FWP would speak for the administration.
“FWP is reviewing the complaint, but seeing as this is active litigation, we do not have a comment at this time,” said an FWP spokesperson.
However, Guy Alsentzer, executive director of the Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, said FWP doesn’t have a choice when it comes to protecting the public trust — it has a constitutional duty.
“Montana’s rivers are incredibly stressed — from extreme drought, unchecked pollution, and declining fish populations — yet the very agency tasked with protecting healthy fish and wildlife is choosing politics over science,” Alsentzer said in a statement. “At the moment when our rivers and streams need water the most, Fish, Wildlife and Parks has refused to act.”
Montana is experiencing “its most extreme drought on record,” and also its greatest demand, the lawsuit said. Citing the U.S. Drought Monitor, it said 82% of the state was experiencing drought conditions as of June.
Water rights possessed by FWP are “held in trust for the public, to protect aquatic life and recreation,” and they can help mitigate harms to fish, the lawsuit said.
However, the lawsuit alleges FWP has been leaving those rights unused, harming fisheries and the public as a result.
“While the state’s cold-water fisheries are the envy of the world, Montana’s iconic trout
species are almost universally experiencing population-level declines,” the lawsuit said.
It said the impacts could be costly; citing a scientific study, the lawsuit said cold-water sections of water generate $500,000 a year per kilometer, but cool-water sections generate just $60,000 by comparison, “primarily due to the preference for cold-water by nonresident fishers.”
In 2021, a conservation specialist at FWP was getting ready to call in water rights on the Smith River and the Shields River, as the agency has done in the past, the lawsuit said.
But that year, the Governor’s Office intervened, “wanting to know the names and types of water users that would be affected and asking for proof of how the call would provide benefit to the stream,” the complaint said.
For a variety of reasons, an FWP manager explained in a July 1, 2021, memo that FWP couldn’t definitively prove the benefit, given, for example, that some junior water rights users might not have been using water to begin with and would have nothing to add, the lawsuit said.
On July 7, 2021, Gov. Gianforte sent a letter to then-FWP Director Hank Worsech directing the agency to “forgo a call for water” on those rivers, the lawsuit said, quoting the correspondence.
Following public outcry in 2021, FWP issued a new Water Right Call Protocol in 2022, but the protocol is problematic in a number of ways, the complaint said.
The protocol fails to examine how aquatic life or recreational uses are protected, the lawsuit said, and it wasn’t created using the right procedures anyway, through rulemaking under the Montana Administrative Procedures Act.
In failing to assert its water rights, the complaint alleges FWP is harming the public’s ability to “fish, float, view and photograph scenery and wildlife, and engage in other vocational, scientific, spiritual and recreational activities which rely on healthy aquatic ecosystems.”
It also said the framers of the Montana Constitution meant it to be proactive in its environmental protections, as the Montana Supreme Court has concluded in other cases.
“Our constitution does not require that dead fish float on the surface of our state’s rivers and streams before its farsighted environmental protections can be invoked,” the lawsuit said, citing an earlier state Supreme Court opinion.
It also said the rights of the public and future generations under the Public Trust Doctrine predate the Montana Constitution, and the doctrine “imbues the state with a fiduciary duty to protect and conserve common pool natural resources, particularly water, for public benefit.”
Additionally, the lawsuit said Montana law “roundly recognizes” that the public’s property rights in water can be lost if they are not exercised and protected.
The complaint also points to findings of fact about the effects of climate change that were not challenged on appeal in Held vs. Montana. In the historic youth climate case, the Lewis and Clark County District Court found, and Montana Supreme Court affirmed, the state’s failure to consider greenhouse gas emissions violates the constitution’s protection of a clean and healthful environment.
“Anthropogenic climate change is disrupting the natural range of variation in the flow paths of Montana’s river systems,” the lawsuit said. “Compared to the 1960s, the summer streamflow … in Montana’s rivers has decreased by approximately 20% and stream temperatures have increased between 1-2 degrees C.”
The current complaint requests the court find Montanans’ constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment include healthy rivers with minimum stream flows that sustain aquatic life and fish; that FWP’s failure to assert its water rights violates its constitutional duty and breaches its obligation as a “trustee” of the public trust; and that FWP’s new protocol is unlawful and should be vacated.

Article Summary

U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, was the keynote speaker at the state’s largest annual downstate gathering of Democrats on Wednesday. Jeffries is poised to become U.S. House speaker if Democrats retake the chamber in 2026.
He said President Donald Trump is a threat to American democracy and that Democrats can win back Congress if they stand up for middle class values.
But that will be a challenge for the party, which has its lowest approval rating in history, according to recent polling.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on the story.

SPRINGFIELD – The man who hopes to be the next speaker of the U.S. House told an audience of Illinois Democrats Wednesday that President Donald Trump is a threat to American democracy and that Democrats can win back control of Congress if they stand up for middle class values.
Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, the current House minority leader, was the keynote speaker at the annual breakfast of the Illinois County Chairs’ Association, Illinois Democrats’ largest annual event, which coincides with the party’s day at the Illinois State Fair.
“The first six months of the Trump administration have been a debacle,” Jeffries said after rattling off a list of controversial actions Trump has taken since resuming office in January, from canceling funding for medical research to mass firings of federal workers. “America is better than this. We’re better than this.”
Wednesday’s events served as an unofficial starting point of the 2026 campaign. In federal races, Democrats hope to gain enough seats to win control of the House, which would enable them to block most of Trump’s political agenda for the remainder of his term.
Democrats are currently the dominant party in Illinois, where they hold all state constitutional offices, supermajorities in both chambers of the General Assembly, both U.S. Senate seats and 14 of the state’s 17 seats in the U.S. House.

But they are currently in the opposite position at the federal level, where Republicans hold the White House and slim majorities in both chambers of Congress.
Those majorities, however, have been enough to push through legislation that enacts much of Trump’s domestic policy agenda, which includes deep cuts to federal spending on social programs such as Medicaid, Head Start and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, along with a package of large tax cuts that mainly benefit upper-income taxpayers.
“They’re stealing food from the mouths of children, veterans and seniors, and all of this is being done so they can enact massive tax breaks for their billionaire donors who don’t need it,” Jeffries said. “This is what House Republicans have done.”
To win control of the House, Democrats need a net gain of at least three seats in the 2026 elections. But making even small gains has become increasingly difficult in recent years as states have drawn congressional district maps in ways intended to heavily favor one part or the other.
Out of the 220 House seats currently held by Republicans, the Cook Political Report rates only eight as “toss ups” while nine are rated as leaning Republican. Meanwhile, 10 Democratic seats are rated as toss ups and 12 others are listed in the leaning category.
In addition, the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature, acting at Trump’s request, is currently attempting to redraw its maps in a way that would give the GOP an advantage in five more congressional seats. But Texas Democrats have so far thwarted that effort by fleeing the state to prevent the Texas House from mustering a quorum, an action that Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has actively supported.
Unfavorable ratings
Democrats also face another obstacle to reclaiming a majority in the House – the party’s own unfavorable rating among American voters.
A Gallup poll in July showed that while Democrats hold a slight lead over Republicans in party affiliation, their favorability rating had fallen to 34%, its lowest point in more than 30 years. And exit polls from the 2024 election showed Trump winning a slight majority among lower-income voters while pulling in support from 45% of those in union households – demographic groups that have traditionally made up a big part of the Democratic Party’s base.
Asked about the party’s unfavorable rating at a separate event in Springfield Tuesday, Jeffries said Trump’s own approval rating has been falling as well.
“Donald Trump is more unpopular at this period of time than any president in American history, and he started out on January 20 more popular than he had ever been in his 10 years on the public scene,” he said. “The one big, ugly bill, which is now law, is deeply unpopular.”
But speaking to the Democratic County Chairs’ Association Wednesday, Jeffries sounded a message that was clearly aimed at winning back working-class voters.
“As Democrats, we believe in rewarding hard work, that when you work hard and play by the rules, you should be able to live a comfortable life,” he said. “Can I break that down for you? Good paying job, good housing, good health care, a good education for your children and a good retirement.”
Republicans will have an opportunity to respond to those criticisms and put forth their own election message Thursday when they celebrate Republican Day at the fair.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
On Friday, Secretary Jared Hoy and the warden of GBCI, Christopher Stevens, denied violating any of Laureano’s rights and engaging in any unlawful actions.
They denied that the plaintiff, Phyllis Laureano, “is entitled to any of the relief that she seeks” and called for the complaint to be dismissed. 
The lawsuit alleged that “defendants’ willful and deliberate indifference to Mr. Laureano’s safety resulted in him being murdered by his cellmate.” It alleged that “based on Defendants’ actions, Mr. Laureano suffered cruel and unusual punishment when Defendants failed to protect him from harm.”
The lawsuit alleged that “defendants failed to protect Mr. Laureano when they placed a particularly aggressive, violent, and discriminatory inmate with a history of severe physical assault and mental health issues” in a cell with him. 
In June, Jackson Vogel was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for Laureano’s death.
Vogel reportedly said he attacked Laureano because he was Black and gay, according to a report the Examiner received from the Brown County Sheriff’s Office. 
According to the report, Vogel had been issued conduct reports dated March 5 and 6, 2024, for language in inmate complaints and interview requests. 
The complaints reportedly contained “obscene, profane, abusive and threatening language” and swastika symbols. According to the report, Vogel wrote “‘you all need and deserve Death! Hail Hitler!’” and mentioned the Aryan Brotherhood and “‘White Power (WLM).’” 
The Post-Crescent reported that in May 2024, a judge and a prosecutor in Manitowoc County received death threats in the mail from Vogel, containing violent language detailing torture and cannibalism. 
In an article about Laureano’s death at GBCI in August, the Examiner reported that court records showed Vogel had been found guilty of attempted first-degree intentional homicide, and Laureano had been found guilty of taking and driving a vehicle without consent and as party to a crime for substantial battery intending bodily harm, robbery with use of force and first-degree recklessly endangering safety.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The future of University of Central Oklahoma’s student newspaper, The Vista, is unclear following a decision to immediately end the print publication. 
The Vista was established in 1903 and is distributed on the Edmond campus for free. This fall will mark the first semester the publication won’t print in 122 years, said Joe Hight, interim chair of the Student Media Advisory Board and UCO’s journalism ethics chair. 
Printing newspapers is still a viable learning tool for journalism students, he said. The Vista will continue to publish stories online, but Hight said there’s no strategy in place for the publication to immediately go all digital. 
“I use digital products myself all the time, but there still is value in using the print product as a learning tool,” Hight said. “That it’s a part of history. That once you put something down in print, it’s there to be referred back many decades from now. It can’t be changed or altered or anything like that.”
With a need to cut the student media budget by $18,000, the Student Media Advisory Board recommended reducing The Vista’s print publication to twice a month and using funds from the Dennie Hall Endowment Fund to supplement additional publications, Hight said. Those funding the endowment specified the money be used for The Vista, including print operations, he said. 
The board’s decision followed lots of research and hearing from students, including staff members of The Vista, Hight said.
Despite the recommendation, Hight said Elizabeth Maier, dean of UCO’s liberal arts college, made the call to cease printing The Vista immediately. Maier cited a “mandate” from the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education and the Regional University System of Oklahoma to be more efficient with resources, he said. 
Maier did not immediately return requests for comment. It was not clear which directive she was referring to. 
The Vista will “transition to an online digital publication” this fall semester, which begins Monday, said Adrienne Nobles, a spokesperson for UCO, in a statement Wednesday.

Nobles said The Vista previously had an online digital edition, in addition to print.
“This move maximizes university resources and aligns with industry trends and expectations,” she said. “UCO will continue meeting students where they are, offering a relevant, high-quality educational experience focused on career readiness.”
Hight said The Vista’s stories are currently published online under UCentral’s domain, UCO’s student media network. But without its own website, he said there’s concern The Vista name will be lost with all branding instead tied to UCentral. 
The Student Media Advisory Board is scheduled to meet Thursday afternoon on UCO’s Edmond campus. At the meeting, Hight said he will read a statement from the dean, emails from concerned students and faculty, and discuss the future of The Vista’s operations and the elimination of the publication’s campus news racks that were removed this summer. 
In recent years, other student media publications have also ceased print editions but continued digital publications. 
University of Oklahoma’s student run OU Daily stopped printing its weekly newspaper in 2022. 
At Texas A&M, the student newspaper The Battalion ended its print operation in 2022. The Maneater, University of Missouri’s student newspaper, stopped printing in 2023. 
Oklahoma State University’s The O’Colly continues to print once a week and publishes online. 
Mark Thomas, Oklahoma Press Association executive vice president, said printing is a small expense compared to a university’s total expenditures. 
The estimated cost to print The Vista for a year is around $12,000, according to an editorial in the publication. 
“If they say it’s the money, let’s open the expenditures of the entire university and let’s look at how they’re spending the money,” Thomas said. 
But if the decision were instead based on the viewpoints published in student media, it would be difficult for the university to overcome, he said. 
Pressure on student journalists to be a “mouthpiece for the administration” doesn’t silence them, Thomas said, because students will still find a way to be heard. 
No one contests that digital publications are an important tool and skill, especially for breaking news, he said. 
“But there are certain things that you want to have archived and to live on for a long time,” Thomas said. “And so that kind of a unilateral mandate to come down and say, ‘We’re just not going to print anything anymore,’ says that they really don’t want to have an archive that can’t be changed.”

Evers vetoed a bill that would have deprived Wisconsinites who finished serving their time for felonies of voting rights if they hadn't paid all their court fees and other obligations.. Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.Gov. Tony Evers recently vetoed a Republican-sponsored bill, AB87/SB95, that would have suspended the right to vote for Wisconsinites convicted of a felony who have served their sentence until they fulfill outstanding court-order obligations, such as fines, costs, restitution or community service.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
In Wisconsin, people who have served their criminal sentence for a felony, including incarceration and community service, parole, probation and extended supervision, are eligible to vote.
But the proposed legislation would have required any outstanding requirements – “fines, costs, fees, surcharges, and restitution [and] any court-ordered community service, imposed in connection with the crime” – to be addressed in full before voting rights were fully restored.
State Rep. Shae Sortwell, (R-Two Rivers) a sponsor of the bill, offered support in writing at the March 4, 2025 Assembly public hearing, saying the bill would “ensure justice is entirely served and full accountability is given to those that still owe a debt to their victims, especially those that are trafficked.” (The legislation also required restitution for victims of human trafficking as a condition.)
State Sen. Dan Feyen, (R- Fond Du Lac), a co-sponsor of the bill, said he supported the legislation “to make sure crime victims are justly compensated and the perpetrators of these crimes are held accountable for their action.”
However, in vetoing the proposed legislation, Evers said, “This bill would create additional barriers to make it harder for individuals who have completed their sentences to have their right to vote restored. My promise to Wisconsinites has always been that I will not sign legislation that makes it harder for eligible Wisconsinites to cast their ballot. I will continue to keep that promise.”
Mark Rice, Wisconsin transformational justice campaign coordinator at WISDOM, a faith-based organization that works to advance the rights of immigrants and formerly incarcerated people, said the issue is personal to him because he had his voting rights removed when he was sentenced for a felony.
“I couldn’t vote for several years after serving my prison sentence,” he said.
For those coming out of prison, said Rice, it is often difficult to secure employment and have the funds to pay off outstanding fees and restitution, and he doesn’t believe those struggling to integrate into society should face yet another obstacle to participate in civic life.
“We here at WISDOM have been organizing to expand voting rights for formerly incarcerated people for many years, and we thank Gov. Evers for vetoing a bill that would have amounted to voter suppression,” said Rice.
Marianne Oleson, operations director for Ex-incarcerated People Organizing (EXPO) of Wisconsin, also celebrated Evers’ veto.
“Governor Evers’ veto is a tremendous victory for EXPO, for the people we serve, and for democracy in Wisconsin,” Oleson said in a statement. “This bill would have imposed a modern-day poll tax, silencing thousands of Wisconsinites who have already completed their sentences simply because they could not afford to pay court costs or restitution.”
She added, “At EXPO, we believe the right to vote should never depend on the size of your bank account. Justice means restoring full citizenship and dignity to those who have paid their debt to society — not creating new barriers that keep them from participating in our democracy.”
The ACLU of Wisconsin has opposed the legislation since the March 4, 2025 public hearing.
“This proposal would create a modern-day poll tax in Wisconsin,” said the ACLU, and compared  the proposed legislation to a controversial Florida bill, SB 7066, that passed in 2019, which required “outstanding legal obligations” to be met before even allowing ex-felons the ability to register to vote.
The ACLU also warned that the state does not have a “centralized database” to accurately identify all outstanding obligations that would have to be met before voting is regained.
“This would make it nearly impossible for some individuals to determine what they owe, if anything, and whether they would be eligible to vote,” an  ACLU spokesperson said..
Jay Heck, executive director of Common Cause of Wisconsin, an organization supporting open and responsive government, also supported Evers’ veto.
“This measure had as its goal to make it more difficult for long marginalized communities in Wisconsin who are disproportionately Black, Indigenous, and other people of color, as well as people living in poverty and those with disabilities, to be able to exercise their right to vote,” Heck said in a statement.
He added, “This legislation didn’t make whole people who have survived crime; it just would have weakened democracy and put the right to vote out of reach through a poll tax – an outrageous and deeply unfair price tag on the freedom to vote.”

Article Summary

JB Pritzker and Illinois Democrats say they’ve delivered for middle class residents and that’s the blueprint their party should follow in 2026.
Democratic candidates for Illinois Senate disagree whether it’s right to receive contributions from corporations as they seek to set themselves apart in the primary race.
Some Democrats say there should be a path to independently drawn congressional maps while the Illinois House speaker says he’s not looking at making any changes to Illinois’ maps in response to Texas.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – Democrats across the country are searching for a winning message in the 2026 elections, but Illinois Democrats say they’re already found one.
With a video montage showcasing the state’s Democratic elected officials as Star Wars heroes fighting President Donald Trump – portrayed as Darth Vader – party leaders unofficially kicked off the 2026 campaign. That was part of an annual Democratic County Chairs’ Association breakfast in Springfield attended by more than 2,000 people before Gov. JB Pritzker held the governor’s traditional campaign rally at the Illinois State Fair.
“Illinois Democrats shook off the rust of old, poll-tested ideas and you governed instead with a renewed dedications to the needs and the wants of working families,” Pritzker told the room full of county-level Democrats.
The governor brought the stump speech he’s used on the national campaign trail and told the gathering of Illinois Democrats to stop analyzing why Republicans and Trump were victorious in 2024. Pritzker argued Illinois Democrats have already successfully implemented a message that resonates with voters.
“Ours is a story that doesn’t have a cult telling us what to believe,” Pritzker said.
While Illinois Democrats have been undefeated in statewide elections since 2018 when Pritzker and a slate of Democrats coasted to power amid Trump’s unpopularity in that year’s midterm election, the party has struggled at the national level. A Wall Street Journal poll in July found only 33% of voters across the country have a favorable view of the Democratic Party – the lowest in 35 years.
Pritzker, who has traveled the country and logged numerous appearances on national TV shows this year imploring his party to talk more about economic issues, isn’t concerned about failing to resonate with voters in Illinois.
“We’re not struggling to come up with a unified message, folks. Democrats are for working families,” he told reporters.
Pritzker is seeking a rare third term as he mulls running for president in 2028. Democratic Party of Illinois Chair Lisa Hernandez said the governor has created the right road map for her party in 2026.
“He’s been certainly a person that has moved this state in the direction where people do feel that there’s somebody speaking on their behalf,” Hernandez told Capitol News Illinois.
Senate race
While Pritzker seeks a third term, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin is not running for reelection, opening up his seat for the first time in 30 years. The three most high-profile candidates vying to replace him appeared at the State Fair Wednesday to explain why they deserve to replace the second-highest-ranking Democrat in the U.S. Senate.
“I wouldn’t even begin to pretend like I could somehow replace him, but I aspire to build on his legacy of great progress,” U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi told reporters.
U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly said she’s focused on being herself and hopes voters will look at her record representing a district that stretches from Chicago’s South Side to rural central Illinois.
Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton touted her current experience as a statewide elected official.
“When I’m going around the state, what people are saying is they are ready for new voices, new blood, new energy in Washington, D.C. – new ideas – and that the status quo right now simply is not working,” Stratton told reporters.
While the three candidates agree on many issues, Stratton has injected contention into the race by pledging not to take money from corporate political action committees.
“I want to make sure that I’m centering the voices of Illinois families and not corporate special interests,” Stratton said.

Stratton raised $1 million in the first quarter of her campaign as of the end of June, but the balance is dwarfed by the $22 million in Krishnamoorthi’s campaign fund and $2 million in Kelly’s. Both Kelly and Krishnamoorthi have received contributions from corporations.
“She’s also hoping for a super PAC to come to her rescue and so it’s very rich for her to accuse others of somehow being beholden to other interests,” Krishnamoorthi said of Stratton.

Stratton launched a federal political action committee of her own in January, which raised just short of $400,000 in the first six months of the year, according to federal records. Pritzker has endorsed his lieutenant governor and has a political action committee that could allow him to financially support Stratton’s campaign further.
Kelly is also working to compete with Krishnamoorthi’s fundraising power.
“I would not have gotten into this race if I didn’t think I had the resources I needed to win,” Kelly said. “I’m giving up a seat I probably could’ve held a long time.”
Redistricting hopes
Pritzker has positioned himself at the center of a national fight over mid-decade redistricting in Texas and has said all options are on the table for Illinois to respond. Recently, however, he has downplayed the likelihood of Illinois lawmakers further gerrymandering a congressional map where 14 of 17 districts already favor Democrats.
Hernandez, who in her capacity as a state lawmaker led the 2021 remap process for Illinois House Democrats, said the process she followed in 2021 was the “right way.”
Asked if she would support a national independent redistricting commission like Pritzker has said he favors, Hernandez said “we can continue talking about that, but for right now, I’m content how we handled things.”
Kelly said she would normally be wary of political blowback for Democrats if they tried to counter Texas Republicans, who hope to add five more Republican-leaning congressional seats in their state.
“We have to fight fire with fire,” Kelly said. “We have to take the House back. There are despicable things and we cannot continue that.”
Krishnamoorthi said he favors banning mid-decade redistricting.
“My vision is someday hopefully we’ll have fair maps across the board, across all states, so that everybody will be in parity,” he said.
House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch, D-Hillside, told reporters there hasn’t been any discussion about redrawing the lines in Illinois.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A compound called 7-hydroxymitragynine, also known as 7-OH, found in some kratom products, is now a Schedule 1 controlled substance in Florida.
Florida Attorney General James Uthemeir issued an emergency rule Wednesday that places 7-OH on a list of drugs, substances, or chemicals that are considered to have no accepted medical use but a high potential for abuse. Schedule 1 substances cannot be legally obtained with a prescription or readily dispensed for clinical use in the United States.
Food and Drug Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary joined a press conference along with Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, Dean of the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine Dean Dr. Charles Lockwood, and USF Health emergency department physician Cory Howard.
“So it is a significant pain killer. It has been proven to be highly addictive and easily can be overdosed, so its very dangerous,” Uthmeier said.
Simpson said his agency, which exercises regulatory oversight of kratom sales, would begin enforcement efforts Thursday and that retailers needed to remove the products from their shelves.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Florida legislators already have made it illegal to sell kratom to customers under the age of 21.  Nevertheless, Uthmeier said it’s being marketed and targeted to “kids.”
Meanwhile, the FDA’s Makary lauded the AG for taking quick action following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s decision last month to  send warning letters  to seven companies for allegedly illegally marketing products containing 7-OH.
Although 7-OH occurs naturally in trace amounts in kratom, the FDA’s  letters focus on concentrated products such as tablets, gummies, drink mixes, and shots that may be dangerous.
USF’s Howard said he has seen four patients over the last two weeks, some in the emergency room, who took 7-OH.
“I’m seeing this firsthand pop up,” Howard said.
“Most consumers don’t even realize the danger of the product, right? They can easily access it on store shelves, gas stations, right? I’ve seen this pop up in tablets, gummies, you know, candy lookalikes, drink mixes, teas, shots, wellness supplements. I personally have seen this show up a the gym, at my local gym, being passed around as a wellness supplement or to get over arthritis or, you know, kind of help that fatigue after a strong workout.”
Not universally supported
The rule isn’t supported by everyone, though.
South Florida attorney Paula Chavenko noted that the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust (HART), formed in 2023, has been working with researchers, regulators, and public health stakeholders to investigate the safety profile and efficacy of 7-OH, including through evaluation of how it is used across different consumer populations, potential adverse health effects, additional toxicological and safety data, and abuse potential studies.
“Studies from HART have observed a notable 30% reduction in opioid overdoses, suggesting a possible role for conservative, controlled use of the plant in supporting recovery,” Chavenko said.
“We stand for a regulatory framework that safeguards public health, encourages responsible usage, and supports scientific inquiry — all without resorting to scheduling that could hamper both medical advancement and individual liberty,” she continued.
The substance, she said, “should remain accessible when manufactured, sold transparently and safely, but not banned in a way that harms research, takes away the ability for the American people to have access to this botanical alternative, and creates counterproductive outcomes,” she said.

(Will McLelland/Alabama Reflector)A federal judge Wednesday declined to block Alabama’s 2024 state law banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and so-called “divisive concepts.”
U.S. District Judge David Proctor wrote in a 146-page opinion that professors and students in the University of Alabama System who filed a lawsuit challenging SB 129 did not meet any of the requirements needed to issue a preliminary injunction, saying that “a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy” that is “never awarded as of right.”
“The court concludes that plaintiffs have not established the requirements for the issuance of a preliminary injunction against the Board’s enforcement of SB 129,” Proctor wrote.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Proctor issued a separate order dismissing Gov. Kay Ivey as a defendant in the lawsuit and wrote in the opinion that none of the “injuries alleged” in the lawsuit or in the hearing “stem from actions taken by the Governor in her official capacity.”
“There is simply nothing in SB 129, the allegations of the complaint, or the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing that implicates Governor Ivey in any action taken in relation to SB 129 (other than her signing it after the Alabama Legislature passed it and her comments while doing so). These allegations are insufficient to establish that Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries are in any way traceable to Governor Ivey,” Proctor wrote.
The lawsuit, brought by professors and students in the University of Alabama system against Gov. Kay Ivey and the university system Board of Trustees, alleged that the law stifled instructional activity and violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The anti-DEI law banned public funding for diversity and inclusion initiatives and the teaching of so-called “divisive concepts,” such as people of one race being “inherently responsible” for past crimes committed by members of that race.
Messages seeking comments were left with the Alabama Attorney General’s office, which represented Ivey, and Jay Ezelle, who represents the UA Board of Trustees.
Antonio Ingram, a NAACP Legal Defense Fund lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the case, said in an interview Wednesday afternoon that while a stay was denied and Ivey was dismissed from the case, the lawsuit will move forward with the UA Board of Trustees as the sole defendants.
“While this is a setback, we are still committed to fighting this discriminatory law that is, in our opinion, violating the First Amendment rights of students and professors,” Ingram said.
In briefs filed after hearings in late June and early July, plaintiffs argued that a new law is leading to “viewpoint discrimination,” claiming that professors, fearing enforcement, have to “self-censor” and change their teaching methods. One professor, Dana Patton, testified she was investigated after an anonymous complaint and warned by Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, that lawmakers wouldn’t “let this go.”
The Alabama Attorney General’s office, representing Gov. Kay Ivey, argued in their post-hearing brief that these fears aren’t “objectively reasonable” since the professors stated they don’t intend to violate the law. Attorneys for the UA Board, argued that classroom speech is “government speech,” not private speech, and that the University of Alabama has the right to “reasonably control the content of their curriculum.”
In July 2024, ahead of the anti-DEI law’s implementation, the UA system announced it planned to close the schools’ DEI offices and replace them with offices that seemingly addressed similar goals. Later in August, UA closed its Black Student Union and Safe Zone, its LGBTQ+ resource center, citing compliance with SB 129.
Student plaintiffs also claimed the law caused their organizations to lose funding and campus spaces. The defendants countered that some of these injuries are “monetary” and that, in certain cases, students chose not to apply for available funding.

(Photo via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the State of Iowa) The federal government’s most recent assessment of health-facility inspections indicates Iowa has failed to meet three key standards.
The new report from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services indicates the state-run inspection agencies that oversee nursing homes and hospitals around the nation fielded more than 107,000 complaints about health care facilities last year – a 31% increase from 2019 that officials say may have contributed to 38 states failing to meet all of the federal performance standards.
Each year, CMS assesses the performance of the state agencies tasked with enforcing federal regulations concerning health care facilities. The latest data shows that last year, only 14 of the 52 agencies met all of the acceptable thresholds for the annual recertification of nursing homes, according to the CMS State Performance Standards System Findings published last week.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
CMS’ report indicates the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing met most of the federal standards related to the inspection process in 2024, but failed to meet the standards in three areas:
— Off-hour inspections at the worst nursing homes: Under CMS guidelines, state agencies are to inspect the worst care facilities in their jurisdiction — the federally designated “special-focus facilities” that have recurring, serious deficiencies in resident care — during off hours to guard against homes altering their routine in anticipation of what should be a surprise visit by inspectors.
— Immediate jeopardy in acute-care settings: To accurately record the seriousness of deficiencies that can cause actual injury or death to residents in acute and continuing-care settings, inspectors must use a CMS-prescribed “immediate jeopardy template” in at least 80% of all cases where immediate jeopardy is cited. The template is used to document the evidence of each issue that places patients at risk.
— Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act violations in acute-care settings: State inspection agencies must initiate, on a timely basis, the intake and investigation of at least 95% of EMTALA immediate-jeopardy complaints tied to acute and continuing-care providers. EMTALA violations often relate to emergency-room patients being discharged without first being stabilized.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch asked the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing on Tuesday for its perspective on the CMS report. As of Wednesday afternoon, the agency had not commented on the report.
Complaints up 31% from 2019 
In its report, CMS notes that its findings are to be considered “in the context of unchanged state-agency funding levels since fiscal year 2015, despite continued resource and workload challenges in the last five years.”
The report points out that since 2019, the number of complaints requiring investigation by health facility inspectors has increased 31% nationally. Most of the 107,000 complaints filed in fiscal year 20124 are related to nursing homes, CMS reported.
CMS also reported that during the past five years, there has been a 79% increase in complaints directed against hospitals, with more than 14,500 such complaints filed in fiscal year 2024.
Last October, DIAL issued a press release announcing that its health facilities inspectors had “met the federal mandate for nursing home inspections outlined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for federal fiscal year 2024.”
The news release focused on the federal requirement that each individual nursing home undergo an annual inspection, called a “recertification survey,” within 16 months of its last annual inspection. DIAL met that specific requirement in 2024.
At the time, DIAL also took issue with a September 2024 report from Auditor of State Rob Sand that indicated DIAL had failed to meet certain inspection standards. DIAL said the audit “relied on outdated numbers and incorrect federal performance measurements,” and the agency criticized the auditor’s office for failing to engage with DIAL “before issuing its inaccurate report.”
“The auditor’s report is inaccurate, incomplete, and confusing,” agency spokesperson Diane McCool said at the time. “It is also a waste of taxpayer dollars as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services will release their own findings of the state survey agencies after the federal fiscal year concludes.”
At least part of the conflict over the findings is due to the nature of the auditor’s report, which looked at DIAL’s compliance over three annual inspection cycles. DIAL itself focused more narrowly on data from 2024 when it performed better than in previous years.
The auditor’s report indicated Iowa had been conducting nursing home inspections, on average, every 17.1 months — which is more than four months beyond the federal mandate that requires such homes to be inspected, on average, every 12.9 months.
In addition to the federal mandate for inspecting all homes on a 12.9-month average, CMS also requires states to inspect each individual care facility at least once every 15.9 months.
According to the state auditor’s report, DIAL had failed to meet that requirement, as well. The report stated that for 85.4% of Iowa’s 403 nursing homes, inspectors missed the 15.9-month deadline on at least one occasion during the past three inspection cycles.

COLCHESTER — On a warm Thursday evening, a group of residents gathered at Bayside Park with signs they used to protest a hotel and resort proposal at a recent Development Review Board meeting.
They pointed out a long marina in the bay and two parcels of private property at 166 and 180 West Lakeshore Drive that were largely hidden by a cluster of large trees.
They imagined what the area would look like when the majority of those old trees are removed. That’s part of the plan proposed by Hazelett Strip-Casting Corporation, which is seeking to combine the two lots and to construct five large buildings into the slope overlooking the bay. 
The plan envisions a $8 million hotel comprising five “cottage-style” buildings for “a 20-room inn” with a restaurant and event space at the lakefront site of a former motel.
“The town should protect us and the bay,” said Phyllis Bryden, who bought a house on East Lakeshore Drive nine years ago and has been disappointed with overcrowding of the area, the diminished water quality and increased traffic on the scenic stretch of Malletts Bay.
Marilyn Sowles, a resident of Porters Point Road and a former selectboard member, is concerned about diminished views — both from the lake and the road. 
She held up a photo of what the shoreline now looks like as taken from a boat on the bay. It looks like a verdant stretch of green on the sloping shore. The project renderings replace it with five shiny glassfront buildings as proposed by consultants Scott Homsted from the engineering firm Krebs and Lansing, and Benjamin Avery of Greenfield Growth Consulting LLC, formerly a developer with Black Rock.

“There is no way to build that huge monstrosity on this skinny piece of land and maintain the views from the lake,” she said at a packed Development Review Board hearing on July 23 that ran almost four hours, like the previous June 11 hearing.
Residents, including those gathered last week, continue to protest the $8 million project. At both hearings, they reiterated concerns about environmental and traffic impacts, and with setting a development precedent for the Malletts Bay shorefront.
Between the two hearings about 20 concerned residents hired Brice Simon, a lawyer in Stowe, who sent a letter to town officials July 21 reiterating a litany of concerns. These range from the project’s lack of stormwater and runoff treatment to its adverse scenic impacts.
“I hope that the DRB will deny the application,” said Simon, who outlined how and why the proposal does not meet the definition of an inn, as the developers call it. He said it is a hotel, which is not allowed in the area according to the Colchester Town Plan.
“The site plan approval is not appropriate for a project that is so out of conformance with the surrounding area, and which would cause such undue adverse effects on the surrounding ecological, scenic, state and municipal resources,” he wrote in an email.
Simon also submitted a petition at the last development review board meeting signed by more than 50 residents opposed to the project.
Town officials declined to comment.
The board is expected to issue a written decision on the project in September, 45 days from the last hearing, according to Zachary Maia, development manager in the town’s planning and zoning office. He confirmed Simon’s letter was received as testimony by the Development Review Board.

Many of the residents who gathered at the waterfront last week shared views on why they believe the project is out-of-character in the bay.
Longtime resident Jerry Allyn said he is concerned about added water pollution it could bring. A big project without a stormwater runoff plan is irresponsible, he said. And with most of the 98 parking spots proposed across the street, drop-off and crossings would create a major traffic hazard, he added.
“When I first came here there was one traffic light in town. Now West Lakeshore Drive is one of the busiest sections in town,” he said referring to the traffic. It has been exacerbated since the Malletts Bay sewer project began.
Nancy Cloutier of Church Road, who has been living in Colchester for 22 years, said she and her husband are “appalled” the town would consider such a large project that would “destroy the view,” affect traffic and does not meet the Town Plan’s guidelines.

“The aesthetics are horrible,” she said.
Cloutier said she has a background in event planning and takes issue with the proposed capacity numbers presented by the developer. What is projected to be a 40-person capacity restaurant can hold much more, she said, if tables and chairs are removed for an event. She shared her concern at the last hearing.
“I feel that the board and the planning and zoning commission have been given enough testimony and information from citizens to reject this permit out-of-pocket on very good, solid ground,” said resident Jeanne Welch, who commutes daily and is concerned about the safety of pedestrians, cyclists and that the development could circumvent local regulations.
The developers and consultants did not respond to comment.
Meanwhile, all await the town board’s decision.
As the rays of the setting sun dappled through the trees at Bayside Park, the residents lowered their signs and walked slowly up the hill to head home.

James Comer said that while he supports President Donald Trump’s crime-fighting moves in Washington, D.C., he hopes similar efforts will not be replicated in Kentucky. 
Trump mobilized National Guard troops and asserted control of police in the nation’s capital on Monday under what he declared a “crime emergency.” He also warned he may pursue similar action in other Democratic-led cities. 
Comer, Kentucky’s 1st Congressional District representative, said Wednesday afternoon that the president’s federalization of the Washington, D.C. police force shows “that the president, as well as Congress, is serious about cracking down on the crime crisis.” The congressman spoke to reporters with Republican Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman following a roundtable with law enforcement officials from across the state.
Comer, who is the House Oversight chair, said the committee will have a hearing with Washington, D.C., officials in September. 
“We’re going to be talking about how we can solve this problem. We don’t want Washington D.C. to have a National Guard presence very long. But what we see in Washington D.C., I’ve learned today, we’re seeing in places like Louisville and other places,” Comer said. 
Comer said his discussion with Kentucky police suggests there has been “a huge increase in juvenile criminal activity.” He later added that he would share the information gleaned in Wednesday’s roundtable with Trump. 
Comer said that in general juvenile offenders “aren’t being prosecuted for crimes for various reasons,” leading to an increase in adult criminals encouraging young people to commit crimes. 
In January, violent crime in Washington, D.C., hit a 30 year low. 
“We have this crime crisis that’s overwhelmingly in the larger cities in the United States, but at the core of this is ensuring that we back these guys on the front line here,” Comer said, referring to the law enforcement officials present. Part of that includes ensuring adequate funding for police, he added. 
When asked if Trump should replicate his move in D.C. in Kentucky, Comer said “hopefully not” and said that Louisville is “a different deal.”
“I think we’ve got a great (Louisville) Metro Council, and I think we’ve got a mayor (Craig Greenberg) that’s serious about cracking down on crime,” Comer said. “Many times it’s the attitude of the prosecutors and the judges. People have to be held accountable for crimes that are being committed in Washington, D.C.”
Comer’s committee has legislative jurisdiction over the District of Columbia ., so he said he often works closely with local officials there. He said “a liberal metro D.C. Council” and “prosecutors and judges that are just so lenient” have led to criminal justice reform “so far to the extreme that the criminals — they’re never held accountable in Washington, D.C.” 
“I don’t want to see what’s happening in Washington replicated to other cities, but if these other cities don’t get serious about it, then it probably will be, and the president’s said that,” Comer said. 
Coleman called Comer “one of the most influential Kentuckians who walked the halls in Washington, D.C.” while introducing him. Coleman also said that Comer has the ear of Trump and leads the House Oversight Committee “both very significant positions to help us address the problems that were talked about around this table.”

Earlier this month, some Kentucky Republicans called on Comer to consider running for governor in 2027. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, serving his second term, will be term-limited. 
Beshear, who is seen as a possible presidential candidate in 2028, addressed Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Washington during his weekly press conference Wednesday afternoon. 
“The Guard is not trained for everyday law enforcement activity. The Guard is trained for logistical support, responding to natural disasters, assisting and helping active military,” Beshear said. “To put our Guard — who, remember, are our neighbors — in places and spaces that they are not trained for, puts an American with a family in a potentially dangerous situation.” 
When Trump mobilized California National Guard troops in response to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents’ activity in Los Angeles earlier this summer, Beshear said at the time that “violence is never acceptable” but “a chain of command” should be respected. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass had objected to Trump’s action. 
“My hope is that going forward, this will not be a tactic that the president continues to use because the very people he is calling in to do different jobs may be put in harm’s way,” Beshear said Wednesday.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4842-e1755121491632-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-08-13 17:57:41.003973

KILLINGTON — The Killington Resort is accustomed to hosting fast-flying World Cup racers on its aptly named Superstar trail. But that didn’t stop locals from gawking Wednesday when a helicopter circled higher than the mid-August temperature as part of an even more stratospheric event.
Vermont’s largest ski area used the chopper to install a dozen towers — some up to 58 feet tall — for a new $12 million Superstar chairlift. It’s part of a $38 million improvement project that also will raise the capacity and reduce the energy consumption of the resort’s 9-million-gallon-a-day snowmaking system.
“This is really a milestone moment,” Tait Germon, Killington’s director of mountain operations, shouted over the windy whir of propellers. “It’s exciting to see it start to come together.”
When a 20-something honeymooner named Preston Smith opened the first trails on the state’s second tallest peak in 1958, he was happy to raise $30,000 for a simple shelter and parking lot.
Smith, now 95, went on to create the biggest snow-sport resort in eastern North America before its sale to the Maine-based American Skiing Company in 1996 (the same year neighboring Pico Mountain joined the portfolio), the Utah-based Powdr Corp. in 2007 and local investors who formed the Killington Independence Group last year.
“This landmark purchase represents a commitment to keeping Killington and Pico in the hands of those who know and love it, with plans to increase capital investment while preserving the mountains’ unique character and community,” the current owners said in a statement last August.

The Rutland County resort closed the four-decade-old Superstar chairlift in April for dismantling, leaving its nearby K-1 gondola to transport summer visitors to hiking and biking trails and an 18-hole golf course. 
Killington faced challenges finding a helicopter, as its original pilot left to fight Canadian wildfires. But another crew arrived Wednesday to fly the towers onto recently poured concrete foundations, logging in some 50 trips up and down the 4,241-foot peak from early morning to late afternoon.
“Given the challenging terrain we’re working with — it’s not like you can drive in with a crane — this is the most efficient way to do this,” Germon said.
The new six-passenger chairlift is on schedule for completion in November, Killington officials said. But mindful of potential weather problems, they couldn’t guarantee it would be finished in time for the World Cup, which has drawn up to 20,000 spectators and a national television audience of 2 million viewers annually since 2016.
As a result, the international circuit will move this year to Copper Mountain in Colorado, although “the race is expected to return to Killington Thanksgiving weekend 2026,” the Vermont resort said in a statement.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) 


“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.” Mark Twain’s quip perfectly describes the entire Trump Administration, but none more so than medical crackpot, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
Perched with his brain worm on top of Health and Human Services, Kennedy probably affects your health more than your family doctor. But unlike your doctor, Kennedy has no medical degree, no hospital privileges, never cared for a patient, never discovered a drug, never published a research paper, and wouldn’t know which end of a stethoscope to use if his life or yours depended on it. Nonetheless he has opinions, and he’s enforcing them on you, on all of us. This makes as much sense as pilots flying airplanes who have never seen a cockpit, or placing the future of the United States in the hands of Donald “Windmills Cause Cancer” Trump.
Many actual medical experts believe vaccines have done more good for humanity than any other public health advance in history.  COVID vaccines saved nearly 20 million lives globally in their first year alone. They also reduced the risk of severe, debilitating outcomes and long COVID after infection.  But Kennedy knows “for sure” that decades of knowledge accumulated by the entire world’s medical community is wrong, and he’s eager to straighten us out.
Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine have been under development for 30 years. Compared to older technologies they are cheaper, can be mass produced faster, and can be changed more quickly to address inevitable virus mutations like with COVID. This technology also has great promise to treat cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and diabetes.  Two American scientists won the Nobel Prize for their mRNA discoveries.  To real scientists, mRNA vaccines are not controversial.  Without them COVID would probably still be spreading death and disability across the globe.
In May Kennedy yanked $590 million from developing pandemic flu vaccines such as bird flu.  Rick Bright, who led Health and Human Services Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority during Trump 1.0, said,“Disinvesting from mRNA strips us of one of the fastest tools we have to contain the next pandemic.”
But the greatest potential of new mRNA vaccines may be as a monumental breakthrough in cancer treatments. The DNA of cancer cells is as variable as the people who are hosts for the disease. Moreover, cancer cells create unique pieces of protein that are not found in healthy cells. A vaccine that produces those pieces can train the immune system to attack those cells. This technology could offer personalized treatment by training a patient’s immune system to read and then destroy individually unique cancer cells.  The vaccines furthest along could treat pancreatic and brain cancers. Over 120 clinical trials on cancer vaccines were underway as of early this year.
But then Kennedy announced last week he will yank another $500 million from vaccines with mRNA technology.  This will also discourage private investment, prompt key scientists to leave the country, and set back cancer research for decades.
One in two women and one in three men will get cancer in their life time. Cancer is the second leading cause of death, claiming 600,000 American lives annually. By the 1970s experts concluded that 80% of cancer is caused by environmental exposures, i.e. carcinogens we eat, smoke, breathe, swallow, or absorb. The incidence of 14 different cancers is steeply rising among those under 50.   And young people are getting more aggressive cancers that are growing more quickly and have a worse prognosis. In young adults symptoms are more likely to be dismissed, resulting in later, less treatable stages when diagnosed. Environmental factors are most likely to blame because the primary remaining culprit, genetics, doesn’t change that much over a generation.
I grew up one of eight children.  Five of us, including me, have had cancer, some with multiple types, and some of us are still fighting it.  Half of my own children are cancer victims. I’ve just spent weeks tending my delightful three year old granddaughter, Lana, because her mother is fighting for her life and will need every cancer treatment available, including perhaps a future mRNA vaccine. The cruel farce of  Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” is animated in real time, in the faces of the people I love and see every day.
Kennedy is slamming the door on the survival chances of millions of cancer victims, some of them will be the more than 14,000 Utahns diagnosed with cancer every year. While we don’t know yet who they might be, go find your favorite family pictures. Some will likely be in the photos you have in your hand.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0919-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-13 17:57:41.003973

How university heads in other neighboring states stack up
University of Alabama System Chancellor Sid Trant takes home $884,716 after a 36% increase from his pay as interim chancellor approved in the spring, according to AL.com.
Peter Hans, University of North Carolina System president, also got a big raise this year, according to the News & Observer, going from about $455,000 to $600,000 on June 1.
Ray Rodrigues, Chancellor of the State University System of Florida, has a salary of $441,252, while Michael Amiridis of the University of South Carolina system makes $352,184, according to state data.
Randy Boyd, University of Tennessee System president, who is independently wealthy, takes no salary but reportedly accepts a $10,000 stipend to cover health insurance costs.


Chancellor Sonny Perdue, head of the University System of Georgia, could be getting a pay raise to the tune of $50,000, bringing his salary to $572,500.
The Board of Regents voted to move the raise forward Tuesday and kick off a 30-day waiting period before they can vote on the raise. The vote came at the very end of the board’s regular meeting, directly after an executive session in which members of the public were asked to leave the room and the livestream was cut off.
Perdue did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“The proposal is not finalized and is part of a formal, transparent process that requires full Board of Regents review and approval,” said Board of Regents Chair T. Dallas Smith in a statement. “Following the required notice period, I know the Board will consider the proposal in the context of its responsibility to serve students, campuses and the public while being good stewards of state resources.”
Perdue, 78, was appointed chancellor by Gov. Brian Kemp in 2022. He previously served as secretary of agriculture from 2017 to 2021 under the first administration of President Donald Trump and as governor of Georgia for two terms, from 2003 to 2011.
According to data compiled by the Georgia Department of Audits and Accounts, Perdue’s salary in fiscal year 2024 was $531,900, which made him one the top-earning state employees in Georgia.
Compared with university system heads in the states bordering Georgia, Perdue’s salary is toward the middle of the pack and less than what the leaders of Alabama and North Carolina’s systems make following a couple big raises of their own.
The University System of Georgia has celebrated successes in recent months, including record enrollment numbers. Speaking at Tuesday’s meeting, Perdue touted a pair of recently released studies he said show the system’s economic impact to the state grew 5.4% in fiscal year 2024 and that the class of 2024 will earn on average $1.4 million more over their lifetimes than they would without a college degree.
The regents’ next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 16, 35 days after Tuesday’s meeting and outside the minimum 30-day waiting period to vote on the increase.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Lawmakers are considering a bill to clarify the legislative veto process after Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s office appeared to accidentally line-item veto housing funding in May.
Armstrong in his veto message indicated he was vetoing $150,000 the 2025 Legislature set aside for a Native American homelessness liaison, but a staff member also crossed out $25 million for affordable housing and $10 million for homelessness in the bill markup.
The legislative and executive branches disagreed over how to interpret the line-item veto, leading to a larger dispute over the scope of the governor’s veto power.
The interim Legislative Procedure and Arrangements Committee on Wednesday advanced a bill draft lawmakers say will prevent similar conflicts from arising in the future.
The draft legislation would make it so that when a governor’s line-item veto message and bill markup conflict, the markup would be considered the authority on what the veto actually does. This is in contrast to a recent opinion by Attorney General Drew Wrigley that found that the bill markups are visual aids and do not change the substance of a veto.
The proposed bill would also provide more specific instructions on what should be included in each veto and which officials the governor’s office would send copies of the veto to.
“We don’t see this as infringing on the governor’s veto power in any way,” Emily Thompson, legal division director for Legislative Council, said of the draft during the meeting. 
The Legislative Procedure and Arrangements Committee voted to forward the proposal to Legislative Management.
The committee on Wednesday also discussed a bill draft to create a more formal mechanism for calling special sessions to override vetoes by the governor after the legislative session adjourns.
Legislative Council proposed a system where lawmakers are polled 21 days after the session on whether they want to reconvene for a veto override session.
The idea received a mixed response from committee members, in part because lawmakers only get 80 legislative days each biennium. 
North Dakota lawmakers not inclined to sue over veto

“Let’s say we’ve set aside three days — that’s all we have left — and we’re coming back to override a bill that really isn’t a substantial bill,” Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, said. “We don’t want to burn our days just to override that.”
Sen. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, suggested earmarking a day well in advance for lawmakers to handle potential post-session vetoes. 
“For people like me who have to return to a day job and your boss would like to know what day you’re going to be gone, there is some benefit for having that future date pre-scheduled,” she said. “We can always cancel it.”
The committee asked Legislative Council to prepare an amended bill draft to reflect Roers’ suggestion for consideration at its next meeting.
Some lawmakers on Wednesday said the two bill drafts are also a way to address what they view as a separation of powers issue raised by the attorney general’s opinion on Armstrong’s line-item veto. 
The opinion, issued in June, found that the accidental markup didn’t create any problems because Armstrong was clear in his memo about what he intended to veto.
Legislators voiced concerns that the opinion could give the Governor’s Office and Attorney General’s Office broad discretion to decide the meaning of unclear vetoes.
“We want to make sure that there’s a balance, that the legislative branch is not losing any authority,” House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, said during Wednesday’s meeting.
The Attorney General’s Office on Wednesday said it was not aware of the proposed legislation and did not have a position on it. The Governor’s Office also declined to comment on the legislation.
Legislative Council’s attorneys said previously in their own analysis that Wrigley’s opinion conflicts with legal precedent, including previous rulings by the North Dakota Supreme Court. 
They wrote that the Legislature could hold a special session and override the veto, though lawmakers have signaled they don’t intend to go that route. Wrigley previously called Legislative Council’s analysis a “political document” and said the agency doesn’t get to decide the scope of the governor’s authority. 
The Office of Management and Budget has already allocated the money at issue in the veto. The agency in an email last month confirmed it dispersed the $34.85 million to the Housing Finance Agency on July 1.

Phil Murphy speaks before signing legislation establishing the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program at MAC Products Inc. in Kearny on Aug. 13, 2025. (Jake Hirsch/Governor’s Office)Gov. Phil Murphy signed bipartisan legislation Thursday creating a $500 million tax credit program for manufacturing businesses in a bid to expand in-state manufacturing and spur job creation, with a focus on clean energy industries.
Murphy signed the bill at Mac Products, a family-owned manufacturing business in Kearny that makes electrical distribution and transmission products. The governor, a Democrat, said the tax credit program, to be administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, is designed to position the state as a manufacturing leader.
“With the most skilled workforce in the world, we have a unique opportunity to not only make our businesses more competitive today, but to prepare them to lead their respective industries for decades to come,” Murphy said.
The new initiative will award tax credits to eligible businesses in industries such as advanced manufacturing, nonretail food and beverage, defense, clean energy, and life sciences.
State Sen. Mike Testa (R-Cumberland), one of the bill’s chief sponsors, called the measure an example of government working on a “nonpartisan basis.” Testa referred to a sign he has in his office that replicates the famous “Trenton makes — the world takes” slogan seen on the Lower Trenton Bridge.
“This bill will go a long way to making sure that means something once again and remains meaning something 50, 60, 75 years to come,” he said.
For the first two years, $100 million in tax credits will be reserved for clean energy product manufacturers in solar, geothermal, and green hydrogen. Unused funds from that allocation will later be shifted to general manufacturing projects.
Tim Sullivan, CEO of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, said the program is designed to reward companies that meet their commitments to invest in New Jersey.
“If you promise you’re going to do something, and you do it, you get the tax credits. If you don’t, you don’t get the tax credits,” Sullivan said.
Funding for the tax credits will come from reallocating money from the state’s existing Aspire and Emerge tax incentive programs, not from new spending, Murphy noted. Those two programs are expected to issue $6.6 billion in tax credits over their lives.
Business groups support the move.
“This law represents a significant and targeted investment for New Jersey’s manufacturing sector and our economy, with no new additional funding required,” New Jersey Business & Industry Association President and CEO Michele Siekerka said in a statement. “It will support much-needed workforce development in manufacturing amid both federal tariff and supply chain uncertainty that challenges these important businesses.”

North Dakota legislators are discussing ways to enhance lawmaker security. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota legislators are working to bolster security measures in response to shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers.
Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, recommended during a committee discussion Wednesday that legislators adopt an official process to report threats.
“I’ve been threatened many times, and it rolls off me, but for some people, the first time they get threatened, it’s very frightening,” Hogan said. She said some lawmakers have “thick skin” and don’t report those incidents, but she suggested that should change after the killings in Minnesota.
“Then, if we get a pattern, we’re sensitive about it,” Hogan said during the Legislative Procedure and Arrangements Committee. “We’ve had to think differently than we’re ever had to think, and that’s the sad part.”
The discussion Wednesday came in response to the June 14 assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were killed in their Brooklyn Park home. Another state lawmaker, Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were shot multiple times but survived. Vance Boelter was apprehended after a 42-hour manhunt and faces six felony charges.
In the aftermath of those attacks, a North Dakota man was charged with sending threatening messages to at least one U.S. official and other state officials. The threats by Charles Dalzell of St. Thomas referenced the Minnesota shootings, court records say. A jury trial is set for this fall.

Legislative Council has accumulated a mailbox full of letters and numerous voicemails from the man, Director John Bjornson said.
“It is something that is fairly common that we deal with on a regular basis,” Bjornson said.
Speaker of the House Rep. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, said he received a threat from Dalzell.
“I don’t know how he got my cellphone number,” Weisz said. “He was ranting and raving about the governor and how I need to force the governor to follow the law.”
Weisz said he explained to the man that he does not control the governor or the state courts, which prompted the man to hang up.
Weisz said he didn’t report the matter to law enforcement, but said he should have followed up with the governor.
Separately, Weisz said he’s received emails threatening his children.
“I’ve even had an email where a lady said, ‘I just want you to know, I know where you live,’ and so I emailed her back and said, ‘Great, when can I expect you.’ Never heard from her again,” he said.
Weisz said he will not be intimidated or bullied for representing his district in the Legislature.
Any reports of threats against lawmakers received by Legislative Council are reported to the North Dakota Highway Patrol, Bjornson said.
Emily Thompson, director of the legal division for Legislative Council, said a more in-depth discussion on lawmaker security will continue at the next committee meeting. Immediately following the Minnesota attacks, Legislative Council removed home addresses of North Dakota lawmakers from the Legislature’s website. Other measures being discussed include providing post office boxes for lawmaker mail and offering safety training.
“Here in North Dakota, we’ve just taken our security somewhat for granted,” said Sen. Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden, committee chair.

Building off a nearly $80,000 grant from 2024, Grand View University in Des Moines announced in a news release it received $30,000 this year to once again expand its educational equipment for nursing students.
While the 2024 grant helped the university purchase a “patient manikin” for its nursing simulation suite, according to the release, this year’s funding will go toward the purchase of a “simulated medication distribution cart” to show students how to use the equipment they’ll most likely see in hospitals once they start their career. The release stated funds will also be used to support an annual event for student athletes and their supporters held by Grand View.

Simpson College in Indianola also received a nearly $10,000 grant from Prairie Meadows for buying additional human anatomical models, according to a news release, which will be utilized by students studying to enter a health science field.
Grand View University President Rachelle Keck said in the news release grant funding from Prairie Meadows is helping the university instill in students “the skills needed to provide exceptional patient care.”
“As Iowa experiences a shortage of nurses, Grand View is proud to partner with Prairie Meadows to ensure our nursing graduates are well-prepared to meet patient and community needs,” Keck said in the release.
According to a list of grant recipients for the Prairie Meadows Legacy Grant program, Mercy College of Health Sciences also received a $650,000 grant for its school of nursing. Drake University received a legacy grant worth $600,000 for stadium renovations and another grant through the company’s Community Betterment Grant program.
Other institutions that received community betterment grants include the Des Moines Area Community College Foundation and Des Moines University.
According to a news release from Prairie Meadows, the nonprofit organization dispensed more than $13 million through just over 400 grants, of which hundreds of thousands of dollars were allocated to colleges for capital projects and academic programs.
“It’s an honor to invest in our community through these grant dollars,” said Gary Palmer, president and CEO of Prairie Meadows, in the news release. “We’re committed to empowering local nonprofits that drive meaningful change and strengthen our communities. Giving back is part of who we are, and this funding reflects our support of organizations that uplift Iowans by bringing hope, opportunity, and lasting impact.”

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Judith Deedy said there’s been a disconnect for a decade in Kansas’ student assessment scores.
Her oldest child once earned fives — the highest level at the time — until 2015, when she began scoring at level three after the assessment scores changed.
“The Kansas assessment has persistently been an outlier for all of the three children in my own family and for thousands of students across the state, as data has shown,” Deedy, a public education advocate, said at a Tuesday meeting of the Kansas State Board of Education.
State assessment scores have shown a steady increase in the number of Kansas students scoring lower on math, science and English language arts tests since 2016, while achieving marks of post-secondary success, such as higher education degrees and military careers.
The state education board voted 7-3 on Tuesday to change assessment cut scores in the 2025-2026 school year, broadening the scoring range and shrinking the tests. Board members Michelle Dombrosky, Connie O’Brien and Debby Potter voted against resetting the scores.
In partnership with the University of Kansas and with input from nearly 150 educators, the Kansas State Department of Education crafted new metrics for the assessment tests students periodically take in English language arts, math and science throughout their school careers.
Cut scores divide performance levels, reflecting student achievement.
Following the board’s vote, cut scores are undergoing an expansion. Previously, the scoring scale ranged from 220-380, with cutoffs varying by grade, level and subject.
Now, the lowest obtainable score is 400 across all grades and subjects, and the highest is 700. Level two cuts off at 510, and the level three cutoff is 540 for all grades and subjects. The level four cutoff varies by grade and subject.
In May, the board approved new performance definitions for each level. Previously, scores fell into the following levels: limited, basic, effective and excellent. Now, “limited” and “basic” remain for levels one and two, but “effective” was changed to “proficient” and “excellent” to “advanced.”
Beth Fultz, director of career standards and assessment services for the education department, addressed the board before its vote. She said it “was an opportunity to impact Kansas education for several years to come.”
Beryl New, a board member from Topeka, said she has heard from constituents who are concerned the state education department is lowering standards.
Fultz responded that the change is more of a realignment of expectations for student performance.
“I do believe we are not reducing the rigor on this assessment,” Fultz said.
The state education commissioner, Randy Watson, said the department brought to the table “a scientifically based process that’s nationally recognized,” and came from the voices of teachers. He assured the board that the new scores still set the highest expectations for Kansas kids.
Deedy, who spoke during the board’s public forum section at the beginning of the meeting, said the old cut scores overshot a desire to be aspirational.
“Adjusting cut scores is not lowering our standards,” Deedy said, ”but rather improving the predictability and reliability of this point-in-time assessment to more accurately reflect student achievement levels.”
Danny Zeck, a board member from Leavenworth, said he struggles with assessments. He said he was once what he called “a level one kid.”
Zeck, following a long pause, said: “The problem I have with level one, two, three and four is that level one person wakes up sometime and they’re gonna be successful.”
Everybody reacts differently, he said.
He also encouraged parents, if they do not agree with the new cut scores, to exempt their students from participating in assessments.
“C’mon, people,” he said. “If you really dislike it, opt them out. It’s not a rocket science deal.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7080376-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-13 17:57:41.003973
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-13 21:18:26+00:00,CT Mirror,CT electric rates to drop in September as a result of state borrowing,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/13/ct-electric-rate-relief-borrowing/,The $155M in state borrowing will result in lower utility rates for Eversource and UI customers on their monthly bills starting in September.,"Connecticut electric rates will dip slightly in September, after utility regulators voted on Wednesday to formalize a relief package centered around $155 million in state borrowing to offset the cost of sky-high electric bills.
The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority voted unanimously to approve new rates for customers of the state’s two investor-owned utilities — Eversource and United Illuminating — that take into account the impact of that borrowing. The new, lower rates will take effect on Sept. 1.
The change will result in an average savings of around $9 a month for Eversource customers and $15 a month for UI customers, according to PURA. The exact amount of savings will vary depending on usage and whether the customer receives residential or commercial rates.
“We’re pleased customers will see a decrease thanks to several factors, including shifting certain state-mandated policy and program costs off electric bills,” Eversource spokeswoman Jamie Ratliff said in a statement following Wednesday’s decision. 
Sarah Wall Fliotsos, a spokeswoman for United Illuminating, said in a statement that the new rates will “have a meaningful impact,” and she expressed appreciation for the state’s decision to borrow money to fund the rate cuts. 
“We look forward to implementing these electric bill reductions for our customers while remaining mindful that several new public policy programs that would be added to the Public Benefits Charge in the future remain under consideration,” she said.
The rate change didn’t prompt any public discussion among the three members of PURA — Chairwoman Marissa Gillett, Vice Chairman David Arconti and Commissioner Michael Caron — before they voted to approve it in a virtual meeting Wednesday.
Gov. Ned Lamont introduced the borrowing plan to the State Bond Commission earlier this month, where it received unanimous approval. The plan itself was crafted by lawmakers earlier this year as part of Senate Bill 4, an omnibus legislative package addressing energy prices.
The bonding component of that bill included $125 million this year to pay off unpaid bills that accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with $30 million to cover the costs associated with the state’s electric vehicle charging program. Both costs are currently paid for by consumers as part of the public benefits charge on their bill.
An additional round of borrowing is expected to go before the Bond Commission next year, with the associated savings lasting through 2027. 
Claire Coleman, head of the state’s Office of Consumer Counsel, said in a statement Wednesday, “As one of the biggest advocates for state assistance to offset high electricity costs this session, I am pleased that customers will see the results of the bond funding authorization beginning in September.” 
Ratliff, the Eversource spokeswoman, said that “even more significant savings” can be achieved through other aspects of S.B. 4 that have yet to be fully implemented. Those include allowing utilities to securitize costs related to storm damage and the roll out of advanced metering technology.
“The collaboration on Senate Bill 4 was an important step forward to make progress on these issues for customers, and we look forward to continued work with lawmakers to deliver cost-effective solutions to benefit the people and businesses of Connecticut,” she said in her statement. 
Wednesday’s decision marked the third time this year PURA has voted to lower electric rates. The first reduction came in April, as part of regulators’ annual rate adjustment proceedings. Two months later, PURA approved a reduction in supply rates for customers of both utilities.
Those decreases followed last year’s spike in the public benefits charge that happened to coincide with a summer heat wave that sent many bills — and public frustration — soaring to new highs. 
Even with decreases taking effect this year, advocates and the utilities warn that some customers may have yet to see a decrease in their overall bill due to growing usage to power air conditioners during the hot summer months.
Connecticut’s electricity costs remain among the highest in the nation. In August, the state ranked third with an average of 26.16 cents per kilowatt hour, according to an analysis by ElectricChoice.com.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PUBLIC-BENEFITS-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 17:57:41.003973

A tense exchange between health care leaders on Monday punctuated the annual, multiday marathon hospital budget hearings before the Green Mountain Care Board. 
The discourse focused on a letter from an independent health care liaison that described a “simmering and ongoing adversarial relationship” between the state’s largest hospital network and its largest health insurer. 
The letter conveys Blue Cross Blue Shield Vermont’s claim that University of Vermont Health Network leaders allegedly threatened to drop patients on the carrier’s insurance plans to pressure the insurer to accept higher network charges in previous years. Network representatives disputed this characterization at the hearing.
Regulators also asked health network executives about revenue overages and profit margins at the University of Vermont Medical Center, the state’s only academic medical center and the only one certified for the highest level of trauma care.
Health care regulators hold extensive hearings annually on the budgets proposed by Vermont’s hospitals for the next fiscal year, but one day of meetings typically impacts Vermonters’ health care costs more than the rest. This year, that was Monday, when all day was spent reviewing the proposals by the University of Vermont Health Network’s three hospitals in the state.
That’s because a big share of what is spent on Vermonters’ health care goes to the state’s hospitals, almost half the money spent in 2022, according to one dataset analyzed by board staff. And the three network hospitals — University of Vermont Medical Center in the Burlington area, Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin and Porter Medical Center in Middlebury — together earn almost two thirds of the money spent on behalf of patients at the 14 hospitals under board review. 

This year, for the first time in recent memory, two network hospitals submitted proposed reductions to commercial insurance rates in the coming fiscal year for the board’s approval.
Also, for the first time, the board dug deeply into the budget and finances of the overall University of Vermont Health Network.
The Green Mountain Care Board set benchmarks for Vermont hospitals this coming fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, to not exceed a 3.5% increase for net patient revenue, which the regulatory board defines as earnings from patient services after certain deductions such as uncompensated care. Other benchmarks set by the regulator are a 3% increase both for hospital operating expenses and for charges to commercial health insurance companies. 
University of Vermont Medical Center is seeking a 2.2% increase to its net patient revenue. The center also expects to increase operating expenses by 3% and decrease what it charges commercial insurers by 7.9%.
Central Vermont Medical Center requested a 3.5% increase to net patient revenue, a 2.8% increase for operating expenses and a 3.6% decrease to commercial rates. 

The reduction in commercial insurance charges put forth by the two medical centers comes after the Green Mountain Care Board entered a settlement in April with their parent health network related to those two hospitals exceeding the patient revenue caps set by the board through this process in the 2024 and 2023 fiscal years. 
A new law capping pharmaceutical drugs costs accounts for the majority of the two hospitals’ commercial rate reductions, alongside compliance with the enforcement settlement.
Health network officials projected last week that the University of Vermont Medical Center will exceed budget caps for the current fiscal year as well, also part of the hospital’s proposed 2026 rate reduction.
Porter Medical Center, a federally-designated critical access hospital — one of eight in the state — asked for a 3.5% increase to net patient revenue, a 2.4% increase to operating expenses and 3% increase to commercial rates. The designation, intended for hospitals that provide care in rural, underserved areas, requires higher reimbursements tied to costs from Medicare. 
Late last month, just prior to the start of hospital budget review hearings, the University of Vermont Health Network announced cost saving measures, including layoffs and workforce reductions, particularly in network-wide administrative services, in order to meet the 2026 fiscal year hospital budget proposals.

‘Lingering animosity’
Board chair Owen Foster, a former federal prosecutor, asked University of Vermont Health Network executives to respond to the letter the board had received last week from Mike Smith, who the board had appointed as an independent liaison to a new working group required by the legal settlement.
The letter dated Thursday gave an update on private negotiations between leaders at the network and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, which were convened with the goal of finding “common ground on cost reductions to lower commercial health insurance rates for 2026, and hopefully beyond.” The update, which included the liaison team’s own recommendations for the Green Mountain Care Board, was also sent to the Department of Financial Regulation, the state’s main insurance regulator.
The discussion between the UVM Health Network and Blue Cross Blue Shield had broken down due to what Smith described in the letter as “lingering animosity” between the health network and insurance carrier.
Despite the insurer being on the brink of insolvency, Blue Cross Blue Shield Vermont officials said they have not negotiated assertively over rates in past years because the Health Network had threatened to cease serving Blue Cross patients if the insurer did not cede to their demands, according to Smith’s letter.
At the board meeting Monday, Kelly Champney, a health network vice president, denied that the University of Vermont Medical Center threatened to not serve Blue Cross patients in negotiations in recent years. 
“I know we have gotten to very tough conversations before,” Champney said. “To my knowledge, there’s not been a termination conversation.”
Smith’s liaison team offered their own recommendations to further lower commercial health insurance rates for the next fiscal year. They included capping reimbursement of health services at 500% of the Medicare payment rate to prevent “excessive cost,” a version of so-called reference-based pricing incorporated into a law signed earlier this summer.
Smith also said the leaders of the Health Network and Blue Cross Blue Shield Vermont should meet regularly to develop a “healthy working relationship.”

Over revenue cap again this year
Amid hearings about the next fiscal year, the UVM Medical Center and Central Vermont Medical Center leaders met with the board last Wednesday to discuss how to address projected overages to hospital patient revenue in the hospitals’ current fiscal year, which ends September 30. 
A hospital’s net patient revenue is the result of both the price of the service provided and the number of patients who receive it, a measure often referred to as ‘utilization.’ Health network hospitals attribute their recent revenue overages largely to more patients seeking more services than anticipated. 
Hospital leaders told regulators that the University of Vermont Medical Center is looking to reduce commercial insurer revenue by $20 million and Central Vermont Medical Center is looking to reduce revenue by $6 million through targeted rate reductions. A large portion of those reductions would be realized in the coming fiscal year, not the current one, because of the late date.
Rick Vincent, executive vice president of finance and chief financial officer for the health network, said the network would have looked to adjust its rates in early May, but had to assess a price cap on outpatient-administered injection drugs then being considered by the Vermont Legislature and later signed into law. 
“The delay was really due to trying to understand exactly what was happening with the drug legislation and how that might impact our budgets going forward,” Vincent said. 
Mark Hengstler, staff attorney for the Green Mountain Care Board, said the board only sets commercial health insurance rate upper limits, not rates themselves, so it is within hospital prerogative to lower rates to meet their set patient revenue cap at any time. 
After questioning from new board member Sara Teachout — formerly an executive and spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont — Vincent said that even with the reductions proposed, the University of Vermont Medical Center is projected to end the year over the revenue cap by around $2 million, and may again be subject to regulatory enforcement action. 
At the hearing Monday, Green Mountain Care Board member Thom Walsh asked how the board should view the University of Vermont Medical Center’s budget projections for the coming 2026 fiscal year given the hospital’s underestimation of service utilization that in the recent past has led to revenue overages, regulatory enforcements and mid-year commercial health insurance rate adjustments. 
Judy Peek-Lee, chief financial officer for the University of Vermont Medical Center, said their methods for making projections have not changed, but staff have developed better communication between departments to more quickly recognize any upticks in how patients are using services.
Peek-Lee said that the academic medical center’s focus on special services and advancements in the medical field make it more difficult to project out costs for the coming fiscal year compared to community hospitals, but that staff will continue to assess budget projections throughout the coming year. 
While past overages in net patient revenue are high in dollar amounts, as a percentage of the medical center’s overall budget, the number is relatively small, she said.

Network ‘centralization and consolidation’
During a new afternoon session on Monday, the board delved into the expenses of the parent organization, University of Vermont Health Network, itself. 
Green Mountain Care Board member Jessica Holmes expressed concern with the increased “centralization and consolidation” of shared services to improve quality care measures and population health outcomes among network hospitals — three in Vermont and three in New York — represented in the increased size of the network’s budget. 
Holmes noted that while the network spent more on these services in recent years, federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services quality ratings for their hospitals diminished between fiscal years 2022 and 2026.
The University of Vermont Medical and Porter Medical Center is currently at a three star federal rating and Central Vermont Medical Center is at two stars, with similar ratings at the New York hospitals, Holmes said. That means that “half of your hospitals are in the bottom third of all hospitals in the country, and none are in the top third,” she said.
Stephen Leffler, president and chief operating officer of University of Vermont Medical Center, said that the hospital’s leadership and staff lost focus on maintaining high quality care ratings during the pandemic, but recent data shows that the academic medical center is making progress to improve ratings. 
“We’ve started that climb,” Leffler said. “We have to sustain that and make it better. I am confident that the network has heard what we’re asking for and that we will do better, but we’re not where we need to be.”
Board chair Foster asked network executives about how funds flow from hospitals to the network, particularly from University of Vermont Medical Center and the New York hospitals.
Sunny Eappen, president and CEO of the University of Vermont Health Network, conceded upon questioning that the New York hospitals’ contributions to network operations are currently not sufficient. He said the network will be looking for higher commercial rates for the New York hospitals.
“The commercial negotiations in New York have looked very, very different than they have in Vermont the last few years. The increases that we’re seeking are much larger. They’re going to be much larger again this year,” Eappen said. “We do the same thing in terms of advocating at the state for additional funding, so the same things that we’re doing in Vermont, we’re doing in New York.”
Maintaining affiliations with the New York hospitals is still a net positive for Vermont, Eappen said, because it increases capacity and access to special services. It also keeps patients from eastern New York seeking care from overwhelming Vermont hospitals, because “patients don’t follow borders.”
Foster probed further, asking why the Board should grant the network hospitals’ budget requests given “competing interests,” such as the state’s cash-strapped, largest health insurer and Vermonters facing a health care affordability crisis. This suggests that the board might consider lowering the patient revenue caps or further lowering the commercial rate reduction proposed by the larger hospitals. 
Eappen responded that the health network would have to continue deferring maintenance on capital projects, and would not be able to maintain the same level of care and services to the region if hospitals’ rate requests were not met. 
Reflecting on what he had heard on Monday, board Member David Murman, who is an emergency room doctor at Central Vermont Medical Center, noted that the University of Vermont Medical Center’s profits swamp that of all other hospitals in the state, and alone represent about half of all hospital revenue this year. 
Green Mountain Care Board staff calculated the profit margin expected by the 14 Vermont hospitals in fiscal year 2025 based on their end-of-year projections, some of which are negative, meaning they’ve experienced operating losses. The analysis highlighted that because of its size, the University of Vermont Medical Center’s 3% positive margin, around $72 million, accounted for almost 95% of all the profit likely across the entire system, estimated at $76.1 million.
Murman, who is not participating in decisions related to his direct employer, also said that the University of Vermont Health Network as a whole is a large player in the state’s healthcare landscape and many Vermonters rely on network hospitals for their care and livelihoods. 
But operations at the University of Vermont Medical Center in particular have an outsized impact on commercial insurance rates, Murman said. That’s because the academic medical center sees a larger proportion of commercially insured patients than other hospitals in the state, 26% compared to less than 20% on average, according to board staff. The other patients at all hospitals are largely covered by the federal and state insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid, which generally pay much lower rates for services than commercial health insurance. 
“While you enjoy massive market power, very high commercial prices, and a remarkably strong payer mix compared to the region that you live in, you also hold the responsibility to not take too much advantage of that,” Murman said.

The side-by-side museums in Jackson – the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and the Museum of Mississippi History –  continued a tradition of conducting tours on Till’s birthday, July 25. Visitors sat in the center of the civil rights museum, where a guide recounted Till’s story and its impact on the Civil Rights Movement. People could also enter a small gallery to watch a documentary about his life.
DeSean Dyson, a Jackson native, said he considers Till’s life essential to his own work. His job takes him around the U.S. to promote peace and justice initiatives.
“It’s very important to me, as I have a 10-year-old, a 12-year-old and a 16-year-old, that they stay rooted and connected to this history,” said Dyson, a former educator who took his sons to tour the museums. 
He said teachings about Till should emphasize his humanity.
“Like, it’s really important how we frame Emmett’s death as being inspiring to a generation, but Emmett’s life mattered a lot,” Dyson said.

“I hope visitors learn about not just the fact that he was murdered, which is important, but also the fact that his life really did stimulate, encourage, inspire a lot of youth his age to become a part of the modern Civil Rights Movement,” Morris said.
Longtime civil rights activist Hezekiah Watkins of Jackson volunteers at the civil rights museum in various roles, often speaking about his life story. In 1961, he was just 13 when he was arrested at Jackson’s Greyhound bus station. Authorities thought he was part of the Freedom Riders, a racially integrated group of young people who rode interstate buses through the South to challenge segregation. Watkins and the Freedom Riders were sent to the Mississippi State Penitentiary and housed on death row.

Watkins recounted that when he told his mother he was joining the Civil Rights Movement, she used Till’s death as a warning: “She said, ‘You remember me telling you about Emmett Till?’ She said, ‘The same thing that happened to Emmett will happen to you.’
“I guess I really didn’t care,” Watkins said, “because I didn’t know that we was living in bondage … I didn’t know we was living as slaves, per se.”
In August 1955, 14-year-old Till traveled from Chicago to the Mississippi Delta to visit his cousins. Till and other young Black people went to buy snacks one day at Bryant’s Grocery & Meat Market in the tiny community of Money. Till’s cousin Simeon Wright later said he heard Till whistle at the white storekeeper, Carolyn Bryant, as they left.

Days later, a group that included Carolyn’s husband Roy Bryant and his half-brother J.W. Milam kidnapped Till from the home of Moses Wright, Till’s great-uncle. They beat Till, shot him and dumped him in the Tallahatchie River, using barbed wire to attach a 75-pound cotton gin fan to him. His body was discovered three days later, decomposed beyond recognition except for his father’s ring on one of his fingers.
Mississippi authorities wanted a quick burial, but Till’s mother Mamie Till-Mobley requested his body be returned to Chicago. After seeing the horrific condition of her son’s corpse, she insisted on an open-casket funeral so the world could see what had happened. 
Jet magazine published a photo of mutilated Till’s body at his funeral, launching the killing into an international news story. Weeks later, an all-white jury in Mississippi acquitted Milam and Bryant of murdering Till. Outrage over the injustice of the case helped launch the Civil Rights Movement, inspiring many Black people to openly oppose Jim Crow.

Today, the courthouse where Till’s killers were acquitted is restored and is a National Park Service site. The restoration was done by the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, formed in 2006 by Jerome G. Little, the Tallahatchie County Board of Supervisors’ first Black president.
The commission was dedicated to remembering Till and healing racial division. It went on to become a nonprofit organization and establish the Emmett Till Interpretive Center in Sumner. 
The center is hosting a Till commemoration Aug. 28-30 at Mississippi Valley State University’s Walter Roberts Auditorium.
Benjamin Saulsberry is the museum’s public engagement and education director. He said the impact of Till’s death is still felt today by people who remember the terrible events of that hot Mississippi summer.

“We’re talking about people who are still alive with us, people who were lawmakers or about to become lawmakers themselves … and in turn, their ideologies and their spaces have helped – or in some ways maybe not helped — shape the world that we live in today,” he said.
The three-day commemoration will focus on Till, his mother and the impact of Till’s lynching in the Delta. The programming includes a theatrical performance, an award-winning biographical exhibit and panels with people discussing their accounts of watching Till’s story. Registration for the commemoration is on the center’s website.
Saulsberry hopes visitors come away from the commemoration knowing more about Till and the Delta, that they feel inspired to continue learning and that they know they can create change in their own lives.

He acknowledged Till’s death was a tragedy, but said people should remember the action it inspired. 
“And I want to be clear that it marks the 70th year after his murder, but also marks the 70th year of Mrs. Mamie Till making the decision she made that would help basically, bring us to another part of the Civil Rights Movement,” Saulsberry said. “It’s the 70th year anniversary point of recognition where Mr. Moses Wright stands up in that courtroom and points directly at Milam and Bryant, knowing he was putting his own life at risk.”

(Photo by Grace Deng/Washington State Standard)A federal appeals court on Wednesday refused to give the operator of the immigrant detention center in Tacoma another chance to make its case for paying detainees as little as $1 per day.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the request from The GEO Group, the for-profit company that runs the facility, to reconsider its decision from earlier this year, siding with lower courts that found GEO violated state minimum wage law.
The decision affirms that the Florida-based GEO Group will need to pay more than $23 million that a jury and federal judge previously awarded. The next step in the company’s fight could be the U.S. Supreme Court. The case, brought by detainees and the state of Washington, has been ongoing since 2017.
GEO Group has run the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma since 2005. Its current contract with the federal government, signed in 2015, awarded the company at least $700 million to operate the facility over the following decade. The facility holds people detained by federal immigration enforcement on civil violations as they await potential deportation or release back into the United States.
The company used to run a voluntary work program for detainees. For years, hundreds at the Tacoma detention center were paid $1 per day, the minimum federal pay required in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. When necessary to attract workers, pay would go up to $5. 
The program allowed GEO to avoid hiring 85 full-time employees, according to court filings. The detainees would cook and serve food, wash dishes, do laundry and clean the facility.
GEO’s federal contract requires it to comply with “all applicable federal, state, and local laws and standards,” including “labor laws and codes.” This includes state minimum wage laws, courts have ruled.
The company had argued federal contractors couldn’t be forced to pay Washington’s minimum wage under the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which holds that federal law takes precedence over state law. 
GEO contended Washington can’t regulate the detention center differently than similar state facilities, since the state’s minimum wage law exempts prisons and jails.
A U.S. District Court jury in 2021 found GEO Group violated Washington’s minimum wage statute, and awarded nearly $17.3 million in back wages. A federal judge ordered the company to pay the state an additional $5.9 million in penalties. The work program has been suspended since then.
Between 2010 and 2018, GEO made around $20 million per year running the 1,575-bed detention center.
Washington’s state Supreme Court also sided with the detainees and the state, finding in 2023 that the detained workers should be considered employees. 
On this go-around, GEO asked the original three-judge 9th Circuit panel either to rehear the case or send it to the full appeals court in what is known as a rehearing en banc. The Trump administration’s Department of Justice also urged the court to reconsider. The court denied the requests Wednesday.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Dissenting from the decision, Judge Patrick Bumatay, an appointee of President Donald Trump, wrote that “the effect of this decision will be widespread.”
“Our court provides a ‘roadmap’ for States seeking to undermine federal policies with which they disagree,” Bumatay wrote. “Our court’s message is clear: So long as States focus their regulation on federal government contractors — rather than on the federal government itself — the States may frustrate the performance of any federal government activities they wish.”
Chief Judge Mary Murguia, who President Barack Obama appointed, disagreed. She wrote that Bumatay equating the federal government and its contractors is “contrary to long-settled black letter law.”
“Adoption of his position would allow any government contractor to refuse to pay state-mandated minimum wage to its employees,” she continued. “For example, any defense contractor could refuse to pay minimum wage. No one in this case, not even GEO, has suggested that this is the law.”
The facility, the only private, for-profit detention center in Washington, has a history of allegations of human rights violations. It has come under renewed scrutiny as more detainees have been sent there with Trump’s return to office. 
The Legislature has long had the detention center in its sights. Lawmakers tried to get it shut down in 2021 through a state law that was later deemed unenforceable. 
Washington has also been ensconced in years of legal back-and-forth with GEO over state laws calling for greater oversight of the facility. Another court case tackling that issue is currently awaiting a ruling from the 9th Circuit.

House seat, was sentenced to 80 years in prison Wednesday. (Photo from his official campaign Twitter feed in mid-November)A failed Republican political candidate whose conspiracy theory about a stolen state House election prompted him to orchestrate shootings at homes of elected New Mexico Democrats will spend 80 years in prison, a federal judge ordered Wednesday.
Solomon Peña – who handily lost the race for an Albuquerque-based house district in 2022 – falsely believed he was the victim of a election fraud and hatched a “sophisticated scheme” to harass and intimidate elected officials, U.S. District Court Judge Kea Riggs said in court during the sentencing hearing.
Election results showed Peña, who ran as a Republican, lost to incumbent Democrat Miguel Garcia, who won 74% of the vote.
The sentence comes amid a spike in political violence in recent years, including the June assassination of a Minnesota Democratic state representative and her husband. As he campaigned, Peña was a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump, who falsely claimed he won the 2020 presidential election over Joe Biden. Trump has pardoned his supporters convicted in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol and repeatedly threatened his political enemies, and he was the victim of two assassination attempts himself in 2024.
Failed GOP candidate accused of plotting to have co-defendants killed

A jury in March found Peña guilty of enlisting a man and his adult son to repeatedly shoot up homes of four elected Democratic officials in December 2022 and January 2023 after he refused to accept defeat. He was also convicted of recruiting fellow inmates he was in jail with while awaiting trial to kill his codefendants.
The shooting rampage  culminated in the early morning hours of Jan. 3, 2023, when, according to prosecutors, Peña and the 21-year-old man he enlisted fired a fully automatic gun at the home where state Sen. Linda Lopez and her children lived. Codefendant Jose Trujillo fired 12 rounds at her home, prosecutors said. Peña himself attempted to fire the weapon but it jammed, according to Riggs and prosecutors.
Lopez testified Wednesday before the sentencing that she and her kids are still traumatized. They’ve all sought counseling for anxiety and depression. Fireworks and other loud noises make them fearful, she said, and they are afraid whenever anyone walks past their house.
“The shooting of our home shattered what I was trying to form for my children,” she said.
Despite the shooting, she ran for reelection in November and won. The choice to stay in office represented her commitment to democracy, she said, and being undeterred by political violence.
“Our democracy must be open. Our democracy must not bend to intimidation or fear,” she said. “We will persevere.”
A jury ruled that Peña also orchestrated the shootings at the homes of other elected Democrats, including Bernalillo County Commissioners Adriann Barboa and Debbie O’Malley, who is now a state senator, as well as House Speaker Javier Martinez.
Failed GOP candidate for NM House charged in connection to shootings at Dem politicians’ homes

Martinez and his wife, Dianna, also attended Wednesday’s sentencing. Dianna Martinez recounted finding spent bullets in her shower and garage, and said she keeps replaying the shooting over and over, thinking about how if bullet trajectories had been “slightly different,” she and her children could have been injured or killed.
She called on the judge to hold Peña accountable for his actions, calling him a “narcissist” who has “no regard for human life.” Speaker Martinez draped his arm over his wife’s shoulders as she spoke through tears.
“This was not politics,” she said. “It was terror. “
Peña did not speak in his own defense. Through his attorneys, he said he maintained his innocence and would appeal the conviction. He appeared stoic throughout the one-hour hearing and did not react to the sentencing that, if served completely, will keep the 42-year-old man in prison through the end of his life.
Prosecutors called on the judge to sentence him to 90 years in prison, saying in court documents that his actions represented an attack on the “American political system.” Peña hoped to force “political change by terrorizing people into being too afraid to engage in political life if they held views contrary to his own,” prosecutors said.
His attorneys asked for the mandatory minimum of 60 years, noting that mandatory minimums tied the judges hands but that other federal defendants are sentenced to less time for what they said are worse crimes, like murder and sexual abuse.
Second co-conspirator in Solomon Peña case pleads guilty

Riggs did not fully explain why she arrived at a sentence of 80 years, but she said it was, at least in part, an effort to deter others from considering similar actions and to restore public servants’ trust that they can safely run for office.
Peña’s crimes were “all because you could not believe that you lost an election,” she told him. Saying it was “beyond a miracle” that no one was physically harmed, she recounted the path of violence that she believes would have continued to escalate if police hadn’t arrested his codefendant less than 24 hours after the shooting at Lopez’s home.
“All for what?” she told him. “For your ego.”
In addition to the 80-year sentence, Peña will face a $250,000 fine. The judge, whom Trump appointed in 2019, noted that Peña’s career as a “storm-chaser” meant he was not indigent and therefore capable of paying the fine. According to the judge and prosecutors, that profession defrauds insurance companies by billing them for overpriced and unnecessary repairs after natural disasters.
He will also be ordered to pay restitution, though the details of that were not clear Wednesday.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FhqHADcVIAM6cl9-1024x873.jpg,,,2025-08-13 17:57:41.003973

Larry Rhoden.
The governor said Wednesday that the inmates will be transferred to federal custody for deportation proceedings.
“South Dakota taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for illegal alien criminals,” Rhoden said in a news release.
The inmates were chosen by the Department of Corrections based on their immigration status, low-risk classification and closeness to the end of their sentence, the news release said. Each case was reviewed by the South Dakota Board of Pardons and Paroles.
The inmates came from Mexico, Sudan, Liberia, Canada, Somalia, Cuba and Ethiopia. Their crimes included burglary, possession of controlled substances, theft, assault and rape, among others.
The action comes on the heels of the Department of Corrections pursuing an agreement to assist the federal government with immigration enforcement, as part of an initiative Rhoden has dubbed Operation Prairie Thunder. The Highway Patrol and Division of Criminal Investigation have similar agreements.

(Photo by Natalie Behring/Getty Images)As conservative lawmakers work to restrict online access to abortion medication, a new report shows how popular it has become for women who live in states that have outlawed abortion.
Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin led a team that analyzed 15 months of prescription data from Aid Access, one of the largest online abortion telemedicine providers.
They found 84% of Aid Access’s more than 118,000 online prescriptions went to patients living in abortion-ban states.
The South and Midwest had the highest rates of patients accessing telemedicine abortion. Rates were also greater in high-poverty areas or where people would have to travel more than 100 miles to reach an abortion clinic, according to the report, which published this month.
Aid Access is able to mail abortion medications to residents in all 50 states — even those in states with abortion bans — thanks to shield laws in Democratic-led states. Shield laws are designed to minimize the legal risks for people who provide or access abortions across state lines.
Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have reproductive care shield laws, either through legislation or by executive order, according to a report from University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
Eight of those states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — specifically protect telehealth abortion providers regardless of where their patient is located.
Shield laws, along with difficulty accessing in-person abortion services in abortion-ban states, have contributed to a rise in medication and telehealth abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, clearing the way for state bans. With telehealth abortion, patients have a virtual appointment with a clinician who can prescribe abortion medication, which is then filled by a licensed pharmacy and mailed to the patient.
Research has shown telehealth medication abortion is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
But as abortion medication use rises, so have conservative efforts to ban it.
This year, more than a dozen states introduced bills to bar access to medication abortion by criminalizing its sale, purchase or distribution, according to Guttmacher.
One such bill in Texas, which could have been a blueprint for medication abortion restriction in other states, was specifically aimed at groups like Aid Access. It would have allowed private citizens to sue for at least $100,000 anyone who provided abortion pills in Texas. The bill passed the Texas Senate but died in the House in May.
Earlier this year, the state of Louisiana criminally charged a New York physician under its abortion ban law for allegedly providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teen via telehealth. New York, which passed a shield law in 2023, refused Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor.
Last month marked the first federal test of shield laws, when a Texas man sued a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to his partner.
This week, a Texas woman filed a federal lawsuit against Aid Access and against a man who she said impregnated her, then spiked her drink with abortion pills. She is also suing the Dutch doctor who founded Aid Access, alleging Aid Access and its founder mailed abortion-inducing drugs in violation of Texas and federal law.

(Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks photo)Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks issued warrants for the arrest of a Michigan father and son, following a series of wildlife violations in Treasure County, the department said in a Wednesday press release.
Ronald Schubert and his son, Chad Schubert, both of Belleville, Michigan, have each been charged with felony unlawful possession of a trophy bull elk.
Additionally, Chad Schubert has been charged with an additional felony for tampering with evidence and four misdemeanors including: hunting during a closed season; failure to obtain landowner permission for hunting; waste of a game animal; and violation of a commission or department rule for failure to return to a kill site.
Ronald Schubert has also been charged with misdemeanor criminal trespass.
According to FWP, the Rosebud County Sheriff’s Office provided information about the wildlife violations to the department. An investigation by an FWP warden found that Chad Schubert allegedly killed a trophy bull elk without a valid permit. The animal was killed on private land, with a rifle, during archery-only season. The elk’s head was removed and transported and the rest of the animal was “left to waste,” the release said.
Further investigation showed that Ronald Schubert was present at the time and allegedly assisted with removal and transport of the head and antlers.
Chad Schubert also faces additional pending charges for violations related to the hunting of deer, antelope, turkeys and mountain lions in Rosebud County, the release said.
Rosebud County Sheriff’s Office, Treasure County Attorney’s Office, Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, and the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources all assisted in the investigation, FWP said in a release.

As President Trump orders federal troops into the streets of Washington, D.C. to “do whatever the hell they want” to stop crime, Sen. Peter Welch is traveling across Vermont to share what he insists is the real news that Trump is trying to divert attention from.


Welch has tallied the impact of President Trump’s economic policies and determined that they will cost families in Vermont an average of $2,120 each year. He says that 99.5%  of all Vermont families will lose money as a result of   Trump’s tariffs and his budget reconciliation bill, which the Senate narrowly passed in early July after Vice President J.D. Vance cast a tie-breaking vote.
The Vermont Conversation caught up with Welch at Snow Farm Vineyard in South Hero, where Welch held a listening session attended by about 150 people.
Welch conceded that even he is “shocked” by the devastating impact of what he calls the “big ugly bill.” His office released a list of those impacts, including:

As many as 45,000 Vermonters will lose health care
As much as $1.7 billion in lost revenue for Vermont hospitals
Over 26,000 Vermonters will lose access to discounted premiums on the Affordable Care Act marketplace
6,000 Vermonters are at risk of losing SNAP assistance
Annual energy bills for Vermonters will rise by $290
The state will lose 1,400 jobs by ending green energy projects
Mortgage payments will rise by $1,060 annually
78,000 Vermonters with student loans will pay $3,694 more over the course of their loans

These cuts will shred the country’s social safety net, and undo social programs that date back to President Roosevelt’s New Deal and President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society.
“There (were) a lot of lies that were peddled by the administration and frankly by many of my Republican colleagues about how great the bill was,” Welch said, while “ignoring the concrete reality” of how it will hurt the people they represent. Welch said Trump’s budget will add about $4.5 trillion to the federal deficit.
In a rare criticism of Governor Phil Scott, Welch slammed the governor’s recent decision to provide the Trump administration sensitive data on thousands of Vermonters who receive nutrition assistance. “We should not be providing the private information of our citizens to the federal government,” said Vermont’s junior senator. “We should be protecting the privacy of Vermont citizens.”
All together, Welch said Trump’s actions are part and parcel of an authoritarian push. He accused the president of employing a “dual standard” around crime in the nation’s capital. “You had a riot that was inspired and incited by President Trump and those folks who were intent on doing real violence and hurt many of these law enforcement officers have been pardoned by the president.” Welch was in Congress hiding from mobs of Trump supporters who rampaged through the Capitol on January 6, 2021.
Abroad, Sen. Welch was also sharply critical of Israel’s war in Gaza. Since the October 7, 2023 attack in which Hamas killed some 1,200 Israelis and took hostage some 250 soldiers and civilians, Israel has killed over 61,000 Palestinians, detained about 3,000 people — none of whom have been charged with a crime — and waged a campaign of starvation against a desperate population. In response, Welch has called for a ceasefire, the return of hostages, and a cutoff of sales of offensive weapons to Israel.
“Being against starvation is not at all being against the endurance of the democratic Jewish state of Israel. It’s about being against starvation and that starvation being inflicted by the authority of the state.” 
American democracy is “fragile,” Welch said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-13 20:56:07+00:00,CT Mirror,Republican Ryan Fazio opens campaign for governor,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/13/republican-ryan-fazio-opens-campaign-for-governor/,State Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich opened a campaign for the Republican gubernatorial nomination with a pledge to lower state income taxes.,"State Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich opened a campaign for the Republican gubernatorial nomination Wednesday with a dig at Connecticut’s popular Democratic governor and a pledge to lower state income taxes, cap local property taxes and reduce electric rates.
In a 90-second video, the 35-year-old Fazio targets the state’s high cost of living as a central issue and ties Gov. Ned Lamont, who has been hinting at a run for a third term in 2026, to a Democratic legislative majority that is more liberal than Lamont on fiscal, labor and housing issues. 
“Connecticut was once an affordable place where families could build a future, but after years of failed leadership in Hartford, it’s where dreams get buried under sky-high electric bills and taxes,” Fazio said. “Under Ned Lamont and his radical legislature, electric rates and taxes have soared to the third-highest in the country.”
Fazio is the second Republican to create a campaign committee that allows him to begin raising and spending money on a run for governor. The first was Jennifer Tooker, the first selectwoman of Westport. New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart has an exploratory committee and is expected to join them as declared candidates.
Republicans have not won a gubernatorial or congressional race in Connecticut since 2006, when the GOP’s brand still was embodied by President George W. Bush, and the party has suffered further losses in the General Assembly since President Donald Trump has come to dominate the party.
Each in their 30s, Fazio and Stewart will be vying to become the face of a new generation of Republicans who will need to appeal to Trump voters in a primary while maintaining a certain distance from a president who has lost decisively in Connecticut in each of his three runs for the White House. 
“I voted for the president. I have great respect for his service and patriotism,” Fazio said. “I know our race for governor will be decided by state issues and the ability to fight for state residents.”
Lamont, 71, is a former businessman, long-time Greenwich resident and one of Fazio’s constituents in the 36th Senate District. He is expected to finalize a decision on a third term after Labor Day.
Fazio drew national notice in August 2021 as the first Republican to flip a Democratic legislative seat after Joe Biden defeated Trump to win the White House.
Fazio won the seat in a special election after the resignation of Alex Kasser, a Democrat who unseated a Republican in 2018. Kasser was the first Democrat elected to the state Senate from Greenwich since the Great Depression, and her win was emblematic of the GOP’s waning fortunes in Fairfield County.
Fazio won a full term in 2022 with just 50.1% of the vote, and he was targeted by Democrats during the 2024 presidential year. But he outperformed Trump, whom he rarely if ever mentioned during this campaign, and was reelected with 52% of the vote. 
In the legislature, he has made electric rates his key issue as the ranking Senate Republican on the Energy and Technology Committee and contributed to the drafting and passage of a bipartisan energy bill that will result in a modest reduction in electric rates by shifting some expenses off ratepayers.
The measure authorized state bonding of $155 million to offset a portion of the public benefits charge in monthly bills. The charge is a levy on ratepayers for programs that, among other things, provide financial assistance for low-income customers and encourage energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives.
In his announcement video, Fazio made specific promises about lowering the cost of living in Connecticut.


“Let’s cut electric rates by 20% and eliminate the public benefits charge. Let’s reduce income taxes by $1,500 for the average family and cap property taxes,” Fazio said.
In an interview, Fazio said he believes property taxes can be capped without shifting local expenses to the state budget. One way, he said, would be to eliminate some of the unfunded mandates on municipalities. 
Choosing specific goals for electric rate and income tax cut was deliberate, he said.
“I’m running for very specific reasons and to do very specific things,” he said.
He acknowledged the governor’s reputation as a fiscal moderate poses a challenge for Republicans, but there is ample room to run to his right on the issues of affordability,
“There is not a corner of the state you can go to where you don’t hear concerns about electric bills, property taxes, the ability of young people to get a job and seniors to retire comfortably,” Fazio said. “It’s not just numbers on a page. It’s people’s lives. People have been hurting here for a long time.”
Fazio recently became engaged, and his fiancée, Amy Orser, is featured in the video. He was unsure how a wedding and a campaign would be coordinated.
“You don’t plan these things, and here you are,” he said. “These are both great things and exciting things.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ryan-Fazio-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 16:57:02.869670

(Photo by Troy R. Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)Underscoring what advocates see as worsening partisan divide over LGBTQ+ rights, Maine lawmakers voted mostly along party lines on many related bills this session, according to Equality Maine’s annual scorecard, released Tuesday.
The organization tracked how every lawmaker voted on specific legislation targeting transgender youth as well as broader proposals that would impact the LGBTQ+ community or that Equality Maine considers to align with their mission to create an inclusive, intersectional community to advance the rights of LGBTQ+ Mainers. These included bills that fund reproductive health and abortion services, a bill that would prevent children from being doxxed, bills related to public health and gun control, and a bill that sought to prevent the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use.
“Most bills have a connection to our community in some form or fashion,” said Gia Drew, executive director of Equality Maine, emphasizing the importance of tracking a wide range of legislation. According to the organization’s scorecard, most Democrats voted to preserve reproductive health, promote gun reform and reject anti-trans bills. 
Most Republicans voted in favor of the eight anti-trans bills introduced this session. These aimed to restrict the rights of students to participate in girls sports teams, access school bathrooms and locker rooms, and use pronouns aligning with their gender identity. Despite a handful of Democrats voting for some of those bills, none passed this session.
In particular, four democrats voted against LD 233, a bill restricting trans athletes’ rights, citing unfair advantages they believe trans girls have over their cis teammates: Reps. Stephan Bunker of Farmington, Wayne Farrin of Jefferson, Dani O’Halloran of Brewer and David Rollins of Augusta. Some of them also voted against their party on some gun control legislation, according to the Equality Maine tracker. 
On the Republican side, only Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford opposed these measures and during the floor debate gave an impassioned speech against several of those bills. He has since left the party to run for governor as an independent. 
The issue of trans rights in particular has become more political over the past few years, Drew noted. For months, Maine faced scrutiny by the Trump administration for its inclusive trans policies, which Drew said had existed for decades without objection or questioning.
“The national spotlight and some of the local issues related to being trans has really unfortunately polarized the parties,” she said.“Historically, LGBTQ+ rights had more bipartisan support.”
For example, when the Legislature added an amendment to the Maine Human Rights Act in 2005 that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing, educational opportunity, credit and public accommodations, it passed with solid bipartisan support, as did a bill supporting marriage equality in 2009.
However, the Equality Maine scorecard did highlight new alignment on the issue of eminent domain. Sponsored by Republican House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor, LD 958, which aimed to preserve tribal rights to land, won over many Republicans who generally were less supportive of previous attempts to provide the Wabanaki Nations greater sovereignty.
Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, ultimately vetoed the bill, but Drew saw the effort as proof that the Legislature could again find common ground around LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights.
“I’d like to be hopeful that when I see that overlap there’s probably ways we can bridge those differences that remain across parties,” she said.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Roughly 8% of Rhode Island Senate District 4 voters cast ballots in the special Aug. 5 election, according to final results certified by the state Board of Elections Wednesday.
The board’s unanimous vote, made swiftly and without discussion, confirms the preliminary outcome of the election in which Democrat Stefano Famiglietti secured 83% of votes, compared with 16% for Republican Alexander Asermely.
The special election was triggered by the death of the late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio. Ruggerio held the seat for 40 years prior to his death in April.
Famiglietti, 33, a personal injury lawyer, pledged to follow in his predecessor’s footsteps, emphasizing deep community ties which include serving on the North Providence Town Council since 2018. His ascension to the State Senate triggers a special election for his seat on the town council, dates for which have not been set.
Famiglietti’s landslide victory received national party recognition, with Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin touting the results as Democrats’ second-biggest “overperformance” of 2025 compared with district results in the 2024 presidential election.
There are 22,214 registered voters in the district, which spans North Providence and a section of northern Providence. A majority of them, roughly 10,000, are registered Democrats, while another 9,700 are unaffiliated, with the remainder registered as Republicans, according to data from the Rhode Island Department of State. 
Nearly 60% of the 2,054 voters who participated in the August special election cast ballots on Election Day at one of the four designated polling places, Miguel Nunez, state election director, said during the Wednesday meeting. Another 25% voted early during designated hours at city or town halls, while the remainder submitted ballots by mail,
Famiglietti will be sworn into office at 4 p.m. Thursday in an inauguration ceremony at the Rhode Island State House. Secretary of State Gregg Amore will administer the oath of office.
Famiglietti will serve the rest of Ruggerio’s two-year term, though 2026. State lawmakers are paid $20,391.97 a year.
Election board members Michael Connors, Randall Jackvony and Robert Rapoza were absent from the meeting.

Ryan’s World is largely credited as being the first kidfluencer channel on YouTube. Some state legislators are pushing to protect child influencers (Derek White/Getty Images for Bentonville Film Festival).A couple of years ago, Alisa Jno-Charles saw her now 9-year-old daughter watching a YouTube video of several children and their swift ninja moves.
The video was from Ninja Kidz TV, a YouTube channel that features four young siblings who were raised in a martial arts studio, according to their official website. The channel has about 23.9 million subscribers.
Jno-Charles scrolled through the Ninja Kidz TV videos and noticed that the content featured more than just the kids’ ninja antics: Every single part of their lives was documented, she said.
“It was their first date, and their insecurities about social situations, and major life decisions — like the type of school they should go to — and their birthday parties,” Jno-Charles said. “It was everything. And that didn’t sit well with me.”
Jno-Charles did some more digging into “kidfluencing” on YouTube. She knew, of course, about social media influencers, and that it had become accepted as a legitimate job — for adults. But were there protections, she wondered, “for children who can’t actually make that decision to go into that business themselves?”
An increasing number of state lawmakers are asking the same question.
In the absence of federal regulations, some legislators are pushing to protect child influencers. Many of the measures aim to ensure kids are compensated fairly for their work, by requiring adult account managers — usually their parents — to set aside any earnings in a trust fund the children can access once they are adults. Some of the bills also aim to give children more control over the content they are featured in.
The experience with her daughter prompted Jno-Charles, an assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, to research the fast-growing industry.
In a paper published earlier this year in the Journal of Business Ethics, Jno-Charles and Canadian researcher Daniel Clark concluded that kidfluencing was “a new form of child labor” that can financially exploit kids and violate their privacy, among other harms.
“Kidfluencing represents a uniquely insidious threat because [it’s] seemingly so benign,” Jno-Charles and Clark wrote. “It is prone to willful blindness from the parents, the platforms, the audience, and society at large.”
The risks are especially great, they argue, when kidfluencers are the family’s primary source of income, “obscuring the distinction between the best interests of the child and those of the family.”
But Jno-Charles said many of the state bills focus on financial compensation while ignoring other issues, such as the child’s reputation and whether it will harm their future employment opportunities, relationships and more.
“We’ve seen so many stories come out on families that have exploited and abused their children in a lot of very terrible ways, the least of which is monetarily,” she said. “How do you protect children from those situations? I feel like these regulations are a good start, but it’s not really addressing what I perceive to be the true issues around influence.”
 40 million subscribers

Kidfluencers and other content creators make money by hawking products and services to the people who follow them. The job has become increasingly lucrative as companies spend more on social media marketing. Some influencers can earn $10,000 or more for a single post, said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit focused on science and technology.
Ryan’s World is largely credited as being the first kidfluencer channel on YouTube. The channel got its start in 2015 with videos featuring 3-year-old Ryan Kaji, who enjoyed unboxing new toys.
Today, Ryan is entering his teen years, and Ryan’s World has nearly 40 million subscribers. The Ryan’s World brand is managed by Sunlight Entertainment, a family-owned production company headed by Ryan’s father. And this year, Ryan Kaji was No. 21 on the Forbes Top Creators list, with $35 million in earnings as of late June.
“It’s so easy for children to just start creating,” Ambrose said. “And with TikTok and Instagram, the ability to edit videos and edit content now is so much easier than it was in the past. You can just start creating with very simple tools that are available to folks.”
Kidfluencers are growing in popularity across nearly every social media platform. While some youths have started accounts on their own, others are managed and monitored by their parents.
Other forms of media already have labor standards. Children who appear on television or in films have contracts that stipulate what they will be paid. Some states, including California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico and New York, have laws mandating that employers of child actors set aside a portion of their earnings — generally 15% — in a trust the actors can access when they become adults.
The first such law was enacted by California in 1939. The Coogan Law was inspired by child actor Jackie Coogan, who played the title role in Charlie Chaplin’s “The Kid” and was one of Hollywood’s first child stars. When Coogan became an adult, he discovered that his parents had squandered much of the money he had earned.
 States step in

In 2023, Illinois expanded its version of the Coogan Law to include kidfluencers, and California followed suit in 2024 (the laws took effect in 2024 and 2025, respectively).
This year, at least four states — Arkansas, Montana, Utah and Virginia — have amended their child labor laws to mandate trusts and other protections for content creators who are minors. And when Hawaii this year approved its own version of the Coogan Law, it included child influencers in the definition of minors engaged in “theatrical employment.”
The New Jersey General Assembly and the New York Senate also approved child influencer legislation this year, but neither has become law.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich, who sponsored the legislation in his state, is a schoolteacher and the father of a 2-year-old and a 9-month-old. Both in the legislature and at home, Gramlich said, he’s worked toward ensuring kids are protected when they use the internet.
The Arkansas legislation he authored has a trust requirement, but it also includes other protections for child influencers, such as requiring adults to pay minors if they are using them to create content for money. For example, a minor must be paid if they or their likeness appears in at least 30% of the content produced over 30 days, or if the adult earned at least $15,000 in the previous 12 months.
The legislation also prohibits accounts from sharing “any visual depiction of a minor with the intent to sexually gratify or elicit a sexual response in the viewer or any other person.”
This goes beyond existing prohibitions on child pornography to include, for example, parents who dress their child-influencer daughters in bikinis or dance leotards for their followers — some of whom are paying a monthly fee to see that kind of content, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
Gramlich said Google helped him write the legislation. Ambrose, of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said other social media companies have played a similar role in other states, and are establishing new policies for content featuring children.
Instagram last month announced new protections for adult-managed accounts that primarily feature children. This includes placing these accounts into a stricter category to prevent unwanted messages and turning on filters for offensive comments, according to the announcement.
Google and Meta did not grant Stateline requests for interviews.
A handful of legislators pushed back against the bill, Gramlich said, because they were concerned about putting too much responsibility on the parents. But when a parent is making an additional $15,000 a year by posting videos of their children, he said, there must be rules.
“In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections,” Gramlich said. “We’re at the point where kids aren’t in the mines anymore, but it looks like they’re going to be on the internet. But now, their parents may be making money off their efforts, and they never get to see it.”
Social media audiences do not see the production behind online content, Gramlich said. These audiences are only seeing the finished product. And younger kids may not realize that their work is being used for money and will forever exist online, he said.
“If you’re anything like me, you’ve been told for the last 15 years that everything you put on the internet is there forever,” Gramlich said. “But can a child really understand what that means?”
The Utah legislation also goes beyond trusts. Utah Democratic state Rep. Doug Owens, the House sponsor of the bill, wanted to make sure that child influencers had the right to delete their content once they became adults. His legislation, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in March, requires that social media companies create a process for people who want their content removed or edited.
Before the legislation was drafted, two people reached out to Owens asking him to propose protections for child actors and influencers. One was a constituent — a child actor who had appeared in traditional television commercials.
The second, he said, was Kevin Franke, the ex-husband of former YouTube family vlogger Ruby Franke. In 2023, the popular YouTube star was arrested after her 12-year-old son, with duct tape stuck to his ankles and wrists, ran to a neighbor’s house and asked for food and water. She was later convicted on child abuse charges and sentenced to up to 30 years in prison.
Recent docuseries on Netflix and Hulu have revealed the ways in which kidfluencing can lead to children experiencing peer pressure, manipulation, child abuse and, in the case of the Franke family, torture.
Both the child actor and Kevin Franke said children in the entertainment industry — including kidfluencers — should have adults who are looking out for them, Owens said.
“I think social media is just an obvious place where kids need some protection,” he said.
But most state legislatures remain focused on broader social media concerns, such as age restrictions, said Georgia Democratic state Rep. Kim Schofield, who has sponsored a child influencer bill in her state.
In February, Schofield introduced a measure that would mandate trusts for child influencers. Her bill also would restrict children’s work schedules: A child between the ages of 9 and 16, for instance, would be barred from working more than five hours a day.
“I’m so excited to see that these kids are just so talented,” Schofield said. “They have a means to broaden and expand an endless universe online — I love that I get to see that. But if you’re making so much money and making the family rich, I want to make sure that you’re getting a piece of the pie.”

,DC,2025-08-13 20:33:51+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump in court ruling allowed to hold back foreign aid funds approved by Congress,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-court-ruling-allowed-hold-back-foreign-aid-funds-approved-congress,,"WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court on Wednesday overturned a lower court’s ruling that had required the Trump administration to spend foreign aid dollars approved by Congress.But instead of addressing the central argument of the lawsuit — that a president cannot refuse to spend money approved by lawmakers, who hold the power of the purse — the Circuit Court in a potentially significant decision said the organizations that filed the case didn’t have the authority to do so.Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson wrote in her 33-page opinion that only the comptroller general, who leads the Government Accountability Office, has the power to bring lawsuits when a president impounds, or refuses to spend, congressionally approved funds.  The GAO is an independent, non-partisan watchdog agency that works for Congress.“Because the grantees lack a cause of action, we need not address on the merits whether the government violated the Constitution by infringing on the Congress’s spending power through alleged violations of the 2024 Appropriations Act, the ICA and the Anti-Deficiency Act,” Henderson wrote. The ICA is the Impoundment Control Act, which is the legal mechanism through which the president can delay or withhold funds.Henderson was nominated to the Circuit Court in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush, a few years after President Ronald Reagan nominated her as a federal district judge in 1986.Henderson wrote that she and Judge Gregory G. Katsas, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, concluded “the district court abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction” for several reasons.Both Republican and Democratic state attorneys general filed amicus briefs in the case, with Republicans siding with the Trump administration. The case originated when Trump signed an order on Inauguration Day freezing certain foreign aid spending.Henderson wrote that “within weeks, the State Department and USAID suspended or terminated thousands of grant awards.”‘It is our responsibility to check the president’Judge Florence Y. Pan, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, issued a 46-page dissenting opinion, arguing the ruling from her two colleagues was “procedurally and substantively flawed.”“It is our responsibility to check the President when he violates the law and exceeds his constitutional authority,” Pan wrote. “We fail to do that here.”Pan wrote she disagreed with the majority’s opinion that Trump withholding certain foreign aid funding was “a mere violation of the Impoundment Control Act that should be addressed by the Comptroller General.”“In this case, the President’s violation of the Impoundment Control Act is a sideshow,” Pan wrote. “That statute provided a mechanism for the President to lawfully attempt to impound the funds, and his failure to follow its prescribed procedures is evidence that he was, in fact, refusing to obligate the funds in defiance of Congress.”Public media funding targetedThe Trump administration has used the Impoundment Control Act one time this year, when it requested Congress cancel $9.4 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and various foreign aid programs.The House voted mostly along party lines to approve the full request in mid-June.Senate Republicans approved the bill in July after preserving full funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.House GOP lawmakers then cleared the bill for Trump’s signature just before a 45-day clock ran out.Trump administration sees 'big win'Several members of the Trump administration, including Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought and Attorney General Pam Bondi, cheered the Circuit Court’s ruling in social media posts.“In a 2-1 ruling, the DC Circuit lifted an injunction ordering President Trump to spend hard-earned taxpayer dollars on wasteful foreign aid projects,” Bondi wrote. “We will continue to successfully protect core Presidential authorities from judicial overreach.”Vought wrote the ruling was a “Big win!”An OMB spokesperson wrote in a statement the ruling represented a victory for the White House.“Radical left dark-money groups have been using the court system to seize control of U.S. foreign policy,” the spokesperson wrote. “Today’s decision stops these private groups from maliciously interfering with the President’s ability to spend responsibly and administer foreign aid in a lawful manner and in alignment with his America First policies.”Lauren Bateman, attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group and lead counsel on the suit, wrote in a statement that the court's ruling represented ""a significant setback for the rule of law and risks further erosion of basic separation of powers principles.""We will seek further review from the court, and our lawsuit will continue regardless as we seek permanent relief from the Administration's unlawful termination of the vast majority of foreign assistance.

Parks Elementary in Oklahoma City serve a student breakfast in the school cafeteria on Wednesday. Oklahoma City Public Schools offers all cafeteria meals for free, but other districts charge fees. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Multiple Oklahoma school districts say they will continue to charge cafeteria fees despite demands from the state’s public education chief to provide all meals for free.
Serving free meals to all students, as state Superintendent Ryan Walters called for last month, isn’t financially feasible and would require dramatic cost cuts, district officials have said. Unlike other states that made school meals universally free, Oklahoma has not dedicated any extra funds to support the policy.
“At the present time, we’re going to continue operating the way we have done with lunches until we have further guidance in terms of what and how that’s going to look within our school and other school districts,” said Josh Delich, superintendent of Edmond Public Schools.
Walters threatened to penalize and audit schools that don’t comply, calling cafeteria fees an extra tax unfairly imposed on Oklahoma families. 
“If schools districts cannot, and will not, prioritize students, (the Oklahoma State Department of Education) will get involved and audit their budgets,” Walters said in a statement Wednesday. “Record amounts of funding are going to schools and it is completely unacceptable for administrators to continue failing our kids, and get rich doing it.”
No state law permits the state superintendent to punish or audit schools for not providing universal free meals, according to a memo from the Oklahoma State School Boards Association.
Speaking with reporters after a State of the Schools event Aug. 6, Delich said he’s not concerned about blowback from the state Department of Education.

“As things continue to unfold, we’ll adjust accordingly and do what we need to do as a collective system to do what’s best for students and families,” he said.
Children living at or near the federal poverty line qualify for free or reduced-price meals in any public school. 
More than 250 districts in Oklahoma have a large enough portion of students from low-income homes that they receive enhanced federal funding that enables them to provide free meals to all enrolled.
Other districts with lower poverty levels don’t qualify for as much federal support for child nutrition costs, which is why they still charge for meals.
Some, like Norman Public Schools, have a mix of both scenarios.
Norman has 19 schools that offer free meals to all students and five that do not. Low-income families at those five schools are encouraged to fill out an application for free or reduced-price meals, district spokesperson Courtney Scott said.
With less than a week to go before Norman’s first day of school, the district had yet to receive any formal directive or guidance from the state Education Department about the meal policy, she said Thursday.  
“We aren’t changing any plans,” Scott said.
Representatives of Deer Creek Public Schools and Bixby Public Schools said they don’t intend to cancel all cafeteria fees, either. Superintendents of both districts said it would take “drastic” cuts to cover free meals for every student.
Walters urged districts to reduce administrative spending to free up funds for the extra cost.

Even a “crippling” 50% cut to Bixby’s administrative budget would afford only 30% of the cost of student meals, Superintendent Lydia Wilson wrote in a message to families.
Deer Creek Superintendent Jason Perez said his district would have to lay off teachers and cut school programs on top of firing all administrators.
“I think for now, we’re going to continue on as planned,” he told Oklahoma Voice on July 8. “We’ve got school opening up in a month. We want to make sure we’re fully staffed. We want to make sure that we’re going to be able to fund school.”
A Deer Creek assistant superintendent, Lenis DeRieux, said last week the district’s stance has not changed.
Lunches will cost $3.40 in Deer Creek’s elementary and middle schools, and $3.75 at its high school, according to the district’s website. Breakfast is $2.37.

(Photo courtesy of Maine AFL-CIO) Graduate workers gathered in Orono on Wednesday to ask the University of Maine administration to agree to a fair union contract. 
Members of the University of Maine Graduate Workers’ Union gathered outside the Raymond H. Fogler Library to speak out about the bargaining process for a contract that began in November 2023 — more than 630 days ago. Other labor union members from across the state joined them in solidarity. 
“Six hundred and thirty days. The graduate workers union has shown up to the table prepared to bargain and motivated to reach the first contract,” said Grant Provost, a member of Ironworkers Local 7 and vice president of the Maine AFL-CIO. “It’s time for the university system to do the same.”
“Every person in Maine benefits from the important work that graduate students do,” he added, including research that directly impacts Maine’s economy and industries such as forestry, wildlife, marine sciences and more.
UMaine grad students hoping to secure higher pay, more transparency in first contract

Union members from other industries including a paper worker, an ironworker and a nurse spoke out in support of finalizing a contract for the graduate workers. State Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot), who co-chairs the Legislature’s Labor Committee, was also present. 
Erin Oberson, a labor and delivery nurse at Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center and a member of the Maine State Nurses Association, said she has been supporting the graduate workers since they first formed their union. She explained that nurses are invested in the students’ efforts because they help teach some of the required courses for the UMaine nursing students.
“Shouldn’t we want to attract the best and the brightest graduate workers to teach our state’s future nursing workforce?” Oberson asked, which was responded to with applause. She said that isn’t possible if those workers aren’t paid living wages or provided decent health care. 
The university system said that it values the contributions of graduate workers but that it is  limited by the state and federal money it receives, according to a statement provided by Samantha Warren, chief external and governmental affairs officer. 
“As a public university system, our ability to improve work opportunities and conditions without shifting costs to our students and their families in the form of unreasonable tuition increases largely depends on our State appropriation and our federal grants and contracts, tens of millions of dollars of which have been impacted in recent months,” the statement reads. “We continue to bargain with the University of Maine Graduate Workers Union in good faith and are committed to achieving an agreement that is responsive to the requests of these respected student workers and the operational needs and increasingly constrained resources of our public institutions.”
The university also announced $250,000 in philanthropic funding back in May to support graduate students whose work had been jeopardized by the loss of federal research funding.
Peter Howe, a research assistant and PhD student in the School of Forest Resources at UMaine, said the union had its 51st all-day bargaining session with the university last week. 
“What we’re proposing is something in line with all our peer universities and what did they hand us back? More crumbs, more pay cuts,” Howe said. “We’re here to say that when we come back to the table on Friday, we need a fair contract and we need it now.”

The Delaware Judiciary is mourning the loss of retired Superior Court Judge John E. Babiarz, Jr., who died on July 30 at the age of 83.
Judge Babiarz served on the Delaware Superior Court for 25 years, from 1985 until his retirement in 2010.
Known for his sharp intellect, fairness, and warm demeanor, he was remembered by colleagues as a cornerstone of the state’s legal community.
“The Court is saddened by the loss of Judge Babiarz,” said Superior Court President Judge Eric M. Davis. “John was intelligent, quick witted, kind and generous. A larger-than-life presence on the Court for many years and a great colleague. He will be dearly missed.”
READ: David J. Pacific named president, CEO of The Music School of Delaware
A Delaware native and graduate of Salesianum High School, Babiarz earned his law degree from Harvard Law School and joined the Delaware Bar in 1966.
Prior to his judicial appointment, he practiced law for nearly two decades, co-founding the firm Biondi and Babiarz in 1971 and later becoming a partner at Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell in 1979.
He earned respect on the bench for his fiercely independent approach to the law, often described as even-handed and principled, without leaning toward either prosecution or defense.
Babiarz was also deeply connected to Wilmington’s civic legacy.
His father, John Babiarz Sr., served as mayor of Wilmington, and Judge Babiarz spent most of his judicial career in the same Rodney Square courthouse where his father once had an office.
Reflecting on his time on the bench, Babiarz once said, “I can’t wait for tomorrow to come, “and in 2010, days before his retirement, he
remained equally enthusiastic. “I look forward to coming to work every day,” he said.
Judge Babiarz is survived by his wife of 58 years, Linda C. (Whalen) Babiarz; daughters Lisa Loughran of Petaluma, Calif.; Julia Babiarz of Truckee, Calif.; and Amanda Cline and her husband Matthew of Brisbane, Calif.; as well as several grandchildren.

While Baxter was initially charged with perjury, she pled guilty in June to a lesser charge of knowingly providing a false or misleading statement to a police officer during a criminal investigation, a misdemeanor charge. 
Circuit Judge James Jamo sentenced Baxter to three months of reporting probation, 20 hours of community service and a $2,500 fine — the highest amount permitted by law. 
Baxter raised money for the Michigan!

“For too long, dark money has operated in the shadows of Lansing with little accountability,” Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement Wednesday. “The Unlock Michigan investigation shed light on corruption in campaign finance that was long considered common practice. Fair elections depend on transparency and honesty, and attempts to skirt the system or mislead law enforcement and the people of Michigan will not be tolerated.”
Baxter was accused of lying to investigators about the extent of her fundraising efforts for the fund, with the Department of Attorney General alleging she was given an opportunity to correct her statements under oath, and chose not to. 
Baxter was charged alongside Heather Lombardini, the head of Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility – also tied to Shirkey – and treasurer for the Michigan! My Michigan! fund.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Self-driving cars aren’t here yet, but states are getting the rules ready

Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

In communities across the Commonwealth, these stations have kept the lights on in meeting halls and school auditoriums, ensuring that local democracy happens in the open.
The post Don’t let public access TV go dark  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IN CITIES AND towns across Massachusetts, a quiet but vital institution continues to serve as a local watchdog, a storytelling hub, and an incubator for the next generation of media makers: public access television. Viewed by some as a relic of the cable era, these local channels are now more important than ever, precisely because so many other local news outlets have vanished. 
Yet this vital public service is under threat. As more households “cut the cord,” shifting from cable TV to streaming services like Netflix, Disney+, and YouTube TV, the cable franchise fees that sustain local access operations have been steadily shrinking. Stations that once operated on healthy budgets now face layoffs, reduced programming, or outright closure. Without intervention, entire communities could lose their only local media outlet. 
In communities across the Commonwealth, these stations have kept the lights on in meeting halls and school auditoriums, ensuring that local democracy happens in the open, where residents can see for themselves how their tax dollars are spent and decisions are made. When the COVID pandemic hit, it was these Public, Educational, and Government (PEG) access stations that pivoted to hybrid meetings, ensuring that residents could still participate in local government even if they couldn’t leave their homes. 
But these stations do far more than record government meetings. They are often the last remaining local media outlet that covers community events and tells stories that bigger broadcasters overlook. 
Many have stepped up their game in recent years, adding original news programming to keep residents informed about issues that directly affect their neighborhoods. Others have started holding workshops on emerging technology like AI, providing citizens with the opportunity to stay up to date on the latest advances in technology and how it impacts them. 
Equally important, public access centers provide hands-on opportunities for people of all ages to learn about video production, editing, and broadcasting. Volunteers produce shows on local history, culture, and politics. High school students get real-world training that can lead to careers in media and communications. 
I personally know the value these opportunities provide, having started my career in media as a volunteer for Holbrook’s cable access station covering high school sports. Without the opportunities presented to me by public access media, I might never have discovered my passion for digital media, and I know many other students have had similar experiences.  
That is why the Massachusetts Legislature must act now by passing An Act to Modernize Funding for Community Media Programming (S.41 and H.91). This legislation recognizes a simple truth: streaming companies use the same public rights-of-way, such as streets, utility poles, and internet infrastructure, that traditional cable companies use, but they pay nothing back to the communities they do business in. 
This bill would require streaming entertainment operators earning more than $250,000 a year in Massachusetts to pay an assessment, similar in spirit to the franchise fees paid by cable providers, to support PEG access channels. The law would establish a fair and transparent system to ensure that community media centers receive the funding they need to serve their communities. 
Updating PEG funding isn’t about punishing innovation or clinging to the past. It’s about making sure that communities don’t lose the tools they need to stay informed and connected. It’s about fairness: when companies profit from infrastructure that taxpayers built and maintain, they should help sustain the local services that keep our towns and cities connected and informed. 
Massachusetts has long prided itself on being a leader in civic engagement. Passing this legislation would continue that legacy, modernizing how we fund community media so it can thrive alongside streaming giants in the digital age.

(West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)Gov. Patrick Morrisey is ramping up the state’s participation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), announcing a wide-spread agreement that enlists the National Guard and police officers to expand immigration enforcement operations in West Virginia.
It’s one of the most wide-ranging agreements a state has forged with ICE under President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. It allows designated law enforcement officers to interrogate people on their immigration status during routine police duties.
Morrisey said that unauthorized immigration was linked to the state’s fentanyl issues. More than 81% of fatal drug overdoses in West Virginia in 2023 involved fentanyl.
West Virginia — which is nearly 1,500 miles away from the U.S. southern border —  has effectively become a border state, the governor said. 
“We had to wrestle with the consequences of seemingly unlimited amounts of fentanyl flooding into our state,” Morrisey said Wednesday at a press conference in Parkersburg. 
Morrisey has directed the West Virginia National Guard, the West Virginia State Police and the state Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation to participate in the federal 287(g) program that enables designated local officers to perform certain immigration functions under ICE’s oversight. Local law enforcement can participate in the program, as well. 
ICE has signed similar agreements with hundreds of local and state agencies across the country.
“The goal is to get as many of our personnel trained in order to be effective partners with ICE Homeland Security and the Trump administration,” Morrisey said. 
The National Guard and law enforcement will participate in the “task force model” of the 287(g) program, the broadest of the program’s models that permits law enforcement to enforce immigration authority with ICE oversight during their routine police duties.
The task force agreements with ICE were discontinued in 2012 during the Obama administration after a 2011 Department of Justice investigation found widespread racial profiling and other discrimination against Latinos in an Arizona task force, Stateline reported. 
In West Virginia, participating state police and National Guard members will also have the authority to make warrantless arrests of any undocumented immigrant entering or attempting to unlawfully enter the United States in the officer’s presence or view or if the officer believes the person to be arrested is in violation of the law and likely to escape.
“We are very excited about complete cooperation and collaboration with ICE,” said Superintendent of State Police James L. Mitchell. “We hope that this sends a message to people throughout West Virginia that if you’re illegal, if you’re committing crimes that are not welcomed here in this state.”
Morrisey said only participating law enforcement personnel who are nominated and trained will have the authority to conduct the delegated immigration officer functions. 
“The National Guard stands by ready to assist where we can with the ICE mission,” said Maj. Gen. Jim Seward, adjutant general of West Virginia. “We briefed the governor that we have 175 certified law enforcement officers that will be going through this training to assist ICE where they are needed.”
DCR will also play a role in the program by servicing and executive administrative warrants for undocumented immigrants who currently are in state correctional facilities. 
David Kelly, DCR commissioner, said it would reduce the premature release of potentially dangerous individuals into communities. “It’s about being smart, efficient and proactive,” he said.  
Around 2% of West Virginia’s residents are immigrants.
In January, Morrisey signed an executive order directing the state Department of Homeland Security, law enforcement and more to coordinate with ICE and to support Trump’s policies on illegal immigration. 
As of Wednesday, the governor said there were 88 undocumented immigrants in state custody. Of that total, 46 are being detained on immigration charges that included failing to appear in court before a deportation judge, Morrisey said.

Following a preliminary approval in May, commissioners took final action during a meeting in Havana, in Gadsden County, Wednesday that was heavily attended by opponents and hunters hopeful for a hunt.
The first hunt will be 23 days long during December, making it the first since 2015.
FWC commissioners appear poised to affirm the first bear hunt in Florida in a decade

The commission aims to “manage the bear population through a conservative, well-regulated bear hunt,” according to a summary on the day’s agenda.
Regulations include designated bear hunting zones, permits given through a lottery system, and a cap on permits issued by the executive director of the commission. The new rules allow hunters to shoot bears at feeding stations and in 2027 will allow the use of dogs in bear hunting. 
The prospect of a hunt drew widespread public comment, the state reporting more than 10,000 responses. During the meeting Wednesday, hundreds showed up.
Critics have called it a trophy hunt and cruel to the animals, particularly mother bears, while advocates for the hunt said it would reduce human interactions with the animals, making communities safer. 
Permits for Florida residents, if selected, would be $100, and $300 for nonresidents. The state is limiting out-of-state permits to 10% of the total granted. 
The bear population in Florida is estimated at around 4,050 — but the agency came up with that estimate as long ago as 2015, the last time a bear hunt took place. 
That hunt ended abruptly after only two days after nearly 300 bears were killed.
In a FWC-conducted survey, 75% of more than 13,000 self-selected participants opposed the proposal, with just 23% in support. A Remington Research survey commissioned by the Humane World for Animals showed that 81% of Florida residents oppose the reopening of bear-hunting season.
Of the 40 states with black bear populations, 34 have regulated bear hunting seasons, according to the FWC.

“There is something truly extraordinary happening at The Music School of Delaware, and it resonates across the entire state,” Pacific said. “To join this community of exceptional music educators, dedicated leaders, and remarkable students as the school’s next President and CEO is an incredible honor—one that has me inspired and overjoyed by the people who are at the heart of what makes the school exceptional.”

Pacific most recently served as the inaugural Executive Director of the Joseph Avenue Arts and Culture Alliance in Rochester, N.Y., where he led the organization through a period of rapid growth and expanded access to free, high-quality arts programming.
His past roles also include leadership positions with the Southeastern Piano Festival in Columbia, S.C., Steinway and Sons in New York, and Friends of Chamber Music in Kansas City, Mo.
“I am grateful to build on the rich history of The Music School of Delaware as we welcome its next century and invite more people to join us in making music a meaningful part of our lives together,” he said.
Elizabeth Stout, Chair of the school’s CEO Search Committee, said Pacific stood out among candidates for his executive leadership, fundraising acumen, and alignment with the school’s mission.
“Our search focused on identifying a leader who embodies three key qualities: exceptional executive leadership experience in a nonprofit setting, a proven track record in high-volume fundraising, and a deep commitment to embodying the mission of the Music School of Delaware,” she said. “David not only meets, but exceeds all of these criteria. His understanding of and respect for our faculty and staff, his success in building inclusive and accessible arts programs, and his enthusiasm for community engagement make him the right leader for this moment in our school’s evolution.”
Pacific holds degrees in piano performance and pedagogy from Nazareth University and the University of South Carolina.
A longtime music educator, he has taught and mentored students at community music schools across the country and has been recognized for excellence in both piano performance and choral conducting.
In a message to faculty and staff, Pacific emphasized collaboration and community.
“Whether through the commitment of the board, the extraordinary talents of the faculty and staff, or the deep engagement of students and families, it is clear that The Music School of Delaware is much more than a statewide institution—it is a vital, living community devoted to the transformative power of music and music education,” he wrote. “I look forward to listening, learning, and collaborating with all of you to shape a shared vision that strengthens and expands the school’s reach, deepens our impact, and lifts up every member of our community.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/music-jpg.jpg,,,2025-08-13 16:57:02.869670

Andy Beshear said more than 1,900 driver's licensing credentials had been revoked by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet because of irregularities. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer) Kentucky’s Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman say investigators have been looking into a whistleblower’s allegations that immigrants paid temporary contract workers to illegally obtain state driver’s licenses. 
Louisville TV station WDRB reported Monday a former clerk at a Kentucky driver’s licensing office said co-workers sold, for $200 each, state driver’s licenses to immigrants who couldn’t legally obtain them because they are in the country without permission. The whistleblower, Melissa Moorman, worked at Louisville’s Nia licensing office through the staffing agency Quantam Solutions. 
Moorman told the TV station she was fired when she reported the scheme to the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC). She filed a lawsuit against the cabinet and Quantum Solutions in April. 
Beshear in a Wednesday press conference told reporters the cabinet regularly reviews driver’s licensing credential applications and had revoked 1,985 credentials for irregularities. 
“KYTC immediately contacted law enforcement who are engaged in a criminal investigation, and it includes multiple offices that are both state and federal,” Beshear said. “The revoked credentials, if used, would not work at an airport, would be flagged if pulled over at a traffic stop. We are committed to getting all of the facts and holding anybody who violated the law accountable.”
Beshear said all employees involved had been hired through a “temp agency and have been terminated.” When asked if Moorman was fired by the staffing agency Quantam Solutions or the cabinet after reporting the scheme, Beshear said he didn’t have that information and had not read the whistleblower lawsuit complaint. But he also said some statements in the complaint were “not factual.” 
Coleman, the Republican attorney general, at a roundtable with law enforcement in Shepherdsville on Wednesday said his office had been collaborating with Kentucky State Police and federal officials “for some time now on that investigation.” 
“The conduct as shared by the whistleblower, has been very concerning that the media has reported on in the last few days,” Coleman said. “It’s a several months-long investigation. It’s been ongoing since long before the media reports of the last couple of days. So that is a very ongoing, very robust investigation at present.”

The report of the whistleblower lawsuit has sparked calls from Republicans in the state legislature and Republican Auditor Allison Ball for investigations into the whistleblower’s allegations. 
“If these reports are accurate, this is fundamentally wrong on every level. It’s not just a breakdown in oversight but a betrayal of public trust,” said Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, in a statement on the allegations. “The Kentucky General Assembly will raise concerns and take every action within our authority to correct this wrong and ensure it never happens again.” 
Higdon, the chair of the Kentucky Senate Transportation Committee, in his statement referenced previous frustrations Kentuckians have had at regional driver’s licensing offices, which the state legislature established through a law passed in 2020. Previously, circuit court clerks in each county issued driver’s licenses. The 2020 law, signed by Beshear, garnered support and opposition from both parties in the state legislature.
Kentuckians have faced long lines at the offices, and another state law went into effect this year requiring drivers to pass a vision test to renew their licenses. 
Ball, the Republican state auditor, sent a letter Wednesday to Beshear and Kentucky Transportation Cabinet Secretary Jim Gray requesting a formal explanation regarding the allegations, saying she was troubled by reports of an “alleged black market within the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet.” 
Beshear, responding to a question from a reporter about if undocumented immigrants were receiving fraudulent driver’s licenses, said that it was a part of the investigation. 
“There are a number of different reasons people might try to get fake identification, and I want to make sure I don’t get in front of the Kentucky State Police in their current investigation,” Beshear said. “But when that’s complete, we look forward to sharing any and all of those facts.”

(Brooke Thorington/WRKF)PLAQUEMINE – It’s planting season for sugarcane farmers in Louisiana as they replenish fields that are older than three years and no longer yielding as much sugar.
When President Donald Trump said he wanted Coca-Cola to use sugarcane in its signature drink, instead of high-fructose corn syrup, it brought a lot of attention to the industry.
Patrick Frischhertz is the son-in-law of an eighth generation sugarcane farmer. He’s been in the business for close to 16 years, and he oversees St. Louis Planting in Plaquemine. The company farms sugarcane and soybeans. When Trump boasted he’d convinced Coca-Cola to use natural sugar, Frischhertz said it was welcome news.
“It seems to be getting everybody talking about sugar cane in Louisiana and our natural product. And as farmers we’re really appreciative of it,” Frischhertz.
Israel Huerta is originally from Mexico, and he’s been a U.S. citizen since 2013. He’s worked on the farm in Plaquemine for even longer. He admits he’s biased when it comes to comparing the high-fructose corn syrup in Coca-Cola to the one made with sugarcane.
“Actually, I think in Mexico they use that already. They use sugarcane and it tastes better. And it’s, it is more, uh, it’s not, I’m not, I’m not gonna say healthy, but it’s better, you know? Yeah. It’s better,” Huerta said.

According to the USDA, Florida produces the most sugarcane in the country–more than 17 million tons annually, followed by Louisiana, which produces 13.8 million tons.
So if there is an increase in demand, farmers here are likely to see it. Frischhertz was asked if he’s noticed this.
“ No, no. Our farm has not heard anything from any distributors or beverage manufacturers about trying to increase sugar, by any means,” he said. “For us, it’s business as usual and working hard out in the field to produce the best crop that we possibly can.”
Coca-Cola has stated they plan to release a line of their signature beverage sweetened with sugarcane in the U.S. this fall.
In the meantime, Frischhertz said he’ll watch and wait, see if the demand for sugarcane in soft drinks increases, and plant accordingly.

Kevin Corbin after a Senate committee meeting. (Photo: Lynn Bonner)The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services will slash Medicaid spending by $319 million effective October 1, Secretary Dev Sangvai wrote in a letter to General Assembly leaders Monday.
That reduction — coming in response to a shortfall in the state budget and changes to Medicaid policy in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — means the state will reduce rates by 3% to all medical providers, as well as cuts of 8-10% for inpatient and residential services and 10% for behavioral therapy and analysis for patients with autism.
In the letter obtained by NC Newsline, Sangvai wrote that while NCDHHS requested $819 million for the 2025-26 Medicaid rebase — the state’s calculation of required costs for the Medicaid program, accounting for growth in enrollment, increases in drug prices, and other factors — it was appropriated just $500 million for those purposes, requiring widespread reductions.
“To meet an effective date of October 1, we must begin several administrative steps now, including notifying providers and beneficiaries, updating contracts and systems, and informing our federal partners at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS),” Sangvai wrote. “We have attempted to make these cuts reversible in the event that additional funding is approved. Absent additional appropriations by the General Assembly, however, NCDHHS will proceed with the reductions described herein.”
As part of a stopgap budget signed by Governor Josh Stein on Aug. 6, the General Assembly appropriated $600 million for Medicaid, $500 million of which will go to the rebase and $82 million of which will go to the Medicaid Managed Care Oversight Fund, which Sangvai wrote still has a $33 million deficit. The remaining $18 million will make up for what he called a “missing LME/MCO transfer,” referring to the Local Management Entity/Managed Care Organizations that manage some Medicaid services.
The letter also outlines plans to entirely cease optional coverage for GLP-1s, drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy commonly prescribed for weight loss. GLP-1s will continue to be covered when prescribed for other health issues such as diabetes and heart disease. NCDHHS will also pull funding for the Integrated Care for Kids Pilot, which will end ahead of schedule, a spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement.
Sangvai also indicated administrative cuts ahead, including ending or reducing contracts, letting temporary employees go, and ending some quality control and compliance functions. “These cuts will significantly impair NC Medicaid’s ability to be responsive to emerging needs and inquiries, monitor services for quality and compliance, and continue making timely operational improvements,” he wrote.
“Despite careful efforts to minimize harm, the reductions now required carry serious and far-reaching consequences. Most immediately, reduced rates and the elimination of services could drive providers out of the Medicaid program, threatening access to care for those who need it most,” Sangvai wrote. “NCDHHS remains hopeful that additional appropriations can be made to prevent these reductions.”
In a statement to NC Newsline, NCDHHS spokesperson Summer Tonizzo wrote that the appropriation shortfall “will result in cuts to services and reductions to provider rates to stay within budget.”
“All Medicaid providers will face a minimum 3% reduction in reimbursement rates, with some services — including physicians, hospice care, behavioral health long-term care, and nursing home services — seeing steeper cuts of 8% and 10%,” Tonizzo wrote. “These reductions may cause some providers to stop accepting Medicaid patients, as the lowered rates could make it financially unsustainable to continue offering care.”
“NCDHHS has attempted to make these cuts reversible in the event that additional funding is approved,” Tonizzo added.

Ron DeSantis speaking at the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Department on Aug. 13, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA – Noting that the Republican primary race for governor is still more than a year away, Gov. Ron DeSantis hesitated to say anything too definitive about the contest to succeed him on Wednesday.
But he did acknowledge that new Lt. Gov. Jay Collins definitely has “the ingredients” to be “a compelling candidate that can grab attention.”
The governor and his newly minted No. 2 in state government made their second appearance in Tampa in as many days on Wednesday, this time holding a press conference at the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Department, where DeSantis hand-delivered $5,000 recruitment bonus checks to more than three dozen Hillsborough County sheriff’s deputies.
After months of speculation, DeSantis on Tuesday formally appointed Collins, a Hillsborough County state senator and retired Army Green Beret, to succeed Jeanette Nuñez as lieutenant governor for the remainder of his second term in office.
However, DeSantis and Collins chose not to answer questions Tuesday. During the question-and-answer session Wednesday, the Phoenix asked the governor if, based on his effusive public praise for Collins over the past 24 hours, he could support him if he runs for governor against Southwest Florida U.S. Rep.Byron Donalds, the early front-runner for the nomination.
DeSantis played down the horse race, saying that there is more a year before the GOP primary, “a lifetime in politics.” But he reiterated that he had confidence Collins could serve as governor “and do it well.”
Tuesday afternoon, DeSantis posted a campaign-style video of Collins produced by a political committee chaired by the new lieutenant governor. During Wednesday’s press conference, the governor said people who previously didn’t know anything about Collins until the previous day or saw the video “were really blown away by his story.”
“I think there’s a lot of people who are like, ‘Man, think this is the type of guy that we need,’” DeSantis said.
“We put out a video to just kind of introduce him to people, and people were like, ‘Man, that’s our guy.” So, he definitely has the ingredients of what it would take to be a compelling candidate that can grab attention, but I know that he’s really interested in moving the ball forward on all of these policies.”
For political observers, it’s been evident for months that DeSantis is interested in backing another Republican to challenge Donalds, who has already been endorsed by Donald Trump and has raised more than $22 million so far for his 2026 gubernatorial campaign.
It was previously believed that alternative candidate could be First Lady Casey DeSantis, who attended Tuesday’s press conference introducing Collins but did not speak publicly.
What about Casey DeSantis?
A reporter asked the governor if his selection of Collins for lieutenant governor and enthusiastic public support for him means Casey DeSantis is no longer considering a candidacy for governor. DeSantis insisted that any focus on the First Lady for the race was coming from outside forces, and not from her.
“I think from the beginning until now it’s always been a lot of people are like, ‘Can you get her to do it? Can you get her to do it?’ kind of deal. She just wants the state to do well,” he said.
“She was really excited and inspired with what we saw yesterday, when Jay was announced, so she’s going to be serving, continuing to help make a difference one way or another,” he said. “The thought around her has been more exterior with people telling her that she has to do all of those things.”

“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.

In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.

‘The world has changed’

While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.

State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.










Everybody understands what’s at stake now.


– Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in New York City whose research focuses on gender and sexuality


Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”

Free speech argument

Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.

A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.

A Republican loss

In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

(Natalie Behring/Getty Images)As conservative lawmakers work to restrict online access to abortion medication, a new report shows how popular it has become for women who live in states that have outlawed abortion.
Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin led a team that analyzed 15 months of prescription data from Aid Access, one of the largest online abortion telemedicine providers.
They found 84% of Aid Access’s more than 118,000 online prescriptions went to patients living in abortion-ban states.
The South and Midwest had the highest rates of patients accessing telemedicine abortion. Rates were also greater in high-poverty areas or where people would have to travel more than 100 miles to reach an abortion clinic, according to the report, which published this month.
Aid Access is able to mail abortion medications to residents in all 50 states — even those in states with abortion bans — thanks to shield laws in Democratic-led states. Shield laws are designed to minimize the legal risks for people who provide or access abortions across state lines.
Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have reproductive care shield laws, either through legislation or by executive order, according to a report from University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
Eight of those states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — specifically protect telehealth abortion providers regardless of where their patient is located.
Expecting challenges, blue states vow to create ‘firewall’ of abortion protections

Shield laws, along with difficulty accessing in-person abortion services in abortion-ban states, have contributed to a rise in medication and telehealth abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, clearing the way for state bans. With telehealth abortion, patients have a virtual appointment with a clinician who can prescribe abortion medication, which is then filled by a licensed pharmacy and mailed to the patient.
Research has shown telehealth medication abortion is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
But as abortion medication use rises, so have conservative efforts to ban it.
This year, more than a dozen states introduced bills to bar access to medication abortion by criminalizing its sale, purchase or distribution, according to Guttmacher.
One such bill in Texas, which could have been a blueprint for medication abortion restriction in other states, was specifically aimed at groups like Aid Access. It would have allowed private citizens to sue for at least $100,000 anyone who provided abortion pills in Texas. The bill passed the Texas Senate but died in the House in May.
Earlier this year, the state of Louisiana criminally charged a New York physician under its abortion ban law for allegedly providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teen via telehealth. New York, which passed a shield law in 2023, refused Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor.
Last month marked the first federal test of shield laws, when a Texas man sued a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to his partner.
This week, a Texas woman filed a federal lawsuit against Aid Access and against a man who she said impregnated her, then spiked her drink with abortion pills. She is also suing the Dutch doctor who founded Aid Access, alleging Aid Access and its founder mailed abortion-inducing drugs in violation of Texas and federal law.

A press release from UM Health-Sparrow states that analyzing the results on-site will provide for shorter turnaround times, which allows patients to be treated in a more timely manner, helping to reduce further spread. The health system calls the advancement the latest installment in a “longstanding legacy of innovation.”
Similar to the COVID-19 and flu tests, the measles test is conducted via nasal swab and is ordered by a physician. Testing is available for inpatients in the hospital or outpatients in their vehicles.
The advancement comes as measles cases across the country are at their highest level in three decades. Eight months into the year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 1,319 confirmed cases of measles nationwide– a significant increase from 285 cases over the entirety of 2024. Michigan is among the 40 states to have reported measles cases. 
27 measles cases have been reported across nine Michigan counties this year, with three counties experiencing outbreaks that have impacted four or more people.
Per the  Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Measles Dashboard, there are currently no measles cases that are being actively monitored. However, as UM Health-Sparrow laboratories director Jon Baker noted, “measles is not going to go away and we’re going to see future outbreaks.”
This innovative testing, he added, “was part of making sure that we were prepared for that.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Ilona Biliaze refreshed a government website on her phone in late July, checking for updates on her immigration case again and again.
Biliaze, her husband and two teenage children are displaced Ukrainians living in Watertown under a temporary legal status known as humanitarian parole after they fled the Russian invasion in 2022. She watched as the updates changed: Their decision was a month away. Then it was three weeks, then two months, then three months.
Watching the time grow was defeating, after she’d done everything she could think of to keep her family in their home. They were denied asylum, another temporary legal status; they shared their story to local news outlets and on social media; they tried reaching out to their congressional delegates. Their parole status was scheduled to expire Aug. 17. 
‘This is our home’: Ukrainians settled in SD fear they’ll be forced to leave

She applied for the parole extension in June, and the office of U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, helped the family seek an expedited extension after they called his office in July. But the wait time on a decision kept increasing.
“I felt so bad,” Biliaze said. “It was too long, too late.”
Then, on July 28, it changed: Case approved.
She called her husband and sponsor family to share the news. Her sponsor, Susan Buhler, started crying on the phone, relieved her adopted family could stay. They shared hugs in the Biliazes’ driveway and marveled over the phone screen. The official documents arrived in the mail last week.
The two parents and their teenage children can live and work in the United States through August 2027. Their 10-month-old son is an American citizen, because he was born in Watertown.
“We feel safe here. This is our home,” Biliaze said.
The Biliazes are among 117,000 Ukrainians who came to the United States through Uniting for Ukraine (U4U). The humanitarian parole program is carried out under the U.S. Homeland Security secretary’s authority to allow noncitizens into the country with a sponsor on a temporary, case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons.

Johnson told South Dakota Searchlight his office was able to help by walking the Biliazes through the paperwork and flagging it for federal workers to understand its urgency.
“Most South Dakotans understand how important it is that when people are here legally, fleeing terrible, dangerous situations, that we have legal mechanisms to remain until they can safely return home,” Johnson said.
Johnson’s office has worked on 535 constituent cases so far this year, ranging from the Biliazes’ immigration case to helping other South Dakotans navigate the Interval Revenue Service, Social Security and Veterans Affairs. Fifty-three cases involved the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
South Dakota’s lone U.S. representative said that many Americans believe their congressional delegates only engage in political work, but constituent casework is where “nonpartisanship still reigns.” 
“That’s our job: We’re supposed to advocate for South Dakotans, and that’s what we do,” Johnson said.
The Biliazes hope to make South Dakota their home permanently and plan to apply for green cards, realizing how fast two years pass by. Congress has not offered a special pathway to legal permanent residency specifically for Ukrainian parolees, like the one for Cubans.
Johnson said opening up a citizenship pathway for families like the Biliazes or those on other temporary visa programs would be politically difficult, but possible.
“When the southern border was in crisis, there was a limited appetite in Washington to talk about more legal pathways to residency in America,” Johnson said. “Now that we’ve regained operational control, there’s more of an opportunity to have those conversations.”

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)West Virginia Board of Education President Paul Hardesty on Wednesday doubled down on the board’s prior guidance that public schools should continue to require students to adhere to the state’s strict vaccination requirements, despite Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s executive order and a Raleigh County court’s ruling upholding religious exemptions.  
Hardesty said the board’s conflict with Morrisey’s order would be resolved in court, but the board stopped short of voting to appeal Judge Michael Froble’s ruling last month that three plaintiffs in a lawsuit be preliminarily allowed to attend class there with a religious exemption.
“We’re not going to comply with an executive order that’s in conflict with the 1937 law,” he said. “We can’t do that. We’ve been advised by our counsel not to do that. I don’t want you to think for a minute we’re trying to inconvenience the people of West Virginia. We’re just trying to do our job.”
Hardesty said he takes offense to Morrisey’s characterization of the board as unelected bureaucrats, a comment Morrisey made during a June press conference. 
Taking a jab at Morrisey, Hardesty called on schools in every county in the state to teach a unit on the three branches of government.
“There’s a checks and balances system in our government,” Hardesty said. “There’s three branches of government. They perform three different functions. I hate it for the people of West Virginia that this issue is not decided before school started. I wish it was, but I don’t control the schedule or the time frame of the judiciary. It takes time. This issue will be decided in the proper venue by the proper people, and we’ll get a decision one way or the other, up or down, and we will comply with that decision.”
In a filing Tuesday, Froble scheduled a hearing for a permanent injunction in the lawsuit for Sept. 10 and 11, beginning at 9 a.m. both days. 
West Virginia school start dates vary by county, but at least three school districts started the new school year on Wednesday. 
The school board also voted to have its attorney send a letter to the state’s charter school board to ensure that it’s in compliance with state law and not accepting religious exemptions for school required vaccinations. The West Virginia Professional Charter Schools Board earlier this month voted that executive director James Paul should communicate to the state’s seven charter schools that they should accept religious vaccination waivers obtained through the state health department.
Morrisey issued the executive order on his second day in office in January. The order is based on the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act, which prohibits government action that substantially burdens a person’s exercise of religion.
Morrisey argues that the state’s vaccine laws taken together with the 2023 law require the state to allow religious exemptions. 
West Virginia has been one of only five states in the country that do not allow students to skip the shots based on their religious beliefs about them. State law allows only medical exemptions. The Legislature earlier this year voted down Senate Bill 460, which would have set the religious exemptions into state code. 
The school board earlier this year voted to direct county boards of education not to comply with Morrisey’s order allowing religious exemptions.
In a statement posted to the social media platform X on Wednesday, Morrisey promised that families who want religious exemptions would ultimately win, either in court or through legislative action. 
“Hold strong,” Morrisey said. “I recognize that the Board [of education] is creating hardships for families but we will keep pushing.  
“Religious freedom is a cornerstone of our constitutional system and required under state law — we will eventually defeat this politically unaccountable board,” he said. “Nine year board terms are too long and need to be reconsidered.”

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)As Texas Republicans redraw the state’s congressional map to their advantage and prompt other states to consider rare mid-decade redistricting attempts, two Coloradans want the governor to have emergency authority to alter Colorado’s districts to restore partisan balance in Congress.
Legislative Council Staff received an initiative filing about emergency congressional redistricting on Monday, filed by Brandon Cary and Jorge Rodriguez. The proposed constitutional amendment, which would be on the 2026 ballot if it clears the procedural gauntlet of approval, would allow the governor to suspend the state’s independent redistricting commission and appoint a temporary body to redraw congressional districts to respond to any “national redistricting imbalances.”
“Texas is taking direct orders from the (U.S Department of Justice) and the current White House administration to do this redistricting,” Cary, who lives in Wheat Ridge, wrote in an email to Colorado Newsline. “Other states can counterbalance their efforts, and in the event nothing goes farther, legislation like what we are putting forth will only be a tool of preparedness that will hopefully not have to be used.”

Texas Republicans began supporting the idea of new political boundaries in July after President Donald Trump pushed state lawmakers to tweak districts to pick up more GOP seats in Congress. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott put redistricting on a special session agenda that also includes relief for recent floods, and the state Senate approved new congressional lines on Tuesday. Texas House Democrats left the state to deny that chamber a quorum to also approve the maps.
The move has prompted leaders in other states, including Democratic-led California, with its 52 districts, to push for redistricting to offset the Republican advantage created in Texas.
Typically, states redistrict every 10 years using fresh census data.










Trigger laws have use in our federalized system, and this law will coexist with Colorado's independent redistricting panel in an emergency capacity to be used sparingly and only when necessary in response to overreach from other states.


– Brandon Cary, proponent of redistricting amendment


The proposed law in Colorado would be triggered if “substantial evidence exists that one or more states have enacted congressional redistricting plans that result in severe partisan imbalance,” according to the initiative text. The governor could declare emergency authority or a majority of the Legislature could enact it.
“Trigger laws have use in our federalized system, and this law will coexist with Colorado’s independent redistricting panel in an emergency capacity to be used sparingly and only when necessary in response to overreach from other states,” Cary wrote.
Colorado’s independent, nonpartisan redistricting commissions — one for congressional districts, one for state legislative districts — were formed by two constitutional amendments in 2018. They drew their first maps in 2021. Seven other states have independent commissions. The majority of states empower their Legislature, and therefore the political party in charge, to draw and approve maps.
Colorado currently has four U.S. House districts represented by Democrats and four represented by Republicans.
The idea for the initiative grew from an informal Reddit chat thread, Cary and Rodriguez said, and there is now a group chat of supporters.
“The amount of interest and encouragement we’ve gotten, even without much formal political or organizing experience, is honestly astounding. We know this is going to be a long process,” Rodriguez, who lives in Loveland, said.
The two said they have not connected with any state lawmakers about about running a bill to refer the measure to next year’s ballot, an alternative method of proposing the amendment to voters.
The initiative has a review and comment hearing from legislative staff later this month. Then, it will head to the state’s Title Board to be considered for a title. Backers would then need to get approved for a petition and gather about 125,000 signatures, from at least 2% of registered voters in each of the state’s 35 state Senate districts, to land on the ballot. Constitutional amendments then need 55% approval to pass.

(Andy Bosselman for Newsline)State regulators in Colorado have chosen 142 older, low-producing oil and gas wells to be permanently plugged, funded by well operator fees and federal grant money. The voluntary well plugging program is part of the state’s effort to reduce methane emissions, which are a major contributor to climate change.
These low-producing wells, called marginal wells, emit disproportionately high amounts of methane compared to their oil and gas production rates. Marginal wells are also at a high risk of becoming so-called orphan wells, wells that become wards of the state after they are abandoned by extraction companies.
“Plugging wells and preventing orphan wells is an important way to reduce pollution, improve Colorado’s air quality and make communities safer,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. “Improving air quality helps keep Coloradans and our communities active and healthy, strengthening our high quality of life. Plugging these wells will directly help lower emissions and reduce risks.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Funding to plug the wells comes from two pots: the federal Methane Emissions Reduction Program, which was established by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 and awarded $12.6 million to Colorado, and the state Orphan Wells Mitigation Enterprise, which collects about $5 million in fees annually from well operators.
The state estimates that plugging the 142 wells will cost up to about $14 million. No state taxpayer money is used for the program.
There are far more marginal wells than those set to be plugged. In Colorado, 922 wells meet state plugging grant eligibility requirements and 8,566 wells meet federal plugging grant eligibility requirements. There are approximately 47,000 oil and gas wells in Colorado.











If these wells are running dry, they should be plugged, rather than keep letting them spew pollution ... It’s important for our communities.


– Heidi Leathwood, a climate policy analyst at the environmental nonprofit 350 Colorado


Heidi Leathwood, a climate policy analyst at the environmental nonprofit 350 Colorado, called for continued and expanded operator fees at the state level to plug marginal wells.
“If these wells are running dry, they should be plugged, rather than keep letting them spew pollution,” Leathwood said. “It’s important for our communities.”
Beyond the contributions to climate change from oil and gas extraction, Leathwood also shared her concerns about health problems, including cancers, heart problems and birth defects, that studies have shown can arise in communities near wells.
“We need to start preparing, and not even for what’s coming in the future, but for the wells that we have right now that need plugging, and we just don’t have enough money set aside,” she said.
The oil and gas industry accounts for 60% of Colorado’s methane emissions, according to a 2024 state report.
The 142 wells were chosen based on “methane emissions, proximity to disproportionately impacted communities or municipalities, and financial assurance plans,” according to the state’s Energy and Carbon Management Commission.
The federal Republican tax break and spending cut law that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 rescinded any remaining un-obligated federal funding that was part of the Methane Emissions Reduction Program.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)ST. PETERSBURG — State-appointed auditors came to St. Petersburg Wednesday to begin two days reviewing spending by Mayor Ken Welch and the majority Democratic-led City Council.
Confronting them was a group of local residents in front of City Hall who declared they didn’t trust what the DeSantis administration says is the motivation for looking into local government spending.
Mimicking the federal initiative led by Elon Musk in the first months of the second Trump administration, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis introduced Florida’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) earlier this year, describing it as an effort to eliminate waste within state  government, save taxpayers money, and ensure accountability.
But it’s been turbocharged into a higher gear, looking at municipal and county government spending, ever since DeSantis appointed former GOP state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia as chief financial officer last month.
“Look, all of this is … because property taxes have been skyrocketing here in the state of Florida,” Ingoglia told reporters inside St. Petersburg City Hall on Wednesday.
But the critics who stood outside in the blazing heat earlier said they weren’t buying it.
“They have no business messing around with our city government,” said St. Pete resident Diane Willis. “They don’t even run our own state government well. I mean, the governor talked about transparency and accountability was the reason for DOGE.
“He should look in his own backyard,” she continued, explicitly naming Hope Florida, the community-based welfare program initiated by First Lady Casey DeSantis that came under fire earlier this year and whose foundation is reportedly being investigated by state prosecutors.
“I think it’s a lie,” added Seminole resident Mary McMullen, who grew up in St. Petersburg, about the stated mission of DOGE to eliminate waste in government spending. “That’s not why they’re here.”
DEI
“Their letter talked about DEI,” McMullen said. “It talked about whether we have electric vehicles. It talked about the environment and that we are having the nerve to get involved in anything that might speak about problems with the environment. So, if they were here for what they say they were here for I’m fine, but that’s not it.”
McMullen was referencing the nine-page letter sent by Florida DOGE to St. Petersburg officials on Aug. 1, which made numerous references to DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) policies adopted in the city in recent years. Auditors also said that they wanted information about policies regarding resiliency and battling climate change, as well as specific purchases or leases of electric vehicles.
That’s a problem, as far as City Council member Brandi Gabbard is concerned.

“Surprisingly and upsettingly, there’s also a lot of questions regarding our resilience work and sustainability work. And we live in a coastal community where we’re incredibly vulnerable. And so to think that those sorts of initiatives could potentially be opposed by our state, to me really doesn’t look like moving forward in a cohesive way to protect the residents that we serve,” she told the Phoenix while walking out of City Hall to observe the protest on Wednesday.
In January 2019, St. Petersburg was selected to participate in the American Cities Climate Challenge, an initiative backed by Bloomberg Philanthropies to tackle climate change and promote a sustainable future. Florida DOGE is now requesting records of “all actions, communications and expenditures to date in support” of that program.
Like most locally elected officials who have been interviewed by the news reporters ahead of planned DOGE visits, Gabbard said she welcomed state officials scrutinizing the city budget, because she believes the council and Welch have been “good stewards” of the public’s money.
“I would push back on any claim that there’s any waste within those tax dollars,” she said. “As far as any savings to be found, if there’s an opportunity to save a single penny that is a taxpayer dollar, we certainly want to look at that, but we are very confident in what we spend our tax dollars on and that is to get the best service that we possibly can for the city of St Petersburg.”
‘A long-term thing’
Florida DOGE’s two-day audit of St. Petersburg’s budget comes two days after a similar inquiry began across the bay with the Hillsborough County Commission. There, Ingoglia promised that this month’s inquiries were not a one-and-done situation.
“We have a lot of work to do with the counties. We have a lot of work to do with the cities. But what I can tell you is that I’m not going away,” he said on Monday. “Cities and counties should not be mistaken that this is a short-term thing. This is a long-term thing.”
During a Tampa press conference, DeSantis appeared surprised when asked about the planned protest against DOGE in St.  Petersburg.
“What are they protesting?” he asked of the photojournalist who posed the question.
“They don’t like DOGE,” the journalist responded.
The governor replied by talking about the rise in property taxes, as he and Ingoglia have been campaigning for a 2026 constitutional amendment that would ask voters to limit taxes on homestead properties. Such an initiative would have to be approved by the Legislature early next year, and there are no specific details about what it would entail at this time.
“The question is, you’ve seen a lot of bloated budgets,” DeSantis said. “Where is that money going to? And they’ll say that it’s for things that we all agree on. Education. Public safety. First responders. But I can tell you, there’s a lot of stuff beyond that that some of these governments are spending these tax dollars on.”
“Do you need to be spending $3 million on DEI consultants?” he said, perhaps in reference to St. Petersburg’s budget. “Would  you rather them spending it on that, or would you rather have property tax cuts?”

According to the most recent published study, 97% of those already meet the exemptions to qualify, according to “Medicaid in Montana,” an annual report that tracks the program’s usage in Montana, funded by the Montana Healthcare Foundation.

The Daily Montanan is launching a series of articles that breaks down some of the biggest changes implemented by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump in the so-called “Big, beautiful bill.”
All four members of Montana’s Congressional delegation — Republicans Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, along with Reps. Troy Downing and Ryan Zinke — voted for these changes. 
Today’s stories are the third installment:
Redetermination redo: New work requirements put in place by the Trump administration and narrowly approved by Congress mean that states will now need more documentation and verification that those receiving Medicaid are eligible because they’re working or meet an exemption. Montana’s history with the “determination” and “redetermination” process means that residents who qualify could be accidentally left without insurance while the state must now be in a state of increased processing and reprocessing. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Reality check: About all those people watching TV. For years, many conservatives, including U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, have claimed legions of people were essentially freeloading off the government, collecting health insurance benefits without work. However, PolitiFact digs into that claim and finds the narrative, while politically satisfying, is a fiction. (Story by PolitiFact and KFF Health News)
Determining difficulties: The “big, beautiful bill” will require those who want Medicaid to undergo a process of determination for eligibility. The work requirements are new for many states, and they’ll require verification and documentation, which will substantially increase the workload for states, leading some to say the process could be too much to handle.

Our previous stories have included:  
Another big change in the Big Sky: Whether you’re one of more than 100,000 people on Medicaid or whether you purchase your health insurance on the marketplace (healthcare.gov), recent federal changes will mean a decrease in people who qualify under expanded Medicaid, as well as hefty health insurance premium hikes from those who purchase a plan. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Is $50 billion enough: Congress has allocated $50 billion to be used for rural state hospitals, which had been identified as particularly vulnerable in the “Big, beautiful” bill. Republicans from rural states demanded the money in exchange for the support, but will the fund be enough? And, what happens after it’s depleted? (Story by Stateline)
Navigators no more: In February, Congress also voted to defund most of the health insurance navigators at the state level. In Montana, 90% of the navigators won’t be available after many of these changes become reality, leaving residents to answer questions on their own, or try their luck accessing one of the few left after the cuts. These navigators helped residents find insurance, understand their eligibility and explain policy differences. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Less leeway: States like Montana had previously come up with their own work eligibility and verification programs. But with the new Trump rules surrounding Medicaid, that means states have less flexibility and fewer resources to navigate the changes (Story by KFF Health News)
 



However, Montana’s experience with the “disenrollment” process is making some wonder if history is about to repeat itself — over and over again.
The concern centers on the amount of work the new legislation requires.
Now, not only are work requirements mandatory for much of Medicaid eligibility, those requirements force a whole new system of verification and paperwork. That paperwork and eligibility has to be documented and reviewed, mostly by state-level workers who “determine” a resident’s eligibility.
Montana’s Medicaid landscape changed dramatically two years ago when the Legislature opted to discontinue a policy of “continuous eligibility,” which ensured that if a person qualified for Medicaid coverage, they remained on it for a year, until it was time to redetermine if the person was still eligible.
As Montana rolled out its new verification and determination process, members of the public, healthcare officials and lawmakers were outraged at the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services. As many as one-third of those enrolled had a lapse in healthcare coverage because of administrative issues, from missing documents to impossibly long wait-times where people would be left stranded on hold for hours. Gradually, as state health department workers worked through redetermining the entire Medicaid population of Montana, which numbered, at the time, more than 120,000, officials caught up.
But now, with new work requirements, new documentation and verification that must happen at least twice a year, providers are worried that people who qualify for Medicaid coverage will lose it due to the same administrative challenges.
“These people if they’re working hard and low income, there is a lot of documentation to it,” said Dr. Aaron Wernham, CEO of Montana Healthcare Foundation. His organization has studied the effects of “redetermination” as it rolled out in Montana, but also spoken with other states.
“Documentation is hard and it requires a lot of the state. Each single case takes time,” Wernham said.
He said work-requirement programs in other states have had mixed results. For example, Wernham said that Georgia has experimented with it.
“It costs an enormous amount of money because of the verification. It’s very expensive,” Wernham said. “If you talk to a lot of clinics, what they’re really worried about is that people will just disappear.”
He said that means that many will likely become overwhelmed or frustrated with the process and just delay seeking medical care.
The Daily Montanan reached out to officials from the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services on several occasions with questions about its capacity and processes given the new federal legislation. No official responded to those requests.
“We saw what happened when the state did it all at once,” said Montana Hospital Association CEO Ed Buttrey. Buttrey was a Republican member of the Montana Legislature through the 2025 session, and many of his colleagues on both sides of the political aisle were frustrated. “It’s not that bad now, but what happens when they start doing this every six months?”
  Another looming reality 

As officials are scrambling to figure out what the new determination and requirements will be for Medicaid going forward, the financial reality in Montana is even more severe, compared with larger or younger states.
“Many of those people are probably expected to drop their coverage before they have been priced out altogether,” said Cynthia Cox, the vice president of KFF Health for ACA Programs. “And those folks, the people who make more than four times poverty are disproportionately older adults, like pre-retirees or early retirees, they’re more likely to live in rural areas and they’re more likely to be small business owners.”
The state’s aging population means more and more healthcare institutions rely on Medicaid or Medicare. But that reliance puts a premium on two other areas — private-pay insurance or strictly managing “uncompensated,” or “charity” care, where a healthcare system doesn’t receive a full payment or any payment for services it provides.
Because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid have lower reimbursement rates for doctors and hospitals, private insurance plans usually wind up subsidizing Medicare and Medicaid patients. However, because the state has such a high percentage of people who utilize the federal programs, the number of people considering not having health insurance is sky rocketing.
Cynthia Cox, the Vice President of KFF’s Program on the ACA, said the reality will begin in January, and once it begins, it will be a difficult trend to reverse.
“The Congressional Budget Office expect that eventually, 4 million people will become uninsured due to the expiration of these enhanced premium tax credits,” Cox said. “I would expect that to play out with a big drop in coverage Jan. 1 or so and then over a longer period of time, eventually adding up to 4 million. That’s going to happen in less than six months.”
That means there could be a resurgence of uncompensated care, which could lead to hospital closures. Nearly half of Montana is covered by either Medicaid or Medicare. According to the Montana Health Foundation, 22% of the state has Medicaid, while the federal government reports 20% are on Medicare.
“We have a handful of hospitals that are over 50% Medicaid and so even small shifts in revenue streams could be really detrimental,” said Katy Mack, the vice president of the Montana Hospital Association.
Some rural hospital margins are lower than one-half of one percent.
“We just don’t have the wiggle room to treat a patient without pay,” she said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-940167624-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 15:57:08.707449

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)States must begin verifying millions of Medicaid enrollees’ monthly work status by the end of next year — a task some critics say states will have a hard time carrying out.
A provision in the tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law July 4 will require the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are volunteering or working at least 80 hours a month or attending school at least half time.
The new law provides states $200 million for fiscal year 2026 to get their systems up and running. But some experts say states will have difficulty meeting the deadline with that funding and worry enrollees might lose their health benefits as a result.
A year and a half to comply is likely not going to be enough time for most states, especially since the federal government must craft guidance on how they should implement their programs, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He predicted it will be difficult to create technology simple enough — such as a phone app — to streamline the process for all enrollees.
“Two hundred million [dollars] is not going to cover the 40 expansion states that we have,” he told Stateline. “There is not a silver bullet here, and there isn’t a single app out there that’s going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That’s just not realistic.”
 

A spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Hannah Jones, told Stateline that “it will take a significant amount of time and investment in order to implement work requirements.”
Jones said an estimated 255,000 people in North Carolina could lose coverage because of these requirements and their “administrative burden.”
“More automation reduces manual work on beneficiaries and eligibility case workers, but it requires more time, funding, and staff resources to implement,” Jones wrote in an email.
Emma Herrock, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Health, wrote in an email that the vast majority of the state’s Medicaid enrollees already work, and the agency expects few people to be disenrolled. Herrock said the department will establish work verification systems by the end of 2026.
“The department is taking a thoughtful approach to implementation,” Herrock wrote. “We are already working with several Louisiana agencies … in order to receive data on recipients who are working.”
She added that the department views work requirements “as a means to grow our economy, while reinforcing the value of work and self-sufficiency.”
In New York, it could cost the state $500 million to administer the new requirements, New York Department of Health spokesperson Danielle De Souza wrote in an email.
Between 600,000 and 1.1 million individuals who are eligible for and enrolled in Medicaid could potentially lose coverage because of work reporting requirements, she wrote, based on what happened when states were required to resume checking eligibility after the COVID-19 health emergency ended.
“The department will remain steadfast in its commitment to protecting the health of all New Yorkers and will work to mitigate the impacts of this law,” De Souza wrote.
The new rules apply to states that expanded Medicaid to adults between the ages of 19 and 64 with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty line (about $22,000 for an individual), an option that was made available under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. More than 20 million people were enrolled through Medicaid expansion as of June 2024 — those are the patients who will face work requirements.



There isn’t a single app out there that’s going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That’s just not realistic.


– Dr. Benjamin Sommers, health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health


Reapplying for Medicaid, which typically has been required once a year, already is burdensome for some patients, said Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association.
“On top of that, now we’re going to be challenging so many people who were at least able to deal with it financially with things like … proving that they got a job,” Mukkamala said in an interview.
Previous attempts at implementing work requirements have ended up costing states millions in administrative and consulting fees. And in some cases, people who were eligible for Medicaid lost their coverage due to paperwork issues.
  Arkansas’ example 

Several states wanted to implement work requirements during the first Trump administration. But only Arkansas fully did so, in 2018, before a federal judge halted the requirements. More than 18,000 Arkansas residents lost Medicaid coverage during the 10 months the requirements were in effect.
 

Sommers, of Harvard, noted that most people were disenrolled because they didn’t know about the policy or made paperwork errors, not because they weren’t working.
“Red tape led to people losing their coverage,” he said. “They had more trouble affording their medications. They were putting off needed care.”
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that advises congressional Republicans, said he thinks concerns about the new requirements are overblown because there’s more advanced technology now.
“Lots of government programs have initial implementation challenges,” Blase told Stateline. “Arkansas was seven years ago, and if you just think about the change in the technological advancements over the past seven years … we didn’t have artificial intelligence and just the ability of modern tech.”
As it stands, each state has varying technological capabilities, and will have a different timeline and budget, said Michael Heifetz, a managing director at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal and a former Medicaid director in Wisconsin. His team contracts with states to implement Medicaid, including work requirements, and other programs.
He also noted that the Trump administration can give states a deadline extension on implementing work requirements to Dec. 31, 2028, if they show they are making a “good faith effort.” States will need to share data across agencies in new ways, he said.
“It will require some form of data sharing and communications with educational agencies, workforce training agencies and some other agencies that typically aren’t in the Medicaid ecosystem,” Heifetz said.
State governments may resist hiring full-time positions for those tasks, he said, but “artificial intelligence and other tools can help work through these processes in a smoother fashion.”
  Other state efforts 

Efforts in other states to implement work requirements have had mixed results.
In Georgia, for example, an experimental work requirement program cost taxpayers more than $86 million in its first 18 months but enrolled just 6,500 people during that time, according to an investigation by ProPublica and The Current published in February. That’s 75% fewer participants than the state had estimated for the program’s first year.
States that enshrined Medicaid expansion in their constitutions could be in a bind

The nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2019 looked at five states that tested systems to track Medicaid work requirements under the first Trump administration. Those demonstration projects were rescinded during the Biden administration.
The states estimated their projected administrative costs for implementing work requirements for one to three years, and the total far surpassed the $200 million Congress has provided in the new law. Kentucky alone estimated $270 million, Wisconsin $70 million, Indiana $35 million, Arkansas $26 million and New Hampshire $6 million.
Susan Barnidge, an assistant director on the GAO health care team and an author of the report, said the agency found that across states there wasn’t much federal oversight of administrative costs on test programs. Oversight will be key as states roll out their work requirement systems, she said.
“We found some weaknesses in [federal] Centers for Medicare & Medicaid oversight of certain federal funding for certain administrative activities. So we found examples of things that states sought federal funding for that didn’t appear to be allowable,” Barnidge said in an interview. “I think that will remain relevant.”
Mukkamala, of the American Medical Association, said the burden will in some ways fall to doctors’ offices to help keep patients enrolled, as they work with patients to check eligibility and possibly help get them on Medicaid. He works in Flint, Michigan, as an otolaryngologist, or ear, nose and throat doctor, and said a third of his patients are on Medicaid.
“As if it’s easy to take care of their health care issue, given things like prior authorization,” Mukkamala told Stateline. “Now to add to the challenge, we have to figure out how to get them covered.”

That’s Unsupported
“Almost 5 million able-bodied Medicaid recipients ‘simply choose not to work’ and ‘spend six hours a day socializing and watching television.’”
Scott Jennings on “CNN NewsNight with Abby Phillip” on July 1
Republicans defended the GOP megabill’s Medicaid changes as targeting a group of people they believe shouldn’t qualify: People who can work but instead choose to stay home and chill.
Several Republican politicians and pundits, including CNN senior political commentator Scott Jennings, pegged that group’s size at about 5 million people.
“There are like almost 5 million able-bodied people on Medicaid who simply choose not to work,” Jennings said July 1 on “CNN NewsNight with Abby Phillip.” “They spend six hours a day socializing and watching television. And if you can’t get off grandma’s couch and work, I don’t want to pay for your welfare.”
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz picked up on some of these points during a July 14 appearance on Fox News. “When the program was created 60 years ago, it never dawned on anyone that you would take able-bodied individuals who could work and put them on Medicaid. Today the average able-bodied person on Medicaid who doesn’t work, they watch 6.1 hours of television or just hang out,” Oz said.
The same talking points were picked up nearly verbatim by Montana’s senior Republican Sen. Steve Daines, who repeated the assertion on Fox News:

“The bottom line is this, Republicans are trying to save Medicaid. We want to strengthen Medicaid, while the Democrats are trying to drain Medicaid. So the reforms that we are proposing, what you just described there in the so-called provider tax, that’s just a scheme that are used by the states to actually get more dollars than the federal government. This is one of the fastest growing entitlements currently in federal spending. It’s designed to protect those who are most vulnerable. It’s an important safety net, but we’ve got to reform Medicaid if we’re going to save Medicaid. We’ve got to take able -bodied males who are laying on the couches at home and get them back to work and off of Medicaid. Put a work requirement in and the reforms we have made we think are reasonable and it’s, again, the way we save this very important safety net.“ 
 
Medicaid is a federal-state health insurance program that covers medical care for lower-income people.
Jennings cited two pieces of data: An estimate of how many fewer people would have coverage because of the work requirement and an analysis of how nonworking Medicaid recipients spend their time. But he made assumptions that the data doesn’t support.
  Jennings Misrepresents CBO Estimate 

The 4.8 million figure stems from a June 24 Congressional Budget Office analysis of a preliminary House version of the massive tax and spending package. The office, Congress’ nonpartisan research arm, projected that provisions of the bill would cause 7.8 million fewer people to have health coverage by 2034. They would include 4.8 million people previously eligible for Medicaid described as “able-bodied” adults 19 to 64 years old who have no dependents and who “do not meet the community engagement requirement” of doing “work-related activities” at least 80 hours a month.
Apart from working, doing community service and attending school also fulfill the community engagement requirement.
Jennings paired that statistic with a separate analysis of how nondisabled adult Medicaid recipients without dependent children spend their time.
But the CBO estimate was a projection — it doesn’t represent the current number of nondisabled Medicaid recipients, nor does it say 4.8 million people in this group “choose not to work.” The figure represented how many fewer people would have coverage because of the bill’s community engagement requirement.
“The challenge with Jennings’ comments — and they’ve been echoed elsewhere by elected Republicans — is that CBO never said that 4.8 million people were out of compliance with the proposed work requirements; they said that 4.8 million people would lose coverage because of the work requirements,” said Adrianna McIntyre, an assistant professor of health policy and politics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Among the Medicaid expansion population, the law requires most adults without dependent children and parents of children older than 13 to work or participate in other qualifying activities 80 hours every month. States will need to verify that applicants met the work requirement for one to three months before they applied. States will also be required to verify that existing enrollees met the work requirement for at least a month between eligibility determinations, which will be required at least twice a year.
Research into Medicaid work requirements imposed at the state level has shown that people found it difficult to fulfill them and submit documentation, contributing to coverage losses.
In Arkansas, which added a work requirement to Medicaid in 2018, a study based on nearly 6,000 respondents found that about 95% of the target population were already working or qualified for an exemption, but a third of them did not hear about the work requirements. As a result, nearly 17,000 Medicaid recipients subject to work requirements lost coverage.
KFF found that adults ages 50 to 64 are more at risk of losing Medicaid coverage because of the new work requirements. More than 1 in 10 in that age group said they had retired, and among them, 28% reported being disabled, said KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Benjamin Sommers, a health care economics professor at the Harvard Chan school, said many of the 4.8 million “able-bodied” people in the CBO estimate “will actually be engaged in the activities they are supposed to be doing, and lose coverage because they are not able to navigate the reporting requirements with the state and lose coverage from red tape.”
  When Recipients Don’t Work, It’s Rarely From Lack of Interest 

There is no universal definition for “able-bodied”; disability can be assessed in different ways. But other studies offer much smaller estimates than 4.8 million Medicaid recipients without dependents who can work but choose not to.
Millions of working-age, nondisabled adults joined the Medicaid ranks in states that expanded eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. There were about 34 million working-age nondisabled Medicaid enrollees in 2024, according to the CBO, 15 million of whom enrolled through the ACA.
A KFF analysis found a smaller figure of 26 million Medicaid-covered adults, ages 19 to 64, who don’t receive Supplemental Security Income, Social Security Disability Insurance, or Medicare benefits.
Among this group, KFF estimated, 64% were working either full time or part time. The reasons the rest were not working included caregiving (12%); illness or disability (10%); retirement, inability to find work, or other reason (8%); and school attendance (7%).
Few people cited lack of interest in working as the reason for their unemployment. An Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents who neither worked nor attended school — or 300,000 people out of a projected 15 million subject to work requirements — cited a lack of interest in working as the reason they were unemployed.
This was consistent with the Brookings Institution’s June 5 analysis that found that, of 4.3 million adult enrollees who worked fewer than 80 hours a month and did not have any activity limitations or illnesses, about 300,000 reported that they “did not work because they did not want to.”
  Mostly Women, Mostly With a High School Degree or Less 

When Republicans have described nondisabled adult Medicaid recipients, they have often portrayed them as men in their 30s “playing video games” in their parents’ basement or who “smoke weed all day.” Research paints a different picture.
Jane Tavares and Marc Cohen, of the University of Massachusetts-Boston Gerontology Department, researched Medicaid recipients who are not disabled or working, have no dependent children under 18, and are not in school. They cited 2023 census data from the American Community Survey.
They found:

The average age of this population is 41, and 26% are older than 50.
Almost 80% are female.
Most, 80%, have a high school education or less.
Their median individual income is $0, and their median household income is $44,800.
About 56% worked in the past five years, and 23% worked in the prior year. About 30% are looking or available for work.

“They are not healthy young adults just hanging out,” the authors, along with health law experts Sara Rosenbaum and Alison Barkoff, wrote April 30.
“It’s clear based on their prior work history and family size/income that they are exceptionally poor and have likely left the workforce to care for adult children or older adults,” Tavares told PolitiFact. “Even if these individuals could work, they would have very few job opportunities and it would come at the cost of the people they are providing care for.”
  AEI Study Not Definitively Linked to CBO Estimate 

On the social platform X, Jennings posted the CBO letter and a May 29 analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, about “how nondisabled Medicaid recipients without children spend their time.” PolitiFact contacted CNN to reach Jennings but did not receive a reply.
The author of that study, American Enterprise Institute senior fellow Kevin Corinth, analyzed survey data and found that Medicaid recipients who do not report working spend on average 6.1 hours a day “on all socializing, relaxing and leisure activities (including television and video games).”
But it’s uncertain whether the people in the survey population he analyzed overlap with the people included in the CBO analysis, said Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of KFF’s Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.
Corinth told PolitiFact “it is difficult to say” how the population he analyzed differs from the CBO’s. Tavares, Cohen, Rosenbaum, and Barkoff said Corinth’s dataset defined disability narrowly, leading to a “serious underestimation of disability” among the population of Medicaid recipients he looked into. It focused on Medicaid recipients who receive Supplemental Security Income or have a health condition that prevents them from working. The researchers said this approach is too narrow because the SSI program accounts for only those “most deeply impoverished adults with severe disabilities.”
The group gave a hypothetical example of a 54-year-old woman with a serious heart condition who can work only a few hours a week. She may not be considered disabled under the SSI program, but she may be limited in the work she can do and may need time to rest.
“Using her ‘leisure time’ to justify a work requirement grossly misrepresents her reality,” the group wrote.
Corinth’s analysis also shows that nonworking Medicaid recipients spend less time socializing, relaxing, or engaged in leisure activities than nonworking people who aren’t covered by Medicaid. Nonworking Medicaid recipients also spend more time looking for work and doing housework and errands, it found.
  Our Ruling 

Jennings said almost 5 million nondisabled Medicaid recipients “simply choose not to work” and “spend six hours a day socializing and watching television.”
The 5 million figure stems from a CBO projection that 4.8 million people would go without coverage by 2034 as a result of not fulfilling the community engagement requirements. It is not descriptive of current enrollees and does not specify that these people choose not to work.
Jennings cited an American Enterprise Institute analysis on how nondisabled Medicaid recipients with no dependents spend their time, but it is uncertain if the population in that analysis overlaps with that in the CBO estimate.
Current snapshots of the population Jennings described produce a smaller number. A survey by the Urban Institute found that 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents who were neither working nor attending school — about 300,000 people — cited a lack of interest in working. Other research has found reasons this group doesn’t work include caregiving, illness or disability, retirement, and inability to find work.
Studies of nonworking Medicaid recipients have found the majority are women and have a high school education or less. Their average age is 41, and more than half have a work history in the past five years.
We rate Jennings’ statement False.

“Idahoans are sick of scammers targeting their families through illegal robocalls,” Labrador said in the release. “We’re putting these telecommunications providers on notice that they must follow federal rules immediately.”
The providers have not complied with Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, rules regarding responding to government traceback requests — in which the origination and delivery of robocalls is traced —  have not registered in the FCC’s Robocall Mitigation Databases, or have not filed a plan to describe how they will reduce illegal robocalls.
“By disregarding these simple rules, these companies are allowing robocallers onto their phone networks and then passing their calls on to other downstream providers until they reach the phones of Idahoans,” the release said.
The task force is also sending letters to 99 “downstream” providers that accept calls from the 37 companies to inform them that they are “doing business with bad actors that are not willing to follow the rules that apply to everyone equally,” the release said. 
Officials from the FCC, in addition to the task force’s work, announced Tuesday that they would remove seven of the 37 providers from the Robocall Mitigation Database, which means that other providers will no longer be allowed to accept and route any calls from their networks.

In 2022, 51 attorneys general joined forces to create the Anti-Robocall Litigation Task Force, which is led by North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, and Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost. The task force investigates and takes legal action against companies responsible for significant volumes of illegal and fraudulent robocall traffic routed into and across the country, the release said. 
In April, Labrador notified nine voice service providers that they may be violating state and federal laws by continuing to route allegedly unlawful robocalls across their networks.

Julio Fuentes. (Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)Self-described conservative business leaders assembled in Tallahassee Wednesday to sound the alarm over the potential loss of federal funds at the end of the year to lower the costs of so-called Obamacare health plans for more than 4.7 million Florida residents.
“I have been around this debate over health care coverage for decades and, while the politics of the ACA [Affordable Care Act] have been heated over the years, there should be a unified political voice in support of the federal marketplace and the premiums assistance in Florida,” said Florida Hospital Association President and CEO Mary Mayhew.
Joining Mayhew were Associated Industries of Florida President and CEO Brewster Bevis; Jonathan Chapman, president and CEO of Florida Association of Community Health Centers; and Julio Fuentes, president and CEO of the Florida Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
 They each stressed the importance of the enhanced premium tax credits and how the state’s economy would suffer if Congress allows them to expire at the end of the year.
“From the Florida business community, the best way to keep us up and running is to have a healthy workforce,” Bevis said. If the enhanced premiums expire, costs would go up for the millions of people who purchase insurance through the federal health care marketplace known as healthcare.gov, he added. 
The cost increases, Bevis said, could lead people to drop their health coverage, which would increase the number of uninsured residents in the state.
That “slows down the employee’s recuperation time, getting healthy again and getting back in the workforce. And like I said, I mean all of these people are part of our family and you care about them,” Bevis said.
Advanced premium tax credits have been available since passage of the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare. During COVID, Congress agreed to make the premium tax credits more generous. Those enhanced credits lower out-of-pocket costs for the coverage and allow people who earn more money to qualify for the subsidies.
They are set to expire at the end of the year. Red Hills Consulting created “Florida Conservatives for Affordable Health Care” to help call attention to the issue. A second press conference will be held in Miami next week, Fuentes told reporters.
Florida Conservatives also has launched a letter-writing campaign to urge members of Congress to keep the enhanced subsidies intact.
Uphill battle

It may prove an uphill battle. Of Florida’s 28 representatives in the U.S. House, 20 are Republicans and eight are Democrats. Florida’s U.S. senators are both Republicans, and senior Sen. Rick Scott, who previously served as governor, ran for that office in 2010 largely on an anti-Obamacare platform. He founded Conservatives for Patients’ Rights in 2009 to oppose Obamcare.
The potential elimination of the enhanced advanced premium tax credits looms as residents face double-digit health insurance premiums next year. Fourteen insurers offering individual health plans proposed double-digit rate increases, a review of insurance rates on a federal website shows.
The rates haven’t been finalized and could change but premium hikes in the coming year are all but guaranteed.
Watch out for double-digit health insurance increases in 2026

Molina Healthcare is proposing a 41% rate change for calendar year 2026, more than any other plan. According to its supporting rate documents the rate would affect up to more than 90,000 members. 
The federal rate review process is expected to be completed by the end of the summer. Open enrollment for 2026 individual coverage under Obamacare begins in the fall.
Insurers blamed rising costs, utilization of services, and the loss of enhanced advanced premium tax benefits as the reasons behind the rate increase, according to KFF, which reviewed the proposed rates.
Carriers also filed proposed rate increases for plans sold to Florida’s small employers for 2026 — those with staffs of 50 or fewer. While less steep than the individual policies, many of the carriers requested double-digit or near double-digit increases. 
Neighborhood Health Partnership requested the highest overall increase for small group plans with a proposed overall 12.78% rate hike, whereas National Health Insurance Co. came in with the smallest proposed rate increase, at 8.38%.
Neither Florida’s top insurance regulator nor the Florida Insurance Consumer Advocate’s office have warned residents of the impending increases.
Mayhew said she’s worried Florida residents aren’t aware of the double-digit health insurance premiums hikes headed their way, or the potential loss of the enhanced premium tax credits.
“We should be educating the population who depend on this and get them engaged in communicating with their members of Congress. This can be fixed. Plenty of issues federally have been up against a sunset and have been extended. This is not difficult. It must be done.”

Conservative judges might allow lawmakers to reinstate the practice of conversion therapy, which aims to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Week after week, a teenage Brandon Long sat through counseling sessions that he said framed his identity as a failure.
Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.

In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
‘The world has changed’
While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.










Everybody understands what’s at stake now.

Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
Free speech argument
Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
A Republican loss
In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-13 19:00:58+00:00,Mississippi Today,Morgan Freeman: Young dreamers in Mississippi should ‘get a book’,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/13/morgan-freeman-young-dreamers-in-mississippi-should-get-a-book/,Award-winning actor Freeman headlined an inaugural fundraising event for the Mississippi Early Learning Alliance.,"Morgan Freeman had a simple message for people attending the Mississippi Early Learning Alliance’s inaugural fundraising luncheon on Tuesday. 
When asked what advice he’d give to an 8-year-old in Mississippi with big dreams, Freeman said just three words: “Get a book.”
Freeman, an Academy Award-winning actor, headlined the “Big Voices for Little Children” fundraiser for the alliance, which is dedicated to improving early learning and child development outcomes. 
More than 200 advocates, politicians and local leaders attended the luncheon, including Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and blues musician Bobby Rush. The event was hosted at the Two Mississippi Museums in downtown Jackson and primarily sponsored by TrueCare, a  nonprofit created by Mississippi hospitals as an alternative to traditional managed care.
The luncheon comes at a critical time for early learning in Mississippi and on the heels of statewide reading gains that have garnered national attention. That wasn’t lost on speakers at the event, including Freeman. 
Executive director Biz Harris opened the fundraiser by underscoring how important successful early education systems are to the state’s success as a whole. 
“Every single day in Mississippi, nearly 100 new babies are born,” she said. “That’s 100 new beginnings — 100 new chances for our state to make the future a little stronger and a little brighter.”
She listed a number of initiatives aimed at improving early learning in Mississippi, including Hosemann’s task force on families and children and the successful passage of a bill that guarantees six weeks of paid parental leave for state employees. 
Harris also detailed her personal struggles with child care — struggles that almost prevented her from accepting her current job. 
Almost a decade ago, she was offered a position by SonEdna, the organization founded by Freeman that helped launch the alliance. It was her dream job, she said, but she couldn’t find child care for her 2-year-old son. After calling every local program, Harris said, she pieced together a child care plan for her son, but it wasn’t ideal. For nine months, her son bounced between programs. 
“He was safe, he was cared for, he was learning, but that constant transition shaped his development and comfort with new situations in ways that we still see him struggle with as a sixth grader,” she said. “I share this because what babies experience in those early years matters so much. It affects their education and their health for the rest of their lives.”
Freeman said his own education in Greenwood influenced his trajectory as an actor and advocate for children’s education, which led to his role as polyester-clad Easy Reader on education children’s television show “The Electric Company” in the 1970s. 
As people ate lunch, Freeman recounted stories from his childhood and shared his love of reading.
“When I was 8 years old and living in Chicago, I had a library card,” he said. “My first book that didn’t have pictures was ‘Black Beauty.’ So there I was, reading, reading, reading. And my penchant for adventure came from those books.”
Freeman regaled the audience with other personal tidbits, too, like his version of a perfect day in Mississippi (“riding horses”) and what kind of student he was in school (“a teacher’s pet”). 
But he kept coming back to reading.
“There are marvelous things in books,” Freeman said. “You can learn anything in the world. … All of the things I’ve done — flying, sailing, acting — are because of books.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/07084921/MorganFreeman212h2.jpg,,,2025-08-13 15:57:08.707449

(Getty Images)The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities on Wednesday approved $100 utility bill credits meant to defray the impact of surging electricity prices.
In a unanimous vote, the regulator’s three board members approved credits that will reduce residential monthly electricity bills by $50 in September and in October, part of state officials’ latest bid to curb energy costs amid summer heat and soaring rates.
“This should be helpful for people, but in no way solves the problem. I hope this helps some people get over the hump. This is a very difficult time,” said Commissioner Zenon Christodoulou.
All residential ratepayers are eligible for the credits, regardless of their income.
Electricity rates have surged nationwide, driven upward in part by artificial intelligence data centers’ mammoth energy demand, while New Jersey’s plans for new renewable generation — chiefly in the form of offshore wind — have largely failed to provide relief.
Wholesale electricity prices rose by roughly 20% in June and are due to rise as much as 5% when the results of a recent price-setting capacity auction take effect in June 2026. Regulators have said they expect prices to rise even further in a capacity auction planned for next July.
The credits will be funded by funds from the solar alternative compliance payment, which is paid by electricity suppliers that are unable to meet the state’s renewables standard, and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which generates funds by auctioning tradeable emissions allowances to fossil fuel plants.
Solar funds, tallied at $263 million Wednesday, would be used before money from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which totaled $123 million Wednesday, Board of Public Utilities staff said.
The credits are part of a plan Gov. Phil Murphy and other state Democrats announced days after higher prices took effect in early June.
That month, the board approved a plan to defer $60 total from electricity bills in July and August, when high temperatures and air conditioning drive power use to a peak. Ratepayers are responsible for repaying those deferred balances, which do not accrue interest or other carrying costs, over the following six months.
“We want to make sure we’re doing everything we can, and we’ll continue to do everything we can with the resources that we have to reduce costs for ratepayers,” said Board of Public Utilities President Christine Guhl-Sadovy.
At the same time, the board approved other programs that extended $175 in bill credits to low-income ratepayers. Those credits are to be applied in equal installments over seven months, from August to February 2026. That benefit was paid last year as a single $175 credit to August utility bills.
Democrats have blamed PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for New Jersey and 12 other states, for recent rate increases, arguing it has been too slow to connect chiefly renewable projects to its grid.
Republicans have blamed Murphy’s renewables-heavy energy goals and the administration’s focus on offshore wind, which has failed to stand up any new generation.
Poll finds NJ is split on who to blame for rising electricity rates

The state’s offshore wind projects appear dead in the water amid opposition from the Trump administration, which has paused or rescinded leases and permits for such projects, and lingering supply chain issues stemming from the pandemic.
The board on Wednesday approved an order terminating a contract with Atlantic Shores for a 1,509-megawatt wind farm off the coast of Atlantic City.
The developer requested that cancellation in June, citing federal uncertainty and the Trump administration’s withdrawal of a Clean Air Act permit needed for construction. The project’s first 762 megawatts of generation were due to come online in September 2027, with the remaining generation expected to start by April 2028.
Atlantic Shores sought to rebid that project, but the utilities board closed its fourth round of offshore wind solicitations without awarding any projects, citing uncertainty at the federal level.
Regulators acknowledged plans for wind generation would have to wait at least a few years. On Wednesday, the board approved an order delaying required in-service dates for offshore wind transmission infrastructure by two-and-a-half years.
Officials said the delay is meant to ease cost pressures by delaying transmission infrastructure investments, which ratepayers fund through their utility bills, without any electricity to bring to shore.
“Obviously, some federal uncertainty has created a situation where we need to make sure we’re acting in a way that we always do — on the best interest of ratepayers,” Guhl-Sadovy said. “This, along with some of the other actions today, are in response to some of those federal decisions around clean energy.”
Those projects, now required to be in service by January 2033, are meant to bring electricity from offshore wind turbines to the coast and prepare the grid for that power.
The order did little to shake environmental groups’ commitment to wind energy.
“Offshore wind is critical to our clean energy portfolio and to protecting our health, environment, and economy. Every delay forces our residents—especially low-income families and communities of color—to breathe dirty air and bear the brunt of climate change. We’ve been knocked down, but we’ll keep getting back up,” said Ed Potosnak, executive director of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
Vermont’s Department for Children and Families has appealed an Aug. 7 Human Services Board decision that found the state had incorrectly enforced the 80-day limit on its motel voucher program.
The citizen panel reversed the department’s denial of emergency housing for petitioner “H.D.,” an individual with a severe medical condition whose name is being withheld, on the basis that they had already exhausted the 80-day maximum outlined in state law. 
In June, local aid providers expressed surprise and dismay at the state’s enforcement of the time limit in relation to Gov. Phil Scott’s March executive order to extend emergency housing for certain medically vulnerable people and children through the end of the fiscal year. On July 1, over 800 people exited from motels across the state. Advocates said a change to the state’s enforcement could mean hundreds without shelter return to emergency housing.
Documents obtained by VTDigger show that Timothy Connors, chief of the state Attorney General’s Agency of Human Services Legal Division, filed an appeal of the Human Services Board’s decision to the Vermont Supreme Court on Monday.

The Attorney General’s office declined to comment, and the Department for Children and Families did not respond to requests for comment.
Vermont Legal Aid, which represented H.D. during their hearing, released a statement last week following the Human Services Board’s decision urging others who were denied emergency housing due to exceeding the 80-day limit to request a hearing of their own. 
Maryellen Griffin, a staff attorney for Vermont Legal Aid, said state law limits the department’s ability to consider past use of the program when reviewing applications.
“It never says anything about going backwards or counting days from fiscal year 2025,” she said. 
The state owes each qualifying applicant 80 days of emergency housing during the current fiscal year by law, Griffin said, within the program’s volume restrictions. As of Aug. 4, of the 1,100 rooms provided by the state, 518 were occupied. 
“Our understanding is that the state plans to force each person to go through an individual appeals process,” she said. 
Griffin said she was aware of her organization’s involvement in roughly 20 active cases of this kind. 
“Our intake is certainly way up just the past couple days,” she said.
Though the actual appeal process may take months, Griffin said hearing officers have sometimes issued “benefits pending appeal,” meaning the person appealing may be granted housing while their case is being adjudicated.
Still, Griffin said the case-by-case approach is a waste of valuable time and resources. 
“I think that it would be much better for the department to simply implement the correct interpretation across the board,” she said.
The ultimate outcome of H.D.’s appeal and related cases will depend on the decision of the Vermont Supreme Court.
If the state’s appeal is rejected, hundreds of people could gain emergency housing through such petitions, according to Brenda Siegel, executive director of End Homelessness Vermont. 
Her organization is working on about 40 ongoing cases related to the issue, she said, adding “that’s just a small fraction of the people who this impacts.”
According to Siegel, some medically vulnerable people who lost housing July 1 have already died, while others have gone without food for long stretches to try and keep a roof over their heads. 
“It’s a big deal,” Siegel said. “This emergency shelter is life-saving.”
A main challenge faced by local aid providers is keeping clients informed of their options, Siegel and Griffin said. 
They said it wasn’t clear that people who used Scott’s extension would have those days counted toward their housing limit later that calendar year. 
Now, they want to ensure unhoused people with children or qualifying medical issues know they may be able to successfully appeal if they have been denied shelter for overstaying the 80-day limit. 
“People living with disabilities who are experiencing homelessness deserve to survive our state’s housing crisis,” Siegel said.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
South Carolinians are renting out their cars. A bill would put ‘guard rails’ on the income booster.

Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars.
With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years.
Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

Joni Ernst has not officially said if she plans to run for reelection in 2026 — but she told a GOP audience Wednesday that Democrats should “bring it on” in the 2026 midterm elections. “Every day we get a new Democratic member of the House or Senate that decides to run for this […],"U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst addressed members of the Westside Conservative Club at the Machine Shed Restaurant in Urbandale Aug. 13, 2025. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst has not officially said if she plans to run for reelection in 2026 — but she told a GOP audience Wednesday that Democrats should “bring it on” in the 2026 midterm elections.
“Every day we get a new Democratic member of the House or Senate that decides to run for this Senate seat — bring it on,” Ernst, a Republican,  said at the Westside Conservative Club in Urbandale. “Bring it on, folks. Because I tell you, at the end of the day, Iowa is going to be red.”
The race for Iowa’s U.S. Senate seat has become a crowded over the past few months. There are five Democrats running to become their party nominee — state Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, who announced his race Tuesday, as well as Iowa Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville; Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City; Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris and former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage. Two Republicans, former state lawmaker Jim Carlin and Joshua Smith, a previous Libertarian candidate, have also announced their campaigns for the seat.

But Ernst, who is serving her second term, has yet to say whether she plans to run for reelection. During her visit to the Iowa State Fair, over the weekend, she told reporters an announcement would be “coming soon.”
Some speculated that Ernst was considering retirement from Congress. While she raised more than her Democratic challengers who had entered the race in the second quarter Federal Election Commission filings, she raised less in the period than she had at this point in her 2020 reelection campaign. Politico also reported in July there were concerns among Senate Republicans that she would not run for reelection, with Senate Majority Leader John Thune telling a reporter he was “doing everything I can to encourage her to run for reelection.”
In recent months, Ernst has faced criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. Her town hall comment in May, “well, we all are going to die,” when responding to a person who shouted to her about Medicaid cuts in the  budget reconciliation bill gained national attention and pushback. Among Republicans, she has been criticized for expressing concerns about U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth during the nomination process, though she voted to confirm him.
Ernst touts cuts in taxes, spending
In addition to talking about the upcoming election season Wednesday, Ernst also celebrated some of the GOP wins since President Donald Trump was elected. Though she did not talk about Medicaid and SNAP provisions in the budget reconciliation law, she said provisions like updated reference prices for farmers and tax exemptions for overtime will help Iowa families, farms and businesses.
She also said the measure will provide “a lot of tax relief for a heck of a lot of people across the United States.”
“Right here in Iowa, if we had not supported the one big beautiful bill, an average household here in Iowa would have seen their tax bill increase by $2,060. $2,060. We avoided that,” Ernst said. “Think about all the Democrats — they voted for a $2,000 tax increase for Iowans, and we’re not going to have that.”
Turek, in an interview Wednesday, said Ernst’s support for measures like the budget reconciliation bill are one of the reason why many Iowans who have previously supported Republicans are looking to Democrats in the upcoming election.
“In the urban areas and in the rural areas, we are getting turnouts like we haven’t seen, with a lot of buyers’ remorse, of people that have said, ‘I voted for Trump, I voted for Ernst, but this is not what I signed up for’ — not for cuts to health care to poor kids and the disabled, not for cuts to food assistance, just to give billionaires tax breaks,” Turek said.
In addition to highlighting tax cuts in the budget reconciliation bill, Ernst said her work to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government has come to pass through the rescissions bill, canceling previously approved federal funding for U.S. Agency for International Development and public broadcasting, as well as through the federal DOGE service.
Ernst said heading into 2025, she met with billionaire Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy as they prepared to lead the Department of Government Efficiency initiative in the Trump administration to discuss areas for savings in the federal government identified through work like her “squeal awards.”
“I was able to present them with an eight-page document that outlined $2 trillion of savings in our federal government,” Ernst said. “Now, trying to get to that $2 trillion mark is pretty darn hard. We’ve got a lot of pushback coming from the Democrats and the unions that exist within federal government. So we’re running into a number of roadblocks, but we will continue to build upon that success.”
Neither Ramaswamy, who is running for Ohio governor, nor Musk is still affiliated with the federal DOGE service, with Ernst lamenting the “big, beautiful breakup” between Trump and Musk. But she said “we still are very committed to DOGE work in the United States Senate and in the House.”
In addition to her statements signaling a campaign announcement, Ernst is scheduled to hold her annual “Roast and Ride” fundraiser Oct. 11, and hired a campaign manager in June.
Ernst said “Republicans are going to rule the day” in the 2026 election cycle, calling for GOP voters to vote and keep Iowa Republicans in power. Iowa has an all-Republican federal delegation, in addition to a GOP trifecta at the Statehouse.
“This is going to be a very big election year for us coming up in this next year,” Ernst told the Westside Conservative Club members. “So I am asking all of you, turn out, turn out, turn out. … After all of those choices have been made through the Republican primary, then we all come together as Iowa and support our Republican candidates, and we turn out in November, and we put the Democrats in their place. Because, let me tell you, I got a lot of years under my belt, and I’ve got a lot of confidence, not just in me, but all of our candidates up and down the ticket.”

Tim Walz on Wednesday announced that Eric Taubel will serve as executive director of the Office of Cannabis Management. He’s been serving in the role in an interim capacity for eight months.
Taubel is overseeing what’s been a sluggish cannabis market rollout after the Legislature legalized adult-use cannabis in 2023. The Office of Cannabis Management is currently issuing licenses to marijuana businesses and, as of Aug. 6, it had issued 10 microbusiness licenses, with nearly 1,100 preliminarily approved. Microbusinesses can grow and sell marijuana products.
Tribal nations including Red Lake and White Earth moved quickly set up their own cannabis operations to serve the new legal market.
Minnesota dispensaries can only sell cannabis grown within the state, so the supply chain will likely take a while to develop, the Star Tribune reported. At a cannabis conference last month, Taubel said that he expects a “more realized model of the market” to take effect in early 2026, the Strib reported.
Taubel previously served as the Office of Cannabis Management’s general counsel and was also general counsel for the Department of Education.
“Under his experienced leadership, I am confident that OCM and the Minnesota cannabis industry will continue to prioritize public health and safety, consumer confidence and market integrity,” Walz said in a statement Wednesday.
Taubel took over from the previous interim OCM director, Charlene Briner.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-13 17:52:59+00:00,CT Mirror,Kosta Diamantis trial witness list includes many former CT officials,Andrew Brown and Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/13/kosta-diamantis-witness-list/,The witness list in Kosta Diamantis' trial on corruption charges includes state employees and people from major CT construction companies.,"The witness lists have been finalized and attorneys are preparing for jury selection in a federal criminal case against Konstantinos Diamantis involving alleged extortion, bribery and fraud within Connecticut school construction projects.
Federal prosecutors filed a list in court this week of more than 40 potential witnesses who could testify in the criminal trial of Diamantis, a former state deputy budget director who is accused of using his position overseeing the state’s school building office to solicit bribes from construction contractors.
That witness list includes several current and former members of Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration, including Josh Geballe, the former commissioner of the state’s Department of Administrative Services, as well as the state employees who worked under Diamantis at the state’s Office of School Construction Grants and Review. 
The list does not name Melissa McCaw, the former secretary of the Office of Policy and Management who moved Diamantis and the school construction grant program from the Department of Administrative Services to OPM, where he became her deputy commissioner.  
When she resigned in February 2022, Lamont and others emphasized that McCaw was leaving voluntarily, not due to the FBI investigation of programs that had been overseen by Diamantis. 
The witness list also includes employees from some of the largest construction and architectural firms in Connecticut, including officials from Arcadis, O&G Industries, Downes Construction, Newfield Construction, Construction Solutions Group and D’Amato Construction.
The high-profile criminal trial, which is currently scheduled to begin on Oct. 6, is likely to dredge up a scandal that shook up the Lamont administration in late 2021 and shadowed the Democratic governor as he campaigned for a second term in 2022.
Lamont removed Diamantis from his post as a deputy budget director shortly after the state received a subpoena from federal prosecutors in 2021 seeking information about Diamantis and a host of projects and companies he was involved with. And Diamantis stepped down from his job overseeing the state’s school construction office shortly after.
Even so, people’s opinions about Lamont and his administration could play a key role in the upcoming trial due to Diamantis’ former position within the highest levels of the state government. 
Diamantis’ defense attorney, Norm Pattis, has asked the federal judge overseeing the trial to allow him to specifically question the potential jurors about their views on Lamont, who is now serving his second term as governor.
“Of course people’s attitude toward the governor might impact whether they can be on the jury,” Pattis said. “At the center of this case are several senior administrative officials.”
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office declined to comment on the upcoming trial. 
Lamont’s office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the proposed witness list. 
Federal prosecutors spent several years investigating Diamantis before he was officially charged in May 2024 with 22 counts of extortion, bribery, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators. 
The charges leveled against Diamantis in the indictment focused almost exclusively on his interactions with two school construction contractors: Acranom Masonry and Construction Advocacy Professionals. Three executives from those companies — Salvatore Monarca, John Duffy and Antonietta Roy — have already pleaded guilty to bribing Diamantis, and all of them are likely to take the stand in the upcoming trial.
The lengthy witness list, however, shows that the trial could delve into far more than the conversations that took place between Diamantis and those three executives. 
The U.S. Attorneys office, for instance, said it could place Diamantis’ daughter, Anastasia, under oath during the trial. According to federal prosecutors, Roy, the owner of Construction Advocacy Professionals, allegedly hired Anastasia Diamantis in return for Kosta Diamantis’ help winning her contracts on school construction projects.
Prosecutors may also call to the witness stand several municipal officials who worked alongside Diamantis. That includes Hartford’s former city engineer, Frank Dellaripa, and Walter Willett, Tolland’s superintendent who publicly accused Diamantis of pressuring town officials to hire specific contractors on the Birch Grove Elementary project.
Meanwhile, Diamantis has announced several prominent witnesses of his own, including former Connecticut State Police Colonel Stavros Mellekas, former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin and Hartford’s former school superintendent Leslie Torres-Rodríguez. 
Pattis said Diamantis is looking forward to the two-week trial and clearing his name.
“Mr. Diamantis has been held hostage by these accusations for a long time,” Pattis said. “The relationships in Hartford are a smoldering dung heap, and we are looking forward to shedding some sunlight and disinfectant on how the state does business.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0228_SR_FederalCourtKosta_068-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 13:57:54.390309

Avelo Airlines does not operate deportation flights out of Connecticut.
The budget carrier’s ICE deportation shuttle contract is based in Mesa, Arizona, under an agreement with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that began in May 2025. None of these flights depart from Connecticut, but the arrangement has prompted local government action. In New Haven, home to Avelo’s East Coast hub at Tweed New Haven Airport, the city has prohibited city employees, grant recipients, and contractors from using public funds to buy tickets from the airline while it continues the ICE charters. 
Several other cities in the region have taken similar steps. Avelo carried 94.64% of Tweed’s commercial passenger traffic between May 2024 and April 2025, compared with Breeze Airways at 5.36%, according to U.S. Department of Transportation data. The airline says the contract helps keep the business financially stable and protects jobs.

This piece of garbage from Blaze News, which is part of right-winger Glenn Beck’s Blaze Media, is an illustration of the moral rot of much of the American information landscape. 
It promises an “exclusive” interview with Vance Boelter, the alleged shooter of the Sen. John Hoffman and Yvette Hoffman and killer of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark.
The publication lends its credibility — yes, a joke to Reformer readers, but an actual thing to Blaze’s millions of readers — to Boelter’s preposterous story, almost entirely unchallenged.
Boelter claims he was at the Hoffmans’ to make a “citizen’s arrest” — right-wingers love this kind of cosplay — that was somehow related to an “investigation” Boelter had been conducting on the COVID-19 vaccines, while working at funeral homes. There’s some more argle-bargle details, but the long and short of it is he admits to shooting the Hoffmans.  
Blaze treats this like an entirely normal claim, that someone without any experience or expertise would use his job at mortuaries to conduct an “investigation” into a widely used vaccine that saved millions of lives. 
The publication doesn’t challenge any of it, except when one of the mortuaries where Boelter worked says, “The assertion in question is wholly unfounded, as no such investigation ever occurred.” 
Notably, a postscript says the quote from Wulff Funeral Home came after publication, probably when the mortuary sent a “WTH?!” email and someone at Blaze was savvy enough to see the risk of a defamation lawsuit and added the quote.
When asked about the Hortman killings, Boelter suddenly clams up and claims he can’t talk because of the ongoing criminal case. (Blaze fails to point out that this makes no sense — why can he talk openly about one criminal case but not the other?) 
Then they let him play to the foolish mythologies of their readership with fictional claims about the COVID vaccines: “I also think about the hundreds of other Minnesota citizens that have died in the last several years that have not been talked about but should have.”
They just let it hang there, giving legitimacy to the nonsense. 
Blaze also fails to mention the lengthy list of targets — Democratic officials and abortion providers — that investigators say was in Boelter’s car. The word abortion never appears in the piece.  
Either Boelter is mentally incompetent or perhaps he is propagating propaganda that will justify and even valorize his evil acts in hopes of persuading one right-wing juror to vote for acquittal. (Or persuading a morally bankrupt president for a pardon.) 
If it’s the former and he’s suffering a psychotic break from reality, quoting him is unethical: You don’t quote someone who is mentally unfit and detached from reality. 
If it’s the latter, you’re participating in his evil charade.
Of course, there’s another possibility: The reporter and editors of Blaze believe Boelter’s claims, that the vaccine is deadly and he was heroically investigating it. 
Which would help us understand the state of right-wing media: So high on their own supply that they’re eagerly willing to give a platform to an accused killer. 
You might be thinking, come on, it’s Blaze. We know what they’re all about. But setting aside their considerable influence — BlazeTV had 450,000 subscribers paying on average $102 a year, Axios reported in 2020 — there’s a lesson here for mainstream media chasing an interview with Boelter or reporting on his now voluminous public comments. 
Even assuming he’s mentally competent, there’s nothing he can say that’s worth printing, unless and until he’s willing to explain who radicalized him — and, thus, who should share in the responsibility for his alleged crimes.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/boelter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 13:57:54.390309

Hill-Lilly was nominated by Gov. Ned Lamont to be DCF Commissioner and underwent confirmation hearings last year. 
Her departure comes at a time when the state is still waiting for another role key to child welfare — leading the state’s office of the child advocate — to be filled. OCA has not seen a permanent replacement since Sarah Eagan resigned more than a year ago.
Hill-Lilly was the second Black commissioner of the agency, following the departure last year of Vannessa Dorantes, who was the first. Hill-Lilly had previously served as deputy commissioner of DCF.
DCF is the agency charged with managing the care of thousands of children who enter the foster system. It also oversees programs that provide mental health care for kids and investigates reports of child abuse and neglect.
“Over the past 18 months, I was reminded daily of the critical role we all play in the lives of children. While there is still much work ahead, I’m proud of the work we have done together in the system,” Hill-Lilly said in a statement. “… As I step into this national role, I do so with hope and urgency, knowing our most vulnerable need us now more than ever. My roots and my heart will always be in the great State of Connecticut.”
In a press release, Lamont praised Hill-Lilly for her work over the past 37 years at DCF, beginning as a case management social worker.
“Jodi is one of the hardest working and most compassionate people I know, and her service to our state has absolutely made a positive impact on the lives of our youngest and most vulnerable residents,” Lamont said in the release. “Jodi truly stands as an example of what it means to serve the public and care about your community and its future, which is why I am not at all surprised that a nationwide child advocacy organization saw her talents and asked her to join their team.”
Hill-Lilly will become the director of the Child Well-Being Program at the Doris Duke Foundation, which works to “build a more creative, equitable and sustainable future by investing in artists and the performing arts, environmental conservation, medical research, child well-being and greater mutual understanding among diverse communities.”
In a statement, the legislature’s Committee on Children co-chair Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, wished Hill-Lilly the best.
“Her national recognition for her detailed, meaningful approach to this work reflects the care and compassion she has shown throughout her time at DCF,” Maher’s statement said.
Ahead of taking on the role of commissioner, Hill-Lilly oversaw the department’s administrative functions such as human resources, the Academy for Workforce Development and fiscal services, among other areas.
She has also served on the faculty for the National Child Welfare Workforce Institute and as vice president of the National Staff Development Training Association. She led DCF’s initiative on racial justice.
During her time as commissioner, Hill-Lilly has said she was focused on mental health services and helping families recover after the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“I will listen, I will learn, I will partner and I will act,” she said during her confirmation process. “My ultimate goal is to continue the great work started and go a little deeper. We will remain responsive to the emergent needs, particularly post-pandemic.”
Under her leadership, DCF has launched enhancements to the Specialized, Trauma-Informed, Treatment, Assessment and Reunification homes, or STTAR homes. The agency announced enhancements to the emergency shelters for kids, including the opening of two new treatment centers, after highly publicized reports of abuse and neglect at one home in Harwinton.
During Hill-Lilly’s tenure, the agency has also launched a new case management software system after years of using an outdated program.
Hill-Lilly is the second DCF commissioner to serve under Lamont’s administration. Her predecessor, Vannessa Dorantes left the agency at the beginning of 2024 after being appointed commissioner in 2019, at the start of Lamont’s first term.

Nessel joined the lawsuit to block the data from being shared, a process that has been preliminarily halted by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
“I am relieved that the Court has recognized that the Trump Administration cannot abandon longstanding policies to personal healthcare data to advance a political agenda,” Nessel said in a statement. “Medicaid exists to serve the needs of some of our most vulnerable residents, not to provide unrelated agencies access to some of our most sensitive information. I will continue to fight to ensure Michiganders’ medical data remains protected and confidential.”
The court said the two federal agencies did not reasonably show its work when deciding to upend longstanding policy that prohibited the health and human services department from sharing information with homeland security for the purpose of immigration enforcement.
In its order, the court also said the agencies failed to consider a limit on the scope of the data provided, and instead moved forward with a plan to provide all private medical data for millions of Medicaid recipients.
The agencies are barred from sharing the data until the lawsuit’s conclusion or 14 days after both departments have completed a reasoned decision making process or rulemaking weighing policy tradeoffs and associated legal decisions.

(Photo by Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder)Public health workers and gun safety advocates gathered at a rally Tuesday night to commemorate last week’s deadly shooting near Emory University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and demand policy changes to prevent future instances of gun violence.
At the entrance to the CDC, members of the community piled flowers, balloons and stuffed animals alongside signs thanking CDC workers and DeKalb County police Officer David Rose, who was killed in the shooting.
Down the street at Emory’s Rollins School of Public Health, leading voices in epidemiology, pediatric health, and violence prevention took the stage in a packed auditorium to describe what they saw as a “culture of misinformation” that contributed to Friday’s attack. The rally was organized by Georgia Majority for Gun Safety and Georgia Clinicians for Gun Safety.
“Georgia is among the bottom third of state gun violence rates in a country that is doing poorly across developed nations,” said Heather Hallett, the founder and director of Georgia Majority for Gun Safety. “So we are really in a unique position in terms of the way gun violence impacts us.”
U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he was “deeply saddened” by the shooting, and visited the CDC campus Monday to meet with agency leadership and survey the damage.
“We are actively supporting CDC staff on the ground and across the agency,” he wrote in a post on X, adding “We honor their service. We stand with them. And we remain united in our mission to protect and improve the health of every American.”
But public health advocates — including former employees of the CDC — point to a rise in public mistrust of vaccines they say is fueled by Kennedy’s rhetoric and policy decisions on vaccines. Earlier this year, he dismissed all 17 members of a key vaccine panel at the CDC and replaced them with a slate of eight hand-picked appointees, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics. The panel later voted to ban thimerosal, a harmless preservative used in a small portion of flu vaccines, in what critics say is a nod to vaccine skeptics who have fixated on the chemical’s use.
Vaccines
Last week, Kennedy terminated 22 grants — including one at Emory University — as part of a “coordinated wind-down” of research studying mRNA vaccine technology. Vaccines using mRNA were first developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the technology won a Nobel Prize in 2023.
Dr. Ben Lopman, an epidemiologist and former CDC employee who studies vaccines, said at Tuesday’s rally that misinformation about vaccines “has reached the highest levels in our government and society” under the current administration.
“RFK Jr. was arguably the nation’s leading anti-vaccine activist before being elevated to HHS secretary,” Lopman said. “These wrong ideas are now embedded in everyday conversations, as well as official policy.”
Dr. Sofia Chaudhary, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta and an assistant professor at Emory University, also drew a link between mistrust of public health workers and Friday’s attack on the CDC.
“This past Friday, more than 180 bullets were fired, but the attack on public health went beyond the gunfire,” Chaudhary said. “Misinformation is a serious and growing threat to public health that leads to erosion of trust, delays in care and vaccinations, and deepening of social division.”
Speakers at the rally also condemned inaction on gun safety legislation at Georgia’s state Capitol. During the 2025 legislative session, legislators introduced a number of bills aimed at improving gun safety, but did not  pass any of them before the session concluded. Lawmakers will return to Atlanta in January.
“There are over a dozen bills held in limbo in committee at our state Capitol that use evidence-based solutions to address gun violence,” said Mike Greenwald, a doctor and co-chair of Georgia Clinicians for Gun Safety.
Lawmakers “are aware of the evidence and the arguments,” he added. “What holds them back is likely a political calculus.”
Georgia Clinicians for Gun Safety and Georgia Majority for Gun Safety will launch a new public information campaign on gun safety next month, Greenwald said.

(Courtesy of Democracy Maine)Democracy Maine Executive Director Anna Kellar is leaving the role after nearly eight years to serve as national organizing director for Rank the Vote, a nonprofit with the goal of adopting ranked-choice voting nationwide. 
Kellar’s last day will be Sept. 12. Al Cleveland, the organizations’ advocacy director, will serve as interim executive director until a permanent replacement is selected. 
In many ways, Kellar’s next role will continue the work they championed in Maine while leading Democracy Maine, which is a collaboration between nonpartisan organizations — the League of Women Voters of Maine, Maine Citizens for Clean Elections and Maine Students Vote — working to make government more equitable by improving elections, protecting and engaging voters. 
During their tenure, Kellar successfully pushed for the adoption of ranked-choice voting, which allows voters to rank candidates by preference, at multiple levels of office. 
In November 2016, Maine voters approved ranked-choice voting for statewide elections for governor, state legislature and Congress — though applicability for some of those offices was later narrowed to only primaries — becoming the first state to do so. Kellar then led Democracy Maine in pushing for the Maine Legislature to expand the system to include presidential elections. At the municipal level, Kellar helped pass ranked-choice voting in Westbrook and expand it in Portland. 
“In this new role, I will bring the values that I learned through my time at Democracy Maine and the League to a national reform effort, especially the power of ordinary people working together to make our communities better,” Kellar said in a statement announcing their resignation Wednesday. “I am excited to help other states and cities follow Maine’s lead and embrace election systems that increase the choices and power of the voters.”
Beyond ranked-choice voting, Democracy Maine under Kellar’s leadership supported other successful legislative efforts to expand voting rights, including automatic voter registration, online voter registration, ongoing absentee and protections for absentee voting and having semi-open primaries. Kellar also aided in creating the state’s first municipal clean elections system in Portland.
Democracy Maine also expanded during Kellar’s tenure, notably with the addition of Maine Students Vote, which is aimed at increasing election engagement and civic participation on college campuses and high schools across the state. 
Jill Ward, the League’s and Democracy Maine’s board president, said in a statement that Kellar has positioned the organization well to “continue to lead the charge for a government truly of, by, and for everyday people.” 
Such efforts this fall will be centered on defeating Question 1 on the upcoming November ballot to require voters to show photo identification at the polls and make other changes to state election law, including limiting absentee voting. Democracy Maine also plans to continue to try to expand ranked-choice voting for the 2026 general election.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0471-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 13:57:54.390309

Immigrants released at the border are being targeted for arrest when they show up for court hearings (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images).Inside immigration courts around the country, immigrants who crossed the border illegally and were caught and released are required to appear before a judge for a preliminary hearing.
But in a new twist, the Trump administration has begun using an unexpected legal tactic in its deportation efforts. Rather than pursue a deportation case, it is convincing judges to dismiss immigrants’ cases — thus depriving the immigrants of protection from arrest and detention — then taking them into custody.
The practice, affecting immigrants released at the border and given a “notice to appear” in court under both the Trump and Biden administrations, sometimes leads to people being quickly deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement through a process called expedited removal.
Many of the immigrants had requested asylum, as allowed under U.S. law. Late last month, advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of a dozen immigrants unexpectedly arrested by ICE, often after having their cases dismissed.
When an immigrant crosses the border illegally and is caught, they may be given a “notice to appear,” or NTA, ordering them to appear before an immigration judge. It can sometimes take years, however, before their case comes up.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit was caught at the border with Mexico and given a court appearance ticket in 2022 after fleeing Cuba. His opposition to forced conscription and the communist government in Cuba led to his arrest there and he was raped in custody, according to the lawsuit.
At his first hearing in U.S. immigration court in May, his case was dismissed with no reason given and his attorney agreed, thinking the relatively new maneuver was a positive development.
But as he left the Miami court, the immigrant was arrested and sent to Washington state for detention, thousands of miles from his family and his wife, who is a U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit.
“The aftermath of these courthouse arrests and dismissals for placement in expedited removal wreaks further havoc on people’s lives,” according to a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice filed in July by a group of immigrant advocates. The group argued the practice is illegal and contrary to the traditional way people are treated when released at the border for court dates.
The lawsuit includes 12 immigrants: three from Cuba, three from Venezuela, two from Ecuador, two from Guinea and others from Liberia and the Chechen Republic. A Department of Justice spokesperson, Natalie Baldassarre, said the department had no comment on the lawsuit.
After a courthouse arrest in New York City in July, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News that the new policy “is reversing [President Joe] Biden’s catch and release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets.”
However, the Trump administration has also released immigrants seeking asylum at the border pending court dates, according to a June 27 report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at the University of Syracuse, an organization that tracks federal statistics.
Almost 18,000 people were released at the border in May “even after Trump officials closed the border, vowed not to allow anyone in and to immediately detain anyone not legally in the country caught inside the U.S.,” the report stated.
Other immigration attorneys who spoke with Stateline described uprooted lives caused by the new practice of arresting people after they show up for court hearings, but the attorneys declined to speak on the record for fear of drawing negative attention to their clients’ cases.
Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 17,000 immigration attorneys and is not involved in the lawsuit, said the Department of Homeland Security is now arguing in court that anyone caught crossing the border should be arrested and detained, though it’s not happening in every case.
“There is a large number of people going to court and getting arrested, and also people in detention not getting let out,” Dojaquez-Torres said. “This happens to people with no criminal background, no negative immigration history — they might even have a sponsor that says, ‘We will house them and feed them and make sure they show up to their court hearings.’”
There are also cases of people arrested in court even if their case isn’t dismissed, Dojaquez-Torres said.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit, a Venezuelan who said he faced persecution in his home country as a gay man with HIV, was arrested July 1 after a hearing in New York City even though his case is still active, according to the lawsuit.
One woman born in Venezuela, who fears persecution because of her sexual orientation and opposition to the Venezuelan government, applied for asylum within a year of entering the United States in 2022, but was arrested at her first court hearing May 27. She now faces an expedited removal order, which could mean an immediate deportation if she loses appeals. She is currently in detention in Ohio, according to the lawsuit.
Other cases mentioned in the lawsuit involved arrests at immigration courts in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Nevada.
Most of the immigrants mentioned in the lawsuit were caught crossing illegally. But two presented themselves at the border legally via an appointment set up through a phone app for asylum-seekers, CBP One, designed to limit the number of people who could cross the border asking for asylum. (The Trump administration shut down the app on its first day in office.)
In one of those cases, a gay man from Ecuador, facing government threats over his LGBTQ+ advocacy efforts, used the app in January and appeared in court June 4, according to the lawsuit.
The government moved to dismiss his case, and he was deported back to Ecuador within a month, despite asking for more time to file an asylum case, according to the suit. He is now living in hiding.
The class-action lawsuit has not yet been answered by the government, though the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, James Boasberg, ruled July 18 that the immigrants suing could use pseudonyms without identifying information as long as they provide real names and addresses in documents sealed from public view.
Courthouse arrests may cross a new line legally but they’re not likely to increase deportation significantly the way current large-scale workplace raids and transfers from local jails might, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. The administration’s goal of 1 million deportations a year still seems unlikely, he said.
Arrests declined in July over the previous month, but deportations increased, according to an Aug. 2 TRAC report, with 56,945 people in detention. The number of detainees will increase with more federal funding for detention, but is still unlikely to reach the level needed to deport a million people in a year, Chishti said.
The issue of courthouse arrests makes legal representation for immigrants all the more important, Chishti said.
“Even in these horrendous cases, if you have a lawyer, he’ll know how to handle it and say, ‘He can’t be removed, he’ll be subject to torture,’” Chishti said. “The difference between arrest and deportation could be the presence of a lawyer.”
Nevertheless, the prospect of arrest and detention during a case that may last years could make immigrants hesitant to show up for court dates, which in turn could make them subject to immediate deportation.
“If you don’t show up for a court date, they will enter what’s called an in absentia removal order. If you come into any contact with ICE after that, you will be most likely detained and removed,” Dojaquez-Torres said.

King Women’s Center in Salt Lake City on March 26, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Though Utah’s rate of homelessness remains below the national average, a new report shows the state’s homeless population is continuing to rise — and the start of 2025 marked a significant uptick.
“It’s a big jump,” Wayne Niederhauser, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox’s state homeless coordinator, told Utah News Dispatch ahead of the report’s release Wednesday. “We haven’t seen that kind of jump for years.”
The annual 2025 Point-in-Time Count — which is a national tally of sheltered and unsheltered people on a single night in January — showed 4,584 Utahns were experiencing homelessness in January 2025, up by 715 people from last year, an 18% increase.
Utah’s homelessness rate is now 13 per 10,000 people, up from 11 per 10,000. But even though Utah is one of the fastest-growing states in the nation and has faced skyrocketing housing prices over the past five years, its rate of homelessness is still well below the 2024 national rate, which was 23 per 10,000.
Though Niederhauser said it’s concerning to see an 18% jump, he said there is a “silver lining.”
“The silver lining is that 95% of those extra individuals were in shelter and not unsheltered,” he said.
Summer shouldn’t push Idaho’s working parents to the brink of homelessness

In the past several years, Niederhauser said Utah has typically seen only a 4% or 5% rate increase, but about 80% of those people were unsheltered. This year, he said, “the good part about that data point is that most of those individuals were sheltered.”
Of the 715 additional people experiencing homelessness during the 2025 Point-in-Time Count, 677 (95%) were sheltered and 38 (5%) were unsheltered, which the Utah Office of Homeless Services described in the report’s key findings as a “dramatic shift” from 2024, when that year’s count rose by 131 people, but only 23 (18%) were sheltered while 108 (82%) were unsheltered.
“This year’s dramatic increase in sheltered individuals compared to unsheltered is largely attributed to the expansion of winter shelter capacity, which allowed more individuals experiencing homelessness to access shelter,” the report says.
 Utah’s 2025 Point-in-Time-Count offers several findings

This year’s Point-in-Time Count took place during Code Blue temperatures, which prompted expansion of shelter capacity. Volunteers also questioned whether increased anti-camping enforcement, along with the frigid temperatures, could have factored into seeing fewer people on the streets.
The report also includes several other notable findings, including:

Rising child homelessness: The number of Utah children experiencing homelessness increased from 589 to 662, a 22% increase. Children now make up 14% of Utah’s total Point-in-Time Count, which is still below 2024 national data, when children accounted for 19% of people experiencing homelessness across the U.S.
More unhoused seniors: The number of Utahns over the age of 64 experiencing homelessness rose from 251 to 356, an increase of 42%. The increase, state officials wrote, “may reflect broader demographic shifts,” with Utah’s population of those 65 and older growing by nearly 58% from 2013 to 2023 and expected to double by 2060, according to the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. But at the same time, “more seniors are being priced out of housing, often living on fixed incomes that can’t keep pace with rising rents and property costs,” state officials wrote.
Veterans experiencing homelessness: The number of veterans experiencing homelessness grew by 36%, rising from 121 to 165. “While this represents a notable year-over-year increase, the 2025 total remains within the historical range, falling between the 2023 count of 181 and the 2022 count of 155.
A rise in first-time homelessness: Factoring in not just people tallied during the Point-in-Time Count, but also those who accessed homeless services according to the state’s database, a total of 10,261 people in Utah experienced homelessness in 2024 for the first time, an increase of 5% from 2023. The state’s homelessness data dashboard shows 5,122 people were categorized as “previously homeless,” only a slight uptick from 4,942 people in 2023. In total, the state’s database reported 15,383 people accessing services in 2024 statewide.

To Niederhauser, the report shows even though Utah homelessness is rising — following a national trend of Americans faced with higher housing costs, inflation, and wages that aren’t keeping pace with cost of living — the state’s homeless system is providing options that those additional people are using rather than living on the streets.
“There’s an increase in homelessness, but we’re addressing it in an effective way,” he said.
In the report’s executive summary, Niederhauser highlighted a list of investments the 2025 Utah Legislature made to improve Utah’s homeless system, including:

$3.9 million in ongoing funding to launch and operate a second family shelter in the Salt Lake Valley. Renovated from a Motel 6, the Family Interim Non-Congregate Housing Facility, or FINCH for short, opened in April.
$5.5 million in one-time funding was allocated for the 2026 fiscal year to expand emergency shelter operations during cold weather. In the 2025 fiscal year, investment in winter response supported 901 additional winter shelter beds, including 256 Code Blue beds and 3,370 emergency shelter nights provided in a hotel setting.
$16.7 million in ongoing, annually adjusted funding was distributed to cities hosting homeless shelters to help mitigate their impacts.

 What’s working and where are more resources for people facing homelessness needed?

The report showed some progress toward the state homeless system’s goals of making homelessness “rare, brief and nonrecurring,” but also areas where the system is falling short.
For example, state data showed a slight decrease in the number of days people are staying in emergency shelters. In 2024, 75% of emergency shelter stays were 90 days or less, down from 80% in 2023 and below previous years.
“While this trend indicates people are experiencing homelessness for longer periods of time, most only need short-term shelter support before restabilizing,” the report stays.
However, the average length of stay in emergency shelter increased by 10 days (17%) compared to 2023, “highlighting the growing difficulty individuals face in securing stable housing,” the report says. “This trend underscores the urgent need for faster housing placements and a broader range of exit options from shelter.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The number of Utahns experiencing chronic homelessness also remains an issue. According to the 2025 Point-in-Time Count, 1,233 were experiencing chronic homelessness — a 36% rise from 906 in 2024. But that group represented 27% of the total Point-in-Time Count, similar to 28% in 2023.
“This highlights the continued need for supportive services for individuals with disabilities and long histories of homelessness, while also confirming that chronic homelessness remains a minority of the overall homeless population in Utah,” the report says.
The report also showed, however, that supportive housing has continued to be a “key driver of long-term stability” for people exiting homelessness. For example, state data shows:

93% of people in permanent supportive housing “either retained their housing or moved on to other permanent options.” 2024 marked the “fourth consecutive year this success rate has held steady.”
In 2024, the percentage of people returning to homelessness within two years of exiting to permanent supportive housing declined slightly from 25% to 24%.
“These outcomes underscore the effectiveness of permanent supportive housing with wrap-around services in keeping Utah’s most vulnerable residents stably housed,” the report said.

In recent years, while lawmakers have put more money toward homeless services than they have in the past, there are still plenty of requests for more money that have gone unfunded. In 2025, lawmakers approved some but not all of the funding requests Niederhauser and his office asked for, leaving funding gaps that local officials have had to find ways to fill.

As his office prepares for another budget proposal, Niederhauser said his message to lawmakers for the upcoming 2026 general session in January is to acknowledge Utah’s homeless population is increasing. He also noted that the data shows the length of time people are staying in shelters has increased, indicating there’s a “gap” that needs to be filled when it comes to providing options for people to cycle out of emergency shelters.
“That’s the service that we really need to focus on,” he said, including additional beds at the Utah State Hospital or expanding capacity in other areas of the state’s mental health system, as well as increasing capacity for supportive housing.
“That is a good message for all of us, and it’s a good takeaway for the Legislature — for us to really focus on that big gap that we have for some of those services,” Niederhauser said. “If those are available, then the nights (people) spend in shelter goes down.”
For the first time, Utah’s Point-in-Time Count this year also included survey questions asking unsheltered people what type of shelter they would use if available. Its findings said:

610 preferred private rooms
568 preferred “bring-your-own setups (cars, tents, RVs) with shared facilities”
511 said they would use small units with shared bathrooms
356 were open to congregate shelters
236 said none of the above.

Niederhauser said that survey “confirms” what state and local leaders have been hearing for a long time – that providing a range of options for people will help keep more people off of the streets. He pointed to the 50-bed “microshelter” community that opened last fall as a model that’s been a success, with plans to add another 54 units in coming months.
“That kind of model we’re very bullish on because the outcomes have been excellent,” Niederhauser said.
He also said those survey questions are expected to inform the design of a planned 1,200- to 1,600-bed homeless campus, which is expected to offer both congregate and non-congregate shelter options.
 Efforts to site 1,200- to 1,600-bed homeless campus in SLC still underway

Lawmakers also passed legislation to allow the state to use eminent domain powers to “accelerate site acquisition” for a planned “transformative homeless services campus, with statutory authority limited to a defined area in Salt Lake City, northeast of the airport,” the report’s executive summary said.
Niederhauser and other state officials have been working for months to site that homeless campus (expected to include 1,200 to 1,600 beds), but they have not yet announced what properties they’ve been eying. Last fall, the Utah Homeless Services Board set a deadline of Oct. 1, 2025 for the campus to be built, but Niederhauser said the siting process has been taking longer than expected.
“Our timeline is ASAP,” Niederhauser said when asked about a new timeline for selecting the property for the homeless campus. “We know this is needed. We are looking at several properties, all of which have some difficult situations to overcome, like wetlands. I’ll highlight wetlands, because wetlands isn’t something I can solve in two weeks, three months, or even six months because the Army Corps of Engineers has to be involved in that, and there’s a process you have to go through.”
Depending on the outcomes of those evaluations, Niederhauser said that will determine whether state officials move forward with eminent domain powers to site the campus. He said a new timeline is not yet clear, but “we’re not sitting on this.”
“We are working hard,” he said, adding that it’s been challenging to find a property along the Wasatch Front, which has limited property available that hasn’t already been developed. “Unfortunately, you know, the need is huge. We appreciate the acute need, the serious need of this. So we’re not letting grass grow under our feet. We’re working hard to find a pathway.”

(Photo by Eros Hoagland/Getty Images)It’s move-in week for students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as thousands of freshmen and returning students arrive and settle into their new campus home. The university is welcoming its biggest class of undergraduates yet. More than 5,100 are first-year students, representing 98 North Carolina counties and 80 foreign countries. Almost 1 in 5 (18.3%) of the incoming undergrads are first-generation college students.
Chancellor Lee Roberts shared the numbers last week as he addressed the UNC-Chapel Hill Employee Forum ahead of the new semester. But overshadowing those positive numbers was another much larger figure — 70 million — that had everyone in the room nervous.
A week earlier, university leaders announced plans to cut $70 million from the budget to address federal funding cuts and uncertainty from the state government budget.

While the university is still sorting out where to make cuts, a $39 million reduction in nonresident financial aid can be expected.
“We’ll be scaling back our nonresident financial aid, continue to prioritize North Carolinians in the provision of our financial aid dollars,” said Roberts. “We’re going to reduce some funding from our centers and institutes. It’s about a 10% cut from centers and institutes.”
The chancellor worked to reassure university employees that these decisions were not being made in isolation.
“I spent the first 10 or so years working at a big bank and we always did it that way. And the drawback to that is that there is no consultation, there’s no input from the organization,” said Robert. “The second way of doing it is the way that we’re doing it, which is to announce our targets, to announce the way that we’re thinking about the reductions. But without all of the details yet finalized.”
But even without a finalized plan, Roberts said they fully envisioned some employees would be cut.
“We don’t know how many layoffs we’re talking about because we haven’t gotten that far in the process yet. But it would be unrealistic to go through an exercise like this and not expect there to be some layoffs.” said Roberts, who hoped that attrition could ease the pain.










We're trying to think about some centers and institutes that were established to serve a purpose, that may or may not any longer be relevant. Centers and institutes tend to have a lifecycle.


– UNC Chancellor Lee Roberts


Natasha Young, the assistant director of leadership development at UNC-Chapel Hill, asked what budget analysis had been done based on salaries, hoping that smaller pay reductions could offset layoffs.
“If you make over $500,000 a year on campus and see a 5% pay reduction, my assumption is that you probably won’t have drastic implications on your quality of life. If you’re an employee that makes $50,000 a year and you get laid off, you risk homelessness, not being able to feed your children, losing your healthcare, all of that,” she reasoned.
Roberts said there are relatively few employees making over $500,000 a year on campus.
“There are 70 on campus,” Young answered.
“A lot of them are going to be in the health system,” Roberts reassured.
“And athletics,” Young responded.
Roberts, a former state budget director, said the university cannot impose pay cuts on state employees.
“It’s just not the way the state employment laws work.”
Keith Hines from the UNC’s Development Department wanted clarification on what constitutes a center and an institute that might be subject to being cut.
Roberts said in this case the 10% suggested cut would not be applied evenly to those organizations.
“We’re trying to think about some centers and institutes that were established to serve a purpose, that may or may not any longer be relevant,” Roberts said. “Centers and institutes tend to have a lifecycle. And that’s what we’re trying to look at.”
The state legislature’s latest mini-budgets did not include funds for the University’s enrollment growth, or an increase in sports wagering revenue. 
  UNC’s ServiceFirst timeline
In May, the UNC Board of Trustees introduced ServiceFirst, a new initiative to identify operational efficiencies and strategic cost-savings for the campus.
Scott Savage, UNC-Chapel Hill’s associate vice chancellor for organizational strategy and performance, said his team will be looking at transactional work, what can be centralized, what work and resources can be shared.
It’s estimated another $3.9 million in savings can be realized by eliminating currently vacant roles.
“What the proposed operating models are drive a lot of those conversations whether it’s the adjustment of team placement, it’s staying the same, or it’s modifications to positions. But the how of doing that is still under development,” Savage told university employees.
ServiceFirst plans to implement its efficiency roadmap as early as November, according to Savage’s presentation to the group.
  Theresa Silsby, director of UNC’s ITS Business Systems
Theresa Silsby, director of UNC’s ITS Business Systems, said future cuts and even the decision to leave positions unfilled will have consequences.
“I purposely made the decision a couple years ago not to fill a position on my team. We support HR, finance and payroll, and all employees for Connect Carolina,” said Silsby, a 29-year-employee.
“What I found was while the work could get done, if anybody was sick or needed a vacation, we were dead in the water.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-1271725146-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 13:57:54.390309

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)The Montana Republican Party announced on Wednesday that Tyler Newcombe has resigned from his role as Executive Director, after serving in the position since the beginning of the year. He will be taking on a new role as communications director and advisor for State Auditor James Brown.
“It has been an incredible honor to work with such a dedicated team on advancing conservative values across Montana,” Newcombe said in a press release. “I’m proud of what we accomplished together and confident that the MTGOP is well-positioned for the future.”
The party plans to announce a new executive director in the coming weeks.
The party hired Newcombe in January to replace Danielle Bradley, who stepped down after leading the MTGOP through the 2022 and 2024 election cycles which turned Montana into a solidly red state, with Republicans winning every statewide office and sweeping the Congressional delegation for the first time in more than a century.
While overseeing the party’s work during the 2025 legislative session, Newcombe also broke fundraising records and “set the party on a path to more victories in the coming years,” according to the press release.
“I appreciate Tyler’s service to the Montana Republican Party and wish him the best in his future endeavors,” MTGOP Chairman Art Wittich said.
Newcombe officially stepped down last week, but stayed on in an unofficial capacity through the start of the transition period. In addition to his communications work in the Auditor’s office, Newcombe also works as a political consultant for many Montana Republicans.
“I’m excited to join the office of James Brown to highlight the work he does to defend Montanans from fraud, prosecute bad actors, and assist Montanans with proactively helping them with finding the best rates for their families,” Newcombe told the Daily Montanan.
In another change at the state party, Ethan Holmes has been brought on to serve as communications director to handle press affairs and as the primary point of contact for the party.
Holmes is a University of Montana graduate who worked in communications and as a legislative advisor for the Senate Republicans during the 2025 session.
“The MTGOP looks forward to delivering the conservative agenda mandated by voters, growing its grassroots base, and keeping Montana bright red,” according to the release.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250628_123801-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-13 13:57:54.390309

Forest Service is said to be close to deciding on a property swap that would give Wyoming a site for a reservoir planned above Little Snake River Valley.
The post Wyoming advances land exchange for proposed West Fork Dam appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming water developers appear to be closing in on a land exchange between the state and the Medicine Bow National Forest to enable construction of a dam and reservoir above the Little Snake River Valley in Carbon County.
Wyoming lawmakers voted last Thursday to transfer $300,000 to the state land office to help complete a swap. The money would enable the Wyoming Office of Lands and Investments and the Forest Service to complete surveys, minerals reports and other elements necessary for the exchange, Wyoming Water Development Office Director Jason Mead told lawmakers.
A land exchange, which has stirred public interest and opposition, is critical to the proposed dam and reservoir. “In order to get our permits, we have to acquire that U.S. Forest Service property,” Mead told lawmakers.
A motion to approve the transfer passed without dissent at a joint meeting of the Legislature’s Select Water Committee and Wyoming Water Development Commission last week. The money comes from $4.2 million already allocated to the water office for the proposed dam on the West Fork of Battle Creek.
 “If they can consolidate … there’s potential[ly] more revenue to state lands for schools.” Jason Mead
Medicine Bow forest officials appear ready to sign and approve a feasibility analysis and public interest determination that could move the exchange forward, Mead told lawmakers.
“The land exchange process has gone through a feasibility analysis to make sure it can be completed through the Forest Service regulations and if it’s in the public interest,” Mead said. “That, I think, currently is awaiting signature.”
The signing of a report affirming the feasibility and public interest of an exchange would advance the process, Mead said. “The next step would be an ‘agreement to initiate’ … a 64-step process, literally to complete that land exchange.”
As the effort advances, forest officials cautioned that tasks so far represent “preliminary steps.” The Forest Service, after consultation with officials in Washington, D.C., stated in an email that it “has not approved or completed a land exchange,” and that “the process is in early stages and subject to further analysis and public review.”
A draft Environmental Impact Statement on the project, announced in 2022, is expected to be published early next year by the federal Natural Resources Conservation Service.
More irrigation in troubled basin
The West Fork dam is proposed to be a 264-foot-high, 700-foot-long concrete plug in a canyon just south of scenic Wyoming Highway 70 between Saratoga and Baggs. The reservoir would be about 130 acres and cover what is now largely forested land. About 44 irrigators have expressed interest in contracting for late-season water from the planned reservoir. In 2017, water developers estimated the dam would cost $80 million and hold 8,000 acre feet.
The drainage is in the Colorado River Basin, where states are scrambling to agree on new methods to share water in the face of climate change, over-promised supplies and dwindling flows. Wyoming believes it has not used its share of basin-wide water rights and is allowed to use more on hay and alfalfa fields.
To enable the dam’s construction, the state lands office proposed exchanging Wyoming school trust property for approximately 1,490 acres of National Forest land. The state lands office has identified “a number of state parcels,” Mead said.

“The majority of those [state] parcels that they’re looking to trade are actually in roadless areas — or what maybe used to be roadless areas,” Mead told lawmakers. “They’re very isolated parcels out in the middle of forest, and the access to them is very limited.
“So if they can consolidate those into this project location of West Fork Reservoir that has access from the highway,” Mead said, “there’s potential[ly] more revenue to state lands for schools.”
The exchange would have to be of properties that are of equal value, or nearly equal value, with a payment that would make up any difference.
Half of the $300,000 would be used by the state for its surveys and other work and the other half would go to the Medicine Bow for its share of the examinations.
Medicine Bow National Forest spokesman Aaron Voos in 2023 outlined his agency’s exchange process. “The feasibility analysis, report, and public interest are all inter-related,” he wrote. “That analysis will culminate in the report and public interest statement.”
“Input previously received … on the land exchange proposal has informed the feasibility analysis, and then subsequently the report/public interest statement,” Voos wrote in 2023. The Forest Service will not take more public input before releasing the analysis and public interest report, he wrote at the time.
What is the public’s interest?
It’s uncertain what elements the Forest Service has considered in determining public interest.
“There is some flexibility in how the report can be written and how ‘public interest’ is explained throughout the report,” Voos has explained in emails. “Regardless, ‘public interest’ is required to be addressed and will be heavily factored into the Forest Supervisor’s recommendation to proceed or not proceed.”
One gauge of public interest emerged when the Natural Resources Conservation Service announced in 2022 the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement that would examine the proposal. The agency received 936 comments, according to a WyoFile tally.
Dam proponents didn’t expect so much feedback. The state water office’s consultant assumed there would be 100 comments, “with only 40 being substantive.”
WyoFile’s count found 96% of commenters opposed to the West Fork plan. Many comments were simple statements of opposition.
The Forest Service will determine which comments will be considered in the public interest determination. That’s because federal agencies have a rule on what comments they consider. Only “substantive” comments are factored into the environmental impact process according to a primer on the procedure published by the Bureau of Land Management.
“Comments that are not substantive include: Comments in favor of or against an action without any reasoning (such as ‘I do/don’t like ____’ without providing any rationale),” the BLM primer states. In contrast, substantive comments “provide relevant and new information with sufficient detail,” the primer states.

Michigan superintendents in the Dearborn, Dexter, Harrison, and Huron Valley school districts are among the seven semifinalists for the state’s top education leader position.
The semifinalists for the state superintendent job also include Virginia’s former top education leader, a former Des Moines superintendent, and the head of a Michigan association of intermediate school district administrators.
Michigan’s State Board of Education chose the seven semi-finalists Tuesday after a closed session in which they reviewed 33 applications for the top job. They are seeking to replace State Superintendent Michael Rice, who announced in April that he is retiring, effective Oct. 3.
The semifinalists will be interviewed by the board in 90-minute sessions next week, on Aug. 18 and Aug. 19, during the first round of interviews. The board will then choose finalists, and the schedule includes making a final decision in early September.
Here are the seven people who will interview for the job:

Thomas Ahart, education consultant and coach, and former superintendent of the Des Moines Public Schools
Lisa Coons, former state superintendent in Virginia and former chief academic officer for the Tennessee Department of Education
Glenn Maleyko, superintendent, Dearborn Public Schools
Paul Salah, superintendent, Huron Valley Schools
John R Severson, executive director, Michigan Association of Intermediate School Administrators.
Christopher Timmis, superintendent, Dexter Public Schools
Judy Walton, superintendent and curriculum director, Harrison Community Schools

The seven semi-finalists were recommended by representatives of Hazard, Young, Attea & Associates, the search firm assisting the board.
Max McGee, an associate with the search firm, told the board the seven recommended are the candidates whose experiences and background best meet the 12 desired characteristics and qualifications that the firm developed based on what they heard in interviews with stakeholders, focus groups, forums, and survey results.
The board approved moving those seven recommended candidates to the first round of the interview process, with member Tom McMillin, a Republican from Oakland Township, the lone “no” vote among the eight members. McMillin had motioned to include an eighth candidate as a semifinalist, but that effort failed.
McMillin explained that his vote “doesn’t mean I oppose them all” and doesn’t mean he won’t eventually vote for one of them.
Fellow Republican Nikki Snyder, from Goodrich, voted to approve the semifinalists, but said the search process “has been inherently flawed.”
“I do believe the candidate has already been chosen,” Snyder said.
Marshall Bullock, a Democrat from Detroit, said he hasn’t chosen a candidate.
“I take some kind of dislike to that commentary that we’ve already selected a candidate. This is all very fresh to me,” Bullock said.
Earlier in Tuesday’s meeting, McGee read a list of 10 candidates for the job who had not requested confidentiality in releasing their names prior to interviews. None of them, however, were among the semifinalists. One of them was Sherry Gay-Dagnogo, a member of the Detroit Public Schools Community District board and former Michigan lawmaker and teacher.

As part of a training exercise for the Nebraska Army National Guard, soldiers will descend from Blackhawk helicopters near iconic Chimney Rock in the state’s Panhandle.
The two-hour-long training exercise is scheduled to begin at 8 a.m. Friday, weather permitting.
Soldiers from the 2-134th Infantry Battalion-Airborne will descend from two Blackhawk helicopters onto a designated drop zone between Chimney Rock and the Ethel S. and Christopher J. Abbott Museum and Visitors Center.
The public is invited to the event, which coincides with National Airborne Day. It’s no coincidence that the current director of the Nebraska State Historical Society, Daryl Bohac, is a former adjutant general of the Nebraska National Guard.
Chimney Rock State Historical Site Manager Loren Pospisil said in a statement the pioneer monument was “excited” to participate in this “history-in-the-making event.”
Officials said the exercise could be cancelled as late as Friday morning if weather conditions make it unsafe for the paratrooper’s 1,500-foot jump.

(Getty Images)Last month, Congress revived and expanded the program that offered payments to people sickened by nuclear weapons testing, meaning Utah’s downwinders can again apply for compensation.
For years, Intermountain’s Downwinder Clinic, located at the St. George Regional Hospital’s Cancer Center, has provided free help to downwinders — that includes education, health care assistance and help applying to receive payments through the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA.
All of Idaho’s downwinders could be compensated under U.S. Senate’s mega bill

However, RECA expired in June 2024 after Congress failed to reauthorize it.
In the 13 months after the program expired, the Downwinder Clinic was still working with eligible families to gather the documents needed to qualify for RECA payments. And last month, after Congress reauthorized RECA in its massive spending bill, downwinders who were just recently diagnosed with cancer or who didn’t know about the program are again eligible for compensation.
“We have been working with families during the 13 months the program was expired to help gather the documents they would need when RECA was reinstated. Now, we want people to know that the qualifying boundaries have expanded, as well as new applicants qualify for a larger compensation amount for the health issues they have encountered,” Barlow said.
RECA has been in place since 1990, but downwinders have long said it should be expanded. Despite studies suggesting the entire West was impacted by dangerous levels of radiation during nuclear tests, downwinders in just 10 counties in Utah, as well as a handful of counties in Nevada and Arizona, were covered.
Now, the program’s scope is much broader. All of Utah and Idaho is considered an affected area, meaning if you lived in the Beehive and Gem states for a period of 12 months between 1951 to 1962, and contracted a certain type of cancer, you are likely eligible for compensation.
Eligible cancers include leukemia (but not chronic lymphocytic leukemia), multiple myeloma, lymphomas and cancers of the pharynx, small intestine, salivary gland, brain, stomach, urinary bladder, colon, thyroid, pancreas, breast, esophagus, bile ducts, liver, gall bladder, lung, and ovarian.
New applicants will also now receive $100,000 — the prior compensation amount was $50,000. However, that increase is not retroactive, meaning downwinders who already received payments are not eligible for the new amount.

For years, the city of Burlington has worked hard to adapt our responses to public health challenges, including homelessness, substance use disorders and mental health crises. 
Camping and rough sleeping have been prevalent in city spaces for decades. However, since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, Vermont has seen an alarming increase in the number of people experiencing homelessness. 
Over the past three years, uncertainty around the State Emergency Housing Program, also known as the motel program, has left the city and partner organizations in a near constant state of crisis-response. 
Vermont’s municipalities do not have the staff or resources to adequately respond to these overlapping challenges. The most recent round of motel exits on July 1 saw hundreds of people pushed out of the motel program statewide, including families with children, older adults and medically vulnerable individuals. 
Many who exited had nowhere to go.

Based on local data, while Chittenden County accounts for 26% of Vermont’s population, we hold 34% of the state’s residents sleeping unsheltered. This is a policy failure that has left vulnerable people and those trying to serve them in crisis. We need more residential treatment beds, more shelter capacity, stronger renter protections and more affordable housing — real solutions that we have collectively failed to achieve.
On July 24, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order: Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets. This executive order promotes forced institutionalization, prioritizes the criminalization of homelessness and deprioritizes funding for evidence-based public health responses. This executive order is not a mandate, and we will not treat it as such in Burlington. 
As Burlington’s mayor, let me be clear: We will continue to move forward with compassion, using evidence-based practices like housing first and harm reduction while also prioritizing public health and safety, and maintaining our public spaces for all to enjoy.
In Burlington, we have made progress in evolving our responses to public health challenges, including increased funding for embedded social support providers and clinicians within our police department, creation of the fire department’s community response team, continued support for the urban park ranger program, and an increased investment in Howard Center’s Street Outreach Team. 
Key staff across multiple departments meet weekly to identify encampments, remove them from city parks, and assess campsites on other city land for health and safety. 
We also recently launched the Situation Table, an international model for intensive case coordination with the goal of reducing relevant risk factors for individuals at a heightened risk of harm to themselves or others. Anonymized risk factor data is then recorded so that we can track interventions, measure the effectiveness of the Situation Table, and assess if services are successfully mitigating risks. 
This data helps inform the development of local policies and initiatives to address safety and can be used to advocate for additional resources. We are also preparing to launch the City Circle initiative, which will offer an immediate accountability process for individuals who violate local ordinances and employs a restorative justice approach. 
I am proud of these innovative initiatives, however, they are at best triage and harm reduction responses necessitated by our maxed-out and chronically underfunded system of care. 
As mayor, I and other municipal officials have pleaded with state leaders, hoping to impress upon them the impossible burden municipalities face when the state fails to take action. My office has coordinated with city councilors and department heads to send several letters to Gov. Phil Scott on this issue. 
I have personally met with Scott and Agency of Human Services leaders to request a truly collaborative statewide response. Homelessness, substance use disorders and mental health crises touch every Vermont community in some fashion. If we are serious about supporting Vermonters, then we cannot ignore the public suffering that is affecting so many communities across our state. 
Municipal officials have advocated repeatedly for a coordinated response by the Agency of Human Services, including expanded shelter capacity and treatment beds. These pleas have largely been met with inaction. Burlington remains a willing partner to Scott, other state leaders and service providers to identify and implement real solutions to homelessness and our housing crisis. 
The conversation around H.91 was a good start, but Scott vetoed that bill to the surprise of many legislators and without offering alternatives. H.91 would have allowed for a more regional approach to shelter and service provision, offering a bridge to more community based shelter capacity and away from motels. 
Our city team will continue to adapt within our capacity to respond to the unprecedented scale of unsheltered homelessness in our community. However, we cannot do this work alone. When we expend resources to fill gaps left by the state, we have less for other local services and have to make difficult decisions, as we did in the previous two municipal budget cycles. 
Finally, I ask people to combat the narrative that just because people do not have permanent housing, they pose an inherent risk to others. Now more than ever, it is imperative to maintain our collective empathy. 
I encourage Vermonters to reach out to Scott. We need help from his administration. The level of human suffering in our communities is unacceptable, and the financial costs are untenable.

Kelly Ayotte at the state’s Executive Council meeting.
Butler, a Democrat, defeated Republican Ken Hilton to represent the reliably Democratic Strafford County District 12, which includes Somersworth and Rollinsford. Evans, also a Democrat, had moved out of the district and resigned.
On the campaign trail, Butler, an active member of the Seacoast area theater community, stressed her support for the arts and said she wouldn’t take up divisive issues, telling Foster’s Daily Democrat she “would like to see more people run who do not have divisive agendas, but who really love New Hampshire.”
During Wednesday’s meeting, Ayotte also called for a special election for state representative in Coos County District 5, which includes Berlin. That seat has sat vacant since June, when Republican Brian Valerino resigned. Valerino, a former sheriff and deputy police chief, was nominated by Ayotte in May to be the Northern New Hampshire Correctional Facility’s warden.
The candidate filing period will be Aug. 18 through Aug. 22, the governor announced. A primary election is scheduled for Sept. 16, with the special election being held Nov. 4.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas State Board of Education granted permission to the Blytheville School District to enter into the state’s second transformation contract during a special meeting Wednesday. 
A transformation contract allows a public school with a “D” or “F”-rating or one classified as in need of Level 5–Intensive Support to partner with an open-enrollment public charter school or another state-approved entity to create a “transformation campus.” The LEARNS Act, a 2023 law that overhauled the state’s K-12 education system, provides for the partnerships.
The state board dissolved the Blytheville School Board in May and placed the struggling eastern Arkansas district under a Level 5–Intensive Support classification due to ongoing academic, financial and administrative issues. The designation marks the highest level of state intervention or support.
Arkansas education board dissolves Blytheville school board

The Arkansas Department of Education issued a request for proposals in May to establish a transformation contract for the educational and administrative management of the district. 
ADE Deputy Commissioner Stacy Smith told the state board Wednesday that eight different groups showed interest and six completed the full application process. Four advanced to final interviews with a committee in Blytheville, which led Smith to recommend that the board allow the district to enter into a transformation contract with AMS Impact Group. 
The charter management organization manages the Academies of Math & Science in Little Rock and nine other schools in Arizona, according to the company’s website.
Smith said the committee felt the organization was committed to Blytheville and understanding the community. Prior to interviews, AMS representatives spent days living in the community and talking to residents at local restaurants, she said. 
“They were about one of the only groups who actually showed that they had a real interest, not just in running the school, but being part of the community,” Smith said. “They definitely sold themselves to the folks who were on the committee that day.”
AMS personnel have already been working with ADE staff in Blytheville. If a contract is approved, Smith said they’ll be responsible for the district’s daily operation, curriculum instructional support, direct support to personnel and professional development. The group has also brought in a “robust community engagement plan” that could include a community advisory board that would provide feedback on how the district was operating, she said.
“Transformation is beginning, but we have a long way to go in Blytheville,” Smith said.
After the board unanimously voted to allow Blytheville to enter into a transformation contract, Education Secretary Jacob Oliva noted the decision to dissolve the board was not done lightly and was the “culmination of a year’s worth of work trying to get things sorted.”
“This is a district that couldn’t even get a toilet to work,” Oliva said. “So when the expectation is that basic facilities can’t work, how can we expect students to learn?”
Over the last two months, Oliva said ADE staff and the community have made getting the first day of school right for students and families their top priority. The AMS team has also been onsite and meeting with families, and “the amount of excitement around Blytheville schools is contagious,” he said. 
“Students are telling teachers and administrators that they feel like this might be the first time that they actually learn something…this is such an exciting time, and we’re going to see monumental gains very quickly because we are now focused on students and not adults,” Oliva said.
The education board approved the state’s first transformation contract between the Marvell-Elaine School District and Friendship Education Foundation, a charter management company, in May 2023. 
The contract’s initial term was set for July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2026. The contract could be terminated early or extended. Under the agreement, the foundation would be compensated $50,000 for the transition term, which lasted until June 30, 2023, and $200,000 annually during the initial term.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

The donation, the first major contribution the team made in Missouri this year, comes roughly two months after the legislature approved a $1.5 billion stadium funding plan aimed at convincing the Chiefs and Royals to stay in Missouri.
Last year, the team spent more than $3 million supporting a ballot measure seeking to extend a three-eights-cent sales tax to finance a renovation of Arrowhead Stadium and the construction of a new downtown ballpark for the Royals. 
The Royals donated around $2.5 million to the effort, as well as $260,000 to various local political organizations. 
However, voters resoundingly rejected the extension of the sales tax.
Tuesday’s $25,000 check went to the House Republican Campaign Committee. The same day, the PAC received $30,000 from Missouri Soybean Association; $10,000 from Mo Medical PAC; and $5,500 from state Rep. Dean Van Schoiack.
The Chiefs and Royals have played in side-by-side stadiums for five decades and share a lease at the Truman Sports Complex that runs through Jan. 31, 2031. As the expiration date nears, legislators in Missouri and Kansas have battled to present the best financial framework to attract the teams to their respective sides of the state line. 
Missouri lawmakers approved legislation to allocate state taxes collected from economic activity at Arrowhead and Kauffman to bond payments for renovations at Arrowhead and a new stadium for the Royals in either Jackson or Clay counties.
The cost is estimated at close to $1.5 billion over 30 years and could cover up to half the costs of stadium construction.
Two Republicans state legislators filed a lawsuit late last month asking a judge to declare the incentives package unconstitutional because it also includes provisions unrelated to stadium funding.
Kansas lawmakers have put a deal on the table that would use state incentives to pay for up to 70% of the costs of new stadiums. That deal originally expired June 30, but Chiefs President Mark Donovan successfully lobbied for the deadline to be extended in order to continue negotiations with Kansas on building a stadium, team headquarters, practice facility and related business developments.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020925Arrowhead4-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-13 12:59:07.884453

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. this week defunded research in messenger RNA vaccines, which could create a chilling effect that could jeopardize efforts to develop vaccines against breast cancer, experts said.
The government is cancelling almost $500 million in 22 research contracts previously granted through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a subsidiary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In addition, the agency will not initiate new grants for projects involving messenger RNA, the revolutionary basis for COVID-19 immunizations. The scientists who helped discover mRNA technology won the 2023 Nobel Prize for Medicine; no vaccine has ever been so quickly developed and produced as the COVID-19 vaccines.

This story was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

Kennedy, who is known for his broad opposition to vaccines, said Health and Human Services is terminating the contracts because “these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections” — despite the broad medical consensus, backed by large studies, which holds that the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.
The government’s move has been widely decried by vaccine researchers, immunologists and public health experts. Some scientists have touted mRNA technology as a possible avenue to develop other vaccines, including ones to treat various cancers, including breast cancer, which is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide.
Cancer vaccines have been a rapid area of growth for medical research in recent years. Prophylactic vaccines, such as the human papillovirus vaccine, prevent cancers. But immunologists and cancer researchers have been working to develop new therapeutic vaccines — products that can trigger the immune system to fight against cancer cells after they have already developed, working instead as a treatment. There is a growing consensus that mRNA vaccines could be particularly effective in fighting cancers.
Most cancer vaccines currently in clinical trials are not based on mRNA. But it’s an area of growing interest: More than 120 clinical trials have been registered with the federal government to explore how mRNA vaccines could treat different cancers. Vaccines in development that make use of mRNA include those that could treat melanoma, lymphoma and colorectal cancer; scientists are also examining the possibility to treat pancreatic, lung and breast cancer.
The 22 contracts terminated were for treatments and vaccines for conditions such as influenza, COVID-19 and bird flu, not cancer. In its announcement, HHS said “other uses of mRNA technology” beyond prophylactic vaccines will not be affected.
But some cancer researchers still fear that Kennedy’s promise will cast a chill upon a promising line of inquiry, slowing progress and possibly preventing scientists from developing effective cancer treatments.
“There’s no question that the U.S. federal government has been one of the largest funders of biomedical research and innovation in the world,” said Dr. Herbert Kim Lyerly, an immunologist at Duke University.
Lyerly is part of a team currently working on a clinical trial for an RNA vaccine that could treat many common cancers, including breast cancer. So far, he said, the results have been promising. His work is government-supported but wasn’t affected by the recent cancellation of mRNA contracts.
Still, he believes the shift in policy could deter scientific innovation — if researchers can’t count on stable funding to explore mRNA-based options, it could prevent them from developing the most effective therapeutics.
“It reduces the options you have to explore strategies to reduce the burden of disease, to prevent disease, to improve the quality of life of people in this country,” he said. “To take away any of the tools to potentially have an impact is likely to limit progress.”
Others have echoed his concerns, including a spokesperson for the Biotechnology Innovation Center, who told the news organization STAT that scaling back government investments in mRNA vaccines “could erode progress and discourage investment in other promising areas of research, including cancer and rare diseases.” In a statement on the social media platform X, former surgeon general Jerome Adams, who served in President Donald Trump’s first term, called the move “dangerous,” highlighting its implications for flu, RSV, HIV, Zika, autoimmune diseases and cancer.
Still, some researchers said they anticipate that any vacuum created by the federal government’s retreat will be filled by other entities: foundations and nonprofits that focus on cancer.
“People are committed to mRNA because it has been shown to be safe and effective. People will still continue to do that research,” said Dr. Alison Stopeck, an oncologist at Stony Brook Cancer Center who focuses on breast cancer.
If the federal government does not support this kind of work, she added, “Foundations and donors will step in and provide some resources for this as well — because donors and foundations know how important this research is.”
Already, medical researchers have been left reeling after the federal government’s cancellation of major funding through institutions such as the National Institutes of Health — a move the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office recently deemed illegal. That’s been compounded by other funding cuts to individual research universities as well as a broader federal effort to curb funding into medical research that considers gender or gender inequality.
Though deaths from cancers have been declining, an April report from the National Cancer Institute found that the incidence of cancer actually increased for women over the past two decades. Breast cancer is also growing more common, particularly among young women and Asian American and Pacific Islander women. Black women who are diagnosed with breast cancer are substantially more likely to die than White women.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Hemp companies are asking for more consistency from state inspectors, who’ve spent the summer cracking down on packaging that could appeal to minors. 
The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services proposed a state definition of what can be considered a “cartoon” on packaging for hemp products such as THC drinks, gummies, and more during a hearing Wednesday in Tallahassee. 
Under the initial proposed language, the state would define a cartoon as “any drawing or other depiction of an object, person, animal, creature, or any similar caricature” that uses “comically exaggerated features,” “attribution of human characteristics to animals, plants, or other objects, or the similar use of anthropomorphic technique,” or “the attribution of unnatural or extra-human abilities, such as imperviousness to pain or injury, X-ray vision, tunnelling at very high speeds, or transformation.”
The definition was taken from tobacco litigation discussing what could be considered attractive to children, the state said. 
State law prohibits hemp products from being “attractive to children” and already prohibits depicting the shape of humans, cartoons, or animals, as well as candy.

Call for consistency
During the hearing on the language Wednesday, hemp industry representatives called for consistency in enforcement. 
“What we’re asking for today are clear rules of the road and ways to check our work before we invest,” Bayou City Hemp Co. co-founder Jeromy Sherman said.
He added that the company’s production process takes six months or more. “Arbitrary, after-the-fact enforcement, especially when it’s trusted retailers in the state of Florida, creates a ripple effect that punishes the companies trying to play by the rules and rewards fly-by-night operators.”
Sherman asked the department for a pre-approval process from the department to determine what counts as a cartoon before the product goes into production, pointing out that some other states require pre-approval.
This summer, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson and the department conducted “Operation Safe Summer,” whereby inspectors removed more than 800,000 packages of hemp products they considered to violate child-protection standards. 
The campaign was “not a one-time sweep,” either, Simpson said in a news release. The department will “aggressively pursue bad actors until the hemp industry gets the message.”
“We applaud those efforts and encourage further actions in that regard,” Sherman said. However, he asked for “consistency and clarity.”
The state should provide “Bright, yet workable, lines for compliance,” he said. 
Li Massie of Akerman LLP, representing hemp beverage companies, said investigators looking at the same product at different stores have come to different conclusions as to what is a cartoon, likening the process to a “gamble” for companies. 
“Too much discretion means that industry members are not able to properly plan ahead for compliance,” Massie said, noting the potential for First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment concerns.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Week after week, a teenage Brandon Long sat through counseling sessions that he said framed his identity as a failure.
Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.
In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
 ‘The world has changed’

While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.
Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
 Free speech argument

Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
 A Republican loss

In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

Sarah Stevens’ campaign for North Carolina Supreme Court has returned donations from lobbyists following multiple news reports and a complaint to the State Board of Elections.
Paul Shumaker, an advisor to Stevens’ campaign, confirmed that donations from Harold Brubaker and Andy Munn, both registered lobbyists, had been returned.
Shumaker added that under “the equity of the law,” Stevens’ opponent — incumbent Associated Justice Anita Earls — “is allowed to accept contributions from lobbyists for her campaign committee.”
WRAL first reported that Stevens’ campaign would return the donations. NC Newsline initially highlighted the donation by Brubaker last week.
North Carolina law allows donations to judicial candidates from lobbyists. But it prohibits registered lobbyists from contributing to sitting legislators’ campaigns, regardless of the office the legislator is seeking. And it bars lawmakers from soliciting or accepting such donations.
Bob Hall, a longtime campaign finance watchdog, has filed a complaint with the board asking them to rule that the donation violated state law.

“For the past six months, Corewell has been forcing Teamsters nurses to exhaust their accrued paid time off before allowing them to use unpaid leave for negotiation dates,” Mike Smith, lead negotiator and trustee of Local 2024, said in a statement. “This is another attempt to target and attack unionized workers who want to fight for fair treatment. We will not back down until we get these nurses what they deserve.”
According to the union, July negotiations brought progress, with the committee securing a memorandum of agreement to provide teamsters nurses with retroactive economic benefits including a March 2025 general wage increase, the base pay market review and tier adjustments for advanced practice providers, a $250 bonus, shift differential and shift premium increases and matching contributions to workers’ 403(b) retirement plan.
However, the union says their fight is far from over. The next collective bargaining dates are scheduled for Sept. 17 and 18. 
In a statement, Royal Oak-based Corewell Health, which was formerly known as Beaumont Health, said they are continuing to bargain in good faith and remain focused on reaching an agreement. 
“We declined the union’s proposal to treat their bargaining committee members differently than our other team members. Our policies require team members to use paid time-off when they choose to be away from work, and we don’t intend to deviate from our policy,” the statement reads. “We remain committed to working with their committee members to accommodate their schedules whenever possible, including allowing them the opportunity to switch their schedule when possible consistent with staffing and patient care needs, as many of the committee members have done.”

With its global headquarters in Louisville, GE Appliances said Wednesday the first phase of investments will begin at plants in Kentucky, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina. As part of the investment, the company plans to expand its air conditioning and water heating portfolio, increase product production and “further modernize” 11 manufacturing plants in the U.S.
The investment is the second-largest in GE Appliances’ history and U.S. appliance history, the company said. The largest was the establishment of Appliance Park in Louisville during the 1950s. 
GE Appliances announced a $490 million investment to manufacture combo washer/dryers and front-load washers in Louisville earlier this year as part of the first phase of investment. That is expected to create 800 new jobs. 
“We are defining the future of manufacturing at GE Appliances by investing in our plants, people, and communities,” said Kevin Nolan, president and CEO of GE Appliances, in a press release. “No other appliance company over the last decade has invested more in U.S. manufacturing than we have, and our $3 billion, five-year plan shows that our commitment to U.S. manufacturing will continue into the future.”
Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear praised the investment Wednesday morning. He said the company “established Kentucky as America’s destination for advanced manufacturing and job creation” and the planned investment “shows this iconic company’s unwavering belief in the commonwealth and the role we play in their success.” 
“This new investment highlights Kentucky’s ability to support world-class companies with a talented, skilled workforce and the resources needed to not just succeed, but thrive,” Beshear said. “The continued investment and support from GE Appliances in the Louisville community and across the commonwealth are important factors in our efforts to build a better Kentucky for the future.”
The news comes on the heels of other domestic manufacturing plans announced in Kentucky in recent days. Ford Motor Company said Monday it will invest nearly $2 billion to convert a longtime auto manufacturing plant in Louisville to build electric vehicles from a new platform adaptable to multiple vehicle types, aiming to launch a mid-sized EV pickup truck by 2027.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Though Utah’s rate of homelessness remains below the national average, a new report shows the state’s homeless population is continuing to rise — and the start of 2025 marked a significant uptick.
“It’s a big jump,” Wayne Niederhauser, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox’s state homeless coordinator, told Utah News Dispatch ahead of the report’s release Wednesday. “We haven’t seen that kind of jump for years.” 
The annual 2025 Point-in-Time Count — which is a national tally of sheltered and unsheltered people on a single night in January — showed 4,584 Utahns were experiencing homelessness in January 2025, up by 715 people from last year, an 18% increase. 
Utah’s homelessness rate is now 13 per 10,000 people, up from 11 per 10,000. But even though Utah is one of the fastest-growing states in the nation and has faced skyrocketing housing prices over the past five years, its rate of homelessness is still well below the 2024 national rate, which was 23 per 10,000. 
Though Niederhauser said it’s concerning to see an 18% jump, he said there is a “silver lining.”
“The silver lining is that 95% of those extra individuals were in shelter and not unsheltered,” he said. 
Under Code Blue temps and increased camping enforcement, volunteers count Utah homeless 

In the past several years, Niederhauser said Utah has typically seen only a 4% or 5% rate increase, but about 80% of those people were unsheltered. This year, he said, “the good part about that data point is that most of those individuals were sheltered.”
Of the 715 additional people experiencing homelessness during the 2025 Point-in-Time Count, 677 (95%) were sheltered and 38 (5%) were unsheltered, which the Utah Office of Homeless Services described in the report’s key findings as a “dramatic shift” from 2024, when that year’s count rose by 131 people, but only 23 (18%) were sheltered while 108 (82%) were unsheltered. 
“This year’s dramatic increase in sheltered individuals compared to unsheltered is largely attributed to the expansion of winter shelter capacity, which allowed more individuals experiencing homelessness to access shelter,” the report says. 
This year’s Point-in-Time Count took place during Code Blue temperatures, which prompted expansion of shelter capacity. Volunteers also questioned whether increased anti-camping enforcement, along with the frigid temperatures, could have factored into seeing fewer people on the streets. 
The report also includes several other notable findings, including:

Rising child homelessness: The number of Utah children experiencing homelessness increased from 589 to 662, a 22% increase. Children now make up 14% of Utah’s total Point-in-Time Count, which is still below 2024 national data, when children accounted for 19% of people experiencing homelessness across the U.S.
More unhoused seniors: The number of Utahns over the age of 64 experiencing homelessness rose from 251 to 356, an increase of 42%. The increase, state officials wrote, “may reflect broader demographic shifts,” with Utah’s population of those 65 and older growing by nearly 58% from 2013 to 2023 and expected to double by 2060, according to the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. But at the same time, “more seniors are being priced out of housing, often living on fixed incomes that can’t keep pace with rising rents and property costs,” state officials wrote.
Veterans experiencing homelessness: The number of veterans experiencing homelessness grew by 36%, rising from 121 to 165. “While this represents a notable year-over-year increase, the 2025 total remains within the historical range, falling between the 2023 count of 181 and the 2022 count of 155.

A rise in first-time homelessness: Factoring in not just people tallied during the Point-in-Time Count, but also those who accessed homeless services according to the state’s database, a total of 10,261 people in Utah experienced homelessness in 2024 for the first time, an increase of 5% from 2023. The state’s homelessness data dashboard shows 5,122 people were categorized as “previously homeless,” only a slight uptick from 4,942 people in 2023. In total, the state’s database reported 15,383 people accessing services in 2024 statewide.
To Niederhauser, the report shows even though Utah homelessness is rising — following a national trend of Americans faced with higher housing costs, inflation, and wages that aren’t keeping pace with cost of living — the state’s homeless system is providing options that those additional people are using rather than living on the streets. 
“There’s an increase in homelessness, but we’re addressing it in an effective way,” he said. 
Once a Motel 6, Utah’s long-awaited family shelter is about to open

In the report’s executive summary, Niederhauser highlighted a list of investments the 2025 Utah Legislature made to improve Utah’s homeless system, including: 

$3.9 million in ongoing funding to launch and operate a second family shelter in the Salt Lake Valley. Renovated from a Motel 6, the Family Interim Non-Congregate Housing Facility, or FINCH for short, opened in April.

$5.5 million in one-time funding was allocated for the 2026 fiscal year to expand emergency shelter operations during cold weather. In the 2025 fiscal year, investment in winter response supported 901 additional winter shelter beds, including 256 Code Blue beds and 3,370 emergency shelter nights provided in a hotel setting.
$16.7 million in ongoing, annually adjusted funding was distributed to cities hosting homeless shelters to help mitigate their impacts. 

What’s working and where are more resources needed?
The report showed some progress toward the state homeless system’s goals of making homelessness “rare, brief and nonrecurring,” but also areas where the system is falling short.
For example, state data showed a slight decrease in the number of days people are staying in emergency shelters. In 2024, 75% of emergency shelter stays were 90 days or less, down from 80% in 2023 and below previous years. 
“While this trend indicates people are experiencing homelessness for longer periods of time, most only need short-term shelter support before restabilizing,” the report stays.

However, the average length of stay in emergency shelter increased by 10 days (17%) compared to 2023, “highlighting the growing difficulty individuals face in securing stable housing,” the report says. “This trend underscores the urgent need for faster housing placements and a broader range of exit options from shelter.”
The number of Utahns experiencing chronic homelessness also remains an issue. According to the 2025 Point-in-Time Count, 1,233 were experiencing chronic homelessness — a 36% rise from 906 in 2024. But that group represented 27% of the total Point-in-Time Count, similar to 28% in 2023. 
“This highlights the continued need for supportive services for individuals with disabilities and long histories of homelessness, while also confirming that chronic homelessness remains a minority of the overall homeless population in Utah,” the report says. 
The report also showed, however, that supportive housing has continued to be a “key driver of long-term stability” for people exiting homelessness. For example, state data shows:

93% of people in permanent supportive housing “either retained their housing or moved on to other permanent options.” 2024 marked the “fourth consecutive year this success rate has held steady.”
In 2024, the percentage of people returning to homelessness within two years of exiting to permanent supportive housing declined slightly from 25% to 24%.
“These outcomes underscore the effectiveness of permanent supportive housing with wrap-around services in keeping Utah’s most vulnerable residents stably housed,” the report said.

In recent years, while lawmakers have put more money toward homeless services than they have in the past, there are still plenty of requests for more money that have gone unfunded. In 2025, lawmakers approved some but not all of the funding requests Niederhauser and his office asked for, leaving funding gaps that local officials have had to find ways to fill.

As his office prepares for another budget proposal, Niederhauser said his message to lawmakers for the upcoming 2026 general session in January is to acknowledge Utah’s homeless population is increasing. He also noted that the data shows the length of time people are staying in shelters has increased, indicating there’s a “gap” that needs to be filled when it comes to providing options for people to cycle out of emergency shelters. 
“That’s the service that we really need to focus on,” he said, including additional beds at the Utah State Hospital or expanding capacity in other areas of the state’s mental health system, as well as increasing capacity for supportive housing. 
“That is a good message for all of us, and it’s a good takeaway for the Legislature — for us to really focus on that big gap that we have for some of those services,” Niederhauser said. “If those are available, then the nights (people) spend in shelter goes down.”
For the first time, Utah’s Point-in-Time Count this year also included survey questions asking unsheltered people what type of shelter they would use if available. Its findings said:

610 preferred private rooms
568 preferred “bring-your-own setups (cars, tents, RVs) with shared facilities”
511 said they would use small units with shared bathrooms
356 were open to congregate shelters
236 said none of the above. 

Niederhauser said that survey “confirms” what state and local leaders have been hearing for a long time – that providing a range of options for people will help keep more people off of the streets. He pointed to the 50-bed “microshelter” community that opened last fall as a model that’s been a success, with plans to add another 54 units in coming months. 
“That kind of model we’re very bullish on because the outcomes have been excellent,” Niederhauser said.
He also said those survey questions are expected to inform the design of a planned 1,200- to 1,600-bed homeless campus, which is expected to offer both congregate and non-congregate shelter options.
Efforts to site 1,200- to 1,600-bed homeless campus still underway
Lawmakers also passed legislation to allow the state to use eminent domain powers to “accelerate site acquisition” for a planned “transformative homeless services campus, with statutory authority limited to a defined area in Salt Lake City, northeast of the airport,” the report’s executive summary said. 
State can officially use eminent domain to site a new homeless campus. What now?

Niederhauser and other state officials have been working for months to site that homeless campus (expected to include 1,200 to 1,600 beds), but they have not yet announced what properties they’ve been eying. Last fall, the Utah Homeless Services Board set a deadline of Oct. 1, 2025 for the campus to be built, but Niederhauser said the siting process has been taking longer than expected.
“Our timeline is ASAP,” Niederhauser said when asked about a new timeline for selecting the property for the homeless campus. “We know this is needed. We are looking at several properties, all of which have some difficult situations to overcome, like wetlands. I’ll highlight wetlands, because wetlands isn’t something I can solve in two weeks, three months, or even six months because the Army Corps of Engineers has to be involved in that, and there’s a process you have to go through.”
Depending on the outcomes of those evaluations, Niederhauser said that will determine whether state officials move forward with eminent domain powers to site the campus. He said a new timeline is not yet clear, but “we’re not sitting on this.”
“We are working hard,” he said, adding that it’s been challenging to find a property along the Wasatch Front, which has limited property available that hasn’t already been developed. “Unfortunately, you know, the need is huge. We appreciate the acute need, the serious need of this. So we’re not letting grass grow under our feet. We’re working hard to find a pathway.”

Heather Meyer of Overland Park opposed a budget proviso requiring the elimination of pronouns from state employee email signature blocks. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas state and university employees were told they must remove pronouns from their email signatures and all other work communications as a result of a directive lawmakers inserted into the state budget.
The budget proviso, which threatens constitutional rights to free speech, requires state agencies to remove all diversity, equity and inclusion programming, training and positions. State employees must remove any “gender ideology” in email signatures and work communications.
“I don’t know what was going to be accomplished by this,” said Rep. Mike Amyx, D-Lawrence. “I couldn’t see a positive outcome on it. The potential for somebody to get in trouble because of this bill is real.”
Amyx, a ranking minority leader on the higher education budget committee, said the provision puts state universities and their faculty in uncomfortable situations.
“I don’t even have a direction that I can tell them right now,” Amyx said. “I’m just concerned.”
The University of Kansas announced last month that it would comply with a directive from the Kansas Board of Regents. KU employees had until July 31 to remove pronouns from their email signature blocks.
KU chancellor Doug Girod released a statement July 22 outlining the rules of the ordinance, ending the message stating the KU community is founded on “respect and support” for one another.
The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression wrote in a July 28 letter to the Board of Regents that universities following the guidance infringe upon employees’ First Amendment rights. FIRE said the language in the guidance is overly broad and vague.
“We offered to work with the Board to craft alternative guidance that clarifies the scope of the law consistent with the First Amendment,” the letter said. “However, the President of the Board has told the media he is unlikely to change the guidance.”
The organization’s letter said it will continue to fight for the rights of employees affected by this new anti-free speech law.
Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican who is seeking his party’s nomination for governor, said in a statement he is proud to have championed this legislation, following President Donald Trump’s lead on cutting DEI programming.
“ ’DEI’ programs promote divisive environments that pressure students and faculty to adopt specific viewpoints, undermining academics and setting Kansas universities back,” Masterson said.
Rep. Heather Meyer, D-Overland Park, said she voted against the budget because of its consequences for minority communities across the state. She said the budget proviso proves legislators’ lack of understanding of the LGBTQ+ and minority communities.
“It’s just deplorable,” Meyer said. “It’s codifying hatred. Universities have typically been beacons of free speech. To turn into this is awful. We just have to keep fighting.”
She said many state employees won’t be able to risk not complying with the budget requirement, especially without a clear understanding of the consequences.
“For people who are actively removing their pronouns and don’t feel safe in keeping them on there and protest, there’s absolutely no judgment about that,” Meyer said. “Everybody needs to support their family and feel safe speaking out.”
The Lawrence Trans Coalition publicly denounced KU’s decision to comply with the budget requirement.
The coalition called for “overwhelming pushback” and recommended wearing pronoun pins to work or calling attention to the budget requirement in email signatures.
“It is genuinely harrowing to see them so quickly comply with an anti-trans bill that has no explicit enforcement mechanisms spelled out within the text,” said Lawrence Trans Coalition politics and public relations chair Isaac Johnson. “The implication here is that the Kansas Legislature views the mere concept of disclosing pronouns as political extremism that must be oppressed.”
Some state employees have said the forced removal of pronouns inherently targets the trans community. The bill does not outline what else can and can’t be in an email signature, such as “Mr.” or “Mrs.”
“If a Kansas state employee wanted to end an email with ‘God bless,’ they would be allowed. If they wanted to mention their partner, a holiday they celebrate, their heritage, they would be allowed to do that,” Johnson said. “The sharing of pronouns is a practice meant to signal to others that they are safe to disclose their trans status with them. This ban actively robs state employees from promoting that.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P2250190-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-13 11:58:38.043644
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-13 14:46:23+00:00,CT Mirror,New Haven Board of Ed adopts AI policy for schools: ‘Support but not substitute’,Maya McFadden | New Haven Independent,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/13/new-haven-board-of-education-ai-policy/,"The policy allows staff and students to use AI to review work, research, and brainstorm for classroom work while always citing its use.","The Board of Education voted Monday night to adopt a new artificial intelligence (AI) policy designed to help teachers and students use cutting-edge tech to generate classroom discussion questions, get feedback on assignments, and conduct research, but not plagiarize.
At the same time, New Haven Public Schools (NHPS) has begun to roll out the AI tools Gemini Pro and NotebookLM for administrators. The district won’t make these programs available for teachers until they’re trained in the new district policy, and it won’t make these programs available for students until a dedicated AI security and monitoring platform is in place.
The school board took that unanimous vote of support for the AI policy at its latest meeting, which was held Monday night at King/Robinson School and over Zoom. 
NHPS Asst. Supt. Keisha Redd-Hannans presented a draft version of the AI policy — which focuses on AI use for instruction and in classrooms — earlier in August. 
During a previous presentation, Redd-Hannans said the district policy comes as educators, administrators, and students are already making use of their own AI tools. She emphasized that the district’s use of the now-selected platforms Gemini Pro and NotebookLM should help with retaining teachers by providing additional instructional support, student toolkits, and operational efficiency. 
She also emphasized that while AI use continues to grow and be embraced across all walks of life, NHPS’ policy and implementation plans will enforce that AI will ​“support but not substitute” teachers and critical thinking in schools. 
Click here to read the full policy, which allows staff and students to use AI to review work, research, and brainstorm for classroom projects and discussion while always citing use of AI. The policy prohibits plagiarism or using AI tools as substitutes for completing assignments. 
In an email statement sent to the Independent on Tuesday, Redd-Hannans and city Chief Technology Officer Michael Simeone said that the city and school district worked together to select Gemini Pro and NotebookLM as the vetted AI platform for staff and students to use. 
The system will first be made accessible only to NHPS administrators.
“These advanced tools will enhance efficiency in curriculum planning, policy review, and day-to-day operations, while allowing staff to streamline processes and focus more on supporting teachers and students,” Redd-Hannans and Simeone said. ​“These tools are designed to help staff work smarter, communicate more clearly, and make data-informed decisions that benefit the entire school community.”They said that the district’s AI committee will meet to discuss a professional learning timeline for staff. That timeline will detail when these AI programs will be made available to staff. Once teachers are trained on the policy, they will be given access to the tools.​“The next major step will be selecting a dedicated AI security and monitoring platform,” Redd-Hannans and Simeone continued. ​“This system will be implemented before any AI tools are introduced to the student population. 
“Our number one priority is protecting our students and staff. We will not deploy AI directly to students until we have robust safeguards in place to prevent exposure to restricted content and protect against malicious actors.” 
Once a security and monitoring system is implemented, the AI tools will be introduced to the student population.
Redd-Hannans also told the Independent that the AI tools will be accessible through each person’s NHPS account. That means that, once they’re granted access, students and staff will be able to log into their NHPS accounts through an NHPS-provided Chromebook or a personal device to use the AI tools. 
The set-up process for administrative access is currently underway.
Before passing the policy through a unanimous vote Monday, Board of Education member Ed Joyner asked that the district create school-by-school structures to evaluate and monitor the tools’ ethical usage. Fellow school board member Abie Benitez responded that an AI committee has been established per the policy guidelines, which will help the district oversee what’s working and what’s not next year.

Vermont Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas said Wednesday her office will not be sharing personally identifiable information about voters in Vermont with President Donald Trump’s administration, if the federal government asks. 
The announcement, in a press release, comes as Trump’s Department of Justice has sought voter information from at least nine other states in recent months, according to Stateline. That could include voters’ dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and social security numbers, among other identifying data, according to the news outlet. 
Copeland Hanzas said in the release that existing state law “specifically prohibits” sharing sensitive data about voters with the federal government. 
“The policy of my office is very clear: our office has no plans to share Vermont voter data with the federal government,” the secretary said.

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
Budget bill threatens Mainers’ access to food, health care and other necessities, experts warn

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.

Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

Noorani will succeed Jim Canales, the foundation’s longtime president who announced in January that he planned to step down after 11 years in the role.
The post Ali Noorani tapped as new Barr Foundation president appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE BARR FOUNDATION has named Ali Noorani, a longtime nonprofit and philanthropic leader, as its new president. Noorani, who currently serves as program director of the US Democracy Program at the California-based William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, will succeed Jim Canales, the foundation’s longtime president who announced in January that he planned to step down after 11 years in the role.
Noorani, 52, who lives in Oakland with his wife and daughter, will take the reins on December 1. 
The Barr Foundation was founded in 1997 by Amos and Barbara Hostetter, using proceeds from the sale of Continental Cablevision, which Amos Hostetter co-founded in 1963 and which was sold in 1996. It’s now one of the largest foundations in New England, with more than $2.8 billion in assets. 
Noorani’s “life’s work has been defined by service, and his values are deeply aligned with the values Amos and I hope will always define Barr – including humility, curiosity, and the long-term view that investing in potential and empowering people in communities always requires,” Barbara Hostetter, chair of the foundation’s board of trustees and of the search committee for a new president, said in a statement.
“I am deeply humbled and grateful for the opportunity to lead the Barr Foundation at this moment and to build on its exceptional reputation,” Noorani said in a statement. 
It will mark a return to Massachusetts for Noorani, who served from 2003 to 2008 as executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.
After leaving Massachusetts, Noorani served as president and CEO of the National Immigration Forum in Washington, DC, where he tripled its staff while leading a national effort to engage moderate and conservative voices in conversation on immigration issues. 
“We’ve always thought about this as an issue that’s all about politics or is all about policy,” Noorani said on a 2017 episode of The Codcast. “What I have learned about the immigration debate is that I think the majority of Americans see this as a question about culture and about values.” 
Noorani said it’s possible to find common ground on immigration issues when they’re discussed on those terms. Conversations he had around that time with religious figures, law enforcement officials, and business leaders led to the formation of an alliance dubbed Bibles, Badges, and Business for Immigration Reform. “If you hold a Bible, you wear a badge, or you run a business, you want a common sense solution to the immigration system,” Noorani said on the 2017 podcast. 
He authored a 2017 book about his search for common ground on the issue, There Goes The Neighborhood: How Communities Overcome Prejudice and Meet the Immigration Challenge. He published a second book on the topic in 2022, Crossing Borders: The Reconciliation of a Nation of Immigrants. 
In the 2017 podcast interview – during the first year of Donald Trump’s first term – Noorani said that he’s an eternal optimist, but that Trump’s election clearly made the path to immigration reform tougher. That seems like a dramatic understatement today. 
Barr’s grantmaking is principally focused on three areas – arts, climate, and education. Barbara Hostetter said in a statement that Noorani’s “enthusiasm for Barr’s core issues of arts, climate, and education was palpable, as was his readiness to propel Barr into its next chapter.”
(MassINC, the nonprofit that publishes CommonWealth Beacon, is currently the recipient of two three-year grants totaling $1.25 million to support general operating costs as well as its policy work on Gateway Cities. CommonWealth Beacon previously received a Barr grant to support reporting on arts and culture.) 
“I am personally thrilled to return once again to Boston, a community I came to know and love early in my career,” Noorani said. “My wife, Toya, and I are excited to raise our young daughter as a Celtics fan.”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
Self-driving cars aren’t here yet, but states are getting the rules ready

And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

(Eric Lee/Getty Images)Violent crime in the United States fell 4.5% in 2024, according to a new FBI report, while property crime dropped 8.1% from the previous year.
The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.
Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
Violent crime continues to drop across US cities, report shows

The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

(Getty Images)Indiana’s latest reading assessment scores showed the largest year-to-year improvement since the state began IREAD testing in 2013, rising nearly five percentage points from last year, according to new results released Wednesday.
The new data revealed that 87.3% of third graders — about 73,500 out of more than 84,000 students statewide — demonstrated proficient reading skills in 2024-25. That’s roughly 6,000 more proficient readers than a year ago and the highest rate since before the pandemic.
  Indiana Education Secretary Katie Jenner testifies in committee on Thursday, Feb. 29, 2024. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
The scores were presented by Indiana Department of Education officials at the August State Board of Education meeting in Indianapolis.
“This is a time for celebration, and it is also a time to double-down on our commitment to helping even more students learn to read,” said Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner in a press release. “The data is clear – what we are doing is working – so let’s keep at it, ensuring a brighter future for Hoosier students.”
Gov. Mike Braun called the results “another example of how we are leading the nation in education,” adding that “helping every Hoosier to live out their American dream starts with the ability to read.”
Jenner and other state officials emphasized that the record jump follows a multiyear effort to reverse pandemic-era declines, anchored by up to $170 million in state and Lilly Endowment Inc. funding to expand teacher training in the “science of reading,” boost early screening and target interventions for struggling readers.
By 2027, state officials want 95% of third graders to demonstrate reading proficiency.
This year, more than 10,000 students did not pass the IREAD but good cause exemptions are still being processed so it is not yet known how many students will be held back under a stricter new law.
Gains across all students groups
For the first time, scores on the Indiana Reading Evaluation and Determination assessment, or IREAD, improved for every student group measured, according to IDOE. 
Black students saw a 7.5 percentage point increase from last year, bringing their total gain since 2021 to 14.1 points. Students in special education also improved by 7.5 points year-over-year and are up 12.2 points from 2021. 
Among students receiving free or reduced-price meals, proficiency climbed 6.6 points from last year and 10 points over four years.
Hispanic students — whose proficiency dropped in 2024 — improved by 7.5 points in 2025. English learners, whose results had been largely flat for three years, posted a 7.2 point increase.
Earlier testing, more interventions
The pass rate includes students who took and passed the IREAD a year early, during second grade. Under a new policy in effect this year, all second graders took the assessment, giving them up to five opportunities to pass before fourth grade.
In years prior, schools could opt-in to second grade testing.
Roughly 81,800 second graders participated in IREAD testing this year, compared to just under 69,000 in 2024 and fewer than 46,000 in 2023.
During the most recent academic year, 68% of second graders either passed or were considered “on track” to pass by the end of third grade.
The state’s data showed that 96% of second graders who were “on track” last year passed in third grade this year, while more than 65% of those identified as “at risk” in 2024 met the standard in 2025.
The annual IREAD pass rate measures one year’s third grade class, counting both those who passed the test in third grade and those who passed it early, as second graders.
Students are given up to five total attempts at the assessment before fourth grade — two in second grade, and three more in third.
Retention numbers still to come
While the 2024-25 IREAD results show sharp gains, the number of students who will be held back under Indiana’s reading retention law won’t be known until after the state’s Oct. 1 school enrollment “count day.” 
That’s when IDOE will finalize which third graders failed to pass the exam and did not qualify for one of several “good cause exemptions” permitted by state law.
In 2023, 13,855 third graders did not pass IREAD, according to IDOE data. Of those, 7,528 received good cause exemptions; 6,327 did not. Even so, fewer than 500 students were retained and required to repeat third grade.
Indiana’s new third-grade reading retention law took effect for the 2024-2025 school year, meaning more students are expected to be held back.
Under the statute, a student who would otherwise be retained in third grade is allowed to advance to fourth grade if they meet one of the following criteria:

Previously retained in grade three for one school year;
Have an intellectual disability or an IEP indicating retention is inappropriate, with promotion approved by the student’s case conference committee;
Are an English learner with fewer than two years of English instruction, with promotion recommended by a parent-teacher-administrator committee based on research-based instructional practices;
Earned a proficient or above proficient score in grade three math on the statewide summative assessment; or
Have received at least two years of intensive reading intervention and were retained more than once in kindergarten through second grade.


Retention requirements were strengthened in 2024 as part of Indiana’s push to reach 95% third grade reading proficiency by 2027. 
Students who do not pass in third grade must receive additional reading instruction aligned with the science of reading and retest each spring and summer until they either pass or are promoted to seventh grade, even if they advance to the next grade under a good cause exemption.
This story will be updated.

Galvin understands the ideal often put forth that lawmaking is best done through the give and take of legislative deliberation. But he also knows the difference between thoughtful deliberation and bill-killing delay tactics.  
The post Galvin pursuing ballot question on same-day voter registration  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","NO ONE NEEDS to school Bill Galvin in the principles of representative governance and the legislative process.  
As secretary of state, Galvin is not only the Commonwealth’s chief election official; he also oversees the Massachusetts State Archives, a vast trove of documents detailing the state’s history in the birthing of American democracy. And before winning statewide office more than 30 years ago, Galvin served nine terms in the Massachusetts House, where he was known as a master of procedural arcana and political strategizing.  
All of which is to say that Galvin understands as well as anyone the ideal often put forth that lawmaking is best done through the give and take of legislative deliberation and debate. But he also knows better than most the difference between thoughtful deliberation and bill-killing delay tactics.  
That’s why, after years of inaction on Beacon Hill on legislation that would allow same-day voter registration, Galvin filed an initiative petition last week to put the issue on the 2026 statewide ballot so that voters can decide on the question directly.   
Despite countless hearings and discussion on the issue when same-day voter registration bills have been filed over the years, “it hasn’t happened,” Galvin said, summing up the result of those efforts to pass a bill. 
In the most recent attempt, in 2022, when the Legislature was assembling a package of election reforms, including making vote-by-mail permanent, the Senate, which has passed same-day bills several times, included it in its version of the bill, but the House did not. The issue didn’t make it into the final bill that the two chambers agreed on.  
A coalition of groups has been pushing legislation that would have Massachusetts join the 22 states plus Washington, DC, that allow same-day registration. Currently, someone must register to vote in Massachusetts at least 10 days before an election to cast a ballot. 
“Massachusetts has a great opportunity to strengthen our democracy by ensuring that every eligible citizen has a chance to cast a ballot on Election Day,” said Geoff Foster, executive director of Common Cause Massachusetts, one of the groups leading the Election Modernization Coalition.  
Foster called Galvin’s ballot question filing “a step in the right direction,” and said he hopes it will “increase movement on Beacon Hill.” But he said the coalition’s main focus right now is on getting same-day registration passed through legislation.  
State Rep. Carmine Gentile, who is co-sponsoring the same-day registration bill with Sen. Cynthia Creem, also welcomed the added pressure from Galvin’s move to put the question on the ballot.   
“Between the ballot petition and this bill, hopefully this will be the session that it gets through,” he said. Not allowing same-day registration is “an unnecessary barrier to allowing people who should be able to vote to vote,” said Gentile, a Sudbury Democrat. He said studies show same-day registration increases turnout by anywhere from 3 to 11 percent.  
Galvin says he’s had discussion with some labor leaders who could help mount the signature-gathering drive needed to get the question on the ballot. 
Why the same-day bill has stalled repeatedly in the House isn’t clear. Some Beacon Hill watchers speculate that the motive is simple self-preservation – that incumbent lawmakers are concerned it could disrupt established voting patterns that have served them well, with a challenger drawing new voters to the polls on Election Day.  
“It puts a little more uncertainty into things,” Gentile said. “I’m sure that is a consideration of some legislators. Hopefully we’ll get beyond that.”  
For his part, Galvin would only say, “There’s obviously opposition from people who are in a position to be influential.”  
The bill filed by Gentile and Creem was referred to the Joint Committee on Election Laws, where a hearing on it has not yet been scheduled. Rep. Daniel Hunt, the House co-chair of the committee, did not return a message on Tuesday. 
Galvin has in the past said he supports same-day registration but raised concerns about  logistical issues in implementing it that he now says have been addressed. While there was concern in the past over the ability of local election officials to manage same-day registration, Galvin said adopting the reform would actually relieve local officials of a huge administrative burden.  
Currently, if someone appears at a polling place where they claim to be registered, but where there is no record to support that, they are allowed to cast a “provisional” ballot. Before counting the ballot, local officials must pore over records in the ensuing days to determine whether there was an error and the person had been duly registered.  
“We had clerks who were literally tied up for days,” Galvin said of the task of going over provisional ballots after an election. As evidence that same-day registration would make election operations smoother, Galvin pointed to the fact that the town clerk in Framingham provided one of the 10 signatures from registered voters he was required to submit with the filing of an initiative petition.  
Gentile said Galvin’s support should allay any concerns that same-day registration could jeopardize the integrity of the election process. “He’s the gold standard for election experts nationwide,” Gentile said of Galvin, who is the longest-serving chief state election official in the country.  
Foster, the Common Cause leader, said Massachusetts has made lots of progress in promoting voter participation. Along with the 2022 bill that made permanent the pandemic-driven adoption of voting by mail, in 2018, the state passed automatic voter registration, which registers eligible residents when they interact with the Registry of Motor of Vehicles or certain state health agencies. Of the push for same-day registration, Foster said, “This is the one reform that remains unfinished.”

Conservative judges might allow lawmakers to reinstate the practice of conversion therapy, which aims to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. (Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Week after week, a teenage Brandon Long sat through counseling sessions that he said framed his identity as a failure.
Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.
In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
 
‘The world has changed’
While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.
Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
 
Free speech argument
Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
 
A Republican loss
In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Week after week, a teenage Brandon Long sat through counseling sessions that he said framed his identity as a failure.
Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.
In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.

Mariners using the Bering Strait are largely abiding by guidelines and rules established in 2018 to protect sensitive areas from disturbances, according to a newly published study by researchers from the University of Alaska Anchorage and Michigan State University.
There, recommended shipping lands and designated “areas to be avoided,” around ecologically sensitive sites, were established by the International Maritime Organization in response to a joint U.S.-Russia initiative. The IMO is an agency of the United Nations responsible for improving the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution from ships.
The study analyzed transit records from 2015 to 2022 that were collected by the Marine Exchange of Alaska, a nonprofit marine organization. It found good adherence to the recommended shipping lanes and a decided shift away from use of territory in the designated areas to be avoided.
The attention to the new IMO-approved standards, which include some mandatory rules for certain large vessels but are mostly advisory guidelines, is a piece of good news during strained times, the study’s lead author said.
“It is really encouraging to see that having these voluntary things do affect how vessels are operating in the region,” said Izabella R. Block of UAA’s Institute of Social and Economic Research.
Marine shipments through the Bering Strait have increased dramatically since 2010, rising from 242 in total that year to 665 in 2024, according to the Marine Exchange of Alaska. The Juneau-based organization tracks vessel traffic and provides information to enhance safety.

(Image provided by NASA/his image was acquired on June 2, 2017, by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the NASA-NOAA Suomi NPP satellite)
 

	While traffic has increased overall, the mix of vessels is different on either side of the maritime border. In 2024, for example, tankers accounted for the largest slice of Russian Bering Strait vessel traffic; the strait is an important passageway for ships carrying Russian liquefied natural gas to Asian markets. On the Alaska side, tugs and towing vessels accounted for the biggest slide of 2024 Bering Strait transits in 2024. The Russian side had a higher proportion of cargo- and fishing-related transits through the strait in 2024; the Alaska side had a higher proportion of passenger vessels traveling there last year, according to the Marine Exchange of Alaska’s data.
Many of those types of vessels were already using the recommended traffic lanes prior to 2018, Block said. Because of that, shifts to those lanes might be subtle. The shifts away from the designated areas to be avoided are more noticeable, particularly for cargo ships, tankers and tugs, she said.
The study also found that vessels that use the strait frequently are more likely to stick to the rules and guidelines.
“It was really interesting to see that those that transit the region more often tended to have higher rates of abiding by the policy than those that transit it, like, once out of the eight years,” Block said. That points to a possible need for more mariner education, she said.
Exchanges and cooperation, which flourished in the immediate post-Soviet era, nosedived after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. and other nations imposed sanctions on Russia and excluded that nation from past levels of participation in international forums like the eight-nation Arctic Council. And even before 2022, relations between the U.S. and Russia had soured, in part because of Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region.
But some amount of international cooperation is needed in the Bering Strait because there is so much at stake, Arctic experts say.
The strait, a little more than 50 miles wide at its narrowest point – and with only 2.4 miles separating Russiamar’s Big Diomede Island from Alaska’s Little Diomede Island – is the narrow Pacific gateway to the Arctic.
Indigenous communities on both sides of the strait have deep roots and cultures that depend on healthy natural resources.

	With whales, walruses and other animals using it to pass between the Bering Sea below the Arctic Circle and the Chukchi Sea above it, the strait is a “marine mammal superhighway,” in the words of Margaret Williams, a senior fellow at the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government’s Arctic Initiative and a veteran of Alaska-Russia conservation efforts. It is also one of the key global flyways for migratory birds that spend their breeding seasons in the full-daylight summer days of the Arctic, she pointed out.
At the same time, it has become a place of new international tension.
Russia has been expanding its Arctic military presence over recent years, including in the Bering Strait region, with expanded facilities and more exercises.
China also poses some potential security concerns in the region. It has engaged in joint operations with Russia, and the U.S. Coast Guard said last week that it is monitoring two Chinese research vessels that crossed through the Bering Strait into the Chukchi Sea off northwestern Alaska.
The U.S. may also be increasing its military presence as well in the Bering Sea and, by extension, the Bering Strait. U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and others are recommending the reopening of a shuttered U.S. Navy station on Adak Island in the Aleutian chain.
Mike Sfraga, former chair of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission and the former U.S. Arctic ambassador at large, said the adversarial atmosphere presents new dangers. Lack of communication across borders – or miscommunication – could lead to unintended disasters, Sfraga said.
“I worry about things like an oil spill in the Bering Strait, because that would devastate communities and regions,” he said at the recently convened Arctic Encounter Summit in Anchorage. He was among several experts who attended the conference held at the end of July.
John Holdren, who served as the senior White House science adviser in former President Barack Obama’s administration, said the end to most scientific cooperation and exchange has been bad for science around the Arctic, where the impacts of climate change are amplified.

	“It’s been very slow, very difficult, and extremely damaging to progress on issues about pan-Arctic change, in a circumstance where Russia has the largest territory, the largest territorial water, the most permafrost, the most people in the Arctic,” Holdren said during a breakout session at the Arctic Encounter event.
Still, there are “some reasons for hope” for continued cooperation, said Holdren, who is now a research professor at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, where he holds a leadership role at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
Holdren pointed out that even in the Cold War era, the U.S. and Soviet Union found common ground in the Bering Strait region and managed to cooperate on specific issues of safety and conservation. As long as war in Ukraine continues, such cooperation will be limited – but still possible, at least on the lower regional level rather than on the high-profile national level, he said.
Block said that type of cooperation and communication seems to be underway among Bering Strait mariners.
“There is cooperation. I think it’s just kind of a quiet cooperation,” she said.
A next step, Block said, could be the expansion of protections in the strait. The 2018 rules and guidelines did not include a designated area to be avoided around the two Diomede Islands, she noted. While the designated shipping lanes provide some protection for the islands, some experts have argued that establishing a formal buffer would be a logical next step toward Bering Strait maritime safety.
Block said she “fully” supports that idea, based on input she has heard from people who live on Little Diomede.
“They get so much traffic that just goes right by, and they get traffic that basically just zigzags in front of the island, like kind of killing time, to their next port,” she said. Local people say the ship traffic has changed the character of the beach, Block said, making it more pebbly than sandy.
  The Indigenous village of Diomede sits in the middle of the Bering Strait, on the U.S. side. Some experts want to establish a new designation “area to be avoided” around Alaska’s Little Diomede Island and Russia’s Big Diomede Island, which are separated by just 2.4 miles of water.

If the confusion and delays caused by self-checkout machines irritate you, California’s Legislature is considering a bill that aims to bring you some relief during your next shopping trip. But businesses say the proposal could drive up prices.
As CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller explains, the measure would require stores to designate at least one employee to help self-service customers and monitor the stands. Stores must also impose restrictions on the type and number of items a customer could bring through self-checkout, and they would need to have at least one traditional staffed checkout lane.
Proponents of the union-backed proposal say it would make self-checkout stations more efficient. Sen. Lola Smallwood-Cuevas, the bill’s author and chairperson of the Senate labor committee, also argues that it would make stores safer for workers, since understaffed stores are likelier targets for shoplifters. 

Smallwood-Cuevas, a Los Angeles Democrat, at a June Senate floor session: “This is about supporting our workforce, to make sure that they’re safe, but mostly to also make sure that they’re providing the level of service that customers expect and deserve.”

But with Californians struggling with the state’s high cost of living, business groups and grocers say that the bill would add labor costs that retailers will pass along to consumers by raising prices. 
They also have concerns over one of the measure’s provisions, which they say could lead to local municipalities passing their own stricter requirements, such as the one Long Beach recently enacted that requires stores to assign at least one worker for every three self-checkout machines.

Daniel Conway, a lobbyist for the California Grocers Association, at a June committee hearing: “This seems like a clear example of why Californians pay the highest prices for groceries, regardless of what checkout line they go through.”

State telework policies audited


Office space at the Placer County Clerk-Recorder-Elections Office in Rocklin on Aug. 10, 2023. Photo by Rahul Lal for CalMatters




From CalMatters politics reporter Maya:
Gov. Gavin Newsom appears to have ordered workers back to the office based on vibes rather than data on worker productivity, according to a newly released report from the California state auditor’s office.
The audit, which legislators ordered in May 2024 after Newsom first ordered workers back to the office two days per week, found that Newsom’s office not only failed to gather “important information” about departments’ office space needs and the associated costs, but also did not use any California state worker-specific productivity data to justify its in-office mandate. Earlier this year, Newsom signed a new executive order that upped the required in-office days from two to four. 
The governor’s office also ignored findings from its own telework oversight agency, the Department of General Services, which had collected estimates from departments on how much office space they would need to fulfill the mandate. 
Supporters of work-from-home cheered the report as further vindication for their claims that Newsom’s return-to-office mandates were capricious, politically motivated decisions rather than a true effort to increase worker productivity. Union leaders say adoption of flexible hybrid work policies can simultaneously save the state money and aid emissions goals by reducing commuter traffic. 



Will affordable housing production increase in CA?

With spending cuts to social services and tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the rich, President Donald Trump’s budget bill doesn’t offer much to like for California Democrats. But tucked inside the spending plan is a provision that housing advocates have been pushing for years and could help the state develop more affordable housing, write CalMatters’ Ben Christopher and Marisa Kendall.
Included in Trump’s budget is an increase in support for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, which is the most important federal funding source for affordable housing. California uses this tax credit for low-income projects, and experts say this could help the state double the number of affordable units over the next decade.
Though it’s unclear how much the state’s housing situation will change due to the additional support — factors including tariffs, labor costs and state funding still need to be considered — a state committee that oversees the credits has already approved changes that incentivize developers to make the most of the new policy.

If passed, a proposed ballot initiative to change the way California regulates property insurance would prevent the public from intervening in rate filings and change the role of insurance commissioner from an elected office to a gubernatorial appointment. Find out who is proposing this measure from CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: As the California Legislature became dominated by one party and the state Capitol press corps shrank, governmental secrecy has become more entrenched.
California’s independent commission is considered the gold standard for redistricting, and Newsom’s plan to redraw the maps to benefit Democrats disrespects the will of voters, writes Jeanne Raya, a San Gabriel resident who served on California’s first Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission.

The center, which worked on the Nevada Job Seeker Survey with the Nevada Department of Employment, Training, and Rehabilitation, believes the insights could be useful as the state “continues to navigate post-pandemic economy recovery and braces for more economic uncertainty ahead.”
The survey indicated that over half of job seekers want to work in a different industry than the last job they held, but that they aren’t eyeing the most rapidly growing fields. Transportation, hospitality, and administration were the desired industries. The survey did not document what industries workers had left.
Researchers wrote job seekers’ desires is something the state should consider, because, while those industries are currently dominant, they aren’t growing as fast as other areas.
The state’s fastest-growing sector, health care, was desired by only 15.5% of survey respondents, ranking 7th among the options available. The top three desired industries are expected to grow at roughly half the rate of health care over the next decade.
The CBER survey didn’t break out occupations by subsectors, but the health care sector includes home health and personal care aides, the occupation that has grown the most nationally for at least a decade, is projected to grow more than any other occupation through 2033, and paid a median annual wage of less than $35,000 in 2024.
‘Structural unemployemnt problem’
When asked in the survey what the biggest challenge to transitioning to a new job would be, the “lack of available job opportunities” was the most selected response statewide. Regionally, job availability as a perceived barrier was most pronounced among unemployed people in Clark County
Educationally, lack of job opportunities was cited by nearly 40% of those surveyed who have bachelor’s degrees, compared to roughly 27% of respondents with either associate’s or high school degrees.
Citing research indicating just over half of Nevada jobs require skills beyond high school but short of a bachelor’s degree, the state has  “an oversupply of workers with high school diplomas and bachelor’s degrees relative to demand.”
Southern Nevada has seen strong regional employment growth, the report notes, “suggesting a mismatch between available jobs and job seekers’ skills or interests.”
Transportation was the second most selected answer statewide, but the topmost answer selected by rural Nevadans. It was also the biggest perceived barrier for respondents aged 24 and younger.
Inadequate skills training and certifications was the third most selected response statewide, but the top answer in Washoe County. (For comparison, Clark County respondents listed inadequate skills as the fourth biggest obstacle.)
Forbes last year ranked Reno as having one of the highest percentages of residents aged 25 and up with a bachelor’s degree. Referencing that ranking, the CBER report concluded “the current labor market may not align with the qualifications of job seekers. That is, a structural unemployment problem exists.”
“The influx of tech and manufacturing companies in Reno has created more higher skills job opportunities, but might be limiting opportunities for individuals without advanced credentials or specialized training in the tech industry,” the report said.
Reasons for unemployment
The survey found the top reasons for job separation included involuntary layoffs, family obligations, and health issues.
Being laid off was the most-cited reason for all respondents, but were more commonly cited by those with lower levels of education and Hispanic Nevadans.
Among the short-term unemployed — that is, people who’ve been unemployed for fewer than six months — family obligations were the leading reason cited for leaving their last job: 23.8%.
CBER noted that, while family obligations can include elder care or other types of care, its prevalence as a reason cited for unemployment was most pronounced for people with children. It was the top reason cited by parents with one child, and a close second (behind involuntary layoff) for those with two to four children. Those findings align with similar surveys conducted nationally, according to researchers.
Previous surveys have found that employers are aware that childcare issues are a barrier to employer retention and recruitment.
CBER found that women’s employment is disproportionately impacted by family obligations: 22.5% of women cited them as the reason for leaving their last job, compared to 14.8% of men.
Behind layoffs and family obligations were health-related factors: 16.7% of respondents cited it as the leading cause. CBER noted that no demographics stood out as being more impacted, “indicating that personal health concerns can affect individuals broadly.”
The results on separations differed from the year prior. In 2023, involuntary layoff was also ranked first, but made up a smaller share — 21.4% in 2024 compared to 15% in 2023. Family obligations was the third most common reason cited in 2023, behind “work environment,” which dropped to the fifth most common reason.

This story was originally reported The 19th.
“In my ideal society, we would vote as households,” a pastor tells CNN. “And I would ordinarily be the one that would cast the vote, but I would cast the vote having discussed it with my household.”
Another agrees, saying he’d back an end to a woman’s right to vote: “I would support that, and I’d support it on the basis that the atomization that comes with our current system is not good for humans.”
The discussion of 19th Amendment rights was part of a news segment focused on Doug Wilson — a self-proclaimed Christian nationalist pastor based in Idaho — that was reposted to X by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The secretary is among Wilson’s supporters, and his involvement with Wilson’s denomination highlights how a fringe conservative evangelical Christian belief system that questions women’s right to vote is gaining more traction in the Republican Party.
Kristin Du Mez, a professor of history at Calvin University and author of “Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation,” said Wilson’s broader vision of Christian nationalism has gotten more attention over the past several years, alongside President Donald Trump’s rise to power.
“He was a fairly fringe figure, but this moment was really his moment,” she said. “And then as part of that, also, I think he signaled and gave permission to others that they didn’t need to hide some of their more controversial views, such as, should women have the vote? And that’s something that you didn’t hear proudly promoted from very many spaces, even just a handful of years ago.”
In the CNN interview, Wilson said he’d like to see the United States become a Christian and patriarchal country. He advocates for a society where sodomy is criminalized and women submit to their husbands and shouldn’t serve in combat roles in the military — a belief Hegseth has also publicly shared in the past though walked back during his confirmation hearings.
Hegseth appeared to support the nearly seven-minute interview with the caption, “All of Christ for All of Life.” Wilson has built an evangelical empire over the past 50 years that is centered in Moscow, Idaho, and now spans more than 150 congregations across four continents — including a new church in Washington, D.C. In July, Hegseth and his family attended the inaugural service at Christ Church, according to CNN.
“The Secretary is a proud member of a church affiliated with the Congregation of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC), which was founded by Pastor Doug Wilson,” Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesperson, said in a statement to The 19th. “The Secretary very much appreciates many of Mr. Wilson’s writings and teachings.”
Du Mez said Wilson built his brand as a vocal critic of mainstream evangelicalism.
“They were too wishy washy,” Du Mez said, referring to Wilson’s view of much of White evangelicalism in the 1990s and early 2000s. “They were too soft. And so he was kind of bringing a harsher biblical truth, and that included things like a much more rigid application of biblical patriarchy. ”
In 2024, only 1 in 10 Americans qualified as Christian nationalism adherents, according to the Public Religion Research Institute.
Ryan Dawkins, an assistant professor of political science at Carleton College, said Christian nationalism hasn’t necessarily gotten more popular in the past 20 years. But there have been partisan trends.
“While they used to be more evenly divided between the two parties, over the last two decades, Christian nationalists have sorted into the Republican Party at incredibly high rates,” Dawkins said. “Christian nationalism is almost non-existent within the Democratic Party today, at least among White Democrats.”
While it’s still far from a mainstream opinion, several figures within the Republican Party have flirted with the idea of repealing the 19th Amendment.
Paul Ingrassia, who Trump nominated to lead the Office of Special Counsel, suggested approval for the idea in a 2023 podcast. Podcast host Alan Jacoby told Ingrassia that his own wife is the “biggest misogynist this side of the Mississippi, by the way. My wife literally thinks women should not vote.”
Ingrassia responded, “She’s very based,” a term expressing support for a bold opinion.
During the 2020 Republican National Convention, Republicans featured anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson, who has advocated for a new kind of voting system where households, not individuals, would cast votes. Head-of-household voting has historically disenfranchised women and people of color by concentrating power on the male leaders of the home.
In the leadup to the 2016 presidential election, FiveThirtyEight, a political forecasting site, shared data that suggested if women didn’t vote, Trump would win. The hashtag #repealthe19th — a reference to the 19th Amendment, which grants women the right to vote — quickly went viral.
And a former Trump-backed Michigan candidate for the U.S. House who has also held positions in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development was found to have made statements criticizing women’s suffrage while in college at Stanford University in the early 2000s. John Gibbs, now an assistant secretary at the agency, said that the country had been damaged by the 19th Amendment because women’s suffrage had led to an increase in the size and scope of the government. He added that women making up half of the population wasn’t enough reason for women’s suffrage. Gibbs’ 2022 congressional campaign denied he opposed women’s right to vote.
Kelly Marino, associate teaching professor at Sacred Heart University and author of “Votes for College Women: Alumni, Students and the Woman Suffrage Campaign” said that while conservative religious sects adamantly opposed to women’s suffrage have always existed, now there is renewed momentum.
“If you look at the way things played out in the past, we have this very liberal period followed by a conservative backlash,” Marino said. “And that’s what’s going on now. You have this period of liberalism where people were having a more expansive view of gender ideology, ideas about sexuality and women in politics. We had some pretty prominent female politicians that were making it pretty far in the last couple of years. And now there’s a backlash.”
Marino said the conservative backlash is reminiscent of the 1960s and 70s. There were significant progressive movements for civil rights, women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights and environmental protections. But at the same time, the early 1970s saw the emergence of the men’s liberation movement, which focused primarily on issues like divorce law and child custody.
“There’s some men who are promoting a sort of return to tradition, a patriarchal vision for society,” Marino said. “It’s always sort of there, but it’s gaining traction within mainstream consciousness again. And now, you have all this stuff about soft girls and tradwives — this gender ideal of women being the domestic homemaker within a traditional family structure. There’s been a big push for this radical Christianity and some of its values — it’s become really popular even among younger people.”
Joseph Slaughter, an assistant professor of history at Wesleyan University, said Wilson is having his moment in the spotlight — but it’s important to remember that he does not speak for the majority.
“He delights in upsetting people or saying transgressive, un-PC things,” Slaughter said. “Ten years ago, when he posted a video talking about man’s biblical duties — people just sort of yawned and dismissed him. Now, he’s saying things and they’re gaining more currency because of some of this other new right-wing masculinity and the online manosphere.”
Slaughter said it’s particularly concerning that Wilson’s teachings have found their support in a man as powerful as Hegseth.
“What does it mean for somebody who’s running an organization which has had its struggles over the years integrating women and trying to understand existential questions about women’s role in combat?” Slaughter said. “Are Hegseth’s views reinforced by his religion now? Does this church reinforce his cultural chauvinism? For somebody in his position, it’s certainly fair game to ask.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/petehegseth_1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 08:56:38.991706

Labor unions are trying once again to regulate self-checkout lanes at California stores. This year’s bill waters down a version that died last session, but businesses still warn it will increase costs and lead to consumer frustration.


It’s been a long day at work, and you still need to stop by the store on your way home. 
To spare yourself more social interaction, you make a beeline for the self-checkout station, praying for a quick and painless transaction.
“Please wait, help is on the way,” the machine’s feminine voice coos, taunting you as you try desperately to flag down a clerk.
Following a failed, union-backed effort last year to strictly regulate self-checkout machines, California Democrats are trying again to set guidelines that they say will improve the efficiency of self-service stations across the state’s grocery, drug and big box stores. 
Senate Bill 442, from Los Angeles Sen. Lola Smallwood-Cuevas, who chairs the Senate committee on labor and public employment, would require stores to have at least one dedicated worker there to help self-service customers. Stores would also be required to operate at least one traditional staffed checkout lane at all times and restrict the type and number of items a customer could bring through self-checkout.
“This is about supporting our workforce, to make sure that they’re safe, but mostly to also make sure that they’re providing the level of service that customers expect and deserve,” said Smallwood-Cuevas on the Senate floor earlier this summer before the bill passed that chamber 26-10. 
But the state’s business community, especially its grocers, still opposes the effort. Instead, without pointing to concrete studies or evidence, they say more regulations will drive up prices due to added labor costs that companies will pass along to consumers.
“This seems like a clear example of why Californians pay the highest prices for groceries, regardless of what checkout line they go through,” said Daniel Conway, a lobbyist for the California Grocers Association, at an Assembly Labor and Employment Committee hearing in June. 
It’s not surprising that  Smallwood-Cuevas, a former labor organizer herself, is carrying such a bill given her close alignment with the two union heavyweights cosponsoring the legislation: the California Labor Federation and the United Food and Commercial Workers. She votes their way more than 95% of the time, according to the Digital Democracy database, and has received nearly $30,000 in total campaign contributions from the groups since 2021. 
Under the measure, stores would have to display signs that limit customers to 15 items or fewer in the self-checkout lanes and also designate one employee whose only assigned duties are to monitor the stands. Notably, the bill explicitly states that stores would not be penalized for failing to enforce the item limit, a condition that the business groups say is nonsensical. Proponents of the provision argue that signs will increase peer pressure and self-policing without strict enforcement.
More items banned from self-checkout
And building on a 2011 law that banned the sale of alcohol at self-checkout stations, another union-backed effort, Smallwood-Cuevas’s new bill would expand the ban to any items that require identification to buy, such as tobacco products, and anything with anti-theft security devices that must be removed by an employee.
Stores that want to add new self-service checkout stations must notify employees and their unions in writing at least 60 days in advance or face a $1,000 penalty per violation per day. 
Democrats have largely voiced support for Smallwood-Cuevas’s bill, calling it a much needed remedy for the headache that is self-checkout. 
Assemblymember Ash Kalra, a San Jose Democrat, scoffed at Conway’s assertion that self-checkout is an efficient and preferable choice for customers and said customers are often forced to use them since stores have reduced the number of cashiers. 
“I don’t know if I can disagree with more points that were just made from our friends with the grocers,” Kalra told Conway during the late June hearing. “You must not be going to the stores if you think there’s an improved shopping experience from these self-checkouts.”

Opponents have expressed concern that a newly added provision in the bill would invite local municipalities to pass their own more stringent standards, as the city of Long Beach recently did, requiring stores to assign at least one clerk for every three self-checkout machines. 
Companies warn that such a patchwork of laws would make it difficult to run stores with multiple locations, creating a burden for both owners and customers.
“Only a uniform, statewide approach can provide the consistency that both employers and employees need to thrive,” wrote Ryan Allain, a lobbyist for the California Retailers Association, which is currently opposed to the bill.
Even though Republicans admitted that they, too, despise the self-checkout process, lawmakers slammed the bill for overstepping businesses’ authority to regulate themselves and raise operating costs that would ultimately be passed along to the consumer. 
Sen. Shannon Grove, Republican of Bakersfield, called it “completely unacceptable” for the Legislature to prevent businesses from introducing automation that could lower costs after committing to an affordability agenda.  
“It’s a labor thing, I get it,” said Sen. Kelly Seyarto, a Murrieta Republican, on the Senate floor in June. “I’d like as many people to work as possible, but I’d also like to afford the groceries.”
Sen. Ben Allen, a Democrat from El Segundo, was among a few Democrats who expressed slight hesitations about the state preemption of local rules but voted for the bill anyway. 
“I understand you’re going to be working with the grocers on that challenge,” he said in June. 
The bill must clear the Assembly Appropriations Committee after lawmakers return from their summer recess on Aug. 18 before it goes to the floor for a vote.

The cars not backfiring. The sirens not wailing. The fireworks not erupting in sonic booms that bounce off hills and peal across valleys. 
This is the consequence of the largest planned deportation in American history. The Trump administration’s goal is to make life as unnavigable, unstable and uncomfortable as possible for people in the country illegally. The administration’s hope is they leave on their own, or with their kids in tow. 
“Self-deportation is a dignified way to leave the U.S.,” the Department of Homeland Security said in May as part of a pitch encouraging people to leave the country on their own. 
What remains are places that used to be: a shuttered restaurant, empty benches on weekends at MacArthur Park and even an abandoned taco stand, meat still on the grill hours later. The silence is the point.
Beneath that silence, behind locked doors, is a population in hiding. They were dishwashers and garment factory stitchers. They sold fruit on the street. This is the echo of the city they left behind.

Los Angeles has always been the author of its own story, from Chandler’s Marlowe to Angelyne’s bright pink Corvette. Now immigration enforcement agents wearing masks, driving cars with license plates from other states, are rewriting the narrative.
LA’s long, nervous summer entered its third month in August, but the immigration worksite raids in June and the smaller number of street-level stops in the following weeks have not brought the city to a standstill. 
But it is a city diminished.
The absences are seen and felt in areas where Latinos are the majority or plurality, and where people are less likely to be insulated by their own wealth.  
That means car traffic is nearly unchanged from a year ago, going by the frequency of crashes, but bus ridership was down 1.5 million rides in June, compared to the same month in 2024.  
UCLA and USC, are continuing to operate on schedule, but Cal State Los Angeles, which caters to a far higher proportion of low-income students, has given its students and faculty the option to take classes online. The school’s provost blamed “heavily armed immigration agents” that left students and faculty in fear.  
Another empty space: The spot on immigration court documents where the names of Immigration and Customs Enforcement attorneys should be. Judges have permitted them to operate anonymously, according to a report from The Intercept.  Asylum seekers and their attorneys must use their full names.
There’s also the missing space on Sergio Espejo’s left hand. The top half of his index finger was destroyed by what he describes as a grenade, fired by the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department during an anti-ICE protest.
In some of the quiet spaces, a small but coordinated resistance sprung up. Most of what they do is photograph immigration agents as they detain people. Sometimes, volunteers with immigration advocacy groups try to stop the detentions, and sometimes they are detained themselves. 
The administration’s goal was for deportation squads to arrest 3,000 people each day — a number that administration attorneys would not admit to in court. In California, according to the state Justice Department, about 3,000 people are in ICE custody as of July.
One of them is Mario Romero, the father of Yurien Contreras, a 20-year-old whose whole neighborhood is waiting for what comes next.
A family retreats
It’ll really pile up on you, if you let it. 
Contreras’ father was detained in the opening stanza of immigration enforcement action, a June 6 raid on a garment warehouse in the Fashion District.
He was the only one in the family with a full-time job. Contreras has confined herself to the house she shares with six people since the day he was taken — she rarely ventures beyond the gate bounding their South Central duplex.

When her two infant daughters are napping, when her brothers are out of the house, Contreras confronts the quiet in her home and in her neighborhood. Strangers are given a wary eye now – something Contreras said wasn’t true before the raids. Contreras said most of the people on her block fear a knock on the door from immigration agents. 
Contreras was born in this country, but her mother was not. One of her brothers, age 4, has developmental delays and appears to be regressing into old behaviors without his father home, pointing and shouting at objects on a kitchen counter but not making clear what he wants.
When Contreras looked for work after her father’s detention, she saw openings for warehouse workers but was afraid to leave the house — afraid for her own safety and afraid of what might happen if her mother had to venture off the property while she was gone. 
“There’s like, no like happy things,” she said. “And when there’s happy things like a birthday that just passed, we get even more sad because my dad’s not here.”
Family friends have kept them afloat by buying them diapers and groceries. In mid-July, Contreras made her first trip to the grocery store since the June 6 raid. 
It had to be done with precision. Her undocumented family members waited at home. She brought her cousin with her – if something happens to her, she wants her family to know when and where she was detained. Her legal status gives her no real comfort — she’s read the stories about ICE detaining U.S. citizens. 
The grocery store was out of tomatillos, something she’s never seen before. 
“You could tell something was going on,” Contreras said. “Back then (before the first immigration raid), everybody was going out, families were together, kids were laughing. Now the markets are empty.” 
She hustled inside the store, armed with a short list. She knew the shelves well enough to get where she needed to quickly. She left as soon as she could. She didn’t really take a deep breath until she was back home, behind the gate.
Contreras wanted to go to school for a certificate as a certified nurse assistant or ultrasound technician this fall, plans that are now on hold. The family also wanted to send one of her other brothers, 16, to a four-year college when he graduates high school, but now wonders whether that’s realistic.

And her anxiety attacks are back. 
“I had already gone from, like, a year and a half without having … anxiety attacks, no panic attacks,” she said, “but when they took away my dad, it triggered it. So my anxiety attacks have been coming back.” 
They kick in every week or two, and at the most inconvenient times, like when she’s already crying or when she’s arguing with her brothers. It feels like her heart is trying to jump out of her throat. Her breathing races. Sometimes she forgets her compensation strategy, which is taking deep breaths, and her friends have to remind her. Her father was good at calming her down. 
“So I don’t really show it to, you know, to my mom either, because I want to be strong for her, for the kids,” she said. “So, it’s like, I can’t talk to anybody. I feel like I can’t talk even though I know I can talk to people about it, it feels like I can’t.” 
She pauses. 
“I’d rather sometimes not talk about it. So when I keep it to myself, it’s, you know, it’s even worse.”
It’ll really pile up on you, if you let it. 
Searching for ICE in LA
Depending on your point of view, MacArthur Park is either a symbol of Los Angeles’ ascent to a truly global city or a symbol of its fall. Labeled as part of the city’s “Mayan Corridor” that welcomed immigrants from Mexico and Central America, its nickname is “the Ellis Island of the West.” 
It’s also a place of intense poverty and the violence and crime that accompanies it, conditions that led the owner of longtime city institution Langer’s Deli to threaten to abandon the area.

One morning this summer, immigration agents arrived at the park in green Humvees and on horseback, a massive show of force to a mostly empty park – word of the immigration agents’ impending arrival got around in the preceding days. Very few people stuck around to watch the show. 
Now, the 35-acre park is smaller somehow. There are fewer people manning its grills or playing music — though the church services held in front of little clusters of folding chairs still draw a crowd. 
Watching from the fringes was a man named Francisco Romero, dressed in an olive green T-shirt, blue jeans, gray running shoes and, on his neck, a red bandana. He wore a large straw hat, visible “so people know where to run to” in case of a raid or street stop.
On a weekend morning in July, Romero’s phone rang. He listened for a few seconds. 
“Put spotters on the 710 and the 110,” he said.
Romero oversees a complicated operation for the volunteer group Union del Barrio, people who have organized and trained since the first Trump administration to resist immigration enforcement by tracking agents’ vehicles and interrupting their arrests, which the volunteers call kidnappings. 
The freeways of Los Angeles are the only practical way for convoys of immigration vehicles to get from their home bases on Terminal Island or the city of Los Alamitos to their next raid, so volunteers with Union del Barrio wait and watch on freeway overpasses, two teams per overpass, observing both directions of traffic. 
At MacArthur Park, Romero was looking for signs that immigration enforcement agents were already on the scene, lying in wait. The first check was all the cars parked along the park’s border looking for what he calls “grab cars,” “drop cars” or “kidnapper ghost rides.” 
“These kidnapper ghost rides, we know which ones they are, and we’re always ID’ing new ones,” Romero said. “You run their plates and there’s no records found, their VIN numbers don’t match. That’s how you know.”
“Drop cars” are the unmarked vehicles parked in an area where immigration enforcement will later show up in large numbers, meant to serve as an advance force blending in with the rest of the cars on the block until they spring their trap and an agent or agents come spilling out, pulling people into the car for transport to a federal holding area.  
“Mire esta placa,” he said, telling an observer to check out the license plate of a red sedan parked behind a black Sprinter van. The van had paper plates. The red sedan had an Idaho license plate. The combination of paper plates and an out-of-state vehicle was what he was looking for. 
Romero pulled out his phone and took a picture of both vehicles. From inside the sedan, a man called out, asking why Romero was taking pictures. 
“We’re just trying to be careful, with ICE out here,” Romero said. 
“I’m not ICE,” said the man inside.
Romero made his apologies and waved. 
Once out of the man’s earshot, he said “that was totally an ICE agent.”
The goal, Romero said, was to be vigilant, not paranoid. He acknowledged the balance is delicate. 
Romero said immigration enforcement agents have tried to detain him at least twice after he and other Union del Barrio volunteers raced to the scene of an ICE raid in a store parking lot. Escape is constantly on his mind. 
His day job is evaluating nonprofits for grant-worthiness.  But under the nom de guerre of Chavo, he delivers orders over the phone, sending people who have chosen names like Froggy, War Machine or Porridge to scope out Home Depots or track a potential drop car. 
“This is a war strategy, so we’re using the language of war,” Romero said. “We’ve been preparing for this.” 
Romero moved on to a nearby Home Depot. 
In the store’s parking lot, a woman named Yesenia was selling Gatorades and mini-donuts. She declined to give her last name but said she is undocumented.

“We’re here because we have to make money,” she said in Spanish when asked about the risk of appearing in public. 
She pointed to a young man seated next to her. “Our kids.” 
A group of day laborers stood nearby, one of them shyly agreeing to speak to a reporter. They were scared, the man said, but they had no choice but to show up to the same places they went before the raids in Los Angeles began. That’s where the work is. 
“There is no option,” he said in Spanish, declining to give his real name. “It makes you have fear but there is no option.” 
Three weeks later, immigration enforcement agents would detain two men who were standing outside the same MacArthur Park Home Depot. Two days after that, agents in masks detained at least two women from behind the same tables in the same spot at the same Home Depot where Yesenia stood. 
CalMatters could not confirm the identities of the people who were taken. 
Where life feels unchanged
The entrance to Élephane is nestled on a leafy, unassuming block in downtown Santa Monica, 10 minutes from the Gwyneth Paltrow-owned Goop store and a half-mile from where Stephen Miller, architect of Trump’s deportation plan, went to high school.

Down a darkened hallway, up three floors in an elevator, insulated by the street, Élephante opens into a modest dining room fronted by a large wooden desk from which three restaurant employees ask guests to kindly step out of the way of the elevator. 
It is just before noon on a Sunday in August. About 40 people fill out three-fourths of the room. The walls, eggshell white, do a good job keeping them hushed to a low murmur. 
This, according to the Los Angeles Times, is a minor evolution in Los Angeles dining. Or at least it was in 2019. Celebrities, sure, but also thoughtful curation of a menu that could have relied instead on the restaurant’s prime beachside location. 
The decor, the owner told the newspaper, was inspired by a trip to the Pantelleria, an island off the Italian coast most famous as the place where Romans banished their unwanted royalty. Longtime Times critic Bill Addison called it “a place to observe plenty of examples of humanity at peak physical perfection” and “the full Los Angeles stereotype.” 
Which Los Angeles goes unmentioned, but this Los Angeles is far from the raids. The closest one was 11 miles away, in Hawthorne, two months ago.

(Photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — More than 300 South Carolinians donated organs last year. Under a federal rule newly set for enforcement, the nonprofit that coordinates transplants across most of the state could fold, putting lives in the hands of out-of-state coordinators, the group’s leaders said.
We Are Sharing Hope SC ranks among the lowest-performing organ procurement organizations in the country under the 2022 rule, which was meant to ensure as many viable organs as possible are transplanted.
But the rating is an unfair measure in a state where so many people lack health care, said David DeStefano, the nonprofit’s president.
If federal regulators shut down the organization — Sharing Hope for short — nonprofits from other states would be able to make their case to the federal government as to why they should take over South Carolina’s organ donations, a role that involves talking to families, getting donors to transplant centers and finding hospitals with patients able to receive the donated organs.
According to the federal agency responsible for the new rule, the change is a way of pushing organ procurement organizations to do better after years of little oversight and no competition. If a procurement organization isn’t meeting federal standards, then another should come in and make changes, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
But replacing Sharing Hope and its 100 employees won’t solve the problems the state-specific nonprofit is facing. It could instead cause disruptions in the system, potentially leading to fewer people deciding to donate, DeStefano said.
Sharing Hope’s federal contract covers all but two of the state’s counties. Donations from Edgefield and Aiken counties are handled by LifeLink Georgia. They are among 56 such nonprofits nationwide.
“I can imagine few things worse than having an (organ procurement organization) from out of this state who doesn’t understand the intricacies, the subtleties, the culture, the people, the environment, trying to run something as intimate and personal as end-of-life donation,” DeStefano said.
More than organs
Sharing Hope was there as soon as 4-year-old Bo Worthy’s parents decided they wanted to donate his organs.

Worthy, an autistic child who loved blankets and had recently started speaking, drowned last month after climbing into the family pool during a brief moment he was unsupervised.
His parents found him unresponsive and rushed him to the hospital, where he was declared brain dead, said Rainee Brewer, Worthy’s second cousin and the family’s designated spokesperson.
Sharing Hope representatives explained the process to Worthy’s parents, answered their questions and stayed in the hospital room as long as possible to make sure the grieving family had everything they needed, Brewer said.
When Worthy’s family decided to hold a “donor walk,” which generally involves friends and family walking a person from the hospital room to the operating room, Sharing Hope helped organize it. In Worthy’s case, more than 300 people showed up to give him a sendoff. So Sharing Hope employees fit them all in the hospital’s hallways to greet Worthy’s hospital bed as it wheeled past, Brewer said.
A Sharing Hope representative even drove to Bojangles restaurants in search of signs printed with the company’s slogan, “It’s Bo Time,” which had become a common saying among the family.
“I felt like (Sharing Hope) really got us through one of the toughest and hardest weeks of our lives,” Brewer said. “I don’t know if we would have actually been able to do that without them.”
That work represents the procurement organization’s central mission, DeStefano said.
The ultimate goal, of course, is for the organs donated to end up with a patient in need, but the procurement organization also plays a major role in guiding families through the donation process and coordinating with hospitals to be sure the organ arrives safely, he said.
He worries whether a nonprofit from another state would have that same touch for the people it serves, or the relationships with hospitals to meet those sorts of requests.
“We are kind of the conduit to that process,” DeStefano said.
‘A foggy lens’
An estimated 4,100 people nationally die each year while waiting for an organ transplant, according to the federal Health Resources and Services Administration. At the same time, 28,000 organs that might have helped those people and others went unused, a 2017 study found.
Part of the problem was that organ procurement organizations falling below national standards had little reason to improve. The organizations operate “essentially as government-granted monopolies,” with little punishment for failing to meet standards and no competition to encourage better numbers, the study found.
Encouraging the nonprofits to pursue “every organ, every time,” as the study put it, was the main goal behind changing the way in which procurement organizations are judged, according to the rule. Under the change, regulators judge the organizations on how many potential donors had at least one organ transplanted, as well as how many organs set for donation successfully went to a recipient. The calculations are based on death certificates.
But DeStefano said those metrics fail to capture the complicated reality of organ donation.
“We need improvement,” DeStefano said. “We need transparency. We need all of us to continue to get better. But we need to do it the right way.”
The pool of potential organ donors starts out small, with about 3 in every 1,000 deaths qualifying for donation, according to the Heath Resources and Services Administration.
A person’s age, health and manner of death — including whether they died in the hospital — all matter for the viability of their organs, said Dr. Tim Whelan, a lung transplant surgeon and medical advisor for Sharing Hope. Any person under the age of 75 who dies of heart failure, a loss of blood flow to the brain, or a cause unrelated to their own health — such as a drug overdose, suicide or drowning — counts as a potential donor under the new rule.
That puts an aging, unhealthy, rural state such as South Carolina at a disadvantage, DeStefano and Whelan said.
Last year in South Carolina, 1,141 deceased patients either registered ahead of their deaths or had family members agree to donation. Sharing Hope transplanted a total of 305 organs, about one-quarter of the total possible, according to the nonprofit’s annual report.
A transplant center might reject a patient’s organs for any number of reasons, Whelan said.
Patients may die of a heart attack, making them a potential donor. But if they die far from a hospital, their organs deteriorate before they can be donated. Patients may have a medical condition not listed on their death certificate that disqualifies them from donating. And patients without access to health care may die with an undetected or untreated disease that wreaked havoc on their organs to the point that they would no longer be viable.
All of those cases would count against Sharing Hope, even if the reasoning was out of the nonprofit’s control, Whelan and DeStefano said.
“That’s been one of my great frustrations, is we are a great organization that’s not getting the credit because we’re looked at through a foggy lens,” DeStefano said.
The changes are not meant to hurt procurement organizations but “to ensure that donated organs are not wasted and reach those waiting for a lifesaving organ transplant,” the rule reads.
The number of donors has gone up in the years since the rule went into effect. In 2021, 24 of the nation’s 56 organ procurement nonprofits fell into the lowest of three performance tiers. By 2023, the most recent data available, that had dropped to 10.
Sharing Hope is one of those 10.
“It is our goal to ensure that (organ procurement organizations) are held to a high level of performance expectations and that all (procurement organizations) are pushed to perform better,” the rule reads.
What happens next
What Sharing Hope really needs is more donors.
During a review of its 2023 transplants, regulators determined that 46 more donors would be the difference between automatically losing certification and being able to make its case for remaining in charge of the state’s donations, according to federal data.
Last year, Sharing Hope received organs from 305 donors living and dead, the most in its history. Whether the nonprofit will reach the threshold to keep operating next year is unclear. Whelan was optimistic that the organization had improved enough to make the cut, while DeStefano remained unsure.
The nonprofit’s leaders are wary of putting too much pressure on families to donate in order to satisfy federal regulators. By design, organ procurement organizations are not meant to face the same performance pressures as hospitals so that families feel more freedom to make their own decisions, DeStefano said.
Coordinators could also try to be more selective about donors in an effort to bolster the ratio of organs the nonprofit successfully transplants, but that could mean missing out on a one-in-a-million match that doesn’t necessarily look good on paper, Whelan said.
For instance, Sharing Hope usually avoids transplanting smokers’ lungs, but every once in a while, one fits a patient who has otherwise been difficult to match, he said. If that lung worked out, it could save a person’s life. If it didn’t, that would ding the nonprofit’s score with federal regulators, Whelan said.
Short of changing the way organ donations are measured, giving the nonprofit more resources could be a better way of improving its numbers than trying to start over completely, Whelan and DeStefano said. Over the years, the nonprofit’s staff has built relationships with hospitals, which a new organization would have to rebuild, Whelan said.
Organ donation is such a personal decision, he worries bringing in a new organization could fracture people’s trust in the system, leading in turn to fewer organ donations, he said.
“The goal really should be to try to give us the tools to improve on those metrics,” Whelan said.
Sharing Hope’s work goes far beyond the hospital or the transplant center. After Worthy’s donation, staff members sent his parents letters to tell them where his heart, liver, kidneys and pancreas ended up.
Worthy’s heart continues to beat in a 9-month-old baby, Brewer said.
“That child has life because of Bo,” Brewer said. “That in itself is a beautiful thing.”

Gov. Newsom should still keep California's redistricting process independent because it's what voters wanted.,"Guest Commentary written by

Jeanne Raya
Jeanne Raya is the head of an insurance agency and lives in San Gabriel. She was the chair of California’s first independent redistricting commission.


In 2008, the Voters First Act created California’s Citizens Redistricting Commission, an independent body consisting of people who reflect the state’s diversity. Good government groups pushed the ballot measure forward, seeking to make sure voters were put first. I served on the first commission two years later.
Voter approval of an independent commission effectively ended the backroom political gerrymandering that characterized redistricting in California for decades. 
Commission members drew new maps with full transparency, giving citizens access to more than 100 public meetings and different ways to submit written comments. Voters could describe their communities, their environment, their infrastructure and their economy, so the commission could create districts giving them a fair chance at electing accountable representatives.  
Drawing fair maps was a challenging yet rewarding experience that took nearly a year to complete. Now California’s commission is considered the gold standard for redistricting, free of partisan self-interest and conducted fully in public view.  
If only Texas could learn from California. There, legislators’ current attempt to rig the 2026 election in favor of Republicans — at the behest of President Donald Trump — represents the basest self-interest of officials so fearful of losing power, all they can think to do is cheat. 
Their determination to stack the congressional deck prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom to threaten retaliatory mid-cycle redistricting in California, to elect more Democrats. He proposes sidelining the independent commission and holding a special election to approve new maps drawn by legislators “just this once.”  
As a registered Democrat, I would celebrate replacing members of Congress who have forgotten their oath to serve constituents and protect the Constitution. But it can’t be at the expense of California’s Constitution — nor its voters, who mandated fair, nonpartisan redistricting.  
Newsom says the threat by Texas Republicans calls for a retaliatory strike. We witness daily the chaos and mistrust created by revenge politics in Washington. That is not the model of responsible government Californians deserve. It’s not worth us expending millions of taxpayer dollars to gamble that different congressional districts will produce the sought-after change. 
Does the governor want to risk losing incumbents in more competitive districts or failing to elect the magic number of Democrats needed to win this electoral war against Texas — and who knows how many other red states?  
Newsom says if the American people are given a fair chance, a voice and a choice, Democrats can take back Congress. In California, the people already have that chance — it’s the independent redistricting commission.  
We know that maps are already being drawn in California while Newsom waits for Texas to pull the trigger. But maybe he should consider a different response to redistricting warfare. 
Rep. Kevin Kiley proposed legislation to ban mid-decade redistricting nationwide. I don’t know what brought Kiley, a Placer County Republican, to this moment, but considering a national solution to a national problem would be a welcome undertaking.  
Californians should demand that Newsom and legislative leaders respect the will of the people and not sacrifice the independent redistricting commission, nor the state’s limited financial resources, for short-term political gain. the State’s limited financial resources, for short-term political gain.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/032619-Fair-Maps-Redistricting-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-13 08:56:38.991706

Gavin Newsom moves forward with his redistricting plan to counteract Texas' push to eliminate five Democratic seats in Congress, Republican Rep. Ken Calvert decries the proposal that puts his seat at risk.","In summary
As Gov. Gavin Newsom moves forward with his redistricting plan to counteract Texas’ push to eliminate five Democratic seats in Congress, Republican Rep. Ken Calvert decries the proposal that puts his seat at risk. 



Last year Republican Rep. Ken Calvert, the longest-serving Republican of California’s delegation, narrowly held his seat against a former federal prosecutor, Democrat Will Rollins.
This year he faces eight challengers, and the possibility that his area, California District 41, could be redrawn to give Democratic candidates the advantage.
Gov. Gavin Newsom is proposing what lawmakers are calling an emergency redistricting plan for California, aimed at turning at least five red congressional seats blue. Calvert’s Inland Empire district is one of those targets.
Newsom floated his plan after Texas began redrawing its political lines to eliminate five Democratic seats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is pushing the proposal with the backing of President Donald Trump, who wants to bolster the GOP’s House majority in next year’s midterm election by skewing voting districts in Republicans’ favor.
“Donald Trump called up Governor Abbott for one simple reason: to rig the 2026 elections,” Newsom said in a statement, vowing to “fight fire with fire.”
But he faces some hurdles. Unlike Texas, where the legislature sets political boundaries, California relies on an independent citizens’ commission to draw voting lines. California voters approved the redistricting commission for state offices in 2008, empowering the bipartisan body to set boundaries based on geographic areas and “communities of interest,” which can include cultural and economic characteristics. In 2010, voters added congressional districts to the process.
To circumvent that, Newsom would ask California voters to approve new boundaries that would remain in place through 2030. He plans to release proposed voting maps next week. Then the state legislature has to authorize a ballot measure by Aug. 22 to place the redistricting plan on the November ballot.
Last week Newsom hosted Texas lawmakers who fled the state to delay a vote on its redistricting effort. And on Monday he sent Trump a letter outlining California’s counteroffensive. “You are playing with fire, threatening to destabilize democracy, while knowing that California can neutralize any gains you hope to make,” Newsom wrote.
Although the governor has been leading the charge for redistricting, his office said the legislature is handling the maps. “That is not something our office is actively involved in,” Brandon Richards, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, told CalMatters in an email.

Calvert didn’t comment on how the redistricting proposal would affect his district, but said the plan undermines California’s citizen-led redistricting process.
“I strongly oppose the scheme being orchestrated behind closed doors by Sacramento politicians to take constitutionally afforded power away from the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission and replace it with a process that would allow legislators to draw district maps that are gerrymandered to benefit themselves and their political allies,” Calvert said in a statement to CalMatters. “A partisan political gerrymander is not what the voters of California want as they clearly stated when they passed the VOTERS FIRST Act and participated in the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission process.”
If voters approve the new maps it could put Calvert’s seat at risk. Previous redistricting in 2021 added the liberal Coachella Valley to conservative parts of western Riverside County, making it a more competitive race. Rollins brought a tightly run campaign and $8 million war chest to the fight and lost by just 3% in November. 
With even more Democrat-friendly boundaries and a wide field of candidates that include business executives, an educator and a pop star, the swing race would likely attract renewed national attention and campaign donations.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052725_Ken-Calvert-TM-GETTY-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-13 08:56:38.991706

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that a group of veterans and labor unions were not entitled to a preliminary injunction that would have blocked DOGE access to their sensitive personal records.
The ruling, by a divided three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, affirms the same court’s decision in April, when it lifted an injunction by the U.S. District Court for Maryland that had temporarily blocked access to the personal records as a potential invasion of privacy.
The circuit court said the plaintiffs in the case — six veterans and five professional organizations — had not shown that they would suffer actual harm if their personal information was shared with officials from DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency set up by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, supposedly to ferret out government waste.
Tuesday’s ruling in American Federation of Teachers v. Scott Bessent marked the second time this summer that the Trump administration has successfully gone to court to lift an injunction in a case out of Maryland that would have stalled DOGE access to personal records.
The U.S. Supreme Court in June granted a stay in a nearly identical case — Social Security Administration v. AFSCME — on similar grounds, ruling that the government, not the plaintiffs, would be harmed if DOGE workers were denied access to government records while the case proceeded through the courts.
In a sharply worded dissent to the June order, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the government failed to show that it would be harmed by letting the injunction stay in place while the case was heard, beyond the fact that “it cannot be bothered to wait for the litigation process to play out before it proceeds as it wishes.” Granting the stay would give DOGE access to what Jackson called “a repository of millions of Americans’ legally protected, highly sensitive information that — if improperly handled or disseminated — risks causing significant harm.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Today the Court grants ’emergency’ relief that allows the Social Security Administration (SSA) to hand DOGE staffers the highly sensitive data of millions of Americans,” Jackson wrote in the June 6 order.
The most recent case involves records in the Treasury, the Department of Education and the Office of Personnel Management, each of which was working to provide DOGE with access to government records on individuals, under an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on his first day in office.
The agencies were sued by AFT, the National Active and Retired Federal Employees, the National Association of Federal Employees, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and six individual veterans. They claimed that “they or their members have personally identifiable information housed in the agencies’ databases and … that disclosing the information to the agencies’ DOGE-affiliated employees would violate both the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.”
They sought a preliminary injunction to keep the agencies from granting DOGE access to the records while the case was pending. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman agreed, issuing the injunction on March 24.
But the circuit court this week disagreed. It said a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy that should be granted only when the plaintiffs can show that they are likely to prevail on all of the issues they raise, and said the plaintiffs here failed to do so.
In particular, the appellate panel said it was not clear the plaintiffs had standing to sue, since they had not shown a “concrete injury” from release of their information to DOGE officials. And their claim that sharing the data violates the Privacy Act ignores the fact that the act “allows records to be shared intra-agency with ‘those officers and employees of the agency … who have a
need for the record in the performance of their duties.'”
DOGE employees would have had such a need, wrote Judge Julius Richardson for the panel, in order to carry out the “broad and open-ended duty” in the executive order that they “improve the quality and efficiency of government-wide software, network infrastructure, and information technology (IT) systems.”
Supreme Court opens door to large-scale federal layoffs

Richardson was careful to note that “we do not hold with certainty that Plaintiffs lack standing” or that the Privacy Act does not apply or that any of their other claims will fail on closer inspection.
“We instead come to a statistically surer conclusion: that Plaintiffs have failed, by a decent margin, to show that they will likely prevail on all of these issues combined,” Richardson wrote. “The district court abused its discretion in finding that Plaintiffs were likely to prevail on each one, and with such certainty that they were likely to succeed overall.”
The appeals court sent the case back to Boardman for further consideration.
In a dissent, Judge Roger King said Boardman’s original injunction was limited and well-reasoned, temporarily limiting access to information that “includes Social Security numbers, income and assets, federal tax records, disciplinary and other personnel actions, physical and mental health histories, driver’s license information, bank account numbers, and demographic and family details.”
King wrote in April that Boardman’s injunction halted “what appears to be the illegal intra-governmental disclosure of highly sensitive personal information. Even a momentary lapse in the preliminary injunction preventing that disclosure could irreparably harm the plaintiffs” by granting “unfettered, unauthorized access to the highly sensitive personal data of millions of Americans, including veterans.”
He said Tuesday that the majority was right to say a preliminary injunction requires a high bar, but that it erred when “it conjures up an even higher one” that the district court could not meet.
“Contrary to the panel majority, the district court did exactly what it was obliged to do,” King wrote. “Specifically, in its thorough and cogent Opinion, the district court separately assessed the plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the contested merits issues” and determined that they were likely to prevail and should be granted an injunction.

The Alabama Aerospace and Aviation High School (AAHS) opened in Bessemer in 2022. The school’s founder, Ruben Morris, previously applied to have the commission approve a new location in May and was denied.
AAHS is open to students in 9th through 12th grade interested in aviation, aerospace and other STEM pathways. The school graduated their first class of 13 students including three student pilots and four mechanics. AAHS ended the previous school year with 146 students enrolled.
Morris told commissioners Monday that he planned to open a new AAHS location at the Birmingham Southern College campus and collaborate with Miles College to increase academic rigor and talked about expanding coursework to include artificial intelligence.
“We’ll utilize an already existing dual enrollment agreement to act as a key catalyst expanding access to advanced computer science education for students,” Morris said.
Morris told the APCSC he had over 80 families interested in a Birmingham location. But commissioners were concerned he wouldn’t have enough enrollment for a new campus. The commission said the Bessemer location  failed to meet the projected enrollment of 365 students.
“The big elephant in the room is if you fail to meet enrollment when you first opened, and you’ve just said more than once that you have 80-plus students ready, 80-plus students is a long way from 145, 165, or even 365 [students],” Sharon Porterfield, a member of the commission, said.
Morris said the Bessemer school is not allowed to use the upstairs portion of the building in which it operates and is not allowed to place portable classrooms on the property.
Commissioners also said they were worried about the retention of students at AAHS due to the school starting the year with about 170 to 200 students and ending with fewer than that.
Morris told commissioners student retention at the Bessemer campus could be low in part because some students leave once they aren’t selected to be a student to fly planes and receive a private pilot license, while others choose to leave because they don’t fit the culture of the school.
But commissioners from the APCSC still remained concerned about enrollment rates and worried about how a new campus would affect the enrollment at the Bessemer location.
“I worry a bit that opening one school, at least at this point, before you build enrollment, up at that Bessemer campus and get to capacity and have waiting lists. That it could actually hurt that Bessemer campus in enrollment, and in growth and strength,” Commissioner Cynthia McCarthy said.
Birmingham City Schools also urged for the denial of the charter school due to a lack of success in major areas.
“Your original ruling was based on well-documented deficiencies across all major areas,” Cedric Tatum, a representative for Birmingham City Schools said. “Including the educational plan, the operational plan and financial plan. And also based on the data that was available at the time.”
Tatum said there was also no demand from the community for AAHS in Birmingham and students in the area did not show they were ready to attend the school.
“No parents or community members attended the public hearings that we provided, and there was no indication that there were any students that were ready to actually attend this school in Birmingham City,” he said.
AAHS will have their first day of school in Bessemer for the 2025-2026 school year on Aug. 18.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-115093584-scaled-1-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-08-13 08:56:38.991706

Several pending bills could expand their secrecy.","California was once a national leader in requiring public officials to conduct their business — really our business — in public.
Beginning with the Ralph M. Brown Act of 1953, which imposed strict limits on secret meetings by local governments, California’s Legislature adopted several “sunshine bills,” as they were dubbed. The Bagley-Keene Act extended the Brown Act’s open meeting requirements to state agencies, while the Public Records Act guaranteed access to all but a few documents state and local agencies maintained.
However, while the Legislature was willing to have the sun shine on others, it largely exempted itself. Thus, “caucuses” could meet behind closed doors to decide the fate of legislation, essentially scripting what would be said in open sessions before voting. Legislative appropriations committees could — and did — secretly decide which bills would reach the floors of both houses and just announce the winners and losers without explanation.
At one time, legislative secrecy was kept in check, more or less, by having two political parties and a substantial corps of reporters. Party leaders could reveal what their rivals were cooking up and reporters could penetrate clandestine deal-making through sources.
However, as California became dominated by one party and the Capitol press corps shrank due to upheavals in media industries, secrecy became more entrenched.
A case in point is the current effort by Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic legislators to draw new maps for the state’s 53 congressional districts with the aim of capturing enough new seats to offset the Republican gerrymandering of Texas congressional districts. California’s new maps are being drafted in secret, a sharp contrast with the months-long public deliberations four years ago of the state’s redistricting commission, resulting in the current maps.
Apparently, the new maps will be revealed briefly before the Legislature votes to place them on a November special election ballot. There are no plans to allow them to be modified before adoption.
What’s happening vis-à-vis redistricting is right in line with the Capitol’s penchant for doing the public’s business in private.
Another example, as CalMatters revealed last year, is an unwritten rule that prohibits legislators from actually discussing changes in their bills during committee meetings, essentially rendering such hearings to meaningless charades.
Still another is the massive project to build a new annex to the Capitol itself. The Legislature has exempted the project from the California Environmental Quality Act and refuses to release details on what is being built or its costs, which appear to be massive, despite the state’s chronic, multibillion-dollar budget deficits. It has also required persons involved in the project to sign non-disclosure pledges to keep details secret.
A pending measure, Assembly Bill 1392, would exempt home addresses of public officials and political candidates from being revealed. While touted as a safety measure, it would make it impossible for journalists to determine whether officials actually live in the districts they represent — something that has popped up numerous times.
Legislators also want to make local government activities less transparent.
One measure now pending in the Capitol, Assembly Bill 699, is the latest of several efforts to allow proponents of local bond measures to omit tax consequences from ballot summaries, but rather place them in voter pamphlets, making them less prominent.
Closing the circle that began with passage of the Brown Act in 1953, Senate Bill 707 would make it easier for some local agencies to conduct their meetings via the internet rather than in person, thus making it easier to mute criticism from the public.
While California’s dominant Democrats often accuse President Donald Trump of undermining democracy, their growing desire for secrecy is equally abhorrent.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/082222-CA-Capitol-08-22-RL-CM-07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-13 08:56:38.991706

In all of 2024, the total number of Washingtonians with concealed carry licenses increased by fewer than 6,000, compared to about 14,000 already this year, state data show.
By the end of July, Washington had 713,195 active concealed pistol licenses, known as CPLs, according to the state Department of Licensing. That’s up from 699,000 licenses to start the year and equivalent to about one license for every 11 residents.

 
Dave Workman, editor-in-chief of the Second Amendment Foundation’s TheGunMag.com, has been tracking concealed pistol license numbers in Washington since 2013. Usually, more people getting CPLs is tied to a fear of rising crime. But crime dropped significantly in 2024, the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs recently reported.
Still, the feeling of being unsafe remains for those on both sides of the political spectrum, Workman believes.
“You see these stories about shootings or stabbings on the heels of reports that Seattle has lost several hundred officers since 2020,” he said. “People look at that and they think, and I think rightfully so, that they have to take more responsibility for their own safety.”
Each month since May has set a new high for active licenses, after the numbers sputtered for a couple years. The number of license holders grew more than 3,800 in July alone. And April saw the most new licenses added in a single month since 2022.
Workman expects the trend to continue.
State lawmakers in April approved House Bill 1163, which will require those looking to buy guns to apply for a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol. 
Applicants will have to pay a fee and have completed a certified firearms safety training program within the past five years, with limited exceptions. Majority Democrats pushed through the controversial legislation amid staunch pushback from gun rights advocates.
The permit system, set to take effect in May 2027, goes beyond the state’s existing background checks, which also require proof of completion of a firearm safety course.
As long as applicants aren’t the subject of an arrest warrant or barred from having guns in the first place, state patrol will have to approve their permit if they meet specific criteria. 
The same currently goes for concealed pistol licenses. Applications can’t be denied, as long as the applicant is at least age 21, is allowed to have a gun and meets some other requirements.
Under the new law, CPL applicants will also need to prove they’ve done a firearm safety program. 
The law, expected to face legal challenges, is the latest in a series of moves legislators have made in the past few years to try to reduce gun violence and suicides.
“And what does the public do?” Workman said. “They turn right around. They buy guns. They go get concealed pistol licenses. It’s like they’re telling the gun control crowd, ‘Hey, bugger off.’”
Since February, Grant, Whatcom, Pend Oreille, Pierce and Mason counties have seen the biggest percentage jumps in licensees. King County, which has the most license holders, also saw a more than 2% uptick in the past six months. The numbers dropped in only 10 of Washington’s 39 counties.

 
The National Rifle Association said the state’s gun control efforts, “coupled with a soft-on-crime agenda, have created a dangerous scenario where law-abiding citizens must jump through administrative hoops to exercise their constitutional rights.”
“Despite these arduous hurdles, more Washingtonians than ever are arming themselves, because they understand that their family’s safety is in their own hands,” said John Commerford, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, in a statement.
Gregory Joseph, communications director for the Seattle-based Alliance for Gun Responsibility, disagrees. He said that, “while more firearms in circulation can increase risk, we believe Washington’s approach to firearm safety makes our communities tangibly safer.”
The permit-to-purchase law will “ensure that those carrying firearms in public are well-trained and continuously vetted, helping to prevent prohibited individuals from possessing firearms,” Joseph said. “By raising the bar for training and oversight, Washington state is making responsible ownership the standard and improving safety for everyone in Washington.”

Commissioner of Education Karla Eslinger told the State Board of Education Tuesday that she was glad to see an end to the “nosedive” that scores took between 2018 and 2023. But she knows the state can do better.
“Now we are seeing an uptick. It takes a lot to see even a percent of an uptick,” she told the board. “Are we where we need to be? Absolutely not.”
Pamela Westbrooks-Hodge, a board member from Pasadena Hills, said she hoped to see more improvement.
“This just feels like we need to revisit our growth targets, understand what worked and figure out where we need to turn up the dial to our growth,” she said.
The results of the Missouri Assessment Program come in four categories: advanced, proficient, basic and below basic. Grade-level equivalence, which is required to be reported in next year’s results, contains scores in the basic and proficient ranges.
In English language arts, 44% of students scored proficient or advanced, compared to 49% in 2019.
Math performance improved, with the lowest number of students scoring “below basic” in recent years. As a whole, 44% of students scored in the proficient or advanced range in math, beating 2019’s level of 41%.
But the achievement gap remains wide. 
The state education department tracks the scores of students who are Black, English learners, free-and-reduced lunch recipients, Hispanic or those with an individualized education plan as a group. The group scores in the proficient or advanced range at less than half the rate of students outside those groups.
Missouri school districts show improvement in annual performance report

The board, with a tone of disappointment, spent part of Tuesday’s meeting examining ways to improve student achievement. The discussion often veered to low attendance rates.
“We have school districts with 49% attendance and that, to me, is not acceptable. So we’ve got to do something about attendance,” Eslinger said.
Her main areas of focus, she said, are literacy and attendance as mechanisms to boost performance.
“We need to truly, truly work on attendance and literacy,” Eslinger said. “And then I do think that we need to look at how we measure progress.”
The current way of measuring performance is too slow, she said, adding that she wants more granular data.
Educators have long been expressing the same sentiment. Standardized test results are one of the factors that determine school districts’ state accreditation and are often cited by lawmakers and researchers to advocate for policy change. But educators compare the test to an “autopsy,” showing what has happened in the past but not providing real-time performance data.
School leaders have advocated for a shift to benchmark assessments, instead of the MAP’s summative format. And schools in the Success Ready Students Network, which is exempt from the state’s accreditation process, have been testing new ways to monitor student performance.
At the end of July, the department announced that the whole state will move toward benchmark tests as part of the U.S. Department of Education’s Innovative Assessment Demonstration Authority Program. The program will allow the state to pilot a new assessment system beginning in the 2025-26 school year.
The department is planning on a “small-scale pilot of approximately five (schools) serving an estimated 100 students each in grade four English language arts and grade five Mathematics,” according to its application submitted earlier this summer.
The new test, which the department is calling the Success Ready Student Assessment, will have a minimum of three checkpoints throughout the school year and is intended to provide more timely feedback to educators and students.
“It just gives us a lot more information,” Eslinger said. “It is so much better for our kids to be able to have that opportunity to really see what it is that they’ve learned and what they need to learn next.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/tests-on-table.jpg,,,2025-08-13 07:58:30.557795

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)“Optically horrible.” A “hard no.” In “bad form.”
Hoosier leaders might be busy taking behind-the-scenes feedback on the prospect of early redistricting, but rank-and-file Republicans are increasingly going public with their opposition.
Statehouse lawmakers redraw districts after each decennial census. They last did so in 2021, and population data shows little change since then.
Indiana Democrats, meanwhile, are joining forces with their Texan counterparts to protest the move, just days after they led hundreds of Hoosiers in a rally to oppose early redistricting.
President Donald Trump is pushing Texas and other GOP-led states like Indiana to redistrict ahead of the 2026 midterm elections to ensure a Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives for the rest of his second term.










I think it's bad form, I think it's inadvisable. It's probably contrary to Indiana law, and I've expressed my reservation about it to some of our elected leadership.


– Former GOP Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma


“On one hand, we feel unlikely as a candidate to approach redistricting. We’ve got seven out of our nine congressional districts (that) are solidly Republican,” said Laura Merrifield Wilson, a political science professor at the University of Indianapolis. “… You would think you would go after states where you get more than one.”
Democratic U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan holds the state’s most competitive congressional district, located in northwest Indiana. The heavily Democratic, Indianapolis district held by Rep. André Carson would be a tougher flip.
But, Wilson said, that GOP strength is also what makes Indiana an “appealing” target from the federal perspective: a “very amenable, very friendly” executive in Gov. Mike Braun and legislative supermajorities in both of the Statehouse’s chambers.
“You’re looking at a state where you could reasonably get the support you need,” she added.
That’s if lawmakers actually want to do it.
Rank-and-file Republicans speak out
Gov. Mike Braun has stayed noncommittal on the possibility he’d call a special session for early redistricting. The next legislative session is set to organize for only one day in late November before coming back in January — possibly too late to finalize maps by February candidate filing deadlines. He’s looking to Texas — and Indiana’s own lawmakers.
Braun noncommittal on early redistricting; decision to depend on Texas action and Indiana lawmakers

The Indiana General Assembly has complete control in redrawing district lines. There’s no nonpartisan commission. A gubernatorial veto can be overturned with simple majority votes.
House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, who lead Republican supermajorities in the state’s House and Senate, haven’t yet made their stances clear. But members are.
Multiple have described themselves as a “hard no,” including Reps. Danny Lopez of Carmel and Jim Lucas of Seymour.
“Just a few years ago, our General Assembly undertook the complex redistricting process based on up-to-date census data, drawing fair maps that ensure every Hoosier vote counts,” Lopez, who took office last year, wrote on X. “We should stand by that work.”
Lucas called the possibility “highly unusual and politically optically horrible.”
“I don’t believe Republicans should stoop to the level of Democrats on this issue. Republicans hold about 90% of all local offices statewide and once the voter rolls get purged of illegals, we will hold an even more commanding lead,” he wrote on Facebook. “Democrats can’t compete with their Socialist policies and ideology and if there are seats that need targeted, we should do it the old fashioned way and campaign harder in those districts.”
Mooresville Rep. Craig Haggard emphasized that Indiana is a “solid Republican state” that has gone for Trump three times in a statement to the Capital Chronicle on Monday. He added that he’s been “hearing from constituents and I do not believe at this time there is an appetite for redistricting in our communities.”
  Indiana’s congressional district boundaries.
WEHT reported that Wadesville Sen. Jim Tomes doesn’t think redistricting is needed right now because the lines are fairly drawn. He similarly noted the GOP is in good shape for the midterms.
Wilson believes the risks are more severe for GOP legislators as opposed to Braun.
They “don’t want to be seen as anti-Trump,” but are “maybe most vulnerable (to) the criticism” since they’d be handling any redistricting legislation — and attaching their names to it.
Former GOP House Speaker Brian Bosma said he’s “glad” lawmakers are speaking up.
He oversaw the 2011 redistricting that involved hearing from constituents in nine different cities before crafting new maps, and was in the General Assembly through three redistricting cycles in all. He recalled how, as a brand-new floor leader in 1995, he resisted efforts to redraw Statehouse districts early.
“I think it’s bad form, I think it’s inadvisable. It’s probably contrary to Indiana law, and I’ve expressed my reservation about it to some of our elected leadership,” Bosma said. “The leaders I’ve talked to, and I’ve talked to the top down, are not thrilled about this prospect but because other states are expressing support for this, there’s pressure to do it.”
Democrats push to prevent
Across the aisle, meanwhile, Democrats hope to sway public opinion against early redistricting.
Members of the Indiana House Democratic Caucus are joining forces with their Texan counterparts to host a news conference in Illinois on Wednesday. Texas House Democrats fled the Lone Star State to block redistricting legislation there.
“Together, the two House Caucuses will explain the serious danger mid-term redistricting plans pose to the legitimacy of our democracy,” a news release said. “Democrats in Texas and Indiana will continue to stand up and reject Trump’s demands to rig an election.”
The Indiana Democratic Party has also been active.
Former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas drew hundreds to an Indianapolis town hall last Sunday, while hundreds more attended a Statehouse protest on Thursday that was headlined by Mrvan, Carson, and an array of state-level Democratic lawmakers.
Indiana Democratic Party Chair Karen Tallian noted both events were organized with “a couple days notice.” She hopes to keep that momentum going, and didn’t rule out the possibility of more rallies.

“We need public outrage and pressure before they ever make the decision that they’re going to call a special session,” she told the Capital Chronicle. “If you could prevent them from calling a special session, … that’s the best possible solution.”
Tallian, who served more than 15 years in Indiana’s Senate, maintains the current districts already offer Republicans outsized benefits, arguing the seven-two congressional split doesn’t reflect the Indiana electorate.
Voters generally went about 60%-40% in favor of statewide Republicans in the 2024 election.
“How greedy can you get? ‘Oh, they’ve got two. We want all of them,'” she said of the GOP.
Tallian said Democrats considered suing over redistricting in 2011 and 2021.
“Frankly, I’m still hoping that we can bring a gerrymandering lawsuit based on their current maps,” she said. “And now they want to come and do it again? It’s just, it’s outrageous.”
The Indiana Republican Party didn’t reply to multiple requests for comment on early redistricting.
Demographic change a factor
Some are open to the idea.
“Northwest Indiana, there’s a lot of people migrating there from the state of Illinois. It’s kind of the first stop over the border from Chicago, (a) good conservative state like Indiana,” Fort Wayne Rep. Bob Morris told WOWO last week.
“If we have an issue there, we’re going to have to get another, you know, essentially a census done in the state of Indiana by an independent source to see where the numbers are at,” he continued.
Mrvan’s 1st Congressional District includes Lake and Porter counties, as well as some of LaPorte County. The trio collectively grew by an estimated 5,824 people — less than 1% — between April 2020 and July 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Indiana, as a whole, added an estimated 137,688 people — almost 2%.
“There’s nothing to lead … me to believe, at least, that things would have changed so dramatically that the congressional districts are not adequately representing their constituents, and at the end of the day, that’s why redistricting matters,” Wilson said.

She called Indiana’s current congressional maps “sufficient” — not very competitive, but relatively compact and homogenous.
Wilson said any changes should be recorded and addressed via data from the next census.
“Every 10 years we do this — whether it’s going to be good for you or bad for you, whether you want to or you don’t,” she added. “… Changing that mechanism means in the future, there’s no precedent. You can say, ‘Well … we want to redraw this right this moment.”
Some fear an effort to flip seats could backfire.
“You can spread out your Republican vote a little too thin so that every few cycles, seats are going back and forth,” U.S. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana told Punchbowl News last month. “And that can sort of cut both ways.”
Others predict squigglier lines.
Bosma said efforts to capture blue districts could undo progress the GOP made in other cycles to make the districts more compact and keep political subdivisions — counties, towns, cities, school districts, fire districts and more — intact when possible.
Map-drawers could “divvy up” northwest Indiana and put Mrvan at risk, he said. They could “run fingers into the center of the city” of Indianapolis to take aim at Carson.
“But … it would not look right, and you’d have to do some pretty serious tap dancing to make it even remotely reasonable,” he said of the 7th District.
Marjorie Hershey, an emeritus political science professor at Indiana University, said it’s “tempting” to look at the early redistricting fight as a “strategic matter of who’s winning and who’s losing.”
She encouraged a broader view.
“Democracy is not self-enforcing. It never has been,” Hershey said. “Democracies do fail, they do die, and we have to take seriously the possibility that that could happen here. Each step has a tendency to make the next step not look quite so bad or quite so distant.”

If approved by both chambers, House Bills 4047 and 4048 would place criminal penalties on the creation and distribution of deep fakes depicting individuals in an intimate or sexual context, and would allow individuals to take civil action over the non-consensual creation of deepfake pornography. 
The six members of the committee in attendance voted unanimously to approve substitutes for the bills and to send the legislation back to the Senate floor for a vote.
Following the meeting, Committee Chair Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) told reporters the substitutes for the bill were intended to further clarify that companies whose technology is used to create deepfakes are not held liable and that the bills’ sponsors, Reps. Matt Bierlein (R-Vassar) and Penelope Tsernoglou (D-East Lansing), had given the substitutes their blessing.
While a previous effort to ban non-consensual deepfake porn was left on the table during lame duck session in 2024, Chang said the policy was fairly bipartisan and that she hoped the Legislature could bring the bills across the finish line.

This story was originally published by The 19th.
“In my ideal society, we would vote as households,” a pastor tells CNN. “And I would ordinarily be the one that would cast the vote, but I would cast the vote having discussed it with my household.”
Another agrees, saying he’d back an end to a woman’s right to vote: “I would support that, and I’d support it on the basis that the atomization that comes with our current system is not good for humans.”
The discussion of 19th Amendment rights was part of a news segment focused on Doug Wilson — a self-proclaimed Christian nationalist pastor based in Idaho — that was reposted to X by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The secretary is among Wilson’s supporters, and his involvement with Wilson’s denomination highlights how a fringe conservative evangelical Christian belief system that questions women’s right to vote is gaining more traction in the Republican Party.
Kristin Du Mez, a professor of history at Calvin University and author of “Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation,” said Wilson’s broader vision of Christian nationalism has gotten more attention over the past several years, alongside President Donald Trump’s rise to power.
“He was a fairly fringe figure, but this moment was really his moment,” she said. “And then as part of that, also, I think he signaled and gave permission to others that they didn’t need to hide some of their more controversial views, such as, should women have the vote? And that’s something that you didn’t hear proudly promoted from very many spaces, even just a handful of years ago.”
In the CNN interview, Wilson said he’d like to see the United States become a Christian and patriarchal country. He advocates for a society where sodomy is criminalized and women submit to their husbands and shouldn’t serve in combat roles in the military — a belief Hegseth has also publicly shared in the past though walked back during his confirmation hearings.
Hegseth appeared to support the nearly seven-minute interview with the caption, “All of Christ for All of Life.” Wilson has built an evangelical empire over the past 50 years that is centered in Moscow, Idaho, and now spans more than 150 congregations across four continents — including a new church in Washington, D.C. In July, Hegseth and his family attended the inaugural service at Christ Church, according to CNN.
“The Secretary is a proud member of a church affiliated with the Congregation of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC), which was founded by Pastor Doug Wilson,” Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesperson, said in a statement to The 19th. “The Secretary very much appreciates many of Mr. Wilson’s writings and teachings.”
Du Mez said Wilson built his brand as a vocal critic of mainstream evangelicalism.
“They were too wishy washy,” Du Mez said, referring to Wilson’s view of much of White evangelicalism in the 1990s and early 2000s. “They were too soft. And so he was kind of bringing a harsher biblical truth, and that included things like a much more rigid application of biblical patriarchy. ”
In 2024, only 1 in 10 Americans qualified as Christian nationalism adherents, according to the Public Religion Research Institute.
Ryan Dawkins, an assistant professor of political science at Carleton College, said Christian nationalism hasn’t necessarily gotten more popular in the past 20 years. But there have been partisan trends.
“While they used to be more evenly divided between the two parties, over the last two decades, Christian nationalists have sorted into the Republican Party at incredibly high rates,” Dawkins said. “Christian nationalism is almost non-existent within the Democratic Party today, at least among White Democrats.”
While it’s still far from a mainstream opinion, several figures within the Republican Party have flirted with the idea of repealing the 19th Amendment.
Paul Ingrassia, who Trump nominated to lead the Office of Special Counsel, suggested approval for the idea in a 2023 podcast. Podcast host Alan Jacoby told Ingrassia that his own wife is the “biggest misogynist this side of the Mississippi, by the way. My wife literally thinks women should not vote.”
Ingrassia responded, “She’s very based,” a term expressing support for a bold opinion.
During the 2020 Republican National Convention, Republicans featured anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson, who has advocated for a new kind of voting system where households, not individuals, would cast votes. Head-of-household voting has historically disenfranchised women and people of color by concentrating power on the male leaders of the home.
In the leadup to the 2016 presidential election, FiveThirtyEight, a political forecasting site, shared data that suggested if women didn’t vote, Trump would win. The hashtag #repealthe19th — a reference to the 19th Amendment, which grants women the right to vote — quickly went viral.
And a former Trump-backed Michigan candidate for the U.S. House who has also held positions in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development was found to have made statements criticizing women’s suffrage while in college at Stanford University in the early 2000s. John Gibbs, now an assistant secretary at the agency, said that the country had been damaged by the 19th Amendment because women’s suffrage had led to an increase in the size and scope of the government. He added that women making up half of the population wasn’t enough reason for women’s suffrage. Gibbs’ 2022 congressional campaign denied he opposed women’s right to vote.
Kelly Marino, associate teaching professor at Sacred Heart University and author of “Votes for College Women: Alumni, Students and the Woman Suffrage Campaign” said that while conservative religious sects adamantly opposed to women’s suffrage have always existed, now there is renewed momentum.
“If you look at the way things played out in the past, we have this very liberal period followed by a conservative backlash,” Marino said. “And that’s what’s going on now. You have this period of liberalism where people were having a more expansive view of gender ideology, ideas about sexuality and women in politics. We had some pretty prominent female politicians that were making it pretty far in the last couple of years. And now there’s a backlash.”
Marino said the conservative backlash is reminiscent of the 1960s and 70s. There were significant progressive movements for civil rights, women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights and environmental protections. But at the same time, the early 1970s saw the emergence of the men’s liberation movement, which focused primarily on issues like divorce law and child custody.
“There’s some men who are promoting a sort of return to tradition, a patriarchal vision for society,” Marino said. “It’s always sort of there, but it’s gaining traction within mainstream consciousness again. And now, you have all this stuff about soft girls and tradwives — this gender ideal of women being the domestic homemaker within a traditional family structure. There’s been a big push for this radical Christianity and some of its values — it’s become really popular even among younger people.”
Joseph Slaughter, an assistant professor of history at Wesleyan University, said Wilson is having his moment in the spotlight — but it’s important to remember that he does not speak for the majority.
“He delights in upsetting people or saying transgressive, un-PC things,” Slaughter said. “Ten years ago, when he posted a video talking about man’s biblical duties — people just sort of yawned and dismissed him. Now, he’s saying things and they’re gaining more currency because of some of this other new right-wing masculinity and the online manosphere.”
Slaughter said it’s particularly concerning that Wilson’s teachings have found their support in a man as powerful as Hegseth.
“What does it mean for somebody who’s running an organization which has had its struggles over the years integrating women and trying to understand existential questions about women’s role in combat?” Slaughter said. “Are Hegseth’s views reinforced by his religion now? Does this church reinforce his cultural chauvinism? For somebody in his position, it’s certainly fair game to ask.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/petehegseth-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 07:58:30.557795

(Getty Images)Long before the tornado siren starts going off, you know a storm is coming. The clouds roll in, the air changes, and the sky darkens. The warning signs of an economic downturn have been rolling in, with revised national jobs numbers showing a steep decline in hiring and companies pledging to raise prices due to tariffs. Surviving this impending economic storm depends in part on the preparation that precedes its arrival, and Indiana has work to do to be ready.
When a person is laid off from a job, our unemployment insurance system is the primary mechanism that keeps families afloat. Unemployment insurance is funded through contributions from employers and serves individuals who experienced a job loss through no fault of their own. The intention is that in the event of an unexpected job loss, unemployment benefits will prevent families from falling into poverty.
Unemployment insurance in the state of Indiana provides individuals a maximum benefit of $390 per week, or roughly $1,600 per month. A recent analysis put the average benefit at $327/week in January 2024, or 32% of the average weekly wage for Indiana workers. In that report, all of our neighbor states had higher average benefits than us, with Kentucky ($498/week) and Ohio ($456/week) replacing closer to 50% of an average worker’s wages. Still, at any of these replacement rates, an unemployed person will struggle to meet their basic needs while they try to get another job.
Indiana lawmakers contemplate slashing unemployment insurance timespan

In fact, Indiana’s maximum benefit falls below the poverty level for a family of two or more. Considering that fair market rent for a one-bedroom is over $1,000 in many locations in Indiana and that the average car payment is $521 (used) or $725 (new), Hoosiers will be hard-pressed to keep a roof over their heads and a working vehicle while they scour the job market. That leaves nothing for utilities, child care, health insurance, food, or other necessities.
The inability of unemployed workers to meet their basic needs doesn’t only affect Hoosiers who lose their jobs. There are landlords and mortgage lenders that won’t get paid, cars that will get repossessed, grocery stores that will see reduced spending, and medical bills that will pile up. Not being able to afford housing or transportation makes it harder for unemployed workers to secure and accept their next job offer because they don’t have a stable place to live or a reliable way to get to work. Failing to address the inadequacy of unemployment insurance benefits will have ripple effects that make it harder to rebound – especially at a time when many other supports are conditioned on meeting work requirements.
Beyond the family-sustaining purpose of these benefits, the unemployment insurance system is the doorway through which workers are connected to programs and tools that should propel their successful reentry into the workforce. With technology advancing rapidly and community needs constantly shifting, the jobs of yesterday are not necessarily going to be the jobs of tomorrow.
A robust unemployment system ensures that people can learn how the jobs landscape is changing and what skills they might need to secure high-wage jobs. It connects them to training opportunities and employment options. This connectivity becomes even more critical in turbulent times. A system with limited benefits that discourages participation also blocks access to these vital supports.
We can certainly debate whether a storm is coming and if we can control the weather. But we all share the goal of setting Hoosier workers, families, and businesses up to survive, and that means taking a hard look at our preparedness and making the appropriate adjustments.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A committee of South Dakota lawmakers endorsed a proposal Tuesday to provide more video livestreaming of the legislative process and heard how water-damaged technology could affect a special legislative session next month.
South Dakota Public Broadcasting — which is part of state government — already provides video livestreaming of state House and Senate floor sessions, as well as meetings of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee. Other committee rooms are only equipped for audio livestreaming.
The Legislature’s Executive Board, which met Tuesday at the Capitol in Pierre, endorsed a $36,442 plan to put video livestreaming equipment in the other five committee rooms. The proposal will go to the full Legislature as part of a supplemental budget bill this winter.
House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, the chairman of the committee, advocated for the plan.
“For the transparency that it brings to this process, to be able to look and see the people presenting, to look at the presentations that are being presented, and also just the awareness of what’s going on in this building during the legislative session, I think it’s great,” Hansen said, “and I think it’ll only enhance that.”
Public broadcasting cuts discussed
Senate Majority Whip Randy Deibert, R-Spearfish, asked whether South Dakota Public Broadcasting will have the capacity to handle the additional responsibility. The organization is considering budget cuts and layoffs after it lost about $2 million of annual support — roughly 20% of its budget — when Congress and President Donald Trump defunded the Corporation for Public Broadcasting last month.
Elijah Rodriguez, chief information technology officer for the Legislative Research Council, said he has assurances from South Dakota Public Broadcasting that it will be able to handle the additional video archiving and management of video livestreams on its SD.net website and YouTube, “regardless of whether they have staff cuts or not.”
House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, asked about the possibility of the Legislative Research Council taking over video livestreaming and archiving duties. The council’s director, John McCullough, said it would require the council to purchase equipment and hire additional staff.
“It could be absorbed,” McCullough said. “It would just cost money.” 
Water leaks damage House technology
Rodriguez updated the committee on damage caused by water leaks this summer in the House chamber’s technology equipment closets. He said the leaks occurred during large rainstorms in May and June while the roof was undergoing repairs. There was about $185,000 worth of damage, he said, which he hopes insurance will cover.
But there’s a four-month lead time on replacement equipment, which is all custom-built. Because of that, a Sept. 23 special session to consider a prison construction plan could be affected. Rodriguez said the electronic board that displays roll-call vote results in the House might not be available, and some representatives’ voting buttons at their desks might not work.
“We are building a contingency plan to have a workaround and still be able to operate in the House just in case that equipment isn’t fully functional,” Rodriguez said.

On July 23, JXN Water disconnected service to the complex in south Jackson, leaving about 20 families without access to running water. Now, the residents have orders to vacate.

Hundreds more Jacksonians could be forced from their homes if the private water utility continues a crackdown that has already led residents in two apartment complexes to flee. 
“We’re not gonna be able to move and pick up in five days,” Glasper said Saturday as officials scrambled to temporarily restore water and deal with the fallout. “We need more time.”
The utility has remained mum about the specific properties where it plans to discontinue service next, though concerned residents are encouraged to call JXN Water 601-500-5200 to get a status update on their property.
Glasper, 44, has lived at Blossom with her mother for four years. She said she doesn’t invite visitors because of safety concerns.
She said she has her eyes set on another complex, The Park at St. Andrews. But that apartment is also behind on its water bill, according to JXN Water.
The utility previously released a list of 15 complexes that had delinquent water bills of more than $100,000, plus 141 total accounts across the city are considered past due. Some of the properties have signed on to a payment plan. The utility said it has declined to name the complexes that have refused and could be at risk of shutoffs, “to avoid triggering confusion or panic among tenants.”
But advocates and caseworkers for low-income and homeless Jacksonians are bracing.
“This is in some ways starting to feel like a practice run,” said Jill Buckley, director of Stewpot Community Services, which is using a federal emergency housing grant to help Blossom residents relocate.

Mayor John Horhn secured a federal judge’s order last Friday temporarily restoring water to Blossom until Wednesday. Because the complex is a low-income housing development, oversight agency Mississippi Home Corporation stepped in, labeling the property unsafe and forcing residents to leave. 
 ”It really been like a horror movie. It kind of reminds me of Hurricane Katrina. People are running here and there trying to get water,” said Chante Robinson-Baxter, another Blossom tenant. She receives disability payments and has lived at the complex for 13 years.
Mississippi Home Corporation Director Scott Spivey, who has headed the agency for a decade, said it was the first time in his tenure it exercised this authority.
“I would love to say that there’s never going to be a next time but there’s going to be a next time,” Spivey said Tuesday.
Many of the low-income residents of these apartments have paid their water bills, combined with their monthly rent. The utility shut off water to residents at Blossom, claiming its owner owes $422,000, on July 23, followed by another south Jackson complex, Chapel Ridge, on Aug. 1. 
“I’ve just been pleading my case with JXN Water, ‘Please don’t displace these residents,’ because they’re doing what they’re supposed to do,” said Allison Cox, director of the Jackson Housing Authority, which administers federal housing vouchers to residents in Jackson, including one who lived at Blossom. 
JXN Water’s policy is to post signs notifying residents of impending shutoffs. But the utility’s spokesperson, Aisha Carson, said Blossom’s property manager removed the notices, “leading to confusion and misinformation among residents.”
Cox and JXN Water have been in constant contact, so she knows how much of a moving target the shutoffs have become. One day, she gets word that a complex might lose service. The next, the owner has signed a repayment agreement. 
“It’s changing all the time,” Cox said.
Tenants and advocates met Tuesday evening at Stewpot to discuss their options. If anything, the Blossom situation has demonstrated how community partners can mobilize to address shutoffs in the future.

Tonia Cowart, a local real estate agent and Stewpot’s housing navigator, said she uses all available resources – secretary of state’s office filings, county tax records, news reports and her own eyes – to vet units before placing her clients there. 
“My best work is done with boots on the ground, and I get up and go see, and I do this on a daily basis,” Cowart said.
Before JXN Water released the names of the 15 delinquent apartment complexes, though, she wouldn’t have known not to refer people there. 
Mississippi Today reached out to the 15 complexes on the list of highest delinquent accounts. The only response came from The Park at St. Andrews, with manager Reuven Oded saying the complex has been dealing with the Jackson water “saga” for years and tried unsuccessfully to resolve the issue.
“We are hopeful that now that the Federal Receiver is in place we will have all billing and usage matters resolved in the very near future,” Oded said in an email.
Blossom Apartments owner Tony Little’s troubles with JXN Water, including hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of charges he says are impossible, began more than a year ago. Little said he doesn’t have enough money to cover the bill.
“The bill is simply not correct, but today we’re talking about displaced tenants … It’s the actual people who are on the ground that we have to protect,” Little said. “This is no longer just about who’s right and who’s wrong.”
Carson said that while she cannot speak on individual accounts, JXN Water is now implementing two systems for transparency. 
Starting in September, the utility will be publishing a list of the 15 complexes with the largest outstanding balances, and it is also allowing call center staff to respond to requests for information on accounts if the resident can provide proof that they live in a particular complex. 
“We’re making this decision because tenants have to know ahead of time whether or not their apartment complex owner is behind on their water bill,” Carson said. “We want to be able to point them towards the source of truth about it.”

Here, smoke plumes and hurricane clouds are visible at once (photo courtesy of NASA Earth Observatory).The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump is seeking to rescind the EPA’s longstanding finding from 2009 that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare.
The EPA is making a truly radical move here.
The endangerment finding has been a linchpin to the agency’s regulatory actions over the years to deal with climate change. In announcing the move to rescind the finding, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin boasted: “Today is the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen.” Zeldin is effectively waging war against what he disparagingly calls “the climate change religion.”
This latest EPA move on the endangerment finding must be placed in context.
The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act back in 2007. The court left it to the agency to make the required endangerment finding. And Congress recently reaffirmed the EPA’s endangerment finding when it passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.
So, this action would be a dramatic change in EPA policy in defiance of Supreme Court precedent and an act of Congress. And the action prioritizes deregulation over the EPA core mission of protecting health and the environment.
All this is taking place in the wake of what I have called a “grand upheaval” in federal administrative law.
In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted a new set of administrative rules aimed largely at restricting the Biden Administration from implementing its regulatory policies.
The court took a three-pronged approach: (1) to interpret regulatory statutes narrowly against agency authority; (2) to bar regulations on what the Court deemed “major questions”; and (3) to overrule the Chevron deference formerly given to agencies when interpreting ambiguous statutes. The Court often targeted the EPA under this new approach.
In my opinion, the Supreme Court’s new restrictive view of agency authority could backfire on Zeldin as he wages his war on “the climate change religion.” The EPA will be hard-pressed to find substantial scientific evidence to support its political conclusion that the finding of endangerment no longer applies. The provocative notion about greenhouse gas emissions posing no serious adverse health risks is rooted in politics and not science.
I do not believe the EPA can justify such an erroneous finding under either the Administrative Procedure Act or the Clean Air Act.
For the EPA now to rescind its endangerment finding from 2009 is a “major question“ that Congress has not specifically delegated to the EPA as required by current Supreme Court precedent. Indeed, Zeldin shows this is a “major question” with his own hyperbolic boast about the effect of the decision. And finally, the EPA will get no Chevron deference for its proposed decision to deregulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.
We’ll likely find out soon if the Supreme Court will consistently stand by its new rules of federal administrative law. If not, you can draw your own conclusions about why.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/climate-change-Sept-2020-NASA-Earth.png,,,2025-08-13 06:56:40.740862

This story by Alex Hanson was first published in the Valley News on August 10.
WOODSTOCK — The board of the Woodstock-based Mountain Views Supervisory Union voted on Monday to join a Board of Cooperative Education Services (BOCES) with seven other supervisory unions and districts.
The unanimous vote makes Mountain Views the first supervisory union in the state to join a BOCES, a structure that’s in wide use in a majority of states but that wasn’t enabled under Vermont law until last year.
A BOCES allows school units to band together to share services that require greater expertise or that entail extra costs. Mountain Views Superintendent Sherry Sousa has been meeting with her seven counterparts for the past five years, a collaboration that has resulted in both cost savings and better services in special education and professional development.
“The southeast region is an incredibly collaborative group with shared goals and expectations for their students,” Sousa said in an interview.
Now that the region has crafted articles of agreement, officials hope that document can become a template that other parts of the state could use to create their own BOCES, Sousa said. While a state task force is trying to draw new school district boundaries, superintendents and school boards are enacting reforms of their own.

“We want a working model of what a BOCES is in Vermont, and we want to move that to other parts of Vermont,” Sousa said.
There are currently no BOCES in Vermont, but several supervisory unions have met with state Agency of Education officials to discuss what a BOCES might look like, Toren Ballard, a spokesperson for the agency, said in an email.
So far, Mountain Views’ collaboration with other districts has taken the form of improving services for students with special needs and providing professional development for educators, Sousa said. That effort has had the effect of reducing the number of costly out-of-district placements. Special education is a challenge for public schools, which are required by federal law to provide services, but are only partially reimbursed for them with federal money.
With the help of the collaborative, Mountain Views created a program for students at risk of not completing their schooling.
The district has special education programs at every grade level that are supported by the collaborative’s expertise and training, Sousa said.
As a result, the district has relatively few out of district placements, which saves money and also better serves students, she said.
“The collaborative is critical to making that happen,” Sousa said.
Sousa has seen dramatic changes in a 30-year career in special education. New teachers now come out of undergraduate and graduate programs with far less training in special education, she said. That puts the burden on either school districts or the state to provide professional development. The state does much less of that than it used to, she noted.
The hope is that a BOCES can fill that void. Many states enable such structures, which also are called education service agencies, education service districts, education collaboratives or regional education service agencies.
Such collaboration is not particularly new, either.
Hartford School District for many years ran the Hartford Collaborative, and still operates the Hartford Regional Resource Center, for students with developmental delays and multiple disabilities, and HARP, the Hartford Autism Regional Program.
But financial pressures, as Vermont’s student population has declined and need for student services has risen, have led local school officials to seek new ways to deliver common services at lower costs. The threat of a major restructuring of education also has served as a call to action at the local level, Sousa said.
In introducing the BOCES bill, H.630, in 2023, state Rep. Rebecca Holcombe, D-Norwich, testified that BOCES can be used for a wide range of initiatives, from operating alternative schools to improving curriculum, standards and assessment to collective bargaining and negotiating transportation and food service contracts.
“You can’t build and maintain the expertise that you need in individual schools,” Holcombe said in an interview. It can be done at the regional level instead.
Holcombe, who served as Vermont Education secretary from 2014 to 2018, also sits on the task force that’s supposed to draw a new school district map by December. BOCES and other regional reforms hold greater promise for improving teaching and learning and saving money, she said.
If a collaborative can help teachers improve learning in the early grades, then students won’t need as much costly intervention later on, she said.
The Legislature approved the BOCES bill in 2024, and Gov. Phil Scott let it become law without his signature. At the time, all of the talk in education was about a substantial increase in property taxes and the BOCES bill received virtually no public notice. Holcombe said she’s glad to see it bearing fruit.
“I think you really have to give these districts credit for putting this idea together,” she said.
The southeastern Vermont BOCES covers Windsor County from Woodstock south, and all of Windham County and comprises at least 8,000 students.
In addition to Mountain Views, Windsor Southeast Supervisory Union, which comprises Hartland, Windsor, West Windsor and Weathersfield, is also part of the collaborative. Its board is slated to discuss and vote on joining the BOCES on Sept. 22, Superintendent Christine Bourne said.
The collaborative, which has had a director for the past three years, has provided assistance with recruiting and hiring special education staff and with professional development around such subjects as hazing, harassment and bullying and special education law, Bourne said.
“That’s been really beneficial, and provided at a reasonable cost, so staff that want to participate can participate,” Bourne said of the professional development.
“In the future, I think we’ll be able to pool resources,” she said, which could include a program for special education students who need a new placement. “We’re still in development, but the possibility for a lot of cost savings is there,” as well as additional collaborative services.
Asked to quantify how the BOCES has saved money for her district, Sousa could not provide figures, but noted that every student who stays in the district instead of being placed in an expensive program outside the public system is a major cost savings.
“We talk about restructuring education in Vermont,” she said. “This is a real opportunity.”

Declan O’Scanlon is among the Republicans who say the proposed labor rules would ""wreak havoc on independent contractors."" (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Three Republican lawmakers are seeking to overturn pending regulations regarding independent contractors that have been criticized by business groups, gig workers, and freelancers.
The concurrent resolution proposed by Sen. Declan O’Scanlon, Assemblywoman Vicky Flynn, and Assemblyman Gerry Scharfenberger — all Monmouth County Republicans — would invoke a state constitutional provision requiring regulators to amend or withdraw rules proposals that lawmakers say are out of step with their intent.
“These proposed rules by the DOL directly contradict the Legislature’s intent and would wreak havoc on independent contractors who rely on flexibility and autonomy to make a living,” O’Scanlon said in a statement. “We’re not going to sit back and let unelected bureaucrats and Trenton Democrats make life more expensive and more complicated for thousands of hardworking people.”
The Department of Labor is considering regulations that would codify its implementation of the ABC test, a three-part assessment used to determine whether workers are employees entitled to certain payroll tax benefits or independent contractors who do not fund those benefits and are mostly ineligible to receive them. The proposal has received criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.
“These rules are a direct attack on worker freedom and the ability of New Jerseyans to control their own livelihoods,” Flynn said. “For many independent contractors — especially parents, caregivers, and those juggling multiple jobs — this flexibility isn’t a luxury, it’s a lifeline.
The ABC test’s three prongs measure whether a worker is free from their employers’ control, whether the work they do is outside an employer’s regular course or place of business, and whether the worker is independently engaged in business or trade.
Workers who pass all three prongs are independent contractors, and those who fail any are classed as employees.
State labor officials say the regulations would merely codify practices stemming from statute and case law that labor commissioners have employed for years.
The proposed regulations would add a list of factors courts have considered in employee misclassification cases — like whether an individual is required to work set hours, use specific tools, or wear a particular uniform — to the test’s first prong.
They would also add examples to the test’s second prong that would make clear ride share and truck drivers are employees by designating the vehicles they drive as their employers’ regular place of business.
Critics say they worry the lists’ non-exhaustive nature — meaning officials can consider factors not listed there — would create uncertainty.
Though ride-share companies like Uber and Lyft maintain they only provide platforms to connect passengers to drivers and that their drivers are independent contractors, the state treats them as employees by allowing them to file for unemployment, family leave, and temporary disability benefits, though program rules mean it’s somewhat uncommon for them to receive those benefits.
Ride-share companies do not make payments for those benefits on behalf of their drivers, so any payroll benefits those drivers receive are underwritten by other New Jersey workers and employers.

As he spoke, Norman glanced at the media panel, including David Clarey of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Jessica McBride of Wisconsin Right Now and Jenna Rae of TMJ4 News. 
As Norman predicted, the panelists proceeded to keep him on the defensive throughout the contentious luncheon. Before he was peppered with questions about safety in downtown Milwaukee, police surveillance and whether officers should return to what courts have ruled were racially discriminatory and unconstitutional stop and frisk practices, Norman presented his own perspective on public safety in Wisconsin’s largest city. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“I always like to start off by saying that I am proud to be the leader of the Milwaukee Police Department,” said Norman, thanking the men and women of MPD “who protect our city through challenging times, through good times, 365 days a year, seven days a week — holidays included.” Norman also thanked the community for supporting MPD after the killing of Officer Kendall Corder, who was shot while responding to a call about a subject with a gun. 
Corner was one of at least two officers who have been shot this year. Norman said of the killings that it’s important for MPD officers to feel that “even though we have challenging times, we know that we have a community that’s behind us, and who understands the challenges that we’re going through, in regards to the work of public safety in our community.”
Tremaine Jones (who has pleaded not guilty) was arrested for the slaying with MPD compiling witness statements, and locating a backpack on-scene containing Jones’ social security card, employee I.D., birth certificate, debit cards, and a receipt for the lower receiver of the gun police say was used in the shooting. Since 2018, there have been six MPD officers killed in the line of duty. 
As Norman moved on to the latest crime statistics, he cautioned that “the numbers are numbers, they’re data sets, but they’re not the reality of what you feel from a personal feeling, your perspective…Never will I ever say that what you feel is not your reality, or the truth. And we have to work to continue to address those concerns.”
Citing the MPD’s mid-year crime statistics report, Norman told the audience at Milwaukee’s Newsroom Pub that there has been: 

A 17% violent crime reduction
7% property crime reduction
11% reduction overall for serious crimes


“And let me put that in the proper context,” Norman said, “this is on top of reductions in 2024.” According to MPD’s crime statistics dashboard, since this time last year Milwaukee has seen an 18% decline in non-fatal shootings, a 44% decline in car jackings, a 24% decline in robberies, and another 21% decline in aggravated assaults. “Now, the elephant in the room, yes homicides are up,” said Norman. In 2024, there were 132 people who lost their lives to homicide incidents in Milwaukee. A little over half way through 2025, there have been 93 deaths.
 










I do know that we’re not going to be able to arrest our way out of this.


– Jeffrey Norman, Chief of the Milwaukee Police Department


 
At the time of the mid-year report, homicides were up 13%, though the most recent numbers on the online dashboard show a 9% increase. “I always say this, anything [more] than zero is unacceptable,” said Norman. The dashboard also shows a 32% increase in human trafficking since last year, and a 52% increase since 2023. Norman didn’t address this increase, and the panelists and audience members didn’t ask about it.
Norman focused on the homicide increase, highlighting what he called “the undercurrent of what these homicides are about” — inter-personal conflict and violence that escalates into harm or death. “Poor conflict resolution,” he said, “availability of firearms to our youth. These are things that we can work together to impact, to intervene, to intercede.”

While MPD is adept at finding high-level offenders in the community, with the department boasting a nearly 80% clearance rate for solving homicides, Norman emphasized that “it’s not enough to have somebody in custody for such a horrible crime. It’s more important to prevent it.” Collaboration has been a key asset for MPD including working with community groups, elected officials and partnerships with other law enforcement agencies including the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office and State Patrol. “When we work together we are better, together, said Norman. “Leaning into the collaboration, leaning into the partnerships truly is where the rubber meets the road, so that we’re able to address when we have a flare-up of crime on Hampton Avenue, or during Cinco de Mayo, or during Juneteenth, or during Water Street, or during the Puerto Rican Fest.” Although Norman said that his own legacy has never motivated his service, he hopes to be remembered as a chief who was there, and who cared, he said, when the Milwaukee Bucks celebrated winning the NBA championship, during the  COVID-19 pandemic, the Republican National Convention and the historic floods just days ago. “He was there,” Norman said of himself. “He cared.” 
A grilling by the media panel 
The first media panel question came from Clarey of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel about MPD’s use of surveillance technology. The department’s use of facial recognition software, drones and other technologies have raised concerns about privacy and due process. 
Norman said that some public safety investigations and interventions have been “wrapped up in a more quick and efficient manner by utilizing the technology.” He mentioned Flock cameras the department uses to monitor license plates and identify vehicles taken in car jackings. He also noted facial recognition technology used in repeat sexual assault and homicide cases. “These are what is going on with this particular technology,” said Norman. “I am very sensitive to the concerns about surveillance, abuse, but I say this, as any tool that can be utilized by law enforcement, has the ability to be abused. It’s about what are the bumper rails? What are the expectations? What is the oversight?” 
Norman said his department is committed to oversight and dialogue with the community about the technology. Yet, he also feels that the fears that he’s heard about surveillance technology are often “speculative.” By contrast, the chief said he could describe numerous concrete examples of carjacking suspects and people who committed violent crimes who were apprehended because of the technology. “That is what is going on,” said Norman, “and if there’s any tools that the Milwaukee Police Department can utilize to ensure that there is direct, serious and quick accountability, we shall use it.”

McBride, a journalism lecturer at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and contributor to the right-wing website Wisconsin Right Now, asked if Norman would support calling on the city to end its obligations under the Collins settlement, the result of a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin, which found that MPD had utilized racially motivated and unconstitutional stop and frisk practices for decades. 
McBride said that she’s heard from officers who feel that the agreement, which mandated changes to MPD’s practices, has made it “difficult if not impossible” to do “proactive policing.” McBride cited a decline in “field interviews,” or officers talking to and gathering information from people, as well as traffic stops. She connected those changes to the rise of reckless driving in Milwaukee. Norman said that officials have focused on checks and balances to ensure that MPD is compliant, but that he also agrees that the Collins settlement should be “heavily modified.” 
The agreement carries “a number of administrative burdens,” Norman said, stressing that he wholly supports constitutional policing. “There is really no wiggle room,” said Norman. “At the end of a shift, reports need to be filed. Some of our officers have done two shifts. They’re tired…There’s a cost associated with this, that’s overtime being used.” Norman said that MPD no longer sees the sort of constitutional violations which led to the Collins settlement, and that the department has shown itself to be responsible, and that things will never “backslide” on his watch.
Rae of TMJ4 asked about an incident involving a car that crashed through a police barrier in downtown Milwaukee, severely injuring two women who were crossing the street. She pushed Norman to explain why “no detectives interviewed the victims or any of the bystanders to follow up on the investigation after that crash?”

Norman said that the investigation went as far as it needed to go, and that it culminated in “accountability measures,” which included issuing citations. Rae, unsatisfied, pushed back saying Norman didn’t answer her question, but the chief reiterated that officers were on scene, interviews were done, and that nothing more was required. An awkward silence followed as the microphone passed back to Clarey, who asked about Norman’s support of city ordinances related to so-called “street takeovers”, where people noisily gather in intersections and do tricks with their cars. Later, Rae pressed Norman further on the car crash. He said he was unprepared to focus on the specific details she wanted him to discuss.
McBride asked Norman about his $65,000 raise, bringing his salary to $243,000, and added that MPD officers have gone without a raise for over two years. She asked Norman why he accepted the raise, whether he’d suspend his raise until other MPD officers receive one, and whether he supports officers getting back-pay from the city. Norman said that he earned his raise not only through his credentials, which include a law degree, but also through the amount of hours he puts in as chief.
“I sometimes work maybe 12-14 hours, work Saturdays and Sundays, I’m actually really never off,” said Norman. “It is important to understand that no one has given me anything for free, the work that I do is earned.” In 2022, CBS58 reported that over a dozen officers made more money than the chief due to overtime pay. 
Norman said he supports contract negotiations that could include back pay for officers, and that the process is in the hands of the Milwaukee Police Association and the mayor. McBride pressed again about how his raise hurts officer morale and whether he supports officers getting back pay.

Norman was also asked about officers being sent away from their own districts to work downtown and whether “broken windows” policing — a strategy that favors tight control of even small infractions to create an overall climate of safety — should be brought back. McBride suggested he did not have “an articulable policing strategy.” 
Norman was asked how he defines reckless driving; how a driver could crash into people after driving through a police barrier and “not see a day in court”; why reckless drivers without insurance retain their vehicles; how MPD retains recruits; whether prosecutors and judges should mete out tougher charges and penalties; how the Black Lives Matter protests and media reporting of policing hurts the profession and how MPD has achieved declines in carjackings. He expressed disappointment that reporters were focusing on certain incidents rather than others — including a deceased 13-year-old who wasn’t claimed for over a week, another 13-year-old who shot and killed people with an extended magazine firearm and crime on the South Side. Norman said in those cases “I wish you had the type of reporting as you have right now.”
Norman responded to a question from Wisconsin Examiner about inter-personal violence in the community and whether arresting more people and bringing more serious charges is the most effective strategy. 
“When you’re talking about inter-personal conflict, how or why does it rise [to] a level of firearm violence is perplexing,” he said. “The other day we had a situation where a person was inappropriately touched. She sees the individual who inappropriately touched her, wants to confront that person, and [in] that particular confrontation someone dies, because a firearm was used.” It would have been better to call the police than to try to resolve things with a firearm, he said.

Therapists and social scientists might have better answers to questions about violent behavior, he said. But, he added, he is committed to strengthening community partnerships with public health and safety teams, mental health specialists and other non-law-enforcement experts to try to resolve conflicts before they become violent. Many situations that escalate into homicides and firearm violence are “emotional,” he said. MPD embraces violence intervention and encourages people to be more introspective instead of  “going zero to 90.” 
“I do know that we’re not going to be able to arrest our way out of this,” Norman said of social conflict that can turn violent. Solving Milwaukee’s homicide cases is important but, he said, the community should ask, “How do we prevent it from happening, to where we don’t even have those numbers? That’s the real question.”

The Wyoming Freedom Caucus began criticizing the court’s judiciary after rulings against its initiatives. A narrow vote Tuesday indicated debate is likely to continue. 
The post Wyoming Senate panel rebuffs effort to give lawmakers more control over judicial nominations appeared first on WyoFile .","CASPER—A legislative committee narrowly rejected a proposal Tuesday to involve the state Senate in the selection of Wyoming Supreme Court justices, though some conservative lawmakers are likely to continue scrutinizing the state’s judiciary.
The decision comes amid rising criticism from Republicans of judicial rulings both nationally and in Wyoming, where judges have struck down abortion restrictions and put on hold an expansive school voucher program.
The Joint Judiciary Committee had in May voted to consider a constitutional amendment that — if approved by voters in a statewide election — would require Senate approval of new appointees to Wyoming’s high court. Though lawmakers backing the bill cast it as a restrained step toward holding judges more accountable to the public, opponents said it was a sea change that would have injected partisan politics into the judicial nominating process — and courtrooms themselves. 
On Tuesday, a 6-3 majority of House members of the Joint Judiciary Committee voted to advance the bill to the 2026 legislative session. Senators, however, voted 3-2 against the constitutional amendment. A majority of committee members from both the House and Senate must vote in favor of a bill for the committee to officially sponsor it. 
Lawmakers can still introduce the bill in the coming session, but it will not have the imprimatur of the judiciary committee. 
Wyoming jurists mounted a spirited opposition to the proposed constitutional amendment during sometimes tense public comments to lawmakers at the committee meeting. Personal injury lawyers spoke against the bill, as did the attorneys who defend companies and government entities against them. Both groups argued that Wyoming is one of the best states in the country at picking qualified, politically impartial judges, and they asked lawmakers not to thrust themselves into the process.
“Our system isn’t broken, please don’t become the type of activist legislature that is looking for solutions to problems that don’t exist,” Alaina Stedillie, president of the Defense Lawyers Association of Wyoming, said. 
But lawmakers, particularly in the House, said they were hearing concerns from their constituents. “We need to determine if it’s just a noisy minority or if this is really a groundswell,” Rep. Tom Kelly, R-Sheridan, said. “The only way to do that is to send it to the people and have them tell us.”
Among the no votes on the Senate were the committee’s two practicing attorneys, Sens. Barry Crago, R-Buffalo, and Jared Olsen, R-Cheyenne. Rep. Ken Chestek, a law professor and Laramie Democrat, also voted against the bill.

The Wyoming Freedom Caucus began to publicly criticize the state’s judiciary this spring, following the lead of President Donald Trump, who has blasted federal judges who ruled against him and called for their impeachment. Caucus representatives have pointed to state judges’ rulings on abortion rights and public education funding that they disagree with as evidence that the judiciary is overstepping its bounds and is out of touch with Wyoming. 
“A lack of public buy-in to the judicial selection process has left Wyomingites feeling confused, upset, and blindsided by the decisions reached by many on the bench,” the caucus wrote in a set of blog posts.
Attorneys who testified on Tuesday rejected that assertion. “Where is this coming from?” Stedillie asked the committee. “I don’t believe that there has been any great clamor by the citizenry of this state to say our judicial branch is broken.”
Debate over the judicial nominating process has carried forward through a summer in which many Wyomingites have anxiously awaited a ruling from the Wyoming Supreme Court on whether a complete ban on abortion, brought by the Freedom Caucus, runs counter to the state’s constitution. That ruling is expected at any time.

The most recent available polling by the Wyoming Survey and Analysis Center on the question suggests more residents approve of how the state’s judges handle their jobs than disapprove. In polling conducted last September and October, only 13% of respondents told the center they disapproved of how judges handle their jobs, while more than 40% of respondents said they approved. 
Wyoming today operates under what is commonly called the Missouri Plan, where a commission reviews applicants and sends three choices to the governor for a final pick. 
The Wyoming Judicial Nominating Commission is composed of six people. Three lawyers are elected by members of the Wyoming State Bar, and three non-lawyers are appointed by the governor. The seventh member, who serves as chairperson and tie breaker, is the chief justice of the Wyoming Supreme Court — a post now held by Lynne Boomgarden. 
The three finalists are named, and the governor traditionally waits 30 days before making a final selection, which gives the public a chance to weigh in. Freedom Caucus lawmakers and other conservatives have availed themselves of that window to pressure the governor away from certain nominees in the past. 
Citing those unfavored nominees, the Freedom Caucus has labeled both the judicial nominating commission and the Wyoming Bar Association as “a victim of left-wing institutional capture.” 
Caucus lawmakers have raised different proposals to fix that alleged bias. They’ve ranged from the drastic — changing the state constitution so that Wyoming voters directly elect judges — to the incremental — pushing the judiciary to make public the names of all applicants for judgeships, not just the three finalists. 
Judiciary representatives, including the recently retired state Supreme Court Justice Kate Fox, have indicated they’d consider publicizing those names. Some of the attorneys who testified at Tuesday’s meeting, however, said doing so would diminish both the quantity and quality of applicants. The state’s best lawyers will be reluctant to apply for a competitive judgeship if they know their law firm colleagues, or their clients, will learn they’re considering a career change, those attorneys said. 
Lawmakers did not make any proposal to publicize all applicants’ names, which the judiciary could do itself through rule making.

Humans have responded to AI, like many innovations, with skepticism, but could it govern better than politicians? The bar is pretty low, columnist Rod Miller writes.
The post Politics is the ultimate test for artificial intelligence. appeared first on WyoFile .","Like it or not, artificial intelligence is rapidly weaving itself into the fabric of our everyday lives. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is an invisible hand that moves levers and flips switches without our conscious knowledge that it is at work. And this fact scares hell out of a lot of folks. 

Opinion

Innovations have always scared hell out of a lot of folks. Every human advancement has been met with skepticism and fear when first introduced. That’s just how our minds work. This is likely a holdover reflex from the time when we were a prey species and everything really was trying to kill us.
From fire, stone tools and the wheel, through steam engines, automobiles and computers, there has always been an appreciable segment of our population that has freaked out and said, “We’re all gonna die!” 
Yet, here we still are. And each innovation has advanced human civilization to the point that we now take them for granted.
Today, AI is taking its rightful place in the pantheon of advancements that scare hell out of us. Even though we all unconsciously use AI every day, and some are thriving with this new intelligence, others firmly believe that it portends the end of the human race.
We fear AI, like we feared horseless carriages, because we don’t understand it. We fear it because it’s new, and we’re more comfortable with old stuff. We fear AI because we think it will replace us rather than usher us into the future. 
We are afraid of AI because we think it is some alien force that has invaded our world, when AI is really just the product of the human mind exponentially multiplied. We’re nervous that it might change our world, and change is always scary for humans.
The reality is that AI is already helping us behind the scenes in many walks of life. Doctors use the power of AI in diagnosing and treating what ails us. Lawyers use AI to do legal research that keeps us out of the hoosegow. Every time you Google a question, you get an answer influenced by AI. And the list goes on.
AI is apolitical and nonpartisan; it would never be a slave to Democrat or Republican dogma. rod miller
Artificial Intelligence can read, understand, analyze and remember everything written in any language on Earth, expressed in both words and numbers, and do so in less time than it takes you to read this column. AI is a tool like any other, and we can learn to use it to our advantage.
Now, I’ll use the rest of my space here to suggest a role for AI in our lives that should dramatically ratchet up the pucker factor among readers. Politics and governance in human societies might be the highest and best use for AI.
Hear me out.
Read any survey or poll about trustworthiness among professions in America, and you’ll find that politicians are ranked well below pimps and horse thieves. Used car salesmen score higher than politicians. With that in mind, why do we trust politicians with the solemn chore of governing us?
An open-source, transparent and fully auditable AI model would do a better job at this. It would never lie to us or steal from us. AI can dispassionately carry out our instructions.
For instance, we could instruct it to “form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity,” and AI would do it in a heartbeat with no backsass. God knows the politicians we’ve elected to do precisely that have done a piss poor job of it!
AI is pure logic and wouldn’t exhibit the human emotional frailties of anger, greed, vanity, hate or the other impediments to good government that we now tolerate from politicians. AI would never suffer cognitive decline. Since it lacks gonads, AI would never screw an intern or rack up frequent flier miles on the Lolita Express. It would never prostitute itself for money or headlines.
AI is apolitical and nonpartisan; it would never be a slave to Democrat or Republican dogma. 
How many politicians can you say that about?
Throughout our shared history, we humans have always had options when faced with an innovation, and our common story is about how we have made choices at those times. We embraced fire because we chose not to keep eating raw meat. We chose the wheel because we got tired of carrying heavy stuff on our backs.
We can choose to keep electing flawed politicians with their appalling track record, or we can choose an alternate option that scares hell out of us but might do a much better job. 
This will be interesting.

The Idaho Legislature’s interim Land Use and Housing Study Committee meets at 8 a.m. Thursday in Sandpoint.
Thursday’s meeting is the committee’s third since Sen. Ali Rabe, D-Boise, pushed for creation of the committee during the 2025 legislative session. In calling for the committee, Rabe said access to affordable housing is one of the most important issues facing Idaho. 
After years working on housing issues as executive director of the Boise-based nonprofit organization Jesse Tree, Rabe said the committee represents an important step of bringing state legislators, city officials, builders, planners, building officials, real estate agents and more to the same table together.
“It was an important step because the problem in the past was people would bring forward legislative proposals in January and no one was on the same page so nothing ever got done,” Rabe said. “I think it’s really important to hear from all the stakeholders.” 
Now, Rabe said legislators, building officials, planners, homebuilders and other folks are all having a comprehensive conversation around housing.
 Idaho legislators will start considering recommendations to address affordable housing in the state

Through the first two meetings, the committee has been in information gathering mode, said Sen. Jim Woodward, a Republican from Sagle who serves as the committee’s co-chair.

After Thursday’s meeting, Woodward said committee members will have a homework assignment to begin considering recommendations.
Woodward hopes to compile recommendations, not new laws, in a best practices document because the solution to housing needs may look different in small, rural or tourist communities than it will in larger cities.
“I will be slow in moving to a state-level solution because I think we can take on most of these challenges at the local level,” Woodward said Tuesday. “When we put in place a law, that always becomes a one-size-fits-all solution.”
Throughout the process, Woodward said he has been struck by how interested the public is in the committee and land use and housing issues. Woodward also said one issue with housing is undeniable – many people in Idaho are not able to afford to continue living in the place where they grew up. 
Rabe said there will be some tension as the committee moves from information gathering to decision making or taking action.
But she remains optimistic. 
“No matter their political background, folks agree this is a big issue right now that needs to be addressed,” Rabe said
Through the first two meetings, Rabe said the committee has centered around a few key issues. Rabe said one major issue is infrastructure needs like water and sewer systems. Rabe said the Idaho Legislature’s passage of the property tax bill House Bill 389 during the 2021 legislative session limits growth of local budgets and hurts cities’ and counties’ ability to afford infrastructure needed to support housing development.
“It’s one of the issues preventing housing from getting built in Idaho,” Rabe said. “We’ve talked about infrastructure quite a bit, and we will keep talking about it.”
Rabe said committee members have also discussed financing options, tax credits or subsidies for builders and other incentives as possible creative solutions to building more housing.
After this week’s meeting, the Land Use and Housing Study Committee is scheduled to meet again Sept. 26 at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.

OTTAWA COUNTY — “We are standing here today to stand up to the Trump Administration to tell them, ‘Get this coal plant shut down.'”


That was the message that lawmakers, health professionals and other officials said at a Tuesday, Aug. 12, press conference near the J.H. Campbell coal plant in West Michigan’s Ottawa County, which has become the epicenter of a legal battle between the U.S. Department of Energy and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel.
The group believes the Trump Administration created an “energy emergency” to justify issuing an emergency order May 23 mandating that Consumers Energy keep the plant open at least 90 days, which superseded the utility’s closure plan slated for May 31, along with the approval of closure by state regulators.
“We’re here today because in 2024 Donald Trump made a deal with the fossil fuel industry: ‘You give me a billion dollars to prop up my campaign, and I will prop up your industry,'” said state Rep. Stephen Wooden, D-81, whose district includes the northeast portion of Grand Rapids.
“And that’s why coal plants that were scheduled to close have been forced to stay open, costing Michigan rate payers a million dollars a day, at a time when we are still dealing with a cost-of-living crisis, when a trade war is costing the average Michigan family $2,500 a year,” he said.
“We are standing here today to stand up to the Trump Administration to tell them, ‘Get this coal plant shut down, to re-shut it down, to listen to local folks, to listen to Michiganders, to listen to the utilities that have already scheduled this closure, instead of propping up a coal plant that doesn’t need to stay open.”

 How we got here

The Campbell Plant is Consumers’ last — and largest — coal-fired plant in Michigan.
The plant, operating since 1962, was originally scheduled to close partially in 2030 and wholly in 2040. But the utility announced in 2021 it was moving the plan up by 15 years for an operations end date of May 31, 2025.
Consumers has said closing the plant was expected to save Michigan ratepayers $600 million by 2040.
The utility was seeking to end coal use altogether by 2025 as part of its goal to achieve carbon neutrality.
Since the announcement, Consumers has been actively preparing the plant for “full retirement,” a spokesperson said last year.
“The complex will officially go into retirement with an aim to go cold and dark after 2025,” said former Consumers spokesperson Kristen Van Kley. “In 2026 and on, the complex will be demolished with a plan to restore the site over time.”
The plant, when operating at full capacity, can generate 1,450 megawatts of electricity. Michigan consumed about 113,740 gigawatt hours of electricity in 2019, according to a 2020 report from the U.S. Department of Energy.
At the time, Van Kley said new technologies would ensure Consumers would be able to continue supporting the statewide grid.
“Energy efficiency, demand response and emerging technologies such as grid modernization and battery storage will help us lower peak customer demand for electricity and deliver exactly what Michigan needs,” she said. “Our plan is designed to respond to emerging needs, adapt to changing conditions and embrace emerging innovative technologies as we work to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.”
On May 23, Secretary Wright directed the Midcontinent Independent System Operator in coordination with Consumers, to ensure that the 1,560 megawatt plant “[remain] available for operation, minimizing any potential capacity shortfall that could lead to unnecessary power outages.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,” Wright said in a prepared news release.
The Energy Department said the emergency order, which is issued by the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, is authorized by Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and is in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency to ensure that power generation availability in the region does not “dip below 2024 capacity levels.”
“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families. With President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department is hard at work securing the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy that powers their lives regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining.”
In June, Nessel — along with a collective group of public interest organizations, Minnesota and Illinois, Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, and the Organization of Midcontinent Independent System Operator States — challenged the DOE’s order to keep the Campbell plant in Port Sheldon Township to remain open for 90 days, arguing that the move will force customers to absorb exorbitant costs.
U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the emergency order demanding that the plant “remain available for operation” on Friday, May 23 — just eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, a plan that has been in place since 2021.
The U.S. Department of Energy said the move was intended “to minimize the risk of blackouts and address critical grid security issues in the Midwestern region of the United States ahead of the high electricity demand expected this summer.”
Nessel filed a request for rehearing with the DOE, challenging what she described as an “arbitrary and illegal order seeking to stop the planned retirement of Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, under the pretense of a fabricated energy emergency.”
She said the order “will burden Michigan utility customers with unnecessary costs and needless additional pollution from the 60-year-old Ottawa County coal plant that was scheduled to close May 31.”
A request for rehearing is a legal process where a party asks a court to reconsider a decision it has already made. It’s typically used when a party believes the court made a mistake in its initial ruling, whether by overlooking a crucial fact, misinterpreting the law, or making some other error.
When the DOE didn’t respond to Nessel’s request within 21 days, she filed a petition for review July 24 with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Washington, D.C., Circuit, challenging the U.S. Department of Energy’s order, claiming the “arbitrary and illegal” move forced the continued operation of the plant “under the pretense of a fabricated energy emergency.”

“This unprecedented order by the Department of Energy declares an emergency without evidence, completely ignores state and federal regulators that approved the plant’s retirement, and will potentially put enormous costs onto utility customers who receive no real benefit,” Nessel said. “I will continue to fight to protect Michigan customers from unreasonable costs imposed by the federal government.”
Last month, Nessel also filed a pleading before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in response to Consumers’ request to recover the costs from running the Campbell plant beyond its initial retirement date. That proceeding is still ongoing.
Katie Carey, director of media relations for Consumers, said Tuesday that the utility is continuing to comply with the DOE order and has requested “the timely recovery of costs associated with plant operations.”
“We expect FERC will take timely action on our request. Our FERC filing from Friday, June 6, requests approval of a mechanism to recover and allocate those costs through MISO.
 What’s happening now

Tuesday’s event saw environmental activists, health experts and politicians calling on the closure of the Campbell plant — whether that be the DOE not renewing the emergency order or reversing it before it expires on Aug. 20.
Jayce Bylenga, West Michigan regional coordinator for Michigan League of Conservation Voters, read a prepared statement from Nessel at Tuesday’s event, which Bylenga’s group helped organize, along with the Sierra Club.
“My department signed a settlement with Consumers in 2021 that included the retirement of the Campbell coal plant and made all due preparations to maintain our state’s energy load without it. Our plan, were it not curtailed by the baseless actions of the Trump Administration, just eight days before it would have gone into effect — was set to save Michigan customers nearly $600 million never before is the Department of Energy delayed the retirement of a power plant absent a request from the operating utility or local government body,” Nessel said in the statement.
Nessel said the majority of Michigan residents don’t want to see rate hikes passed along to them and the continuation of burning fossil fuels.

“To put it plainly, no one asked for this,” Nessel said. “The unprecedented order of the department of the DOE fabricates an emergency without evidence, completely ignores the state and federal regulators that approve the plans retirement and will potentially put enormous costs onto Michigan utility customers who receive no real benefit, and that’s before taking into account the environmental and public health health costs of continuing to fuel a full-powered plan.
“Michigan must be present in the fight to maintain self-determination over where our power comes from. The DOE ignored my request for rehearing, and as a result, I have filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to overturn this expensive and unlawful order. As I’ve done throughout my years in office, my department will continue to fight for affordable utility bills on the rights of Michiganders to clean up their energy production.”
Dr. Steven Ashmead, a family physician and a member of the Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action, said coal-fired plants pose serious negative health effects to residents, which is part of well-settled science.

“Medical science has had over 250 years to study the health impacts of using coal for heat and energy production. The health effects have been documented at every stage of coal production and combustion, from mining to the disposal of ash,” Ashmead said. “These pollutants directly affect our hearts, blood vessels, lungs and brains. Children, the elderly like myself, pregnant women and individuals with chronic disease and those that work outdoors are at increased risk of exposure to these deadly pollutants. … That does not include the millions of dollars that will be spent on health problems associated with burning of coal, such as asthma, COPD, heart attacks, stroke, cancer and many other chronic diseases.”
 What’s the cost to keep Campbell open?

Nessel said Wright’s order would lead to Michiganders “feeling a pinch in their pockets.”
“The costs of maintaining production at the plant, long since prepared for closure, could be an enormous burden on the rate-paying customers of Consumers Energy,” she said. “And that’s before taking into account the environmental and public health costs of continuing to fuel a coal-powered plant.”
In a June 3 statement, a Consumers spokesperson said the company is currently complying with the order.
“We are currently in compliance with the order, have arranged for new shipments of coal, some of which arrived last week, and will continuously operate the Campbell Plant,” Trisha Bloembergen, West Michigan media relations specialist, said in a June 3 email. “We are still determining the overall cost, but want to ensure those costs are shared across MISO and not all on Consumers Energy customers.”
Generating power at the Campbell plant is likely to be costly for ratepayers, experts from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis wrote June 5.
Campbell Units 1 and 2, which are 63 and 58 years old, respectively, were already increasingly uncompetitive in the MISO market, meaning it cost more to generate electricity than what it could be sold for, said energy data analysts Seth Feaster and Dennis Wamsted.
According to data filed by Consumers at FERC, the operation and maintenance costs for the two units totaled $45.80 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in 2023 (the most recent data available). That puts both units in the red almost all the time in MISO: S&P data shows that the monthly around-the-clock price at the Michigan hub has been above $40/MWh just twice in the past two years, and never during the summer.
“In other words, the plant would lose money on virtually every MWh generated if past prices hold this summer, costs that could add up to many more millions of dollars if the units at Campbell are run for any substantial amount of time,” Feaster and Wamsted said.
Beyond operational costs, there are fuel and staffing costs as well.
“Coal itself has gotten more expensive,” said Frank Rambo, executive director at Horizon Climate Initiative, a nonprofit organization that works to use cost-saving energy market reforms to address the causes and impacts of climate change.
“That fleet has gotten more expensive to run. It’s coal, which used to be synonymous with cheap power. It’s now among the most expensive power … and then the excess costs that are incurred because they’re running more expensive resources.
Ultimately, it will be residents who foot the bill, Rambo said.
“They run those coal plants, and then they turn around, go to their commissions and recover those excess costs from their customers,” he said.
Rambo said the price could be even higher than normal because Consumers would need to buy coal on the open market rather than enter into a new contract with a mine.
“We don’t need to sign a new long-term coal supply contract because we’re shutting the plant down,” he said. “Now they may have to buy coal on the spot market.”
The price of coal has hovered around $110 per ton on the U.S. commodities exchange. As of June 19, the price of coal was $103.85 per ton.
In 2024, Campbell burned more than 3.7 million tons of coal, Feaster and Wamsted said. That is an average of 12,700 tons of coal a day, which would amount to $1,318,895 per day using today’s prices.
According to Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, keeping this coal plant on life support even for 90 days may add upwards of $100 million in additional costs — the bulk of which will be passed on to ratepayers across the 15 states.
All of the Campbell plant’s coal was previously delivered by rail from the Powder River Basin in northern Wyoming, according to the IEFF.
Two of the PRB’s biggest mines provided that coal: Arch Resources’ Black Thunder Mine, which delivered 2.25 million tons, and Peabody Energy’s North Antelope Rochelle Mine, which delivered 1.47 million tons.
Rambo also noted the plant staffing issue, explaining that Consumers likely already had phased out several employees who were then called back.
“We were laying these people off. Now we’re going to have to hire them as contractors,” likely at a higher pay rate because the work would be temporary, Rambo explained.
“There are all sorts of excess costs that would not be incurred, but for the fact that there’s now this executive order,” he said.
Carey, of Consumers, said Tuesday that the utility’s costs will “depend on a number of factors, including offsetting revenue from plant operations, and are still being determined.”
“The cost of operating the plant will be shared by customers across the north and central MISO region, consistent with the DOE order,” she said. “We will continue to work with MISO and with federal and state regulators to ensure compliance with the order and appropriate cost recovery.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/unnamed-1024x918.jpg,,,2025-08-13 06:56:40.740862

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

 Veterans depend on SNAP

Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
How Congress’s megabill will impact Idaho: Cuts to taxes, Medicaid, SNAP and more

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
 New law puts greater food assistance burden on states

In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.












This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center




“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
On the Fourth of July, Trump signs his ‘big, beautiful bill’ into law

Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Officials in the small West Tennessee town of Mason on Tuesday approved a contract with private prison corporation CoreCivic to operate the former West Tennessee Detention Facility as an immigration detention facility.
The Mason Board of Mayor and Aldermen called a special meeting to review two contracts: one between the town and CoreCivic, and one between the town and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). 
After a chaotic exchange between aldermen and a crowd of constituents and residents of nearby towns in West Tennessee, the board approved the CoreCivic contract 4-1 with two abstentions. The ICE contract passed 3-2 with two abstentions.
Neither document was provided to the public prior to the meeting, and town attorney Nathan Bicks said he and others were working on the CoreCivic contract until Monday, giving the board about 24 hours to review it in its final form before the vote.
Crowds flanked the 1,500-person town’s Main Street more than 40 minutes before the meeting began, holding signs decrying ICE and opposing the facility’s reopening. 










We need everybody’s support, everybody’s business here. We open arms for everybody. We’re not against nobody.


– Mason Mayor Eddie Noeman


The 600-bed prison closed in 2021 after the Department of Justice, under order from then-President Joe Biden, did not renew its contract with CoreCivic to operate the facility. President Donald Trump reversed Biden’s order against contracting with private detention facilities in January.
Mason Mayor Eddie Noeman, the first Egyptian immigrant to represent the town, voted in favor of both contracts, citing the job and economic opportunities that would come with reopening the facility.
“We need everybody’s support, everybody’s business here,” he said. “We open arms for everybody. We’re not against nobody.”
Alderman Virginia Rivers, who previously served as the town’s vice mayor, disagreed.
“I feel you should have been notified and made aware of this situation before now,” Rivers told the audience. “I understand and support the need to deport actual criminals, but the majority of the people who are being deported and detained are lawful citizens.”
“We, as the officials of the Town of Mason that was elected by the citizens, should consider the consequences and the hurt that this will cause our local community, our neighbors, Tennessee schools, and many families,” Rivers said, adding that entering into a contract with CoreCivic and ICE would “make our city complicit in the abusive treatment of immigrants.”

Mason officials held the meeting in the Mason Fire Department garage across the street from Mason City Hall to accommodate some of the larger crowd. The remaining audience stood outside the garage doors, chanting and drumming through most of the meeting. Officials passed around a microphone attached to a karaoke machine, and audience members repeatedly yelled out that they could not hear what officials were saying.
The majority of audience members who spoke at the meeting opposed the contracts. 
Those who spoke in support pointed to property tax, impact fees and utility revenue that would come from the facility. CoreCivic stated the facility would generate about $325,000 in annual property taxes, and an estimated $1.2 million in annual utility payments. When fully operational, the facility would generate about $200,000 in annual impact fees to the town, according to the company.










I understand and support the need to deport actual criminals, but the majority of the people who are being deported and detained are lawful citizens.


– Alderman Virginia Rivers


Eloise Thompson, a fifth-generation resident of nearby Fayette County, said she was against Mason “becoming a for-profit center for human suffering.”
She said Mason has other alternatives to create jobs and stimulate the local economy that “speak more to the character of who we are.”
Darryle Donell, a veteran and Mason resident, said he previously worked at the facility when it was run by Corrections Corporation of America, which later became CoreCivic.
“That prison ain’t never been good for the town,” he said, calling for transparency, honesty and loyalty from town leaders. “I don’t see no prison. I see a concentration camp.”
Christa Poindexter, another Mason resident, approached Noeman during the meeting and asked why he supported the contracts.
“I want the job. Jobs,” he said.
At one point, at least three board members — Noeman, Vice Mayor Reynaldo Givhan, and Alderman Alethea Harris — exited the building during a period of public comment.

Givhan voted in favor of the CoreCivic contract but abstained from voting on the ICE contract.
“When I moved here 20 years ago, CCA or CoreCivic employed several of my family members, and it was thriving,” he said after the meeting adjourned. “I was actually excited when we first got word that they were coming, that it was going to reopen.”
The “negative connotation that’s connected with just the word ICE … you feel it, and in your heart of hearts, you have to be able to look at yourself in the mirror,” he said of his abstention.
Givhan said he exited the building, which was not air conditioned, during the meeting to “get some air” and pray. He said he did not talk to other board members and did not see other members talking to each other.
CoreCivic Public Affairs Manager Brian Todd said 2,100 people have already applied for the roughly 240 job openings at the facility. These roles would pay a starting salary of about $26.50 per hour, according to a statement distributed by CoreCivic representatives at the meeting.
“You all may feel that there’s no oversight and accountability at the facility, and that is far, far from the truth,” CoreCivic representative Jerry Langford said. “The facility will operate with strong oversight and accountability … our government partners will have a presence at that facility while we’re operating, including regular audits and on-site monitors. Both our company and the government partners share a deep commitment to humane care.”

Beauregard in St. Bernard Parish, pictured in July 2025. (Piper Hutchinson/Louisiana Illuminator)ST. BERNARD PARISH — Before being elevated by Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, the slave-owning new namesake of the state’s largest National Guard training facility was at best a footnote in history, according to a review of what few documents are available to trace his background. 
Camp Beauregard, founded in 1917 in Pineville, was originally named after Confederate Gen. Pierre Gustav Toutant Beauregard, a St. Bernard Parish native who initiated the attack on Fort Sumter, South Carolina, to begin the Civil War. In 2023, Beauregard’s name was removed from the facility amid a nationwide effort to remove monuments and honorifics to Confederate veterans and leaders. 
Landry announced in July the facility would be renamed after the Confederate general’s father, Jacques Toutant-Beauregard. 
The governor’s decision to restore the Beauregard name is in keeping with the style of President Donald Trump’s administration, which has restored the former Confederate names of military installations by selecting unrelated military heroes.

But Landry’s choice of honoree is different. 
For starters, Camp Beauregard’s new namesake is shown in nearly every historical document and on his grave as Jacques Toutant. According to a biography of his son, “P.G.T. Beauregard, Napoleon in Gray,” by historian T. Harry Williams, the future Confederate general began going by a single last name, Beauregard, when he enrolled at West Point in an attempt to Americanize himself. 
Jacques Toutant is also different from Trump’s other restored honorees as he is related to the original namesake. He also does not have any distinctive military accomplishments and was a slave owner, which to many make him a worse choice than his son, who adopted more racially moderate stances after the war. 
“It signals to the Black citizens in [Louisiana] that [Landry] thinks you’re second-class and he doesn’t care if you’re offended,” University of North Carolina Charlotte historian Karen Cox, a scholar on the legacy of Confederate monuments, said of Landry’s decision. 
Landry spokeswoman Kate Kelly did not respond to a request for comment as to why the National Guard facility was being renamed, who was involved in the decision or why Landry opted to name it after a slave owner. 
Little is known about Jacques Toutant other than that he owned a sugarcane plantation in St. Bernard Parish that was later named Contreras. Enslaved people were forced to work on his fields and in his home. Toutant also served as a captain in the Louisiana Militia, though historical records don’t tie him to any particular battle. 
Six historians at four universities contacted for this report declined to comment on his history, citing how little they as individuals – and historians as a group – know about the elder Beauregard. 
“Very little has been written on Contreras Plantation or on Jacques Beauregard, apart from brief mentions in biographies of P.G.T Beauregard,” LSU historian John Bardes said. 
The most detailed records of Toutant’s life come in the Slave Schedules of the 1850 census, which list the age, residence and owner of each enslaved person in the United States. 
Toutant is listed as the owner of 86 enslaved people, ranging from a 60-year-old Black woman to a 2-year-old mixed-race child. The names of the enslaved people Toutant owned were never recorded. 
According to P.G.T. Beauregard’s biographer, T. Harry Williams, Toutant forced an enslaved woman to nurse his children, a practice that often forcefully separated Black women from their own infants. 
Even on his home turf in St. Bernard Parish, the name Jacques Toutant is all but forgotten. 
The site of the Contreras Plantation, where a large home burned down in the mid-20th century, is marked with a decrepit memorial to P.G.T. Beauregard. Enclosed on three sides by barbed-wire topped fences, the grassy patches that surround the memorial were littered with empty beer cans and rotted picnic tables when visited by a reporter in late July. 
The white brick pyramid memorial at the Contreras site was financed by Judge Leander Perez, according to local historian and author Sean Michael Chick. Perez is remembered as a dogged segregationist who was excommunicated from the Catholic Church for his efforts to obstruct the integration of schools in New Orleans. He also attempted to stop civil rights workers from entering Plaquemines Parish to help Black residents register to vote. 
Once pristine, the pyramid was covered in grayish muck during a reporter’s recent visit. It only mentions Toutant as among the general’s ancestors. 
Less than 2 miles down the road, Toutant is buried in the St. Bernard Parish Catholic Cemetery. The engraved door to his tomb is broken in over a dozen places, his name hardly legible through the cracks and the wear of time.

The grave also bears a medallion commemorating Toutant as a veteran of the War of 1812. 
It is on this veteran status that Landry chose to honor Toutant. 
“By restoring the name Camp Beauregard, we honor a legacy of courage and service that dates back over two centuries,” Landry said in his announcement about the renaming. 
Through a public records request, the Illuminator obtained the historical documents the Louisiana National Guard said it used to justify renaming its Pineville training base after Toutant. They included militia payroll records that span from Dec. 16, 1814, to March 20, 1815. They indicate Toutant served under Col. Pierre Denys de la Ronde, who led the Louisiana Militia at the Battle of New Orleans and later earned the rank of major general. 
The records do not definitively place Toutant at the site of any particular battle or indicate he earned any military honors. A Louisiana National Guard press release announcing the renaming notes his regiment took part in a prelude to the Battle of New Orleans, although historians have noted only minor skirmishes along Lake Borgne before the war’s final conflict in Chalmette.  
Despite having no details on Toutant’s militia service, Maj. Gen. Thomas Friloux, adjutant general of the Louisiana National Guard, praised him as an American hero. 
“We’re naming our premier training installation after an American hero and patriot who fought for the freedom of the city of New Orleans, the State of Louisiana, and the United States of America against a foreign invader,” Friloux said. 
When asked about this discrepancy, Louisiana National Guard spokeswoman Lt. Col. Noel Collins referred questions to the Society of the War of 1812’s Louisiana chapter, which she said was consulted for information about Toutant. 
Chapter president Brig. Gen. Rodney Painting, who is listed online as an assistant adjutant general in the Louisiana National Guard, did not respond to a request for comment.

Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In total, lawmakers in 25 states, including Colorado, introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Gov. Polis vetoes 11 bills, a personal record, passed in 2025 by Colorado Legislature

Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
“Allowing (the measure) to become law would require a driver to be present in commercial vehicles, which may undermine innovation of future technologies that could increase road safety,” Polis said in his veto letter.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A pro-private school voucher group that poured millions into 2024 Tennessee House races is setting its sights on a Republican in the 7th District Congressional special election.
A dark money group called the School Freedom Fund spent almost $20,000 in early August to oppose state Rep. Jody Barrett, a Dickson Republican. Last year, the School Freedom Fund spent more than $3.1 million in state legislative races to boost candidates who backed Gov. Bill Lee’s private school voucher program. 
The spending paid off when the legislation narrowly passed the state House at the start of 2025. Barrett vocally opposed and voted against the voucher program. 
The group’s spending is expected to grow significantly after it reported in June that the political action committee had a $10 million war chest, according to the Federal Election Commission. Dark money is funding raised to influence elections, typically by nonprofits groups not required to disclose the names of donors.
“It’s not a surprise,” Barrett said in response to questions from the Lookout. “I think most people who pay attention to state-level politics knew what was coming when they saw who was entering this race to replace Mark Green.”
Tennessee’s election to fill an open seat left by Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Green is set for an Oct. 7 primary, and the general election is scheduled for Dec. 2. He stepped away from the post with more than a year left in his term, creating a surge of interest in the congressional seat: 19 Republicans and five Democrats have picked up petitions to run.

Kip Capley, Gino Bulso and Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson. Reeves and Bulso are running for Congress in Tennessee’s 7th District. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
One candidate for the post, Republican state Rep. Lee Reeves of Franklin, benefited to the tune of $787,100 from independent spending by the School Freedom Fund in 2024. Reeves, who did not respond to phone calls, also received an endorsement in his 2024 campaign from Lee, an unusual move from a governor in a state race. Reeves won by less than 100 votes in the Republican primary.
Club for Growth President David McIntosh, whose group controls independent spending by the School Freedom Fund, recently circulated posts on X, formerly Twitter, saying Barrett is “anti-Trump” and voted against the “school choice” bill. The voucher measure will start this year, providing $7,200 each to 20,000 Tennessee students to use for private-school attendance.
“He’s the opposite of what we need in TN-07. Kick this snake to the curb,” McIntosh’s video says.
The post also contains comments from Barrett in 2016 when he supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for the presidency and called Trump “a liberal douchebag.”
Responding to that criticism, Barrett sent comments to the Lookout showing McIntosh also questioned the president by saying, “Donald Trump is the worst kind of politician – he will say anything to get elected.” It was part of a Club for Growth attack ad that circulated in 2016.
Barrett said the group is “having to dig awfully deep” if it is questioning his skepticism about Trump from nine years ago before he took office and showed the type of policies he would support.
Despite $4.5 million in spending by pro-private school voucher groups last year, support for the governor’s bill gained only a couple of votes, including those of Reeves and Rep. Aron Maberry, a Clarksville Republican. The group spent almost $1.8 million in those two races, far outpacing any other spending. 
Republican Sen. Jessie Seal also received independent backing totaling more than half a million dollars in his defeat of the late Sen. Frank Niceley, a Strawberry Plains farmer who died in June. Niceley vocally opposed vouchers. 
Seal, a Tazewell Republican, voted against the private-school voucher bill along with first-term Sens. Bobby Harshbarger of Kingsport and Tom Hatcher of Maryville.
Hashbarger defeated pro-voucher Sen. Jon Lundberg of Bristol, then voted against the bill even though his mother, U.S. Rep. Diana Harshbarger, is a major supporter of President Trump, who along with Lee called private-school vouchers the “civil rights issue” of this era.

Patrick Morrisey said Tuesday he’s inclined to comply with a request from President Donald Trump’s administration to supply personal data for state residents who rely on a federal food assistance program. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has asked states to turn over the information, including recipients’ names, dates of birth, personal addresses and Social Security numbers to comply with a Trump executive order called “Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos.”
The request also included records to calculate the amount of SNAP benefits they got over time.
Morrisey said he needs to look further into the federal request for SNAP recipients personal data, but conceptually the state wants to help the Trump administration’s purpose.
“The goal that they have is to root out fraud, waste and abuse, and to go after undocumented aliens,” Morrisey said. “And I think that they want to look at a number of the public programs, including SNAP. I’m supportive of that. 
“Obviously you always want to protect the privacy of citizens, but there’s a real issue ensuring that we’re going to have the adequate details to go after fraud, waste and abuse, and to make sure that undocumented aliens and other people are not taking advantage of these benefits unlawfully,” he said. “So my inclination is to work closely with the Trump administration on that and make sure that we’re giving them the tools they need to limit bad use of taxpayer money.”
Morrisey’s comments came in response to a question from West Virginia Watch.
Last week, 22 organizations — including the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, the ACLU of West Virginia, Facing Hunger Foodbank and the West Virginia Food and Farm Coalition — called on Morrisey to reject with the request, calling it “an outrageous act of federal overreach” without clear parameters for how the federal government intends to use the personal data. 
A coalition of 21 states and Washington D.C. led by Democrat attorneys general in California and New York sued the federal government over privacy concerns with the data request. They asked a judge to stop the government from making the demand or stop it from withholding funding from states that don’t comply. 
In West Virginia last year, more than 277,000 people got SNAP benefits, according to the Center on Budget and Policy.

Currently Stage 1 fire restrictions are in place for state, Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service lands, but we need to double-down in our message to Idahoans about the need for everyone to be smart and do your part to prevent wildfires. 
Idaho wildfire potential remains high as hot temperatures continue 

As a rancher, mom, business woman, volunteer wildland firefighter and chair of the Idaho Rangeland Resources Commission, I’m particularly concerned about the huge potential for range fires ignited by careless people when they’re venturing outdoors.
Roughly 80 percent of the wildfires that occur in Idaho and the West are typically human-caused. It might be accidental; it might be out of neglect. But we can make a difference if we use common sense. 
I live near Grand View, and when I see a giant mushroom cloud rising above the Snake River Plains and the mountains above, I get this awful feeling in my heart about who or what might be killed or injured by that wildfire, who’s valuable range might be getting burned up, the potential loss of wildlife and livestock, native plants and shrubs, and more. 
In the Idaho Rangeland Resources Commission’s Life on the Range series, we featured a story about the human-caused Moose wildfire near Salmon in 2022. The fire quickly took off in steep terrain in the Salmon River Breaks, and burned 130,000 acres over 4 ½ months, causing millions in damage. 
One careless camper left a campfire unattended the morning after spending the night next to the Salmon River. Sparks from the campfire blew across the river into a steep canyon and suddenly the whole canyon was ablaze. All of this because of one person neglecting to do one of the most basic things when you go camping: put out your campfire until it’s dead-out! It must be doused with water until it’s cold to the touch.  
Humans can cause fires in other ways too: 

Vehicle fires occur along our highways and freeways from poorly maintained vehicles or flat tires that can turn into balls of fire.  
Dragging chains behind any kind of trailer.
Errant bullets can strike rocks and spark wildfires from shooters who don’t have a proper backstop. 
Sparks from chainsaws, motorbikes or ATVs can ignite wildfires in tall grass. 
Arson-caused fires … the unthinkable does happen! 

Dry conditions in the West make the risk of catastrophic wildfire from lightning that comes with afternoon thunderstorms very high. Firefighter staffing is limited within the region. When a human-caused fire starts, it can force firefighting professionals to respond to areas they wouldn’t otherwise have to be, and prevent them from responding quickly to lightning — caused fires that can quickly move across the landscape. 
Please, do your part to keep Idaho, Idaho, and let’s enjoy the rest of the summer with clear blue smokeless skies.

(Shalina Chatlani | Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court has set the date it will hear new arguments in a Louisiana case that could have ripple effects for congressional redistricting around the country.
The court will hear debate Oct. 15 in Callais v. Louisiana after asking both sides to file new briefs in response to its latest question: Could a state violate the 14th or 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution when it draws election maps to comply with the Voting Rights Act?
The Callias case was filed by a group of non-Black voters in Louisiana after the legislature updated the state’s six congressional districts last year to carve out a second U.S. House seat to give a minority candidate a better chance of being elected. The 6th Congressional District was reconfigured to stretch from Baton Rouge to Shreveport, zig-zagging along the way to pick up pockets of Black voters.
The 14th Amendment, in part, addresses representation in Congress, while the 15th Amendment prevents citizens from being denied the right to vote based on their race. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 strengthened provisions in these amendments, although the more conservative makeup of the Supreme Court over the past decade has peeled back some of those protections.

In the Callais case, justices are drilling down on Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting laws and procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. 
Republican leaders in the legislature have said politics, not race, were the predominant influence on how the boundaries of their congressional map were drawn. Sen. Glen Womack, R-Harrisonburg, who authored the law that created the new districts, said its lines were specifically drawn to protect U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and House Speaker Mike Johnson – all Republicans. 
To craft another Black majority district, much of the old 6th District in and around Baton Rouge was redrawn to fall within Letlow’s 5th District. That led to the ouster of 6th District Congressman Garret Graves, who had aligned himself against the state’s most powerful Republicans. 
When Scalise was nominated for U.S. House speaker in the fall of 2023, Graves declined to support him out of loyalty to Kevin McCarthy, who had been removed from the post. In the Louisiana governor’s race that year, Graves endorsed longtime friend Stephen Waguespack, putting him at odds with the frontrunner and eventual winner, Jeff Landry.     
It was Landry, as the new governor in January 2024, who called the legislature into special session to revise the state’s congressional districts. As attorney general, his office defended a map lawmakers approved in February 2022 with a single Black-majority U.S. House seat despite the 2020 census showing Louisiana’s Black population had reached nearly one-third. Black voters challenged the map in federal court, and it was ruled unconstitutional.
How we got here: Louisiana’s redistricting case puts the Voting Rights Act on trial 

State lawmakers refused to budge, taking no action to update congressional districts during a second redistricting session in June 2022. This kept the lawsuit from earlier in the year, Robinson v. Ardoin, in play.
In October 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Alabama Legislature had to redo a map it approved with just one majority-minority district out of seven. Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the court’s liberals in determining the Alabama map violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 
Lawmakers had to add a second Black district in Alabama, which has a smaller share of Black voters in Louisiana. The decision was considered a possible harbinger for Callais until the Supreme Court issued an order Aug. 1, seeking parties to submit briefs in response to its question about the 14th and 15th amendments.       
Attorney General Liz Murrill has until Aug. 27 to file her answers, while the plaintiffs have until Sept. 17. A ruling in the case isn’t expected until next spring. 
Murrill has offered no comments on the Callais case since the Supreme Court’s Aug. 1 order, only saying in a statement Tuesday she will make herself available for interviews after the state files its brief. Louisiana Solicitor General Ben Aguiñaga will argue on behalf of the state, she added.
At the court’s initial hearing on Callais in March, Aguiñaga told justices that Louisiana’s congressional map was created in response to federal court rulings that required the addition of a second majority-Black district. 
He also mentioned that the state feels Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional, but state lawmakers opted to redraw its maps because Louisiana had lost prior court cases making that same argument.
The Louisiana case has been pushed to backburner news status as redistricting showdowns in other states have gained prominence. Mid-decade congressional map changes are rare, but Republican governors loyal to President Donald Trump are aggressively pushing their GOP-majority legislatures to add red U.S. House seats to offset possible losses in next year’s mid-term elections. Democratic state leaders are positioning themselves for countermoves.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Thirty minutes, every other month was all it took for Tina McDonald to make a difference in the lives of Claudia Dunagan and her nonagenarian mother, Hazel.
Armed with a smile and a bag of sterilized foot care equipment, McDonald, a wound and ostomy nurse, skillfully and gently trimmed the thick toenails that Hazel, a homebound diabetic, could no longer care for herself.
For 16 months, it was the perfect solution. Until it wasn’t. 
Two months after Hazel’s 100th birthday, in January 2024, McDonald texted Dunagan to cancel their upcoming appointment. The Rhode Island Department of Health had issued a cease and desist order, forcing her to halt the business she’d begun 12 years earlier, unknowingly violating state laws governing foot care. 
Dunagan, 77, searched for an alternative, asking certified nursing assistants and home hospice nurses, even considering a peducurist willing to come to her Providence condo. Their answers were the same: “We can’t touch feet.” 
Basic foot care is especially crucial, but also more complicated, for people with diabetes, arthritis and other underlying blood and vascular conditions, which are also more prevalent in seniors. Lack of regular nail trims and callus shaving can lead to serious medical consequences, including infections and falls.
“There was no one in the entire state,” Dunagan said in a recent interview. “I had zero options.”
Legislation introduced this year by Rep. Jennifer Boylan, a Barrington Democrat, sought to give the mother-daughter duo, and others like them, a solution. The bill would clarify the uncertainty in state law by explicitly allowing certified nurses to perform routine preventive and maintenance foot care at home. It seemed an obvious solution —  one allowed in every state in the country except Rhode Island.
“It sounds trivial to someone who is healthy and can reach their feet, but as soon as you can’t, it’s not,” Boylan said. “It’s quite frankly unacceptable that people are going without care. In an elderly population, every day, every month counts.”
Boylan’s bill won unanimous support in the Rhode Island House in a June 12 vote. But it failed to advance in the Rhode Island Senate, and ultimately, died without even a hearing before the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services. 
Greg Paré, a spokesperson for the Senate, said it was a timing and logistics problem — without a Senate companion, the chamber had to wait till Boylan’s bill passed the House to consider it. There just wasn’t enough time before the 2025 legislative session ended on June 21.
“Should a version of this legislation come before the Senate earlier in next year’s session, it will be reviewed,” Paré said in an email.
Boylan pledged to reintroduce the same, revised bill early in the 2026 session. She already has a Senate sponsor, Sen. Lori Urso, a Pawtucket Democrat.

350 people on waiting list
Dunagan’s mother died in February 2024. But hundreds of homebound seniors and their caregivers are still searching for someone to provide the basic foot care critical for safety, wellness, and dignity.
McDonald amassed a 350-person waiting list during the four months of 2023 when she paused her practice while the state nursing board conducted a review after receiving an anonymous complaint.
State nursing law doesn’t explicitly prohibit nurses from providing home foot care. They don’t name it as a provided service, either. Meanwhile, a separate section of state law governing podiatry stipulates that only licensed podiatrists can treat feet.
The state health department cited the podiatry law as the reason why McDonald could not provide home foot care.
“The nursing regulations are vague,” McDonald said. “To me, this falls within our nursing practice, but I didn’t want to risk losing my license.”
Lynda D’Alessia, state nursing director, did not respond to inquiries for comment.

– Claudia Dunagan of Providence on her fruitless search for home foot care for her nonagenarian mother, Hazel.


McDonald has now rebuilt her business to exclusively focus on Massachusetts, and has  a contract with Bristol Aging & Wellness, a nonprofit serving seniors in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Her former patients did not fare as well.
Anne Hagan, a home hospice nurse who lives in Warwick, wrote to lawmakers with a litany of stories, including a homebound veteran whose neglected toenails had grown so long and thick he couldn’t trim them with standard clippers. He eventually took a jacknife to his nails, ending up in a “pool of blood,” Hagan wrote. 
Leigh Anne Cappello, a Barrington resident, described an aging family member whose foot cyst became infected after it went undetected.
“It is easy to go unnoticed since their feet are largely covered in socks, slippers or shoes,” Cappello wrote. “What could have been addressed with some basic foot health/hygiene care turns into a more difficult problem that can even affect mobility — something that is so critical to their overall health.”
McDonald sympathized in her testimony to House lawmakers during a March 27 hearing on Boylan’s bill.
“If you’ve never been a family caregiver, it is difficult to imagine the stress, exhaustion, isolation and grief that one experiences,” McDonald told House lawmakers who serve on the Committee on Health and Human Services. “As access to services outside the home becomes less accessible, the pressure on the caregiver increases. Nurses need to be allowed to fill in the gaps, to let people age in place with dignity.”
The Rhode Island Developmental Disabilities Council, the Rhode Island Nurses Association, AARP and a host of local senior services agencies backed Boylan’s bill, too. 
Many were surprised to learn that home foot care nurses weren’t already allowed.
“Everybody seemed genuinely unaware of this gap in services,” said Carol Anne Costa, executive director for the Senior Agenda Coalition of Rhode Island. 










Everybody seemed genuinely unaware of this gap in services. 


– Carol Anne Costa, executive director for the Senior Agenda Coalition of Rhode Island. 


Costa expects the gap will widen as Rhode Island’s senior population swells and its residents look to live out their final years at home.
“As a rule, we have been very successful in enabling older adults to age in place,” Costa said. “With that success naturally comes the need for more services to sustain them in their homes.”
Podiatrists push back 
Representatives from the American Podiatric Medical Association and the Rhode Island Podiatric Medical Association wrote to lawmakers with concerns over the health and safety implications of letting nurses provide home care to patients whose age or other diagnoses — like diabetes — make even routine trimmings more risky.
“While routine foot care sounds nice, more often than not, it is not routine and it is more than foot care,” Dr. Sarah Cathcart, vice president of the Rhode Island Podiatric Medical Association, told lawmakers during the March 27 committee hearing. 
Cathcart works at South County Foot and Ankle in Warwick, and said she, and most other podiatrists, make house calls outside of regular office hours.
But, Cathcart acknowledged when questioned by lawmakers, home visits are usually to existing patients — not new ones. 
And federal Medicare rules require that any patients receiving care at home from a podiatrist first secure a medical necessity determination from a primary care provider. 
“I have to protect my license and my practice,” Dr. Michael Reuter, a podiatrist with Brown University Health in East Providence, told lawmakers during the committee hearing.
The Rhode Island Podiatric Medical Association and its members did not respond to follow-up inquiries.
McDonald doesn’t take insurance, and therefore doesn’t need any paperwork to make a house call. She charges $100 per visit, seeing 30 to 40 people weekly. Podiatrists told lawmakers they treat a couple people at home per week, or less.
Seeking to assuage podiatric concerns, Boylan changed her bill between its initial committee hearing and approval on the House floor, adding more specific requirements to the training and scope of services that qualifying nurses could provide. She also moved the proposal from the state law governing podiatrists to the section on nursing, modeling the language after the advisory rules set by the Massachusetts Board of Nursing.
 The health department did not take a position on Boylan’s bill.
“We would only take a position if something in a piece of legislation represented a health or safety concern, or if we believed that our support for a bill would clarify its benefits for legislators and the public,” Joseph Wendelken, a spokesperson for the health department, said in an emailed response. 
Claudia Dunagan never found someone else to trim Hazel’s toenails after McDonald was ordered to stop coming. Her last view of Hazel after she died was of her feet, the long, curling toenails peeking out from beneath the blanket covering her mother’s body.
“When I saw her feet, that was the one relief I had that she died then, because there was no one to care for them,” Dunagan said.

BEREA — A safer era for Madison County and the region is just three months away, according to the governor’s top man for overseeing the destruction of chemical weapons previously stored at the Blue Grass Army Depot.
Craig Williams, a Berea resident and Vietnam veteran, has been leading the way to decommission the toxic gasses for the past 40 years after he learned they were to be disposed of dangerously. 
“The Army was going to incinerate them. Obviously, that was a bad idea,” Williams told The Edge in a sideline interview at the first regularly scheduled Berea City Council meeting of August. 
The decommissioning of these weapons was federally declared 100% complete in July of 2023. The declaration referred to actual weapons, according to Williams, who told The Edge that the remaining materials are not explosive, and so were not included in the terms of the decommissioning.

“There already are no chemical weapons in Kentucky. There are chemical warfare agent-contaminated weapon components that are being destroyed now,” said Williams, co-chair of the Kentucky Chemical Demilitarization Citizens’ Advisory Commission which is appointed by the governor.
 Nerve gas contamination

During his presentation, which included multiple slides, Williams told the Berea council that as of Aug. 4, more than 89% of the 17,739 warheads containing residual amounts of nerve agent VX have been destroyed. In the past two months alone, Williams said more than 2,400 of these contaminated warheads were destroyed. 
Contaminated warheads containing residual amounts of nerve agent GB have been 98% destroyed, Williams said, adding that in June and July of this year, 5,500 of these warheads were destroyed. 
In the past year, the decommissioning project’s recordable safety incident rate was 0.16, and that as of June 30, 17,122,130 hours and 2,117 days have been completed on the project without a lost-time accident, according to Williams. 
“Every time I go out there, I am always impressed that these folks have gotten rid of all these chemical weapons without any serious incidents. It’s a remarkable accomplishment,” Williams told the council. 
Many other necessary infrastructure changes have been made to prepare for the demolition of the main chemical plant at the depot, scheduled for summer 2026, according to Williams.
Chips from the concrete “igloos” (concrete bunkers) that housed the chemical weapons are now being analyzed, Williams said, and the environmental team on the project awaits the results. The entire warhead destruction portion of the project is now slated for completion by November of this year, he said. 
“We’ve been working on this project for 40 years. It never ceases to amaze me how many agencies and procedures you have to go through in order to get one item checked off the list,” Williams told council. “However, they are making extremely good progress.”
 Job losses

A reduction in force at the depot has been tied to project milestones, according to Williams, who said that at one time there had been 1,460 employees, but the drawdown now leaves just over 900 workers there. Another 200 employees are scheduled to be laid off now through the fall, Williams said. There has been a 57%  placement rate of Blue Grass Army Depot workers into roles elsewhere, once their work at the depot was complete, according to Williams. 
Bechtel Parsons Bluegrass held a job fair for displaced depot workers Tuesday at the Madison County Fairgrounds. Participating companies included Enersys, Hyster Yale, Georgetown Municipal Water & Sewer, Qualex, and others, Williams said. 
 Economic impact

Williams said the decommissioning’s economic impact has been significant. Half of the project is staffed with local hires, he said. Also, well over $200 million has been spent with Kentucky companies, with more than half of that spent in Madison County, according to Williams. More than $1.4 billion in payroll have been paid to local workers, he said. 
Defense bill paves way for ‘new missions’ at Blue Grass Army Depot, says McConnell

Williams also told The Edge that Kentucky’s retiring Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell was instrumental to the safety mission. “He was the spearhead on the political side of things,” Williams said, noting that there were many others who also helped ensure the weapons were disposed of in a manner not harmful to residents. Williams said McConnell got involved directly in 1996.
“Once he understood our position on the technology (that could help destroy the weapons safely), and we demonstrated to him that not only were we advocating that, but there was a broad section of scientific engineering and environmental scrutiny being given to what (the Army)proposed to do, and he realized that that was not safe for anybody, then he helped us out,” Williams said. 
 Gratitude

“I appreciate everyone taking the time to listen, and I anticipate probably one or two more presentations as time goes on. Then I will bid a fond farewell to chemical weapons and my role in it, and I will be joyously working in my garden instead of making slides for y’all,” Williams concluded. 
Williams was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2006 for leading a national grassroots coalition that convinced the Pentagon to halt plans to burn four chemical weapons stockpiles, including the one in Kentucky, and instead use a chemical-neutralization process to dispose of the deadly substances.
Councilmember John Payne commended Williams.
“I just want to say thank you,” Payne said. “It’s been a decades-long endeavor to remove these toxic materials from Madison County, and I think we all feel a little bit safer for it.”
“I know I do,” Williams said.

Thomas Massie asserts strong positions in opposition to President Donald Trump, he increasingly looks like the future of the Republican Party.
Americans who appreciate political courage, including Trump supporters, are celebrating Massie’s push for release of the “Epstein files,” the records of the criminal investigation into the late pedophile and child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.
Massie is laser-focused on forcing the U.S. Department of Justice to release the files, as Trump is backtracking on his repeated promises to let the public know who witnessed or participated in Epstein’s crimes.
Principled politicians willing to oppose their own party are hard to find, particularly in Washington, D.C., where office seekers need millions of dollars to pay for their campaigns, and don’t want to offend their party leaders and potential donors by taking a stand. 
Musk enters Massie-Trump fray as two Kentucky Republicans buck president on his ‘beautiful’ bill

Massie is clearly aggravating Trump by calling for release of investigative records in which the president’s name reportedly appears because of his close friendship with Epstein.
Massie is sponsoring a House Resolution requiring Attorney General Pam Bondi to release “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice” connected to Epstein.  
In the four years between his first and second terms, Trump and his supporters frequently called for the release of the files.  Vice President JD Vance, Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, Donald Trump Jr., and others like Sean Hannity were particularly adamant about “transparency” and “holding people accountable.”  
A few months ago, on Hannity’s show, Bondi said the FBI received a “truckload” of Epstein evidence, and “everything’s going to come out to the public. The public has the right to know.”
On June 5, Trump’s close adviser Elon Musk posted on X:  “Time to drop the really big bomb, realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.  That is the real reason they have not been made public.” Musk then wrote: “Mark this post for the future.  The truth will come out.”
Weeks later, the Justice Department released a memo stating “no further disclosure (of Epstein information) would be appropriate or warranted.”
Massie is almost alone among Republicans in pushing back on the government’s Epstein cover-up, and in doing so, he offers his party hope for the future. Trump got millions of votes from people who saw him as the anti-politician who would take on Washington’s elite political class, expose years of wrongdoing and punish whoever was doing it.
Recently, on “Meet the Press,” Massie said: “The release of the Epstein files is emblematic of what Trump ran for and why he got the populist vote.  There seems to be a class of people beyond the law, beyond the judicial system … and we all thought that when Trump was elected, he would be the bull in the china shop, and he would break that up and bring transparency.”
“They’re the ones — it’s the president’s own attorney general, FBI director, children … and vice president who said these files need to be released,” Massie said. “We’re just trying to hold their feet to the fire.”
If the Epstein cover-up continues, more Trump supporters could move away from the president and toward leaders like Massie, who fight for transparency and against dishonest dealings that Republicans hoped Trump would banish from Washington.
This could mean bright political prospects for Massie.  In Kentucky’s 2026 U.S. Senate race, three Trump bootlickers are groveling for the president’s endorsement, which may be far less valuable next year than they hope. 
Although Massie hasn’t recently expressed interest in the Senate race, there’s a lane open for him because he has a political philosophy that lines up with most Republicans, but includes an independent, anti-corruption streak that appeals to voters looking for a consistent conservative who’s willing to fight the establishment.

(Photo by Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)A board that oversees the management of critical forage fish menhaden along the Atlantic coast is looking into further restricting Virginia’s only commercial menhaden reduction fishery.
Last week, the Atlantic States Marine Commission’s menhaden management board voted to task a workgroup with determining options for spreading out menhaden reduction fishing caps throughout the year to manage the fish populations in the Chesapeake Bay.
This would only impact Ocean Harvesters, owned by Reedville-based Omega Protein, which is already under reduction fishing caps of 51,000 metric tons. This fishery reduces the fish into oil and fishmeal. Smaller fisheries in the bay use the fish for bait. Some sportsfishers and environmentalists believe too many menhaden are being fished from the Chesapeake. One group of anglers recently penned a letter to President Donald Trump to sign an executive order to protect the fish.
The Menhaden Fisheries Coalition, conversely, feels the Virginia reduction fishery has been unfairly blamed for issues in the entire ecosystem that could potentially be attributed to environmental challenges, however, more data is needed to nail down the specific impacts on menhaden in the Chesapeake Bay.
Fewer fish prompts quest for more data
Lynn Fegley of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources introduced the motion to begin exploring further restrictions on Omega Protein. Fegley said a smaller fishery in her state is suffering because menhaden are not reaching their shores. She claimed that the population of fish is being accounted for in other parts of the Chesapeake Bay, but they are not seeing enough of them in the northern bay.
“The reduction fisheries’ pressure has been increasing in the middle part of the summer… and potentially leading to a choke point where that biomass of menhaden isn’t making its way into Maryland,” said Will Poston, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s forage fish manager. “Maryland’s small scale commercial fisheries, which are stationary gears, pound nets that have a well established time series of data.”
Maryland experienced a major fish kill of thousands of mostly juvenile menhaden washing up on their shores in the summer of 2024 that was attributed to low oxygen due to water quality issues.
“We understand that this is a coast-wide issue. We understand that things are changing … there is significant effort by a large-scale fishery in the Chesapeake Bay. The fish were there but they were not where we are,” Fegley said.
The Menhaden Fisheries Coalition fired back on allegations their operations are bottlenecking the nutrient-rich fish and preventing them from reaching farther up the Chesapeake Bay to Maryland fisheries, as well as leading to osprey populations decreasing.
“Now, when fishermen report low summer menhaden catch, Maryland frames the pound net fishery as a targeted menhaden fishery under threat from Virginia’s “intercept” fleet—itself an incredible stretch to suggest six menhaden fishing boats “blockade” the lower Chesapeake Bay,” the coalition’s statement read.
Fegley also led an effort last year to look into “precautionary management” methods. A workgroup compiled a list of ideas on how to manage the concerns around the menhaden populations but frequently mentioned the need for more data.
The commission’s stock report of menhaden accepted in 2022 for all of the Atlantic Coast states that menhaden are not overfished. But some environmentalists believe that the Chesapeake Bay populations specifically are in decline and the data is getting lost in the big picture. 
“I am not saying this is an intercept fishery. What I am saying is that the conditions are changing in such a way that we are having a real fishery problem in Maryland. This is not just about Maryland, it is about an ecosystem that supports the coast,” Fegley said.
Due to the drop in striped bass and osprey populations that rely on the forage fish to survive, conservationists are eager to find a solution. The U.S. Geological Survey presented to the board last summer about the osprey decline.
“Their findings suggested that while the Chesapeake Bay osprey decline was real, it likely stemmed from a complex array of ecological stressors, not simply the availability of menhaden. In fact, USGS explicitly did not attribute osprey declines to menhaden harvest pressure,” the Menhaden Fisheries Coalition said in a statement.
Commercial fishing yields of menhaden have also reportedly dropped in recent years according to Fegley and other board members, leading them to look for any insight into why it is happening. There have been state-level efforts to fund research in the Virginia General Assembly into the bay’s menhaden populations but those efforts have not been successful.
“The Chesapeake’s fisheries and predators can’t wait. Menhaden are key to a thriving Chesapeake Bay, and a healthy, productive Chesapeake is vital to the entire Atlantic coast,” said Chris Moore, Chesapeake Bay Foundation Virginia Executive Director. “We appreciate the efforts of those on the ASMFC menhaden management board who have worked to keep this important issue at the forefront.” 
In a press release response to comments made by Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Ocean Harvest said “(CBF) omits mention of well-documented water quality issues in Maryland that may also explain the localized fishery observations cited.”
The workgroup will collect data on the possibility of the reduction fishing caps being shifted to different parts of the seasons, as members of the board shared insight into the menhaden populations showing up in the Chesapeake later in the year. The work group will present their ideas on how to manage the fishery caps at the ASMC winter 2026 board meeting.
The board members said “something is going on” but they aren’t sure why the fish are arriving late and not approaching the shore as much as they used to. Fourteen of the board members voted in favor of the work group, with the representatives from Virginia and New Jersey voting against it.
Some of the members pointed out that there are similar concerns around menhaden yields, striped bass population decline, and osprey decline along the coast outside of the Chesapeake Bay. They want to focus research into the cause and how to protect the fish beyond imposing additional restrictions on the one fishery. 
“The only real recourse to ensure the health of the ecosystem is to err on the side of conservation and be more risk averse in how (to) manage this industrial fishery that concentrates so much effort in and around Chesapeake Bay,” Poston said.
The 2024 workgroup made multiple recommendations on how to obtain better data around the menhaden populations, such as seasonal or area closures for menhaden reduction fishing, quota days or periods, restricting some gear usage, or further reducing the menhaden reduction fishing cap.

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)North Carolinians were able to provide public comment on a natural gas pipeline at a hearing Tuesday evening, the latest step in the MVP Southgate project cutting through the state.
The Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Water Resources (DWR) held the hearing so members of the public could make their voices heard on Mountain Valley Pipeline’s LLC application for a 401 water quality certification.
Mountain Valley Pipeline segment ruptures during test

Running through Rockingham and Alamance counties, the pipeline has been controversial project for years. DEQ denied a water quality permit for the Southgate project in 2020, NC Newsline previously reported.
Out of roughly 150 comments received in advance of Tuesday’s hearing, only three were in favor of the project: one, a coalition of pipeliners, another an individual who is affiliated with the pipeliners union, and a third person who did not indicate their affiliation.
Hundreds of members of the Pipeliners Local Union 798 signed a letter backing the project.
“In addition to the tax revenue and job creation that MVP Southgate is poised to generate, this project’s approval is clearly in the region’s best interest, as it secures access to domestically sourced natural gas, safely and efficiently transporting it back to consumers that need it most,” Danny Hendrix, the union’s business manager, wrote in a supporting statement.
The union’s letter highlights the financial opportunities and jobs that could be created by the project.
MVP Southgate would invest $21 million into North Carolina’s economy and support more than 200 jobs in the state, according to the letter.
Hendrix also cited a rising need for natural gas in the region and said the project has “consistently demonstrated a commitment to environmental-sustainable goals” by adhering to feedback from members of the community.
“MVP Southgate is a central part of making a reliable supply of natural gas available for residents and small business owners in the region,” the letter continued.
The bulk of the submitted comments oppose the project, with some entries spanning dozens and even hundreds of pages.
Some came from organizations like the Southern Environmental Law Center or Wild Virginia. Others were submissions from individuals simply indicating  that they did not agree with the project.
Blakely Hildebrand, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, wrote the group’s opposition to the application.
She cited DWR’s denial of MVP’s original 401 water quality certification more than five years ago due to its “anticipated significant adverse impacts” to water quality in the state.
“MVP’s record of compliance with water quality laws and regulations in other states is abysmal,” Hildebrand wrote. “Virginia and West Virginia have issued dozens of notices of violation to MVP for its failure to project waterways in those states during construction of the MVP Mainline project.”
David Sligh, conservation director at Wild Virginia, focused on the proposed project’s impact to the environment in his letter on behalf of his group.
Pollutants from the project would enter Virginia since the Dan River flows downstream into the state from the project’s areas.
“While the direct discharges addressed in the application for MVP Southgate enter streams and wetlands in North Carolina, impacts from the project would affect Virginia waters and Wild Virginia’s interests,” he wrote.

(Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Breakthrough T1D)U.S. Sen. Susan Collins drew President Donald Trump’s ire last week in a departure from the  unusual deference he has shown toward the Maine Republican. 
Trump told Republicans in a Truth Social post, “when in doubt, vote the exact opposite” of Collins, not referencing any vote in particular. “Generally speaking, you can’t go wrong,” Trump wrote. “Thank you for your attention to this matter and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
Political scientists see the jab as notable but refrained from speculating about whether it signals a shift in their relationship or Collins’ political future, as she is up for reelection in 2026. Maine Republicans and Trump have rejected the idea of forcing a primary on Collins, though someone familiar with the conversation told Politico recently that the president would love to see a “better option.”
Despite the president’s comment, Collins’ approach to Trump hasn’t changed much during his second term, said Mark Brewer, chair of the political science department at the University of Maine. Rather, Brewer said, how Maine’s senior senator continues to handle disagreements with his administration illustrates that she is continuing to try to find a middle ground. 
“She’s been operating the way that she’s, I think, consistently operated,” Brewer said. “She’ll say this publicly, when she doesn’t agree with what the president’s doing, she’ll vote against him. Other times, if she’s supportive of the policy, maybe not necessarily some of the things he does but the underlying policy, she’ll vote in favor of it.” 
Collins has packed millions of dollars into spending bills for Maine. Will it materialize?

That was exactly her response when asked about the president’s criticism of her voting record. “I cast each vote based on what is right for Maine and America,” Collins said in a statement. “Sometimes that means I agree with the President and sometimes I disagree.”
When Maine Morning Star spoke to voters this past spring about Collins’ role during Trump’s second term, some constituents critiqued her piecemeal approach to fighting his cuts to federal programs and funding, arguing that a focus on Trump’s individual actions wouldn’t be effective in deterring the president as he convoluted the federal government’s system of checks and balances. 
That balancing act is currently being tested on an issue Collins has been a vocal proponent of: medical research. 
Public comments
The first full hearing this Congress of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which Collins chairs, was titled “Biomedical research: Keeping America’s edge in innovation.” During her opening remarks, Collins emphasized that the research was a high priority for the committee and stated that no investment pays greater dividends to Americans. 
“Very troubling are the administration’s abrupt cancellation of grants, proposals to slash federal funding, and laying off scientists and technical experts with apparently little or no justification,” Collins said. “These actions put our leadership in biomedical innovation at real risk and must be reversed.”
The Trump administration has also been slow to disburse National Institutes of Health funding as the end of the fiscal year approaches on September 30. Collins and 13 of her Republican colleagues sent a letter to Russell Vought, director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, late last month to share their concerns. 
In their attempt to encourage follow through, the Republicans made appeals to the president’s agenda to slash anything he views as government waste, stating that they believed NIH leadership would ensure the funds are “not diverted to ideological or unaccountable programs.” 
This approach was markedly different from comments by Congress’ top Democratic appropriators, including Washington Sen. Patty Murray, who said in a statement, “this administration is lying about waste, fraud, and abuse at NIH to justify attacking medical research.”
The administration has since backtracked on funds frozen during what they chalked up to a “programmatic review” but hasn’t fully addressed the widespread delay of disbursements.
This week, the Government Accountability Office, an independent congressional watchdog, concluded that the Trump administration violated federal law when canceling NIH grants and slowing new awards.
Votes 
While lawmakers on both sides of the aisle issued statements advocating for the research funds, a legislative proposal was brought forward. 
Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois proposed an amendment to the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education appropriations bill that would have reinstated NIH and other grants that the Trump administration terminated. Stating the issue was not partisan, Durbin listed off examples from several states impacted by such cuts, including Maine, when introducing the amendment. 
“Sen. Collins, Maine Health: two awards canceled or frozen totaling $323,000, including research to focus on rural health needs, and Mount Desert Island Biological Lab has one $5 million award frozen,” Durbin said during the committee meeting. 
Collins, the last to vote, rejected that amendment, which narrowly failed 14-15.
Collins’ Communications Director Phoebe Ferraiolo said the amendment was “too broadly drafted and would make it impossible for this administration and future administrations to cancel any grants, including grants that were failing or duplicative.”
“Senator Collins believes that, regardless of who is in the White House, the administration should be provided the ability to review these programs,” Ferraiolo added. 
That sort of blanket treatment is something Collins has often pointed to when defending her record, specifically on procedural votes. It’s also something some constituents have critiqued as inadequate as Trump has upended established procedure. They’ve also critiqued what they see as Collins’ piecemeal approach to funding restorations. 
When explaining that Collins has had success with pushing back on Trump administration decisions she disagrees with, Ferraiolo pointed to the reinstatement of some NIH grants in June for Jackson Laboratory, MDI Biological Laboratory and MaineHealth. Collins previously highlighted her ability to restore some cuts through her conversations out of public view in an interview with Maine Morning Star this past spring.
However, the overall structure of how NIH grants will be awarded going forward, and therefore these organizations’ funding long term, is at risk. 
Upended procedure
The president’s change in tone on Collins comes as Congress approaches the deadline to pass spending bills for the next fiscal year. The early version of the the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education appropriations bill and others, which Collins had a hand in crafting, signal lawmakers may not give the president as large of cuts as he wants.
Susan Collins has reached a pinnacle of authority. How will she use it?

In the marked up version of the labor, health and education bill, which will advance to the full Senate after lawmakers return from August recess, the committee largely rejected the Trump administration’s proposals to slash funding for medical research grants and other programs. 
Included is a $150 million increase for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer’s disease research, as well as a ban on an administration cap on indirect costs at the NIH, according to a summary from Democrats. 
Collins questioned NIH Director Jayanta Bhattacharya in February on the proposed cap on how much NIH pays research universities and medical schools for indirect costs. She’s also said it’s against federal law. The cap is currently the subject of a permanent injunction in an ongoing lawsuit. 
Brewer said, in some ways, the current appropriations cycle appears to be returning to its typical procedures.
“They’ve put some money back in from some things that Trump wanted to take out,” Brewer said. “As long as we stay on that, quote unquote, more normal process, then I think [Collins’] role as chair of appropriations once again becomes very important.”
However, Brewer is hesitant that that will be the case. 
“Democrats are saying, ‘Well, look, we’re not going to negotiate spending packages when you’re out there ripping money back after we’ve already approved it,’” Brewer said. 
When it comes to NIH research, even if Collins and other members of Congress can secure increased funding for the agency, the Trump administration’s budget maneuvers have set up the NIH to be able to receive fewer grants. 
The NIH started changing the way it funds grants earlier this year, front-loading funds so researchers receive all money on day one rather than the NIH having to build years-long research grants in its budget. 
The shift is already lowering the chances that a scientist’s proposal will receive funding and many, including Collins, have raised concern that this method could result in future reductions.
Congress cannot stop the administration from forward-funding grants, Collins told Roll Call.

Ohio’s minimum wage is $10.70 per hour for non-tipped employees and $5.35 per hour for tipped employees. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. 
“We’ve got a crisis of affordability right now,” Smith said. “And some of how you fix the crisis of affordability is you make sure people have more money in their pockets from the jobs they work.” 
The bill would raise the state’s minimum wage to $12 per hour starting Jan. 1, 2026; $13 per hour in 2027; $14 per hour in 2028; and $15 per hour in 2029. 
The state’s commerce director would then adjust the minimum wage every year on Sept. 30, starting with 2029. The new minimum wage would still take effect on Jan. 1 every year. 
“We believe that it increases the purchasing and saving power of working Ohioans,” Craig said. “… We want families, no matter where you are, to have a livable wage.” 
The bill would also eliminate the tipped employee minimum wage and require all employees to be paid the state’s minimum wage. 
“I think it’s important to also raise the tip worker minimum wage, which is one of the main focuses of the bill because those folks seem to be stuck in poverty if they’ve got a tipped wage occupation,” Smith said. 
This is not the first time Smith and Craig have introduced a bill that would increase the minimum wage. 
The duo introduced a bill during the last General Assembly that would have raised the minimum wage until it was up to $15 an hour in 2027, but it only was given time for sponsor testimony.  
Ohioans passed a constitutional amendment in 2006 that increases the state minimum wage every year based on the consumer price index. 
Ohio House Democrats have also introduced a bill that would raise the state’s minimum wage. 
State Reps. Dontavius Jarrells, D-Columbus, and Ismail Mohamed, D-Columbus, introduced Ohio House Bill 34, which would also increase the state’s minimum wage gradually per year, but S.B. 234 would get to $15 per hour faster. 
Under H.B. 34, the state’s minimum wage would increase to $11 per hour on Jan. 1, 2026, $12 per hour in 2027, $13 per hour in 2028, $14 per hour in 2029 and $15 per hour in 2030. 
Eleven states and Washington, D.C. have minimum wages of $15 or more, according to Paycom.

Ohioans need to be making at least $22.51 an hour working a full-time job to be able to afford a “modest” two-bedroom apartment, according to a recent report by Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio and the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 
“People are getting squeezed … between rents, health insurance and public utility costs, all of those are going up substantially,” Smith said. “… We need to make those arguments and lay them at the feet of the (Republican) majority and be like ‘You’re running this government. What are you going to do about it?’ Here’s one of the things you can do.”

Conservative judges might allow lawmakers to reinstate the practice of conversion therapy, which aims to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Week after week, a teenage Brandon Long sat through counseling sessions that he said framed his identity as a failure.
Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.
Many medical treatments could be affected by Supreme Court transgender ruling

In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
‘The world has changed’
While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
More states pass laws restricting transgender people’s bathroom use

State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.










Everybody understands what’s at stake now.


– Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in New York City whose research focuses on gender and sexuality


Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
Free speech argument
Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
Here’s how state lawmakers are taking aim at transgender adults’ health care

A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
A Republican loss
In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

Gerrymandering. Most Americans are familiar with this phenomenon in which politicians rig electoral maps and elections for partisan purposes. But unless you’re a serious political observer, you may not be up to speed on just how far out of control this practice has gotten of late or, indeed, how unless something is done soon, it could spiral out of control.
And make no mistake: the threat is real. Right now, in Texas, Republican legislators are, at the urging of President Trump, attempting to make a mockery of the 2026 midterm elections by rigging congressional maps in unprecedented ways. And this situation is only fueling efforts in other states – by Republicans and Democrats – to follow suit. It’s a frightening situation that, as we’ve seen repeatedly in North Carolina, makes general elections uncompetitive and gives candidates from the middle no chance of winning.
The bottom line: Gerrymandering has come to be one of the greatest threats to American democracy and it’s essential that congressional leaders at some point soon muster the courage to end it.

(Photo by Avelino Gomez G via iStock/Getty Images Plus)Starting Jan. 1, New Hampshire will place a $3.50 per ton surcharge on all solid waste taken at any of the state’s six active landfills or its waste-to-energy facility.
The surcharge was included in the state budget signed into law in June. The state plans to use the revenue to fund salaries for waste management officials at the Department of Environmental Services and to support grant projects focused on improving waste disposal infrastructure across the state. This type of surcharge is common in other states, including neighboring Vermont and Massachusetts.
The fee will be paid by municipalities, businesses, and other institutions, but New Hampshire towns and cities will receive a 100% quarterly rebate.
Roughly 1.9 million tons of trash were disposed of in New Hampshire in 2022, according to the most recent data available from the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. At $3.50 per ton, 1.9 million tons would’ve generated roughly $6.7 million had the surcharge been in effect at the time, though some of that would’ve been rebated to towns and cities.
Of the 1.9 million tons in 2022, roughly 1.1 million tons — about 58% — came from municipalities, though it’s unclear from the data how many of those municipalities were in New Hampshire and how many were out-of-state. But almost half of the total (both municipal and non-municipal) — or roughly 820,000 tons — came from out-of-state sources, mostly nearby states with more restrictive waste regulations. The large amount of out-of-state trash being dumped in New Hampshire has been a focus of those advocating for changes in the state’s landfill system.
Reagan Bissonnette, an expert on solid waste issues, said that’s why the rebate applies only to in-state municipalities.
“If the state simply wanted to stop waste from coming into the state from out of state, they wouldn’t be able to simply say ‘no trash can come here from Vermont or Maine or Massachusetts,’” she said. “That would actually violate the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. So this disposal fee is designed in such a way that the burden will primarily be on anyone from out of state who’s disposing waste in New Hampshire, and any business sources or institutions that are disposing of waste in New Hampshire. So municipalities are really the ones most benefiting here.”
Bissonnette is a member of the state’s Solid Waste Working Group, which was created by the state Legislature to advise DES, and is the executive director of NH Recycles, a nonprofit created by New Hampshire municipalities that helps communities develop and improve recycling systems. She sees the fee as a positive.
“Certainly the cost of disposal will go up for businesses and out-of-state entities,” she said. “But for New Hampshire municipalities, I do see this as a real positive, because my expectation is that New Hampshire municipalities will be able to readily apply for grants in the future to help them maybe purchase a baler to compact their recycling, or to pay for new equipment at their facility that’s going to help them recycle better. Also, the grants will be available for small businesses that may be looking to get into composting food waste in the state.”
Bissonnette, a strong proponent of recycling and someone who works in the field, is also happy this will create an added incentive for businesses and institutions facing the fee to grow their recycling program.
Bissonnette said rates to dispose of waste at a landfill or waste-to-energy facility are currently anywhere from $60 to $90 a ton, “so in the big scheme of things, $3.50 is not a huge number, but certainly when you aggregate it across all of the waste disposed of New Hampshire, it’s going to raise a meaningful amount of money.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/trashblock-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-13 05:57:42.922056

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/13/ct-sales-tax-holidays/,"CT's sales tax holiday, from Sunday through Aug. 23, exempts clothing under $100 from the 6.35% sales tax. Some say it doesn't do much good.","For decades, Connecticut officials have been trumpeting the annual sales-tax-free week, including this year’s promotion, which begins Sunday and runs through Aug. 23.
But such sales tax holidays increasingly are coming under fire from policy groups.
Progressive organizations note that relatively brief exemption periods, usually limited to a week or even just a weekend, deliver extremely modest relief to consumers, often helping poor households the least.
And other groups argue these promotions are equally ineffective at boosting the economy, adding that the hype from politicians far exceeds the impact.
“Since sales tax holidays shift the timing of demand but do little to increase its magnitude, sales tax holidays reduce state and local tax collections for little or no economic benefit,” analysts Katherine Loughead and Brayden Myers wrote for in a recent brief for the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan, Washington-based policy group.
Consumers generally don’t make enough “impulse” purchases — extra buys they wouldn’t have made — were it not for the holiday, the analysts wrote. Instead, they simply defer purchases that normally would have been made earlier in the year to take advantage of the sales tax promotion.
In Connecticut, that promotion involves waiving the 6.35% sales tax levy on clothing and footwear items that cost less than $100, whether purchased in-store or online, according to the state Department of Revenue Services.
Nineteen states either have held or are scheduled to hold such promotions in 2025, along with one municipality in Alaska, according to the Tax Foundation.
Besides clothing, other items commonly featured in sales tax holidays in other states include computers, energy efficiency equipment, books and other school supplies. 
And while proponents argue these promotions draw out-of-state consumers into the local economy, Loughead and Myers counter that “since so many states now have tax holidays, and because the holidays often apply to lower-cost items that wouldn’t justify a large detour, their effect in attracting out-of-state purchasers is doubtful.”
Critics say states would better serve their economies by focusing resources on reducing everyday tax rates.
And they aren’t the only ones.
The Connecticut Retail Merchants Association has said some Connecticut businesses count on this annual mid-August promotion to secure a huge chunk of their annual profits.
The National Federation of Independent Businesses has long endorsed such sales tax promotions. NFIB Connecticut State Director Andrew Markowski said, “We think it’s a good economic driver and it helps get feet in the doors.”
But Markowski also said Connecticut officials should focus “getting on a more even playing field” with neighboring states when it comes to the sales tax. Massachusetts has a 6.25% sales tax rate and exempts clothing items costing less than $175 from its sales tax year-round. New York has a 4% sales tax rate — which climbs to 8.8% in New York City — but also exempts clothing costing less than $110.
ITEP: Sales tax holidays do little for consumers
Sales tax holidays also are increasingly facing scrutiny for delivering minimal relief.
A family that spends $500 on back-to-school clothes for its children during Connecticut’s promotion would save $31.75.
The Department of Revenue Services estimates the tax holiday will cost the state between $2 million and $3 million.
A $2 million cost represents 1/120th of 1% of the state budget’s General Fund. By comparison, Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration estimates Connecticut closed the last fiscal year on June 30 with almost $2.5 billion unspent, which represented almost 11% of the General Fund.
Lamont and the General Assembly in 2023 ordered the first state income tax rate reduction since the mid-1990s, boosted a tax credit for the working poor and expanded exemptions for pension and annuity earnings. These changes cost the state close to $500 million annually, but low- and middle-income households benefit between $200 and $400 per year.
“A two- to three-day sales-tax-free shopping spree for selected items does nothing to reduce taxes for low- and moderate-income taxpayers during the other 362 days of the year,” Miles Trinidad, an analyst for the Washington-based Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, wrote in a brief last month.
Most states’ sales tax systems, including Connecticut’s, already are largely regressive, meaning consumers pay the same rate regardless of their income or wealth. And these holidays are too brief to effectively reform this unfair system, Trinidad wrote.
A 2010 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago found that households making less than $30,000 annually generally couldn’t even afford to time their purchases to take advantage of these sales tax promotions. Instead, they had to buy clothes or other basic items only when their resources allowed it.
Some retailers also increase prices to take advantage of the increased customer traffic during a sales tax holiday. A 2003 study of Florida retailers found that up to 20% of the price cuts that consumers thought they were receiving from the tax holiday effectively had been reclaimed by last-minute price hikes.
Fazio: ‘A nice PR stunt’
So why are nearly four out of every 10 states offering sales tax holidays this year?
“Sales tax holidays are politically popular with elected officials because they offer direct discounts, whether real or perceived, to consumers in a highly visible way,” Loughead and Myers wrote.
“Permanent solutions tend to be deprioritized when politically easier, temporary gimmicks like sales tax holidays persist,” wrote researchers for the Tax Foundation. Another Tax Foundation official once told the New York Times these holidays are “political catnip.”
Connecticut’s promotions have long been lauded by politicians here.
“Our annual sales tax holiday gives Connecticut consumers some extra savings during the busy back-to-school retail season,” Lamont said Monday. “I encourage everyone to take advantage of these savings and, as always, support our many locally owned small businesses.”
Promoting the event last year in West Hartford, Lamont said, “This is Christmas in August.”
Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich, who is exploring a bid for governor and currently is a ranking Republican on the legislature’s Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, also backs the sales-tax-free week — but says state officials real focus must be on further, ongoing income tax rate cuts. 
Sales tax holidays are “a nice PR stunt for leadership in state government with the third-highest taxes in the country who have refused to deliver real long term tax relief,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sales-tax-art.jpg,,,2025-08-13 05:57:42.922056

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Like people, rivers suffer from lack of care and concern. The 117 miles of the Merrimack River, known colloquially as the “Mighty Merrimack,” generously supply drinking water to over 600,000 residents in Concord, Nashua, Manchester, and Haverhill, Lowell, and Lawrence, Massachusetts. The river rises at the confluence of the Pemigewasset and Winnipesaukee rivers in Franklin and empties into the Atlantic in Newburyport, Massachusetts. 
But it has suffered for centuries.
Prior to European settlement, Native peoples inhabited its shores — the Agawam and Naumkeag (Nashua), Souhegan and Namoskeag (Manchester), Pennacook (north of Bow), and the Winnepisseogee (Lakes Region) — and named the river Merrimack, meaning dark and deep.
Since last century’s industrial boom, their ancestral waters have been dammed and canalled, resulting in severe degradation. Manchester residents remember as children swimming in water of unusual colors, odors, and vegetation. In the 1960s, the Merrimack was considered one of the 10 most polluted U.S. rivers due to years of unmediated dumping of raw sewage, paper and textile mill discharge, and tannery sludge. 
Environmentalist Donald Eaton Carr described it as “haunted with the oldest and most hopeless pollution of any in the country.”
In 1973, phthalates, a group of chemicals used to manufacture plastics, were identified in high concentrations. In 1976 a study found road salt to be the major polluter. A 1997 study found elevated bacteria counts, low dissolved oxygen, and high nutrient levels. A 2002 water assessment detected elevated E. coli and coliform counts. By the 2020s the biggest concern was pollution from combined sewage overflow.
Wildlife has suffered from the contamination of shellfishing beds and aquatic life from contaminated habitats resulting from excess lead, zinc, and heavy metals, such as mercury, which poses a significant threat to fish. Though the Clean Water Act of 1972 improved the river’s infrastructure with funding for a wastewater treatment plant in Manchester, the Merrimack remains one of the most endangered rivers (named by American Rivers, 2016). 
Current concerns include stormwater runoff, high levels of bacteria, phosphorus creating harmful algal blooms, reduced oxygen levels, illicit sewage, and litter. Due to infrastructure issues in the sewage system, untreated sewage flows directly into the Merrimack during combined sewage overflows.
What a toxic and tragic evaluation for a river honorably named by Chandler Eastman Potter as “the place of strong current” (“merruh” meaning strong and “auke” meaning place) and by Henry David Thoreau as the “Sturgeon River.” 
Fortunately, conservationists are deeply committed to its restoration. 

To protect New Hampshire waterways, the NH Network Plastics Working Group is advocating for a statewide plastic bag ban. 
Neighbors near the treatment plant, with support from the Conservation Law Foundation, are petitioning to reduce and/or eliminate PFAS and other “forever chemicals” contained in the sewage sludge from upstream industries from being burned at high temperatures, contaminating the air, and leaching into groundwater and the river itself. 
The Merrimack Conservation Partnership, a consortium of 30 environmental organizations, is dedicated to protecting the watershed by promoting “advocacy, restoration, outreach, and education.”

The Merrimack’s water has been thoroughly tested and analyzed, but only Rocky Morrison of the Clean River Project has committed to its cleanup. 
Raised on the river, Morrison would fish and canoe often, steering his boat clear of the trash build-up along the sandbars. He was “disgusted,” he said, by the trash along the shoreline, and launched the first Merrimack River Scavenger Hunt with the goal of retrieving as much debris as possible. In 2007, he organized a tire pull-out day, which collected 584 tires and 23 cars. 
Years later there’s not much Rocky hasn’t seen or pulled out: 86 cars, thousands of tires, televisions, household appliances, furniture, bikes, trash, barrels, car parts, hypodermic needles, and tons of plastic bags. With seven boats, one equipped with a hydraulic arm, and booms along the shoreline, he collects 30-yard dumpster loads of accumulated refuse that gets recycled with the help of students from area high schools, community volunteers, and local business partners. 
His mission is, simply stated, “to clean, protect and provide a safer water supply to the people and wildlife in the many cities and towns who rely heavily on a treasured natural resource for drinking and pleasure.”
Morrison views the river as a public good, fostering community. For over two decades he has formed a lasting friendship with the Merrimack and its concerned allies. 
His story is one of a boy who loved a river — and an enduring desire to keep it clean and healthy.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/merrimackriver-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-13 04:57:02.994532

(Photo by Matt Vasilogambros/Stateline.)A pair of Democratic Ohio state lawmakers want to give voters the chance to sign up for absentee ballots permanently. Eight states allow all their citizens to opt in to regular absentee voting, and another 11 allow specific populations like people with disabilities to do so, too.
But under current law in Ohio, voters must file a new absentee ballot request with every single election. And the procedure isn’t all that simple.
Ohioans can register to vote online, but they can’t request an absentee ballot while they’re there. Instead, voters have to print and fill out a request form and then mail it in to their county board.
Ohio state Reps. Michele Grim, D-Toledo, and Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood, argue that’s more cumbersome than it needs to be.

How the bill works
Ohio House Bill 400 would create several avenues for voters to sign up for the permanent absentee ballot list.
“Folks who regularly vote by mail can voluntarily opt into being part of a system where they’re always going to get an application to vote by mail,” Rader explained. “So they don’t have to go seek that out every election. They don’t have to go find a form, or go online and request a form and remember to do that, put it on their calendar.”
“So, it just kind of removes a step,” he added, “makes it a little bit easier for folks that prefer to vote by mail.”
The measure directs the Ohio Secretary of State to develop a new form for voters to add their name; voter registration, change of address and change of name forms would all get a new box allowing voter to opt in as well.
Ditto the online voter registration portal. Finally, anytime a voter requests an absentee ballot for an individual election, they could also sign up for absentee ballots going forward.
Rader stressed the program is voluntary. Voters can sign up and back out at will.
Rep. Grim said she regularly hears from voters who don’t realize they have to request an absentee ballot every single time. Primary, special, general — each one requires its own request.
“A lot of a lot of people don’t know that, or they forget sometimes,” Grim said. “So this would make it a lot easier, especially for older folks or people with disabilities, but also, you know, folks that maybe don’t work traditional jobs and have a hard time voting.”
“I actually did it in California, when I lived in California,” she added. “My ballot came every time, and I was able to vote and mail it back. It was very simple, and I think it just helps a lot of people.”
This is not the first time Democrats have proposed a permanent absentee voter list. Former state Rep. Michael Skindell, D-Lakewood, made the most recent attempt in 2022, but that proposal went nowhere.
A likely complaint is what happens when a voter moves or dies? Does the new resident just luck into an extra ballot? The short answer is no.
“That is against the law, so they can’t do that,” Grim said. “If they vote with someone’s ballot, that’s not their name, you know, that is a state and federal offense.”
What’s more, the proposal doesn’t direct county boards to send the actual ballot. Instead, voters would get the ballot request form.
To get an actual ballot the voter has to return that form with identifying information including date of birth, social security number or driver’s license and their signature.
Election officials verify that information on the application form and again when the voter sends in their ballot.
Grim notes it’s not as straightforward as it could be, but it’s an improvement on a system requiring the voter to initiate each absentee ballot request.
Rader also said it would be nice if voters could just sign up to receive a ballot rather than a request form.
“I would love to move to the next step, but I think we have to take this in incremental steps,” he said. “I think our goal here is to get people warmed up to this idea and see if we can’t get bipartisan support.”
Ultimately, Rader said, it would be great if Ohio joined the eight states and Washington, D.C. that proactively mail ballots to every registered voter for every election.
“If we can get more buy in for universal vote by mail would be fantastic,” he said, “but I don’t know if that’s like where our state is right now.”

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)Ohio LGBTQ+ advocates will soon start collecting signatures for their equal rights proposals as the U.S. Supreme Court has been asked to review its 2015 same-sex marriage decision.
It’s been 10 years since SCOTUS decided in Obergefell v. Hodges, a case originating out of Ohio where justices determined that same-sex couples have the fundamental right to marry. The ruling legalized same-sex marriage across the country.
But the Ohio Constitution still states, “Only a union between one man and one woman may be a marriage valid in or recognized.”
Ohio amendments for marriage equality and equal rights both cleared for signature collection

This means that if the justices overturn Obergefell, same-sex marriage would be illegal in Ohio once again.

“Some people hear equal rights and think, ‘Well, I already have all my rights. I have what I need,'” Lis Regula with Ohio Equal Rights said. “That’s not necessarily the case for everybody.”

Kim Davis, a former clerk in Kentucky who was jailed for several days in 2015 after denying a same-sex couple their marriage license, asked the high court Monday to take up a case that would overturn that decision.
In 2022, Justice Clarence Thomas said that the Supreme Court of the United States should reconsider landmark cases such as Obergefell.
Regula knows he can’t change what the court will do, he said, but there are other options.
“What Ohioans do have control over is being able to put forward ballot initiatives that help to protect our state, help to protect our community,” he said.
Ohio Equal Rights just got one step closer to enshrining marriage equality into the state constitution.
On Friday, Attorney General Dave Yost certified two separate constitutional amendment proposals: one would remove a provision from the state Constitution that prohibits same-sex marriage, and the other would prohibit discrimination by state and local governments because of “race, color, creed or religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression regardless of sex assigned at birth, pregnancy status, genetic information, disease status, age, disability, recovery status, familial status, ancestry, national origin, or military and veteran status.”
Ohio Equal Rights has been approved to start collecting signatures for the Ohio Right to Marry Amendment, which would remove the provision that bans same-sex marriage, something that Christian conservative activist Lizzie Marbach is prepared to fight.
“It directly goes against our First Amendment right to practice our religion, but also it is spitting in the face of God because not only does he define what marriage is, but he’s who created the sexes,” Marbach said.
Just because someone has an interpretation of the Bible doesn’t mean it applies to everyone, Regula said.
“That’s perfectly fine for her to believe,” Regula said. “But we are not a Christian nation.”
There is a specific carveout for religious organizations and members of clergy who will be able to deny marriage requests, which Marbach appreciated but said wasn’t enough.
She said her faith is why she is also against Ohio Equal Rights’ other ballot proposal, the Ohio Equal Rights Amendment, which would prohibit government discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
10 years after winning marriage equality, Jim Obergefell wants to aim higher

This is just meant to fight against the legislation lawmakers passed last year, she said.
“It’s important not to allow men into women’s bathrooms and boys into young girls’ sports and all of those things,” she said.
Ohio Equal Rights was required to put forward two proposals instead of one that focused on all LGBTQ+ rights. Republicans on the Ohio Ballot Board said that same-sex marriage was fundamentally different than anti-discrimination protections.
This means that instead of only needing to collect about 415,000 signatures for one constitutional amendment, supporters would need to get that amount for each of the two amendments — 830,000 valid signatures. For all ballot proposals, campaigns need valid signatures from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties.
Regula wants to get this on the November 2026 ballot.
“I think being able to pass this would be a huge bright spot,” he said.
Already, GOP politicians, like Sec. of State Frank LaRose, have begun fundraising off of the amendments.
However, LaRose — and each other politician we have seen — have only mentioned the Equal Rights Amendment, not marriage equality.
In a fundraising email, the secretary asked for help to fight the Democrats who are trying to “Enshrine special protections for extreme transgender policies in schools, businesses and even churches.”

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)Kansans can congratulate themselves. A vacancy on the state Supreme Court has once again been smoothly filled through an orderly process Kansans voted to put into our state constitution in 1958. At its heart, the process requires selection of the court’s justices based on their merit, not politics. As the final step in that process, last week Gov. Laura Kelly appointed attorney Larkin Walsh. She became the 29th justice appointed on merit since Kansans chose it 67 years ago.
I have known Walsh for 15 years. She is an outstanding choice, blessed with experience ranging from working as a research attorney for both the federal court and the Kansas Supreme Court (where I worked with her) to representing clients in complex court cases. She brings with her a strong work ethic and absolute commitment to the rule of law.
It is important to remember how Walsh got here. Along with thousands of other Kansas lawyers and judges, she received notice of a Supreme Court vacancy. In response to this opportunity offered equally to so many, Walsh applied to be a justice — as did 14 others.
The next steps in the selection process were created by the voter-approved constitutional amendments and involve the Supreme Court Nominating Commission. Because an applicant’s merit-based selection as a justice essentially means competition with the other applicants, the commission must thoroughly vet them all.
That commission of nine members from across the state reviewed the applications of Walsh and her 14 competitors, investigated them and interviewed them in full public view. At the end of this step in the selection process, the commission members elected Walsh and two other applicants — both judges — as their nominees. The commission then forwarded these three names to Kelly for making her appointment as the last step of the competitive, merit-based selection process.
After even more vetting and personally interviewing each of the three nominees separately, Kelly eventually selected Walsh as a justice. On merit, not ideology.
I speak from experience. In 2002, I underwent this same process with 17 other applicants. The nominating commission’s work was extensive, even seeking input from people I had not listed on my application.
After my interview with Gov. Bill Graves, I was appointed and served for 17 years on the Supreme Court, including the last 10 as chief justice. Unlike in some other states, I never had to make political speeches, raise any campaign money, or tell anyone (such as voters or potential donors), how I would vote on certain issues as a justice. I certainly was not asked such questions by the nominating commission or Graves.
The ultimate stage in the merit-based selection process is a democratic one — which requires the people of Kansas to have the final word. Starting with the first statewide election after Walsh has served 12 months, Kansas voters will decide whether to retain her to start a six-year term. If she is retained, voters will have the same opportunity every six years after that, much like I faced retention votes in 2004, in 2010 and in 2016. I don’t know how much more democratic you can get.
In the Kansas constitution, the people created a system that has worked well for 67 years to select justices based on their merit. These justices do not serve one party or ideology. Instead, they serve the people of Kansas and the rule of law. Like Larkin Walsh will.
Lawton Nuss served more than 17 years as a justice on the Kansas Supreme Court, including nearly a decade as chief justice.

Unfortunately, inaction by both state and federal lawmakers could quickly make things worse.
In June, the national 2025 KIDS COUNT Data Book, a 50-state report of data developed by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, ranked Ohio 31st in America for child well-being. The reasons why weren’t surprising.
The research showed almost one in five Ohio children, about 470,000, live in poverty. That is more people than the populations of either Cincinnati or Cleveland respectively. Almost 70 percent of Ohio eighth graders aren’t proficient in math, while a similar share of fourth graders struggle with reading. Meanwhile, nearly 9 percent of Ohio newborns have a low birthweight, slightly above the national average.
These are just the latest figures in a long downward trend for our state. In 2015, KIDS COUNT ranked Ohio 23rd for child well-being.
So, how could things get worse?
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Well, many more Ohio children now risk losing both health care and access to food after Congress passed the “Big Beautiful Bill.” More than half of Ohio children are enrolled in Medicaid. Some of our state’s own representatives in Washington recently voted to cut that vital program by roughly $1 trillion over the next decade. They also defunded the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by $186 billion during that same period. The Urban Institute predicts more than 108,000 Ohio families with children could now lose some or all of their SNAP benefits.
In our 2023 Ohio school meals report, we emphasized well-nourished children are healthier and learn better. If we take away meals and health care, we’re not just cutting programs — we’re setting children back.
And yet, when our state’s lawmakers knew these changes were coming from Washington, they made a choice to pass a state budget that included a $1 billion tax cut for the wealthy and money for Cleveland Browns’ ownership. The General Assembly made these choices at the same time it rejected Governor Mike DeWine’s proposal to support Ohio families by creating a child tax credit.
We’re not surprised by the final decisions made by our lawmakers in Columbus. After all, they had been telegraphing their priorities for several months. Still, they had the opportunity to make choices that would benefit children — and they chose not to.
In response, we need to go back to square one. If we want real progress for families then we must secure a vision for Ohio that doesn’t rely on gutting essential services or handing corporations blank checks. That means building grassroots power strong enough to make legislators think first about their constituents, not their campaign donors. When everyday people are organized and unified, they can hold elected officials accountable and create the change families need and deserve.
Whether you live off Lake Erie, Columbus or in rural Southeast Ohio, the challenges facing our children, like poverty and a lack of health care, are shared community issues regardless of political affiliation. It’s important for people from different parts of Ohio with common concerns to come together and show that we all want the best for our children. Building broad-based support for improving the well-being of ALL children is the work that must happen now.
Despite setbacks, we know things can swing in the favor of Ohio’s children when there’s genuine commitment. Ohio’s lawmakers must act now before more children suffer the consequences of continued neglect.

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
More than 3 million people would lose SNAP benefits under GOP bill, nonpartisan report says

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
 A greater burden on states

In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/ Stateline)At least 12 states have received federal approval to restrict recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from using their benefits to purchase certain foods such as soda and candy.
The states receiving waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are overwhelmingly Republican. Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia received approval last week. The feds granted waivers to Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and Utah earlier this year.
SNAP served on average nearly 42 million people a month in fiscal 2024, with about 12% of the U.S. population receiving benefits.
GOP cuts to food assistance would hit rural America especially hard

The trend is part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s agenda to “make America healthy again” by inviting states to apply for waivers to change SNAP rules to limit what types of food recipients can buy.
Kennedy said in a statement that SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to “fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics.”
“These waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health,” the statement said.
Critics of these waivers say the policy could harm people in places such as food deserts, where healthy options are limited, and take away recipients’ power to make their own food choices.
Craig Gundersen, a professor in the Department of Economics at Baylor University, told Stateline that these changes could harm the integrity of the program.
“One of the main reasons why SNAP is such a successful program is because it gives dignity and autonomy to recipients. It gives dignity to recipients by allowing them to shop in the same manner as their neighbors, friends and family, and it gives autonomy to recipients by saying to families: You are the best ones to make decisions for your families about what to purchase,” Gundersen said.
Gundersen said he worries the restrictions could stigmatize SNAP, which he called one of the best programs for fighting food insecurity.

(Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)After a flurry of activity at the state Capitol Tuesday, it’s unclear if lawmakers are any closer to ending the budget impasse that has lasted more than six weeks past the constitutionally mandated June 30 deadline.
With both the Democratic-controlled House and GOP-led Senate holding floor sessions that stretched into the evening, disagreements that had largely been conducted behind closed doors have been dragged into the open. 
On Tuesday, the Senate passed a budget bill that would see the commonwealth spend $47.6 billion in the next year, roughly $3 billion less than a proposal passed in the House last month.
The Senate also passed a Republican-backed plan to fund the state’s mass transit agencies for the next two years, providing about $300 million. The bill would also take money from a fund for public transit to spend on roads and bridges.
Both votes fell on party lines.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I ask my colleagues today, to stand with the taxpayers of this commonwealth, to stand with those that are service providers or educating our children right now who need the money to start flowing, to decide on this side of fiscal stability and not trying to greatly outspend what we’re taking in,” said Senate Appropriations Chair Scott Martin (R-Lancaster)
The move comes only two days before the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA)’s stated deadline to receive new funds from the state, or cut services by 20% later this month.
It’s also a response to a proposal that passed the House on Monday that would give transit agencies an additional 1.75% of the state’s total sales tax collected, which Republicans have called irresponsible.
But despite both chambers in the Capitol individually making progress, leaders in the House and Senate seem as divided as ever.
A  joint statement provided by House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia), House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) and House Appropriations Chair Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia), said the Republicans “failed to do their job.” 
“This budget does not fulfill our constitutional obligation to adequately and equitably fund our public schools and it fails to support critical programs and services such as mass transit,” they added.
Manuel Bonder, a spokesperson for Shapiro, said, “ this is clearly not a serious, long-term proposal that can pass both chambers. It’s time to get back to the table and keep working at it.”
And following passage of the Senate measure, President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) wrote in a post on the social media platform X, “If Gov. Shapiro and House Democrats reject this proposal, holding up funding is on the governor and the House Democrats and they will have to answer to their constituents.”

No free rides
House Bill 257 would transfer $87.5 million in state gaming revenue to both public transportation and highway funding next year and $43 million annually thereafter. That money could come from skill games – a target for regulation by both Democrats and Republicans. 
Right now, SEPTA and other transit agencies in rural, suburban and urban areas get money from the Public Transportation Trust Fund earmarked separately for operations (referred to as 1513 funds in the measure) and capital (referred to as 1514 funds) expenses.
The bill would allow transportation entities to transfer a limited amount of those capital funds to operations. And it would require fare increases indexed to inflation in 2026, 2027 and then every other year thereafter (leaving open the possibility to seek a waiver).
But Republicans and Democrats disagree over whether that would mean pulling money from improvement and construction projects. While Democrats said that the trust fund money was earmarked, Republicans said they were never offered proof of more than $1 billion or so being dedicated to projects.
The confusion seems to extend to SEPTA’s leadership.

“It’s a solution that essentially tells SEPTA and other transit agencies to raid from our capital dollars to put them into our operating budgets,” Scott Sauer, SEPTA’s general manager, told reporters. “That creates a whole slew of problems for us.”
Later in the evening, Sauer said in a statement sent to the Capital-Star, “In subsequent discussions with Senate Republican staff this evening, there may be confusion about the proposed sources of funding to address the crisis we are facing. As a result, we expect to remain in close contact with all parties in this negotiation as we continue to await a solution that will provide adequate, sustainable funding for SEPTA’s future.”
It’s unclear whether SEPTA would proceed with planned service cuts if this proposal should pass the House before the oft-repeated deadline of Thursday, Aug. 14. The board isn’t scheduled to meet until Aug. 28. 
It also calls for sentencing enhancements for dealing drugs on or near public property related to transportation and making it a felony to interfere with public transit vehicle operators.
And it would make the role of SEPTA special prosecutor with jurisdiction over crimes committed “within” the transit system  – on track to expire in 2026 – more permanent with four-year terms. 
Transit systems serving at least 600,000 people also would have new performance criteria. The only two that meet that requirement are SEPTA and Pittsburgh Regional Transit. 
For highways, funding would be allocated to counties based on eligible mileage and road conditions – and require the work to be completed within five years.

The 37-page transportation funding bill passed Tuesday night started out as a two-page piece of legislation that would ensure the state driver’s license test and education materials cover driving safely in work zones. Those components remain in the legislation.
The bill also takes money from the Public Transportation Trust Fund for road and bridge repair.
“It sounds like it’s a pretty good day for rural Pennsylvania,” Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) said. 
Pittman and other Republicans on multiple occasions referenced Gov. Josh Shapiro’s decision to flex $153 million of federal highway funds in November to SEPTA to avoid immediate service cuts and fare increases. 
“Now you know how we felt back in November when the governor absconded $153 million from road projects and put it into transit,” Pittman said. “Now you know how we felt 15 years ago when Governor Rendell took road money and put it in the transit.”
“Doesn’t feel so good, does it?” he added.
A divide over education
Another area where the two proposed budgets diverge is on K-12 education spending.
Last year, both chambers agreed to a new adequacy funding formula, based on factors like poverty in a school district, in response to a 2023 Commonwealth Court ruling that found the state’s public school funding was unconstitutionally inequitable. The result was more than $500 million distributed through the formula explicitly to benefit underfunded school districts.
This year, both Shapiro and House Democrats proposed increasing the amount of education funding by $526 million. The Senate’s proposed budget would keep education funding at the same rate it was set last year.

Sen. Kristin Phillips-Hill (R-York), called the proposal “a way forward to ensure that our children returning to their classrooms in a few weeks have the resources that they need in their classrooms.”
She added, “Our students, teachers, administrators and nonprofit staff can know that instead of a fictional world that the Governor thinks that we live in where budgets do not need to balance exist,” 
Democrats, however, argued that failing to increase education funding could amount to the state failing to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth Court ruling.
While the ruling called on lawmakers to solve the problem, they pointed to a report from a commission that determined the state would need to spend roughly $5.4 billion to adequately fund all of the state’s schools, and recommended doing so over a seven-year period.
According to Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D-Allegheny), the Republican proposal falls far short, and fails to live up to promises made by lawmakers last year to increase spending to meet that target.
Sen. Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia) also said, “it does not fund our schools, it does not address the increases in education funding that have been mandated by the courts. … It is not a real solution.”
PA Schools Work, a coalition of education-focused nonprofits, including some involved in the lawsuit that led to the Commonwealth Court ruling, opposed the flat funding proposal.
“Senate Republicans’ budget proposal isn’t just inadequate – it amounts to a massive education cut that betrays Pennsylvania students and leaves them holding the bag,” said Dan Urevick-Ackelsberg, Senior Attorney at the Public Interest Law Center, which was a part of the lawsuit, and is a PA Schools Work partner. “Schools can’t meet rising costs with stagnant, unconstitutional funding, and students are entitled to investment, not teacher layoffs. This bill is a gut punch that shortchanges students and abandons lawmakers’ constitutional duty to ensure a thorough and efficient system of public education for all kids in the Commonwealth.”
However, Sen. Scott  Martin, rejected the idea that it was failing to meet requirements, noting with declining public school enrollment, a flat budget would still meet schools’ needs.
“We’re seeing a tremendous decline in our public K-12 enrollment, and part of that’s our demographic decline,” Martin told reporters after the vote. “Where does that balance out? That’s the never-ending tug of war … to me, we need a much fairer system. It’s going to be changing because our demographics change.”
Budget talks have now reached a potential fork in the road. 
Ultimately, the House will either have to agree to what the Senate passed, or the two parties will have to resume negotiations with Shapiro.
“It’s now incumbent upon us to reject what we have in front of us and get back to the table and put together a strong negotiating team that’s going to allow us the opportunity to find that common ground,” said Costa, pushing for a budget that ultimately spends somewhere between what Senate Republicans and House Democrats have proposed.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/state-capitol-2-august-2025-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-13 00:56:36.926049

Kemp and the state’s majority conservative legislature passed a bill that prohibits incarcerated transgender people from receiving access to hormone therapy and other treatments used to address gender dysphoria. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post/Getty Images)This story was originally reported by Candice Norwood of The 19th. Meet Candice and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
A group of incarcerated transgender women and men have sued Georgia corrections officials, challenging a new law that prevents them from receiving gender-affirming medical care.
The lawsuit, filed Friday morning, accuses the state of violating the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.
Five transgender plaintiffs — two men and three women — brought the class action on behalf of nearly 300 other people in Georgia state prisons, who argue that the state’s law will have “catastrophic consequences.” In some cases it is forcing trans people who have already received hormone replacement therapy and other services for years to detransition without their consent.
“We are very much in the thick of seeing policies like this be adopted,” said Chinyere Ezie, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, which brought the lawsuit with co-counsel Bondurant Mixson & Elmore LLP.
“It’s really unfortunate, I think that it has and will cost people’s lives. I think that the plan is to really just eradicate trans people from public life, to really — contrary to medicine — make the treatment of gender dysphoria a culture war, as opposed to a serious medical need that requires treatment.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXIn May, Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed SB 185, a bill passed by the state’s majority conservative legislature that prohibits the use of state funds or resources for surgery, hormone replacement therapy, cosmetic procedures, and other treatments used to address gender dysphoria.
The law states explicitly that incarcerated people may still receive treatments like hormone replacement therapy if they are medically necessary for conditions other than gender dysphoria.
Ezie told The 19th that the bill’s sponsors indicated during hearings that incarcerated trans people would not be allowed to pay for treatment themselves, either. Her team has also heard this from their clients, she said. The 19th reached out to the Georgia Department of Corrections to confirm whether incarcerated trans people can pay for these procedures themselves.
“Senate Bill 185 prohibits the use of state funds or resources for the following treatments for state inmates: A. Sex reassignment surgeries or any other surgical procedures that are performed for the purpose of altering primary or secondary sexual characteristics; B. Hormone replacement therapies; and C. Cosmetic procedures or prosthetics intended to alter the appearance of primary or secondary sexual characteristics,” wrote Joan Heath, the department’s director of communications.
“Thus, the GDC cannot use state resources to transport an offender to be seen by a provider paid for at their own expense, nor allow a provider being paid by an offender to treat such offender at a GDC facility,” she continued.
Consequences
The legal complaint includes details about the plaintiffs, who described the effects of being cut off from their gender-affirming medical care. One trans woman named Fantasia Horton, incarcerated in Phillips State Prison, had been receiving hormone therapy since 2019 but was completely cut off following the law, despite being told that her dosages would gradually decrease before ending, according to the Center.
“Due to Defendants’ policies and actions in terminating her treatment, Ms. Horton is now at grave risk of physical and psychological harm,” the complaint states. “Three years ago, after losing access to hormone therapy for just one week after her prison’s supply of hormone therapy was temporarily depleted, Ms. Horton’s mental health plummeted and her depressive symptoms returned.”
Gender dysphoria is a condition recognized by medical journals and professionals. It is defined as the sense of discomfort or anxiety a person feels when their physical gender feels out of sync with their gender identity. This can lead to long-term mental health effects, including periods of depression and thoughts or acts of self-harm.
Forced detransition due to anti-trans legislation, coupled with the poor conditions and discrimination that incarcerated trans people often experience, can worsen these mental health consequences. From a physical standpoint, doctors recommend that any termination of hormone replacement therapy takes place gradually over three to six months, rather than cold turkey.










Taking away individuals’ access to gender-affirming therapies while in prison constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and increases the likelihood of abuse and detrimental health consequences.


– Jan T. Mooney, psychologist


“Taking away individuals’ access to gender-affirming therapies while in prison constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and increases the likelihood of abuse and detrimental health consequences,” Jan T. Mooney, an Atlanta psychologist, and Mark Spencer, an Atlanta-area internal medicine physician, wrote in an April column about the Georgia bill.
“Abrupt cessation or forced weaning of medically necessary, ongoing treatment is a health risk. Physical effects of hormone withdrawal are accompanied by psychological distress, which may manifest as anxiety, depression, and suicidality,” they continued.
Precedents
The class action comes 10 years after Ezie first sued over another ban on gender-affirming care in Georgia prisons. In that case, Ashley Diamond, a Black transgender woman, sued the Georgia Department of Corrections in 2015 after being held in men’s prisons and denied hormone treatments.
The case drew attention from the U.S. Department of Justice, which said at the time that blanket policies barring hormone therapy violate the Eighth Amendment “because they do not provide for individualized assessment and treatment.”
Diamond won an undisclosed settlement in 2016, and her case prompted policy changes in Georgia meant to facilitate better treatment of incarcerated transgender people. But six years later, Diamond sued again, asserting that the state failed to provide her adequate health care or protect her from sexual assault after a second incarceration. Ultimately, Diamond dropped that lawsuit to protect her mental health, according to her lawyers.
To see the same issues come up again in 2025 feels like being “in a time machine going back in time,” said Ezie, who represented Diamond 10 years ago.
“I think that is a feeling that’s shared by many trans rights activists,” Ezie said. “It feels like, rather than seeing a forward march of progress when it comes to securing basic rights and basic dignity for transgender people, we are now fighting to hold on to very basic legal wins that you know we achieved, at times, decades ago.”
Ezie and the legal team at the Center for Constitutional Rights hope the courts overturn Georgia’s law, as they have in other similar cases. For example, Wisconsin enacted a law in 2005 that barred prison doctors from providing hormone therapy or gender-affirming surgery to incarcerated transgender people in state custody. But a federal court ruled that denying this medical care constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.
Another state-level class action in Colorado resulted in a negotiated settlement agreement between the state and the Department of Corrections requiring an overhaul of how it houses incarcerated transgender women and provides medical care to all trans people behind bars.
If the Center for Constitutional Rights is successful in Georgia, Ezie anticipates that there will still be a long road ahead in the effort to challenge anti-trans legislation and policies.
“We’re going to continue to use the courts, we’re going to continue to organize, we’re going to continue to — as we did prior to the passage of this bill — lobby against bills like this that seek to cause so much preventable harm,” she said. “This is why we fight.”

Powelson,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/13/private-water-a-proven-partner-for-cts-future/,"Claiming that government ownership of a water system inherently delivers transparency, accountability and long-term value is simply not supported by actual evidence.","Conversations about the future of water operations in Connecticut paint an incomplete picture, overlooking the significant advantages and proven track record that regulated, private water companies bring to communities, particularly in Connecticut. 
Claiming that government ownership inherently delivers transparency, accountability and long-term value is simply not supported by actual evidence.
Regulated, private water companies operate under a far more rigorous and transparent regulatory framework compared to government-run systems. Regulated, private water companies are subject to oversight from multiple state and federal agencies. In Connecticut, this includes the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA). This multi-layered scrutiny not only leads to higher rates of compliance, it also results in an increased standard of performance in areas such as cybersecurity, diversity and even rates.
Regulated, private water companies’ rates in Connecticut, far from being arbitrary, are meticulously reviewed and authorized by PURA, ensuring fairness and preventing an undue burden on consumers. This level of independent oversight is often less robust in government-run systems, where decisions can be more susceptible to the whims of political influence rather than purely operational or financial considerations.
The claim that regulated, private companies are solely driven by “shareholder profits” and thus neglect long-term planning or affordability is a grossly inaccurate statement. Regulated, private water companies’ business model is built on long-term investment. Our success is inextricably linked to the health of the communities we serve. This necessitates continuous investment in infrastructure, advanced treatment technologies and skilled personnel to ensure the delivery of safe, reliable and high-quality water for generations.
Regulated, private water companies such as Aquarion and Connecticut Water have a long and distinguished history of serving Connecticut residents, because they consistently invest in safety and reliability by updating the community’s infrastructure and delivering water that meets or exceeds all regulatory standards. This commitment to long-term stewardship is a fundamental principle of responsible private utility management.
Furthermore, the notion that regulated, private systems are inherently less compliant is simply not true. While a recent op-ed cites a single study from Virginia, it’s crucial to consider the broader landscape. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), regulated, private water companies are 24% less likely to violate the Safe Drinking Water Act.  The largest and most comprehensive analysis of water quality data ever conducted found that private ownership of a community water system resulted in higher SDWA compliance rates over a 34-year period.
Using Connecticut’s Regional Water Authority (RWA) as an example, the EPA data shows the government-run system was not in compliance with the lead and copper rule for nearly five months in 2021 due to a monitoring and reporting violation. Furthermore, a Safe Drinking Water Act Sanitary Survey conducted in May 2021 found “significant deficiencies” in the RWA system.  Three years later, a SDWA sanitary survey showed RWA had the same “significant deficiencies,” and the list of “recommendations” expanded to also include “distribution” and “security,” indicating negative progress on key performance metrics.
As of June 2025, the EPA Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) Violations Report shows 59 total violations for RWA dating to 2014. Of these violations, 56 are listed as “major violations.” The vast majority – 55 of the 59 – occurred in 2014-2015 as monitoring and reporting violations relating to a variety of contaminants.
The reality is that regulated, private water companies often have access to greater capital, specialized expertise and economies of scale that enable them to invest in cutting-edge technologies and best practices for water treatment and monitoring. This translates into superior water quality and a proactive approach to regulatory compliance. This is a claim that is supported by study-after-study, not just a cherry-picked one from a single state.
The reputation of regulated, private water companies – and indeed their very existence – depends on delivering safe water, making regulatory adherence a top priority, not an afterthought. Connecticut residents have been well-served by regulated, private water companies and their dedicated professional employees and their established infrastructure for decades.
Ultimately, the debate over government-run versus regulated, private ownership should not be about ideology, but about what truly delivers the best outcomes for communities. Regulated, private water companies offer a compelling value proposition: access to capital for critical infrastructure upgrades, specialized expertise in water management, rigorous independent regulatory oversight and a proven commitment to delivering safer, more reliable and affordable water.
For Connecticut, a new, untested government-run entity carries significant risks, including potential service disruptions, increased costs to customers and a loss of the institutional knowledge and expertise that has been cultivated over a long history.

Kennedy Jr. on the ballot last year, I can attest to the absolute ridiculous rules and regulations in Connecticut to unfairly restrict people from getting on the ballot.
The biggest impediment is cost.  While we in Connecticut had hundreds of volunteers willing to “stand out on the pavement,” the nature of the process requires you to collect around 150% of the required signature count due to expected disqualifications.  Why? “Signer didn’t list their correct address; the state can’t read the signer’s printing (they must print themselves); can’t read their birthdate” (yes that’s required); and it goes on.  So because of the sheer signature numbers required, ultimately, you resort to needing to pay for people to help.  
This is clearly intended to take funds away from educating the voters on policies, qualifications, etc.  So, ultimately, it’s a ploy to undemocratically keep people from running.  And it works.
Here’s more, the State of Connecticut absolutely makes it impossible to actually do this job.  Did you know that the state won’t allow you to  petition outside a Division of Motor Vehicles office?  You also cannot petition outside the Post Office.  You cannot petition outside any privately owned business, like grocery stores. (And while this doesn’t sound like a problem, most private businesses won’t allow it because people don’t like to be asked).  So, the state is requiring it, but doing everything possible to make it impossible to accomplish.
This process of antiquated and onerous and I believe undemocratic.  So, for a state that constantly purports to be the bastion of democracy, this is absolutely the opposite of that.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)The New Mexico board overseeing water regulations quashed robust public opposition Tuesday  seeking to stop a proposal that would allow much wider use of oil and gas wastewater that environmental advocates say could contaminate the state’s limited supply of drinking water.
Dozens of people spoke during a three-hour public comment period that drew over 100 attendees to the Water Quality Control Commission Meeting at the Roundhouse. Most objected to the renewed effort to change rules about disposal of wastewater, a potentially toxic byproduct of oil and gas extraction. State law currently limits disposal to oilfields and recently extended disposal in concrete pits for pilot projects to test treatment technologies.
Opponents included conservation nonprofits such as Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter, Amigos Bravos, Western Environmental Law Center, among others; members from acequias and several health care workers. Sen. Harold Pope presented a letter from 25 Democratic lawmakers, urging the commission to keep the current rule in place.
“Reopening this issue undermines the Democratic process and disrespects the public’s investment of time and trust,” said Pope, a Democrat from Albuquerque. “There has been no new, no new peer-reviewed, published scientific evidence presented.”
Proponents for the changes say allowing the byproduct – also known as produced water – to be used for more industrial, construction and agricultural purposes would mean less tapping into fresh sources used for drinking.
An industry group known as WATR, which stands for Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse (WATR) Alliance, with board members from oil and gas giants Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum and other industry interests, put forward the new proposal in June, just a month after the state water commission adopted rules to allow for pilot projects, but no discharges into surface or groundwater.
WATR’s proposed rule would allow 13 counties to use the treated produced water for uses such as watering livestock, “non-food crops,” construction and release into the environment.

“I think that this commission should hear from the communities where the water’s being produced, from the communities who see the water being transported to Texas every day,” Jennifer Bradfute, an attorney for WATR Alliance told commissioners Tuesday. “They see and witness the missed opportunity for New Mexicans to treat and use that water in their own projects, for their own economic development.”
The 12-member board rejected three motions from environmental groups Tuesday to toss WATR’s proposal altogether or to request additional time to prepare for a future hearing. The board’s vote Tuesday means the proposal to expand use of oil and gas wastewater will be considered at a hearing tentatively scheduled for November.
Attorneys for New Mexico environment and conservation groups called Tuesday’s vote a “travesty” and “disappointment,” saying they’d seek further legal options.
“They completely shut the public out of the process today,” Mariel Nanasi, executive director and attorney at nonprofit New Energy Economy, told Source New Mexico after the hearing.
“As young people, we’re extremely disappointed that the Commission chose to side with polluters,” said Vittoria Judy with Youth United for Climate Crisis Action in a statement after the meeting. “The industry’s toxic waste crisis is not our problem to solve, and if regulators won’t protect us, we’ll keep fighting to defend our water and our future.”
It’s the latest development in a tense policy debate to address New Mexico’s water scarcity driven by climate change, clashing with oil and gas and the industry’s political influence in New Mexico.
The New Mexico oil and gas industry generates billions of gallons of wastewater. The mixture is extremely salty and poses challenges for treatment since it can contain radioactive materials, heavy metals, toxic chemicals and cancer-causing compounds from the oil and gas, such as benzene. Oil and gas companies can use compounds protected as trade secrets in the mixture, which do not have to be disclosed to regulators or the public.
Powerful proponents for treating the water include Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Rep. Nathan Small (D-Las Cruces), chair of the House Appropriations and Finance Committee.
“Setting standards for reusing treated wastewater would create the regulatory pathway to offset industrial demand for freshwater while protecting our families, farmers and communities,” Jodi McGinnis Porter, a spokesperson for the governor, said in a written statement. “The governor supports the Water Quality Control Commission considering the reuse petition and reaching a decision based on thorough review of all scientific data and expert testimony presented by the parties.”

Snow melts, drought builds and NM legislators spike new oil regulations


Water Commissioner Bill Brancard, who said he opposed WATR’s proposal, warned their attorneys to limit the scope of the changes, saying that they’ll be “raked over the coals” in the upcoming public hearing for the broad proposed uses.
“It was never in the intent of the commission when we passed the last set of regulations to go from nothing to 60 in two seconds,” he said during Tuesday’ hearing. “The goal was incremental changes built on what the commission has built. Instead, you’re proposing to completely repeal the entire effort of the commission and do something that nobody considered from the beginning.”

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderPublic health workers and gun safety advocates gathered at a rally Tuesday night to commemorate last week’s deadly shooting near Emory University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and demand policy changes to prevent future instances of gun violence.
At the entrance to the CDC, members of the community piled flowers, balloons and stuffed animals alongside signs thanking CDC workers and DeKalb County police Officer David Rose, who was killed in the shooting.
Down the street at Emory’s Rollins School of Public Health, leading voices in epidemiology, pediatric health and violence prevention took the stage in a packed auditorium to describe what they saw as a “culture of misinformation” that contributed to Friday’s attack. The rally was organized by Georgia Majority for Gun Safety and Georgia Clinicians for Gun Safety.
  Gun safety and public health advocates gathered at an evening rally at Emory’s Rollins School of Public Health. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
“Georgia is among the bottom third of state gun violence rates in a country that is doing poorly across developed nations,” said Heather Hallett, the founder and director of Georgia Majority for Gun Safety. “So we are really in a unique position in terms of the way gun violence impacts us.”
U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. said he was “deeply saddened” by the shooting, and visited the CDC campus Monday to meet with agency leadership and survey the damage.
“We are actively supporting CDC staff on the ground and across the agency,” he wrote in a post on X, adding “We honor their service. We stand with them. And we remain united in our mission to protect and improve the health of every American.”
But public health advocates — including former employees of the CDC — point to a rise in public mistrust of vaccines they say is fueled by Kennedy’s rhetoric and policy decisions on vaccines. Earlier this year, he dismissed all 17 members of a key vaccine panel at the CDC and replaced them with a slate of eight hand-picked appointees, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics. The panel later voted to ban thimerosal, a harmless preservative used in a small portion of flu vaccines, in what critics say is a nod to vaccine skeptics who have fixated on the chemical’s use. 
Last week, Kennedy also terminated 22 grants — including one at Emory University — as part of a “coordinated wind-down” of research studying mRNA vaccine technology. Vaccines using mRNA were first developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the technology won a Nobel Prize in 2023.
  Dr. Ben Lopman, an epidemiologist and former CDC employee who studies vaccines, spoke at Tuesday’s rally at Emory University. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
Dr. Ben Lopman, an epidemiologist and former CDC employee who studies vaccines, said at Tuesday’s rally that misinformation about vaccines “has reached the highest levels in our government and society” under the current administration.
“RFK Jr. was arguably the nation’s leading anti-vaccine activist before being elevated to HHS secretary,” Lopman said. “These wrong ideas are now embedded in everyday conversations, as well as official policy.”
Dr. Sofia Chaudhary, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta and an assistant professor at Emory University, also drew a link between mistrust of public health workers and Friday’s attack on the CDC.

“This past Friday, more than 180 bullets were fired, but the attack on public health went beyond the gunfire,” Chaudhary said. “Misinformation is a serious and growing threat to public health that leads to erosion of trust, delays in care and vaccinations, and deepening of social division.”
Speakers at the rally also condemned inaction on gun safety legislation at Georgia’s state Capitol. During the 2025 legislative session, legislators introduced a number of bills aimed at improving gun safety, but did not  pass any of them before the session concluded. Lawmakers will return to Atlanta in January. 
“There are over a dozen bills held in limbo in committee at our state Capitol that use evidence-based solutions to address gun violence,” said Mike Greenwald, a doctor and co-chair of Georgia Clinicians for Gun Safety. 
Lawmakers “are aware of the evidence and the arguments,” he added. “What holds them back is likely a political calculus.”
Georgia Clinicians for Gun Safety and Georgia Majority for Gun Safety will be launching a new public information campaign on gun safety next month, Greenwald said.



GBI releases updates in ongoing investigation
At a Tuesday news conference, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation released new insights into the motives of 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, a Kennesaw resident who police say is the suspect in the shooting.
Police said nearly 200 rounds of ammunition struck six separate CDC buildings over the course of the attack, and they recovered 500 shell casings from the CVS Pharmacy where White’s body was found dead with what police say was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. White had broken into his father’s safe and stolen five firearms that were used in the attack, including a rifle, a shotgun and a handgun, police said.
  Patrick Joseph White’s driver’s license photo was released Tuesday by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.
“All indications in our investigation was that [the guns] were secure and that he forced his way into the safe that contained the weapons,” said GBI Director Chris Hosey.
For the first time, officers publicly confirmed that White had expressed “discontent with the COVID-19 vaccinations.” Reporting from the New York Times and CNN alleged that the shooter blamed his health issues on the COVID-19 vaccine, but police had not publicly confirmed the shooter’s motivation before Tuesday.
GBI also released White’s driver’s license photograph for the first time Tuesday.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Rental options continue to be widely unaffordable for most low-income workers in Maryland, where a renter needs to make more than twice the minimum wage to afford a one-bedroom apartment, according to a new report.
The 2025 edition of the National Low Income Housing Coalition’s “Out of Reach” report says that a worker earning Maryland’s minimum wage of $15 an hour would need to work 89 hours a week in order to afford a one-bedroom rental home in the state and still have money for other living expenses.
This is the second year that the coalition ranked Maryland as the eighth-most difficult state for low-income renters to afford.
Claudia Wilson Randall, executive director of the Community Development Network of Maryland, said she’s “disappointed” in the lack of movement.
“We have not made much progress in the state of Maryland and housing,” she said.
The report, released Monday, shows that Marylanders working 40 hours a week would have needed to earn $39.15 an hour to be able to afford a two-bedroom apartment in fiscal 2025. That salary, which the report calls a “housing wage,” covers the average fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment at $2,036 without having to sacrifice more than 30% of income on housing,
That means a Maryland household must earn at least $6,786 a month, or $81,434 annually, to afford a two-bedroom apartment. That’s up from the fiscal 2024 housing wage of $36.70 an hour, or $76,345 a year, to afford that two-bedroom.

The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Maryland has also increased in the last year, from $1,909 a month in fiscal 2024 to $2,036 a month in fiscal 2025, according to the report.
Renters make up 33% of all households in Maryland, with about 760,800 renters across the state. The report shows that the average Maryland renter has a wage of $22.31, well below the “housing wage” to afford a two-bedroom apartment, according to the report.
Maryland falls behind neighboring Washington, D.C., which ranks fifth for unaffordability with a $44.50 housing wage for two-bedroom apartments. California leads the country with a $49.61 two-bedroom housing wage.
Wilson said that there are several reasons why Marylanders are struggling to afford rental units in the state – it’s not just rent going up and wages stagnating, though those are factors.
“Landlord costs are going up. Cost of insurance is going up … it’s utilities,” she said. “Inflation is also real. That’s just a hard place for renters to be.”
Wilson noted that high rent falls particularly hard on health care workers and other low-paid professions. Nursing assistants, home health and personal care aids, construction workers, cashiers and truck drivers, all have average wages that fall below the “housing wage” of $33.24 to afford a one-bedroom apartment in Maryland.
Kevin Lindamood, president and CEO of Health Care for the Homeless, agrees that the high cost of rent impacts many in the health care sector.
“The high cost of housing continues to be one of the biggest issues facing Maryland families, including the very health care workers we all rely on when we’re sick – like the workforce employed by community health centers like ours,” he said in a written statement.

Wilson said that while the issue of renter affordability is complex, the state can start by prioritizing the development of new homes across the state to help fill a 96,000-unit housing shortage.
“Maryland needs to make progress in the production of housing,” she said. “We also need to create more opportunities for affordable homeownership,” she said. “Again, it’s not a simple problem with one simple answer, but we have to make progress.”
State leaders are already aware of the state’s significant housing shortage, particularly for those earning lower wages.
In 2023, Gov. Wes Moore pushed a housing package to increase the supply of affordable housing options in the state. He attempted to build off of that momentum in the 2025 session by pushing a bill to tie new housing development to areas with high job growth, but those efforts were unsuccessful.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC01954-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 22:57:01.947152

Ford/Maryland Matters)She’s only seven months into the job, but U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md). has been tapped to help lead the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s annual conference next month in Washington, D.C.
Alsobrooks will join four-term Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) as co-chair of the Sept. 24-28 legislative conference with the theme, “Made for This Moment: Power, Policy, and Progress.” Thousands of elected officials, community leaders and activists are expected to converge on the Walter E. Washington Convention Center for sessions on health, education, economic prosperity and more.
There are a record 62 caucus members in this Congress, representing most of the 67 Black legislators on Capitol Hill. The other five are Republicans who do not belong to the caucus: Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Reps. Byron Donalds of Florida, Wesley Hunt of Texas, John James of Michigan and Burgess Owens of Utah
Alsobrooks made history in January when she was sworn in with fellow freshman Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), the first time two Black women had been elected to the Senate at the same time.
Neguse, first elected in 2018, has risen in House Democratic leadership ranks, serving as an impeachment manager in 2021 in the second impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. He was elected last year as the assistant Democratic leader and in January he was elected ranking member of House Natural Resources’ Subcommittee on Federal Lands.
“We are in a defining moment for Black America — one where our collective power, civic engagement and policy influence are shaping the future of this nation,” Nicole Austin-Hillery, president and CEO of the foundation, said in a statement. “With leaders like Senator Alsobrooks and Congressman Neguse helping guide this year’s conference, we are poised to deliver one of the most impactful gatherings to date.”

Signature events at the conference include a national town hall, a prayer breakfast and the Phoenix Awards Dinner, which was headlined last year by former Vice President Kamala Harris, then the Democrats’ presidential nominee.
The caucus’ main goal: Amplify voices and issues that most affect the Black community. Rep. Terri A. Sewell (D-Ala.), chair of the foundation’s board of directors, called it “a vital opportunity to come together, share ideas, and shape policies that move our communities forward.”
“By gathering leaders, advocates, and innovators from across the nation, we spark conversations and actions that advance equity, celebrate our culture, and strengthen Black leadership for generations to come,” Sewell said.
List of Annapolis City Council hopefuls set — and it’s a long one
The Annapolis Board of Supervisors of Elections has certified 21 city council candidates, and 16 of them showed up at First Baptist Church of Annapolis for a candidate forum Tuesday, a little more than a month before the Sept. 16 primary.
The two-hour forum was hosted by the Caucus of African American Leaders. Candidates in Wards 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 participated in the forum.
Ward 1 Alderman Harry Huntley (D) is seeking reelection but faces challenges from Democrats Ben Bramsen, Ron Gunzburger, Kathleen McDermott and Genevieve Torri. The nominee will face unaffiliated candidate Thomas Kriek in the Nov. 4 general election.
After the candidates introductory remarks, each was asked about plans to redevelop the City Dock, and what their criteria would be for a proposal to allow certain structures on Dock Street to exceed a height limit by 7 feet. All the candidates said they want to preserve the historic downtown area, with several saying they don’t support “spot zoning.”
Torri said she didn’t like “the culture that we’re hearing tonight, how it’s residents versus businesses, and businesses are bad, and residents may be mad.”
“I don’t think that benefits our city at all,” she said. “We are all a community. We all need to work together, and we need to find the solutions.”
Candidates were asked to raise their hands if they would retain Annapolis Police Chief Edward Jackson, who got a vote of confidence from the caucus last year. About five candidates raised their hands. Gunzburger, who wanted to respond to the question about the chief but wasn’t allowed due to time constraints, quickly said, “I support the men and women of the rank and file.”
All candidates were asked the police chief question, but other questions were more random, ranging from financial literacy programs to affordable housing and efforts to support minority businesses.

Ward 2 Alderwoman Karma O’Neill (D) doesn’t have a primary opponent, but will face Republican Kenneth Vincent in the general election.
The Ward 3 seat is open, after incumbent Rhonda Pindell Charles decision to run for mayor to replace Mayor Gavin Buckley (D) who is term-limited. Democrats Deborah “Debbie” Odum and Keanuú Smith-Brown will square off in the primary, with winner to face unaffiliated voter Mike Dye in the general election for the Ward 3 seat.
The Ward 4 seat is also open, after Alderman Sheila M. Finlayson’s (D) decision not to seek reelection. The Democratic primary between Janice Elaine Allsup-Johnson and Coren Makell — there is currently no opponent filed in the general election. Makell attended Tuesday’s forum.
In Ward 6, Democrats Diesha Contee and Craig Cussimanio square off in the primary for the chance to face Republican George Gallagher in the race to succeed Alderman DeJuan Gay, who is not running for reelection. Gallagher did not  participate in Tuesday’s forum.
One more open seat — Ward 8 Alderman Ross H. Arnett III is not seeking reelection — drew Democrat Frank Thorp ad unaffiliated voter Will Cunha, who fill face each other in the general election.
Candidate for Wards 5 and 7 did not attend the forum. Ward 5 Alderman Brooks Schandelmeier will face Republican Jack Papaleonti in the general election, and Ward 7 Alderman Robert Savidge is running unopposed.
Before the forum ended, Carl Snowden, convener of the caucus, announced a mayoral debate will take place at 6:30 p.m. Sept. 10, at the Boys and Girls Club of Annapolis. Besides Pindell Charles, Democrat Jared Littmann and Republican Robert O’Shea are scheduled to participate in that event.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Angela-Alsobrooks-9-13-2024-cropped-e1755058569368-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-13 04:57:02.994532

Myrex campaigned on listening to constituents, improving mental health care in public schools and economic growth. Voters told Myrex they were concerned about a new state law that would allow the city of Cullman, a wet city, to annex land from Cullman County, a dry county, for a “community development project” to serve alcohol.
The law drew criticism from Democratic and Republican candidates in this election and the House District 11 election, scheduled for Aug. 26. Cullman County did not have representation in the House after Harbison resigned in April and Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to work for Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman.
Gudger, who co-sponsored the legislation, pre-filed a bill on Aug. 1 to repeal the law, which goes into effect on Oct. 1. Myrex supports the repeal bill, which would not go into effect until it goes through the legislature in January.
According to campaign finance records, Myrex raised $151,235.69 and spent $120,132.59. Most of Myrex’s fundraising came from her own money and businesses. Hollingsworth raised $182,878.34 and spent $164,728.51. Almost two thirds of his donations came from political action committees (PACs), where the SV&B and SVBII PACs donated the most at $14,000 between two separate PACs that are operated by the same consulting firm: Swatek, Vaughn and Bryan.

Aug. 12, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A new state commission charged with reviewing and suggesting updates to how Nebraska funds its public K-12 schools kicked off its first meeting Monday largely with a consensus that the state should dole out more aid to local schools.
The work of the new School Financing Review Commission revolves around property taxes and state income and sales tax dollars distributed under Nebraska’s Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act, better known as TEEOSA or state aid formula. The  formula, at a basic view, considers a district’s “needs” minus its “resources.” A district receives “equalization aid” if it has a positive balance.

For the 2025-26 school year, TEEOSA is calculated between 18 “needs,” such as addressing student growth, poverty or English language learners, and six “resources,” including some income tax funds in a given district and how much a district could collect if it taxed the property within its boundaries at $1.
While all schools receive some level of state funding, only 50 of the state’s 245 school districts are equalized, a calculation that fluctuates annually in part because of property valuations.
Gov. Jim Pillen, addressing the commission Tuesday, asked that commissioners leave any preconceived ideas behind and look at what’s best for Nebraska and its schools.
“It’s critical, we all agree, you never, ever, give up on a kid,” Pillen said. “Can’t let one be left behind.”
Brady Public Schools Superintendent Ann Foster, one of 17 members of the mostly governor-appointed commission, which still has one vacancy still to fill, said she recognizes the work is twofold: property tax relief while keeping kids at the “heart” of all decisions.
TEEOSA basics
Local school property taxes accounted for about $2.9 billion of a $5.3 billion total in property taxes collected statewide last year. Schools receive about $5 billion in total revenue each year, including federal and general state aid plus state dollars meant to offset some local property taxes through tax credits. 
Voters prohibited the state from levying separate property taxes in 1966.

Pillen and state lawmakers took a first stab at addressing TEEOSA after he took office in 2023 by establishing baseline “foundation aid” for each district — $1,500 for K-12 students plus $900 for pre-K students.
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, one of 18 commissioners and vice chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee, passed the legislation this spring establishing the new financing commission to suggest possible tweaks to TEEOSA. The formula has been perennially updated since its creation in 1990.
A lawmaker-led committee thought up TEEOSA and a similar school financing review commission took effect after it passed. That group disbanded in 2002.
State law requires the new commission to produce a first report of recommendations by Dec. 1, with most commissioners saying they want to meet at least monthly until then.
‘Overreliance’ on property taxes
During Tuesday’s meeting, the commission broke into small groups to think up goals for the commission — with agreement there must be a balance among revenue sources, including as funding variables change.

In large part, commissioners said they want to get away from an “overreliance” on property taxes.
Millard Public Schools Superintendent John Schwartz said his group wanted to highlight sustainability and predictability for school districts, the state and taxpayers. But he said doing so should not erode intended property tax relief efforts, which his group said “might add value.”
State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee, suggested educating the public about TEEOSA could be a good focus, too. Schwartz and former State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of the Elkhorn area agreed. Linehan chaired the Legislature’s Revenue Committee for six years.
“If it was simpler, I think, and people understood it better, school funding would even have more support than it does now,” Murman said.
Operational expenses
Other commissioners, such as Hughes and Nebraska State Treasurer Tom Briese, suggested long-term plans that would have the state assume greater responsibility for school funding.

Hughes, vice chair of the Education Committee, highlighted a long-term goal to push school property tax rates closer together, which vary between 30 cents and $1.05 per $100 of property valuations. Her original bill in the spring, which included the commission, also sought to do this. 
However, Hughes’ original plan, which had earned the backing of Pillen and many school and ag advocates, needed about $120 million in state funding to work. 
That remained out of reach with current tax revenues, as the state continues to face budget woes and as lawmakers reject suggestions to add sales taxes to goods and services currently exempt from them or to increase taxes on tobacco or vape products.
Briese again suggested the state take on the operational expenses of local schools, 80% of which are staff salaries and benefits, an idea Briese, Pillen and other lawmakers tried to rally behind in summer 2024.

That model would be similar to the state assuming the property tax side of community college through 2023 legislation led by Briese and Murman. That law allows community colleges to go back to property taxes if state funding from mostly sales and income taxes falls.
“It’s aspirational at this point,” Briese said. “It’s going to be hard to get there any time real soon, but I think we ought to work through that, figure out how we can do that and try to set ourselves on a roadmap to do that.”
Some school officials and lawmakers have balked at the idea of the state taking on a greater portion of state aid instead of property taxes, arguing it could erode “local control” and lead to more strings, an idea that resurfaced Tuesday and will likely continue to be a focal point.
However, sometimes the same public school defenders have criticized the state for not funding schools to a higher degree.
Operational expenses
Keith Runge, president of the Lakeview Community School Board in Columbus, explained that the state taking on more school funding can be a scary proposition.
Today, the situation could be alright, Runge explained, but in three or four years, he asked if some state lawmakers or officials would try to “tie the hands” of local schools and say, “You either do it this way or you’re going to lose some of this.”

Omaha Public Schools, the largest in the state, has taken a blanket position of opposing any legislation that would increase the district’s reliance on state funding or lead to the “erosion” of local control in budgeting decisions, such as teacher recruitment. OPS board members voted 7-0 for the position in July 2024, earning the ire of some lawmakers, including Linehan
Linehan last summer proposed legislation to remove the “resources” side of the TEEOSA equation. She then suggested using TEEOSA as the vehicle to distribute more school funding.
Shavonna Holman, an OPS board member representing the district on the commission, declined to comment on the district’s position. She was one of the seven voting for it, as did now-State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, who sits on the Education Committee. OPS communications staff confirmed Tuesday that the district’s position has not changed.
Defining ‘local control’
State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, who serves on the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, pushed back. He said school districts already get state money and that the state already has the power and leverage to exert itself more aggressively if lawmakers or the executive branch want to.
“I hear this sometimes, and I’m interested in understanding more about where some of these fears are and what really are we talking about looking forward, if you wouldn’t mind just indulging me a little bit,” Bostar said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Foster gave the example of “autonomy” in teacher recruitment and retention, such as in setting salaries according to the cost of living in Brady, a town of 400, or offering full family insurance. She suggested the commission define what “local control” means to help frame future conversations.
Schwartz said it’s also hard for the state to account for all variables in funding. He said local funding also means a higher degree of local accountability.
“At the point at which a standardized funding formula is put in place, there could be some discrepancies that are maintained indefinitely,” Schwartz said.
Linehan said new legislation for K-12 schools could include similar built-in safety rails as community colleges, for schools to retain the ability to raise property taxes if the state doesn’t fulfill its part of the deal. She and others echoed past statements that school boards would retain local decisions on how to use funding.
Bostar said interests wanting to micromanage schools will exist regardless of funding decisions, as he asked school officials not to “fear” the idea of receiving more state dollars.
“I don’t think your concern about the erosion of local control is misplaced, but I don’t think you should pair that concern with funding,” Bostar told fellow commissioners. “I think that concern should be real, and it exists, but it doesn’t necessarily mean anything related to funding.”
Vice chair decision
The commission’s decision on whom to elect vice chair could hint at what direction the commission goes next in its advisory role. That person would serve alongside Nebraska Education Commissioner Brian Maher, whom lawmakers designated as chair when they created the commission.

Linehan nominated Briese, describing him as someone ag leaders trust. She also noted Briese’s law degree and willingness to consider other taxes to fund schools since at least 2017, when they both joined the Legislature. He became treasurer in 2023.
Ag interests, a predominant Nebraska industry, often feature in property tax debates and can determine the fate of such legislation. Just days before the 2024 summer special session ended last August, tensions erupted, with Linehan warning ag leaders they had major wins in her eight years but still needed to broaden their coalition, such as with homeowners.
Superintendent Aaron Plas of Bennington Public Schools nominated Schwartz, praising his experience in Nebraska schools, big and small. Plas said Schwartz, the most recent Nebraska superintendent of the year, also knows TEEOSA “forwards and backwards.”
Schwartz was selected as vice chair in a 7-5 vote. Two members were absent, and one vacancy remains for an active public school teacher to be appointed by the governor.
‘You’re on the right track’
One member of the public, Dave Welsch, a retired farmer who is president of the Milford School Board, urged the commission to consider aspirations to make Nebraska’s tax policies competitive. While that might often focus on competition with other states, he said it could also include district-to-district tax rates. 
  Nebraska Education Commissioner Brian Maher of Lincoln talks to a staffer from the Nebraska Department of Education during the first meeting of the School Financing Review Commission. Aug. 12, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
One farmer, for instance, might need to sell a bushel of beans for $1 more just to pay for more property taxes, Welsch explained.
The school board president has worked with lawmakers for years on school funding legislation, including Hughes. Welsch said that once schools are equalized, the focus can turn to student investments.
“You’re on the right track,” Welsch told the commission. “Keep rolling.”
Maher, a former central Nebraska superintendent, told reporters he is hopeful for progress. He said nobody in the room voiced a desire to balance budgets on the backs of K-12 schools. Rather, he said the focus is on adequate school funding and supporting students and taxpayers.
Said Maher: “I think if we all put our hearts and minds together, I think we can actually make some progress on the complexity that is school funding.”

We are joining the growing number of communities across the US that are exploring ways to handle calls for help other than by sending police officers.  
The post In Lynn, new ‘Calm Team’ offers  alternative to police response appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","MORE THAN 200 years ago, the City of Lynn saw a need to be filled, and founded the Lynn Fire Department in response. The Lynn Police Department, as we know it today, started about 150 years ago. If the city’s newly launched “Calm Team” lives up to our hopes, Lynn will look back to this moment for many years to come as the launch of a similarly vital public safety initiative. 
We have long asked police to respond to almost every kind of trouble imaginable. Whether a violent incident is taking place or a person with known mental illness is in the throes of an acute episode, the way to beckon help has been to dial 911 for police.  
Recognizing that there are situations where a different type of response could be the best way to deal with a situation, a growing number of communities across the US are exploring ways to handle calls for help other than by sending police officers.  
The Calm Team is Lynn’s unarmed alternative to police response. It’s a mobile team of social service professionals with strong community ties who will be charged with responding to some of our residents’ most challenging and sensitive issues in real time.

The number to call Lynn’s newly formed unarmed response team (781-905-CALM) went live on July 21. The Lynn Calm Team is a city service independent of the police department. Originally called for by community activists who part of the Lynn Racial Justice Coalition in response to George Floyd’s murder in Minnesota in 2020, this initiative has been years in the making. 
Understanding there is a critical need to address mental health at the intersection of racial justice and through culturally responsive services, our administration has sought to meet these new challenges in a way that complements and enhances our existing public safety infrastructure. 
This is something that is being implemented in communities across the country, from an experiment going back to the 1980s in Eugene, Oregon, to more recent initiatives in bigger cities like Denver and efforts closer to home in Amherst and Worcester. 
We have contracted with a Massachusetts-based behavioral health provider, Eliot Community Human Services, to hire the core team members and triage calls to leverage Eliot’s expertise and facilitate access to Eliot’s deep pool of behavioral health resources, including the state-funded Community Behavioral Health Center. The core team’s work will be supported by a full-time program administrator in the city’s public health department, who has a background in public administration and conflict resolution, as well as the city’s opioid specialist. 
The Calm Team is an important example of the broader effort to bring all relevant skills and experiences to our critical problems, particularly mental health and substance use, in a way that honors the impact of civil rights activism after George Floyd.  
It will help us reconcile community members’ demands to address individual suffering and law enforcement’s recognition of its own limitations when it comes to dealing with mental and behavioral health issues. Having more options for interventions creates more scenarios where community members have a choice when calling for a response to an individual they see struggling. 
Given the passion around these issues, the development of this team has been controversial. At certain points, advocates felt we were moving too slowly. Other times we were accused of not going far enough. Constituents across the political spectrum questioned our actions, doubted the need for any kind of alternative, and criticized us for putting city resources towards the initiative. 
Convinced that this was the right thing to do, we listened to everyone and worked through every controversy with community engagement. We hosted a series of forums in English and Spanish to educate Lynn residents on these new resources we hoped to make available. We negotiated with our public safety unions to make sure they understood what we were trying to do and could get on board. 
Through community guidance, we arrived at a vetted list of calls to which the Lynn Calm Team will respond. Those issues include non-emergency, non-violent mental health crises, drug overdose follow-up, tenant rights, community mediation, panhandling, and at-risk youth support.  
Recognizing the limitations of unarmed, alternative response, the issues do not include calls that require an immediate medical response, or are considered an active threat, such as domestic violence. The Calm Team members will use their discretion to deescalate situations, but will prioritize the well-being of the people they are trying to help as well as their own safety. 
The work will sometimes overlap with existing public safety teams, and that is OK. These issues are so extensive and, in some cases, intractable, that what works for one individual or situation may not for another. Although the program is independent from existing public safety agencies, collaboration with police and fire will be key to its long-term success.  
Today our cities and towns face new challenges. From creating resilience in the face of climate change, to working to be a community that welcomes everyone, Lynn is not unique. But the new effort with the Calm Team is a clear example of our ability to meet every challenge with an innovative perspective and a commitment to bringing people together. 
The Lynn Calm Team’s name invokes the feeling it hopes to create and was selected in part for its simple translation into Spanish: calma, calmness, tranquility. We hope that in the coming months, we are able to restore some of that calm to our community in a time when it is needed most.  
Jared Nicholson is mayor of Lynn.

,California,2025-08-13 01:12:53+00:00,CalMatters,Federal judge orders Trump administration to restore hundreds of UCLA research grants,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/2025/08/trump-ucla-research-grants/,The administration terminated the grants over alleged DEI violations. University of California attorneys argued the suspensions were arbitrary and capricious.,"In summary
The administration terminated the grants over alleged DEI violations. University of California attorneys argued the suspensions were arbitrary and capricious.


A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to restore a portion of the 800 federal science research grants that it suspended at UCLA last month, delivering a major setback to efforts to force the university into a $1 billion settlement. 
California district court judge Rita F. Lin ruled Tuesday that the suspensions violated her June  preliminary injunction in which she ordered the National Science Foundation to restore 114 grants it had terminated at the University of California and blocked the agency from cancelling other grants at the UC system.
”NSF’s actions violate the Preliminary Injunction,” Lin wrote.
Her June order came after lawyers for University of California researchers argued the science foundation grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious and in violation of federal law. Those grants and others were terminated over alleged Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion violations following several Trump executive orders in January.
Lin’s order to restore the suspended grants came in response to a court filing lawyers for the UC researchers submitted after 300 National Science Foundation Grants and 500 National Institutes of Health grants at UCLA were suspended. The suspensions froze $584 million. The lawyers aren’t acting on behalf of the UC system, though some are employed at the UC. It is not yet clear if all 300 suspended National Science Foundation grants are to be restored under Lin’s latest order. A lawyer for the researchers, Claudia Polsky, said all 300 should be restored.
Lin told the Trump administration and lawyers for the UC researchers to file an update on the restorations Aug. 19.
Lin’s latest order doesn’t restore UCLA’s suspended National Institutes of Science grants because they weren’t covered in her initial June order.Campuses rely on the funding to make scientific breakthroughs, develop new medicines, train graduate students and fuel the research that has made the U.S. arguably the world’s leader in scientific discovery.
Lawyers for the federal government contended that suspending the UCLA grants didn’t violate Lin’s June order, which barred terminations but was silent on suspensions. Lawyers for the University of California researchers said there’s no difference between suspensions and terminations because both mean researchers lose access to funding. They also argued that like in the June case, the suspensions of UCLA grants didn’t follow federal procedure that requires an agency to explain why each individual grant should no longer continue to receive funding.“NSF’s indefinite suspensions differ from a termination in name only. ” Lin wrote in Tuesday’s order.  She added that the letters informing UCLA of the grant suspensions “fail to provide a ‘grant-specific explanation’ for why the award has been terminated, as required by the Preliminary Injunction.”Some federal judges have faulted the Trump administration for never defining what it considers DEI but cancelling funding to schools based on those violations anyway.“Although a new presidential administration is entitled to develop programs with its chosen priorities, the Executive may not set out to suppress ideas it deems dangerous by trying to drive them out of the marketplace of ideas,” Lin wrote in her June preliminary injunction.
How we got here
The Trump administration suspended UCLA’s grants over allegations that the campus isn’t doing enough to combat antisemitism. The National Science Foundation sent a letter to UCLA on Aug. 1 that accused the campus of admitting students based on race, even though all public campuses in California have been barred from affirmative action since state voters eliminated the practice in 1996.The letter also accused the campus of relying on admissions essays to determine an applicant’s race. But when the Supreme Court of the United States struck down affirmative action in 2023, the majority ruling allowed campuses to allow students to write about their race and identity in admissions essays.The science foundation made similar accusations against Harvard University when it terminated that campus’s grants. 
The 800 grant suspensions followed a federal Department of Justice report last month that accused  the campus of not doing enough to address antisemitism, particularly related to events during last year’s pro-Palestine protests, which included overnight encampments erected by protesters. The report came months after UCLA commissioned a task force to investigate antisemitism on campus and come up with recommendations that UCLA leaders said they’d implement.
That report published the same day UCLA agreed to a $6.45 million settlement with four Jewish plaintiffs. That deal was opposed by several pro-Palestinian professors and students, some of whom are Jewish.Last year a federal judge in the case sided with the Jewish plaintiffs who said that the anti-Israel sentiment displayed by protestors in the encampment violated their religious liberties because of their spiritual ties to Israel. “Jewish students were excluded from portions of the UCLA campus because they refused to denounce their faith,” the judge, Mark C. Scarsi, wrote in his preliminary injunction.
Various Jewish groups debate whether anti-Zionism is inherently antisemitic. The UCLA encampment included Jewish participants.
About a week later, on Aug 8, the Trump administration sent UCLA a settlement proposal of $1 billion that the school would pay over several installments in exchange for getting back the suspended science grants, CNN first reported. The settlement also sought to ban overnight demonstrations at UCLA, but that was already campus policy before last spring’s pro-Palestine protests; the UC reaffirmed those bans systemwide last fall. 
How California responded
Gov. Gavin Newsom said Trump “has threatened us through extortion with a billion dollar fine unless we do his bidding” at a press conference on Friday hours after CNN first reported Trump’s settlement demand. Newsom said “we’ll sue” last Friday when a reporter asked how California will respond. The state’s attorney general has already filed 37 lawsuits against the Trump administration, including several tied to education funding.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said “bring it on, Gavin” at a press conference Tuesday.
“A payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians,” said UC President James B. Milliken in a statement about the $1 billion settlement demand. UCLA has also continued its media blitz highlighting the human benefits of the university’s health and science research. 
The settlement demand “does not make Jewish students safer,” the Jewish Public Affairs Committee of California said in a statement Tuesday. The advocacy group 39 organizations that offer family services, political advocacy, immigration legal aid and other nonprofit work.The Jewish affairs committee pointed to several strides UC and UCLA made to curtail antisemitism and promote safer campuses. “Meaningful progress is already underway in California,” the group wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/040825_UCLA-Funding-Cuts_JH_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-12 21:56:42.739619

Branch Out Burlington, a tree nursery located in the University of Vermont Horticulture Farm, has been providing trees to Vermont towns and organizations for almost 30 years.

Camryn Woods is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
BURLINGTON — On a warm Sunday evening in June, Margaret Skinner crouched near a young honey locust tree and plucked away the net of weeds that surrounded it. Her efforts, she knew, could help the sapling breathe by reducing its competition for nutrients and water.
This honey locust is just one of 600 trees that Skinner and her team of volunteers nurture throughout the summer. Most of the trees, having traveled in a tractor trailer truck from Oregon, where the climate is better for cultivating trees, will spend their most vulnerable years being cared for in the South Burlington–based tree nursery called Branch Out Burlington.
Once they graduate from the nursery three to four years later, the trees will provide shade, carbon sequestration and valuable habitats throughout the state of Vermont.
Branch Out Burlington, affectionately referred to by its members as “BOB,” is dedicated to enhancing the urban forest in Burlington, engaging community members through events like tree walks and weeding days and hosting an annual tree sale. 
Skinner helped found the group in 1996 when the city lacked resources to care for its trees. Two years later, she was granted access to land that would become the nursery — at the time, stocked with only 40 trees, according to Skinner — which is currently located off of Shelburne Road in the University of Vermont Horticulture Farm.
“I don’t want to just plant trees. I want to make sure the trees that get planted in the community get cared for, because they weren’t and they were dying,” said Skinner, who also works full-time as an entomologist at the University of Vermont.
This care, Skinner said, includes removing weeds, selectively removing branches to improve health, securing trees in place with wooden stakes and watering them. Young trees can also be easily damaged by outdoor equipment like weedwhackers and lawnmowers, which should be avoided around them, she said.
That Sunday evening, Skinner was joined by the president of Branch Out Burlington, Jacob Holzberg-Pill, and the organization’s web designer, Nathan Hoffmann, who are part of the board’s eight to nine members.
When he found Branch Out Burlington, “I was looking for things to do that were outside, that were tree related, that were part of the community,” said Holzberg-Pill, who had moved to Burlington with his 1-year-old son. “I contacted Margaret, and I was like, “Hey, could I come help out?’”
Hoffmann joined the organization three years ago, when he was looking for volunteer opportunities as a graphic designer at OnLogic, a computer hardware manufacturing company. After attending multiple weeding events, he started going to the board meetings, cementing his long-term involvement.
“I wanted to learn more. There’s a wealth of knowledge here that you’d never believe. It was just such a cool opportunity to get more involved and to be a part of the community, doing something that was much bigger than me,” Hoffmann said.
On Tuesday, July 8, from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m., Branch Out Burlington held a Weeding Bee in the nursery, which is open to the public every second Tuesday during the summer months. Its 20-some attendees chatted, cleared weeds from tree beds and puzzled over iPhone pictures of unidentified damage on folks’ front yard trees.
Once the weeding was done, Skinner provided free pizza and homemade cookies to volunteers. A ticket raffle was held, with prizes ranging from urban forestry books to a handmade wooden birdhouse.
“It’s a really special, fun way to get away from the work week and meet wonderful community members of all ages and from all over,” Hoffmann said. 
The Essex Junction Tree Advisory Committee, established by the city council in 2013, also makes an effort to be at the Weeding Bees. They have two rows of trees specifically allocated to the city, but volunteers help care for the entire nursery. 
“It was a win-win for us because we could, with our budget, be able to really increase the number of trees we could get into the community,” said Nick Meyer, chair of the committee.
Weeding Bees and Branch Out Burlington’s other volunteer opportunities, like pruning and grafting workshops and tree planting events, make urban trees economically viable for cities. 
When trees are bought older and immediately ready to plant in urban environments, they’re much more expensive, according to Holzberg-Pill — potentially around $500 each. 
Instead, Branch Out Burlington buys its trees from Oregon nurseries for $50 at younger ages with the knowledge that they’ll be stewarded by volunteers for a few years until they’re ready to move. 
Branch Out Burlington’s July 2025 newsletter wrote that it give away hundreds of trees to local schools, towns and non-profits that have the means to take care of them every year. The ability to fund projects like this comes from donations and tree sale profits. 
Green Mountain Farm-to-School, a nonprofit that builds healthy school environments, the Intervale Community Farm, a Burlington-based agricultural center, and Perkins Pier in Burlington, for example, have received tree donations, according to the newsletter.
Going forward, Skinner hopes to continue developing Branch Out Burlington’s media presence. “We are lucky to get 20 people up here to help take care of these trees once a month,” she said. “As I look around the nursery, I could spend every day, all day, and there would still be work to do.”
Urban trees are becoming more important as the climate warms, according to Meyer. 
“If we didn’t have any trees on all our sidewalks and open areas, days like today would be even hotter,” Meyer said. Cooling the temperature in cities and slowing rainfall in tree canopies are forms of stormwater management, and green spaces can give a visually softening effect to concrete environments, Meyer said.
“Hopefully these trees are going to be here for generations,” he said.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A multi-year investigation centered on multiple motels, “brow and lash” salons and alleged human trafficking in and around Nebraska’s largest city has led to charges against five people in the hotel business. 
The five are accused of crimes ranging from alleged sex and labor trafficking, fraudulent use of visas, money laundering and concealing undocumented immigrants, law enforcement officials announced Tuesday.
Also seized as part of the search warrants was $565,000 in cash. A representative of U.S. Homeland Security said workers in the country without proper documentation also were detained, though he declined to disclose how many.
Eugene Kowel, special agent in charge of the Omaha FBI, said child victims as young as 12 years old were involved in a case he described as “absolutely horrific.” A statement said officers “rescued” 10 minors and 17 adults from the alleged labor trafficking conspiracy.
“Human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery,” Kowel said. “This investigation revealed victims right here in the heartland forced into sexual activity, living and working in dangerous and filthy conditions and extorted to work in grueling jobs with little to no pay.”
Kowel said investigators became aware of activity about four years ago, assisted by calls and concerns from the public. 
He said the case involved “sex for rent,” drugs and more. On one occasion, he said, a source working with the federal government entered a hotel room where immigrants slept on the floor with cockroaches crawling on them.
Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said more than 100 Omaha officers worked the case at various points, mostly since earlier this year, when an alleged juvenile sex trafficking case was revealed at one of the hotels that was also part of Tuesday’s crackdown. That property, the AmericInn near Interstate-80 and 13th Street, is adjacent to Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo.
Other motel properties upon which agents converged Tuesday: New Victorian Inn & Suites near 108th and L Streets; Rodeway Inn at 1110 Fort Crook Road South in Bellevue; The Inn (formerly Super 8) at 9305 S. 145th St.
Ten other businesses associated with the accused also were searched under a warrant, the officials said, including “brow and lash” salons in the Westroads Mall and other Omaha metro locations.
The five people accused of alleged crimes, according to the U.S. Attorney for Nebraska, Lesley Woods: Kentakumar Chaudhari, 36, of Elkhorn; Rashmi Ajit Samani, 42, of Elkhorn; Amit Prahladbhai Chaudhari, 32, of Omaha; Amit Babubhai Chaudhari, 33, of Omaha; and Maheshkumar Chaudhari, 38, of Norfolk.
According to a U.S. Attorney’s Office statement, sex trafficking was encouraged at the hotels — “protected from law enforcement detection, and sex trafficking victims at the hotels were subjected not only to the traditional perpetrators of a sex trafficking scheme but also to hotel management and employees victimizing them as well.”
The statement said, “Drug traffickers allegedly received protection from law enforcement in the same manner in which human traffickers were also shielded by the hotel owners and managers.” 
Kowel said at least one of the accused is charged with conspiracy to defraud the government through a scheme designed to obtain a U visa, which are for victims that help law enforcement prosecute crimes.
In that situation, he said, a hotel owner is accused of staging a fictitious robbery at a salon in 2022, the goal allegedly being to secure a U visa for one of the other defendants by representing her as a victim.
The federal government is taking steps to prevent the sale or transfer of the hotels during the ongoing investigation. The officials said 11 agencies and about 300 law enforcement officers were involved in the FBI-led investigation.
Among the agencies: the Nebraska State Patrol, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Attorney’s Office of Nebraska and Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office.

Cheyenne court says the injunction against voucher law will remain as schools chief appeals the order to the Wyoming Supreme Court.
The post Judge keeps freeze on spending state funds for private education appeared first on WyoFile .","A judge Tuesday said his temporary halt on a law that would allow state money to fund education at private schools will remain in place while his injunction is appealed to the Wyoming Supreme Court.
District Court Judge Peter H. Froelicher denied a request by Wyoming Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder and others to let the law take effect while they challenge his preliminary injunction. 
Degenfelder wants state money to be disbursed while voucher supporters challenge a lawsuit brought by the Wyoming Education Association and others. Wyoming students are set to return to school soon for the fall semester.
The WEA sued Degenfelder, State Treasurer Curt Meier and the state of Wyoming on June 13, claiming that the Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act violates the Wyoming Constitution by allowing public funds to be used for private education for more than just the needy.
“Defendants and Intervenors failed to show they are likely to succeed on appeal.” Judge Peter Froelicher
Degenfelder and intervenors Nicolette and Travis Leck and Victoria Haight argued that they were likely to win their appeal and would be harmed while the voucher program is on hold.
“Defendants and Intervenors failed to show they are likely to succeed on appeal and failed to show they will suffer an irreparable injury,” Judge Froelicher wrote. “The preliminary injunction will maintain the status quo.”
WEA president Kim Amen hailed the decision. “We appreciate the thorough and thoughtful approach that the judge continues to take in this case,” Amen said in a statement.
Degenfelder was not prepared to comment by press time.
How we got here
Froelicher blocked the law on June 27, five days before it was to take effect. Wyoming families had submitted nearly 4,000 student applications for the program through late June. The program would give applicants up to $7,000 a year.
The WEA, which represents more than 6,000 state public school employees, filed its lawsuit along with nine parents of school-aged children.
In her motion to remove the temporary injunction, Degenfelder argued that Froelicher misread the constitution’s declaration of a fundamental right to education. But Degenfelder’s arguments ignore “plain and unequivocal terms” in the constitution that restrict legislative power on the issue, the judge wrote.
Degenfelder and Meier also failed to convince the judge that the injunction allows the WEA to “dictate the quality of education for other Wyoming students.” The court’s interpretation of the constitution also does not block all state programs that fund private entities, as alleged by Degenfelder, the judge said.
Also, there are no real consequences of the injunction to the Lecks and Haight, Froelicher wrote. The three “will not suffer any irreparable injury because their harm can be remedied if this Court is reversed and the Act is implemented,” his order reads.
Froelicher also knocked down Degenfelder’s arguments based on school funding cases in West Virginia, Ohio, Nevada and North Carolina.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)North Carolina Democrats spent a Tuesday press conference painting Republican Senate candidate Michael Whatley as an extremist, pointing to his support of former Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who lost his gubernatorial bid last year after numerous inflammatory remarks.
At the state Democratic Party headquarters, state Rep. Phil Rubin (D-Wake) called Whatley a “Washington big oil lobbyist” who has “consistently elevated the most extreme forces in this party and in North Carolina,” specifically mentioning Robinson.
Whatley, who has served as the national Republican Party Chair since March 2024, announced last month he will seek the Senate seat being vacated by the retiring Sen. Thom Tillis. His announcement, which came with the support of President Donald Trump, followed on the heels of former Gov. Roy Cooper declaring his candidacy for the seat, setting up what is expected to be one of the most expensive races in the country in next year’s midterm elections.

Rubin referenced a 2022 remark by Whatley, then the state Republican Party chair, in which he called Robinson “the greatest lieutenant governor in the United States” amid controversy over Robinson’s apparent incitement to violence against transgender people and libraries hosting “drag queen story hour.”
“His support for Robinson was steadfast even as Robinson said vile things about women, attacked victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, and said, ‘We are called to be led by men, not women,’” Rubin said. “This election is a clear choice between results and resentment, between competence and culture wars.”
Shortly after Robinson’s victory in the 2024 Republican primary, Whatley endorsed his campaign for governor on social media. “North Carolina voters have delivered a resounding message that they want change in the Governor’s mansion and Mark Robinson is ready to deliver it!” he wrote in March. In the months that followed — as Robinson’s campaign collapsed into scandal over a CNN investigation into his online presence — Whatley expressed disappointment, but stopped short of disavowing the candidate.
“Those comments are absolutely antithetical to Republican values, and if Mark Robinson is going to continue in this race, then yeah, I do think he is going to have to demonstrate to the voters of North Carolina that those are not his words, his actions, or his values,” he told Bloomberg Radio in September.
Former N.C. Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, criticized Whatley that same month for enabling Robinson’s rise. In an interview with CNN, he said the former state Republican Party chair “ignored many known flaws that many of us knew about [Robinson] and just assumed they’d be brushed over,” calling Robinson “a ticking time bomb for several years now.”
World Tabernacle Church Pastor James Gaillard, a state Senate candidate, said at the press conference that Whatley “spent years here in North Carolina and also nationally elevating really dangerous people to powerful offices.”
“One of those dangerous individuals was our former lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson, and I think it’s important that we connect those dots,” Gaillard said. “North Carolina doesn”t need someone representing us in the U.S. Senate who wants to be rewarded for having given us Mark Robinson.”
Ironically, before Tillis announced his retirement, Robinson had hinted that he might mount a primary challenge against him for the seat. Robinson bowed out in January the same day he announced he was dropping  a defamation lawsuit he filed against CNN during his gubernatorial campaign.
Little known by voters
Democrats are eager to define Whatley by his past support for Robinson as he prepares to face an electorate that knows little about him. An August 1 poll by Emerson College found that a plurality of registered voters who were surveyed do not know who he is, with 36% responding that they “have never heard of this person.” Another 30% said they had no opinion or were unsure how they felt about him.
That survey found Cooper leading Whatley 47% to 41%, with 12% of respondents unsure how they would vote. A popular two-term governor, Cooper boasts much higher name recognition than Whatley, with only 3% of those surveyed not recognizing his name. About 6% did not know who the retiring Tillis was.
Robinson ultimately lost the 2024 governor’s race by nearly 15% of the vote, the largest margin in more than 40 years. If Democrats successfully tie Robinson to Whatley, it could deliver them their first Senate victory in the state since 2008.


Beyond Robinson, the speakers at Tuesday’s press conference attacked Whatley over his support for the Republican “big, beautiful bill” cutting health care and social services spending, contrasting it with Cooper’s record of ushering in Medicaid expansion and extending coverage to nearly 670,000 additional North Carolinians.

“We cannot afford a senator like Mr. Whatley who called gutting Medicaid for over 650,000 North Carolinians, undermining our rural hospitals, ‘a big win,’ ” Rubin said. “We should reject Michael Whatley’s radical agenda and send a senator to Washington who will protect health care, lower costs, defend our freedoms, and safeguard our democracy. North Carolina deserves nothing less than Roy Cooper in the United States Senate.”
Jen Kalinowski, the mother of a girl born with a rare genetic disorder known as dup15q who requires constant care through Medicaid, also spoke at the press conference. Kalinowski said losing that care would have life-altering consequences for her family.
“She will never be able to gain any independence without her therapies. She certainly will not have the quality of care and support she needs. She will die without control of her seizures,” Kalinowski said. “We can’t elect a U.S. senator who rips away health care from those who need it more. I implore my fellow North Carolinians to please stand up for what’s right.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8123236-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-12 20:57:14.911730

The vote came after an “extensive evaluation” of Jealous’ conduct, according to the email from board President Patrick Murphy. The email did not describe the particular reasons for Jealous’ ouster.
Jealous, a former Democratic nominee for Maryland governor, was placed on leave last month over what a Sierra Club spokesperson would only describe as a “personnel matter.”
“The Sierra Club leads with our values,” Murphy wrote in Monday’s email. “That’s how we engage in communities across the country, how we fulfill our mission and achieve our goals, and how we interact with one another and our organization.
“The decision the Board made was a difficult but principled one to uphold these values and ensure every individual at the Sierra Club is held equally accountable, with no special treatment or favor for those holding influence and power,” his email went on to say.
In a statement issued through a spokesperson Tuesday, Jealous said that he had initiated a “process under my contract” to fight the termination.
“It is disheartening, unfortunate, but perhaps not surprising that the board has chosen an adversarial course that the facts so clearly cannot support,” Jealous wrote in the statement.
Sierra Club spokesperson Jonathon Berman said the board determined Jealous “engaged in conduct that constitutes cause under his employment agreement….  the entire Board determined that it had no other option than to separate from him in order to protect the organization, its employees, its values, and its mission.”
“Mr. Jealous had an opportunity for a dignified exit and we are disheartened to see he has instead unfortunately chosen an adversarial course.,” Berman’s statement said. “Mr. Jealous’ challenge to the Board’s unanimous cause determination has no merit.  We are confident that Mr. Jealous will not prevail in any forum, whether public or private.”
Jealous’ tenure at the national nonprofit was tumultuous, including several rounds of layoffs and other moves that drew ire from the Progressive Workers Union, which represents Sierra Club workers.
Progressive Wokers President Erica Dodt said in a statement Monday that the union was “heartened” to learn of Jealous’ termination for cause. Dodt cited the union’s “no-confidence” vote against Jealous one year ago, which she says was spurred by his “mismanagement of our organization’s strategy and budget and his ongoing attacks on our union.”
“We hope that his departure will open the door for a stronger relationship between workers and management, and allow the Sierra Club to better focus our efforts on fighting the Trump administration and protecting the environment,” Dodt wrote.
In a July 21 letter sent to Sierra Club leaders after Jealous was put on leave, Aaron Mair and Chad Hanson, former board members, defended Jealous, who is the nonprofit’s first Black executive director, and argued that he was treated differently than his white predecessors.
The two argued, in part, that Jealous was unfairly blamed for actions he took to balance the Sierra Club’s budget, including layoffs and other cost-cutting measures.
“The Sierra Club’s first Black Executive Director is being treated like a fall guy, unfairly blamed for Board and past management decisions made before he began his job,” Mair and Hanson wrote.
In a letter to the Sierra Club board Tuesday, the union’s Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) Caucus, pushed back against what they called “baseless accusations that PWU’s attempts to hold Mr. Jealous and his team accountable are rooted in racism.”
“BIPOC staff and allies alike have been voicing our concerns about Mr. Jealous’s leadership and actions, not because of his identity, but because of the impacts of his choices,” reads the letter.
The group argued that Jealous dismantled the Sierra Club’s equity department, and gutted other programs serving communities bearing environmental burdens. They also argued that layoffs overseen by Jealous disproportionately impacted staff of color, who made up less than a third of the organization but accounted for nearly half of the layoffs in 2025, according to the union’s data.
In its letter, the caucus argued that “dismissing Jealous is just the first among many steps” the board should take to repair the organization. It called for workplace morale and worker retention studies, as well as a voice in the hiring process for the nonprofit’s next executive director.
Jealous, a former leader of the NAACP, ran unsuccessfully to unseat Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) in 2018. After the race, Jealous took on consulting work, including for the Juul e-cigarette company, before he took the leadership role at People For the American Way, and then the Sierra Club.
In his statement issued Tuesday, Jealous touted a list of achievements during his tenure with Sierra Club.
“While I was recruited at a time of significant, diverse challenges for the club, I was able to create the most diverse leadership team in the club’s history,” Jealous wrote. “The board and I strengthened a weak financial base, crafted a progressive union contract, dramatically increased chapter directors in red states, and increased our advocacy capacity by building a stronger field department.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_3110-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 19:56:52.028041

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)The coffee industry in New Mexico and across the country was already in crisis when President Donald Trump’s second term began, owners of a prominent local roaster told U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján when he visited their Albuquerque headquarters Tuesday.
A sudden 50% import tax on one of their biggest suppliers is making business much more chaotic, and consumers of all types can expect prices to continue to increase in the months and years to come, Rachel Langer, coffee director at Red Rock Roasters, told Source New Mexico.
“Anybody who’s buying coffee by the pound has definitely already felt this, and they will only feel it more,” she said. “And people who buy coffee by the cup, because the coffee is such a small percentage of the total cost of the beverage, it’s not gonna feel as bad, but they are, in fact, also paying quite a bit more. It’s just, like, a slow drip.”
The 50% tariffs that went into effect on Brazil, which produces about one-third of America’s coffee supply, were just the latest chapter in an unpredictable and expensive few months for Red Rock Roasters, Langer said.
Even though Trump has created and then canceled various tariffs since taking office, Red Rock Roasters has consistently paid the tariffs since April, Langer said. That’s because the contracts she signs with coffee brokers are worked out months before the beans arrive at her roastery, she said.

In May, she presented Luján’s office with a petition she circulated among other New Mexico coffee roasters, calling on Luján to support the Trade Review Act of 2025, which would enable Congress to approve tariff changes. The Republican-controlled Senate has taken no action on the bill since it was referred to the Senate Finance Committee.
The petition said prices of raw goods she and other coffee roasters need were between 25% and 40% higher than last year.
After getting a tour of the coffee roaster, Luján told Source New Mexico that the tariffs across the state are hitting New Mexico businesses hard. Despite Trump’s promises, businesses and consumers are bearing the costs.
Washington’s Cantwell pushes plan to rein in Trump’s tariff power

“Everything that this President is doing is arbitrary. So that’s more uncertainty, more pressure on all these entrepreneurs, all these small businesses across the country,” the New Mexico Democrat said. “I’ve not spoken to one business in New Mexico yet that has told me that they are applauding these tariffs, whether it’s a toy store, restaurants, a manufacturing wholesaler.”
The new tariffs in Brazil will only increase prices on industry already going through hikes that result from crop failures and labor shortages, Langer said. And she said that the purported aim of the tariffs — boosting domestic manufacturing — make little sense for coffee, which can only grow in high elevations near the equator in tropical temperatures.
Coffee grows in Hawaii, but the state produces 5 million pounds annually in a country that imports 3.5 billion pounds each year, the local companies write in the letter.
“There truly is no domestic alternative to importing coffee,” the petition states. Nine coffee companies statewide signed the letter, including NM Piñon Coffee, the state’s biggest coffee company.
“We are, in fact, manufacturers. We are what American manufacturing looks like,” Langer said Tuesday. “It’s not making toothbrushes.”
Langer said she expects the price of a latte to increase by about 50 cents due to the latest round of tariffs. In the next year or two, she predicts that major coffee companies will buy up the stock of coffee from countries with lower tariffs, leaving her roastery and other smaller shops with only the most expensive options.
“We’re going to be stuck with whatever’s left. That’s my main concern,” she said. “We’re already on the backfoot.”

(Photo by Corrine Smith/Alaska Beacon)A long-awaited glacial flood is hitting Alaska’s capital city.
On Tuesday morning, local officials sent warning messages to cellphones across the City and Borough of Juneau, alerting local residents that the Mendenhall Glacier’s ice-dammed lake has burst its barrier and is sending a torrent of water toward homes and businesses in the Mendenhall Valley.
“We are prepared for this situation. We’ve been preparing for this situation,” said Sabrina Grubitz, public safety manager for the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska, and the commander of a unified local government task force responding to the flood.
The flood is expected to peak Wednesday afternoon at 16.6 feet, likely setting a record and surpassing a flood last year that damaged more than 290 homes.
With the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers stating that permanent flood barriers could be years off, local officials have installed semi-permanent HESCO walls in some neighborhoods to avert the worst flooding.
Those barriers have not yet been tested in an actual flood. 
Local officials have asked residents in the affected area to voluntarily evacuate in case the barriers do not perform as intended. 
During a briefing on Tuesday morning, Ryan O’Shaughnessy, director of emergency programs for the City and Borough of Juneau, gestured at maps showing the predicted inundation without the barriers.
“We strongly encourage everyone in the 17-foot inundation layer to evacuate their homes sometime today. There’s no need to rush out of neighborhoods, but we encourage folks to take a moment, take a deep breath, remember that they have a plan. This is something that we’ve been planning for as a community. Grab their go bag, let their family and friends know where they’re going, and then execute that,” he said.
Capital City Fire/Rescue Assistant Chief Sam Russell warned local residents to not stand on the flood barriers and for sightseers to stay away from the area.
Public radio and television station KTOO has set up several live video streams with instant information for people who want to keep an eye on the situation.
“I know everybody wants to see what’s going on, but we have cameras that are posted on the website, and you’ll be able to observe from there other things that are going on,” he said.
An evacuation shelter has been set up at nearby Floyd Dryden school, O’Shaughnessy said, and a non-emergency hotline has been set up for people who need information about shelter, transportation or other things. That number is 907-500-0890. Any road closures can be monitored at 511.alaska.gov.
As of Tuesday afternoon, much of the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area — Alaska’s most-visited tourist attraction — was closed to the public. The glacier’s visitor center remained open, but most trails, including the heavily trafficked Nugget Falls Trail, campground and West Glacier Trail, were closed.
On Monday, Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued a preemptive state disaster declaration “in response to an imminent threat of catastrophic flooding,” to support a coordinated interagency emergency response. “By issuing this declaration before the flood occurs, we can position state resources and personnel in advance to support local and tribal governments in their efforts to protect
lives, homes, and essential services,” Dunleavy said in a statement with the announcement. “Our goal is to act early to reduce impacts and preserve community safety.”
This week’s flood has been anticipated for months. Since 2011, the Mendenhall Glacier has caused floods each summer as Suicide Basin — a glacially locked lake — fills with meltwater and runoff, then bursts from its confines after the water overtops an icy dam.
As more ice melts amid global climate change, the flooding has grown worse. In 2023, the flood eroded the Mendenhall River’s banks, causing homes to collapse. In 2024, the flood was the worst yet.
After that experience, city and local officials mobilized to avoid a repeat, and they’ve been monitoring Suicide Basin closely.
This week’s flood was forecast well in advance, and residents were repeatedly warned ahead of time. On Monday, workers went door to door, distributing almost 900 warning flyers, “and there’s an additional 200 residents that are being contacted this morning directly,” O’Shaughnessy said.
Nicole Ferrin, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service forecast office in Juneau, said officials expect the Mendenhall River “to continue to rise through the next 24 hours, with a crest sometime Wednesday afternoon, around 16.6 feet. But that plus or minus half a foot, so a range of 16.3 to 16.8 is probably more fair.”
That expectation is based on prior experience and computer modeling, and it could be altered by tomorrow morning, she said.
“I should note that we’re already at minor flood stage,” she said Tuesday morning, “and this will be a new record based on all of the information that we have.”

(Courtesy of Governor's Office)The South Dakota Attorney General’s Office said Tuesday that the suspect in the recent seizure of 207 pounds of crystal methamphetamine has been indicted on two state felony counts and could face additional federal charges.
The office also identified the suspect as 42-year-old Alonso Molinacorona and said the arrest occurred Friday night on Interstate 90 in Sturgis, which was during the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.
“Meth of any amount is dangerous, but distribution of meth with a street value of $12 million would have led to grave consequences for our citizens,” Attorney General Marty Jackley said in a news release. “I appreciate the excellent work of the South Dakota Highway Patrol in stopping and arresting this defendant.”
Jackley said a trooper stopped Melinacorona for speeding before discovering the drugs.
The updates from Jackley came one day after Gov. Larry Rhoden announced the arrest and described the suspect as a man who is not a U.S. citizen, but did not disclose the suspect’s name. Rhoden described it as the Highway Patrol’s largest-ever meth seizure.
Jackley’s office listed Molinacorona’s address as Fresno, California, and said he is a Mexican citizen.
According to Jackley, the Meade County grand jury indictment charges Molinacorona with possessing more than 5 grams of meth with intent to distribute, and an alternate count of unauthorized possession of a controlled drug or substance. If convicted of the first count, he would face a mandatory minimum sentence of one year in prison and a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $30,000 fine. The alternate count has a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
Molinacorona made his first appearance in Meade County Court on Monday and pleaded not guilty. He is being held without bond.

Article Summary

U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries made a stop in Springfield one day before keynoting a breakfast with Illinois Democrats.
Jeffries, Sen. Dick Durbin, Rep. Nikki Budzinski and Sen. Tammy Duckworth visited Springfield groups to gather feedback about President Donald Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill.”
Senators believe public pressure and a strong 2026 election by Democrats could force Congress to undo parts of the bill.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – Illinois Democrats brought some of their biggest names to Springfield Tuesday to call attention to the massive cuts that will take effect in the coming years for programs that benefit low-income communities.
At one event, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin and U.S. Rep. Nikki Budzinski hosted the Democratic leader of the U.S. House, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, for a roundtable discussion at a Head Start school to talk about cuts to early childhood education and the food assistance program known as SNAP.
And at a separate event, Durbin joined Sen. Tammy Duckworth at a Springfield hospital to call attention to the impact health care providers will experience from cuts in federal funding for Medicaid.
Those cuts, along with a package of tax cuts, were all included in a massive domestic policy bill that the Trump administration pushed through Congress last month known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
“It’s going to be a tough election for this president because he took the wrong approach when it came to the big and beautiful bill,” Durbin told reporters at the Head Start program. “The American people do not want to see us cut back in the fundamentals in health care, in services of hospitals, to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people.”

Tuesday’s events came as Democrats prepared for the annual Governor’s Day at the Illinois State Fair, an event where they typically showcase their slate of candidates for the next election and try to stir up public enthusiasm for the race.
Jeffries, of New York, stands to become the next speaker of the U.S. House if Democrats win back control of the chamber in 2026. He is scheduled to be the keynote speaker Wednesday morning at a brunch hosted by the Illinois Democratic County Chairs Association.
“On the public scene, the one big, ugly bill, which is now law, is deeply unpopular,” Jeffries said, referring to public opinion polls. “Because the American people don’t like the fact that they’re ripping health care away from millions of people, stealing food from the mouths of children, and all of this is being done to reward their billionaire donors with massive tax breaks while exploding the debt by more than $3 trillion.”
Health care implications
Durbin and Duckworth also met with the leaders of Springfield-area health care providers to seek guidance on the problems they anticipate facing as a result of the bill’s Medicaid cuts, including hospital closures.
“There are places that will not survive,” Durbin said. “We know they will not survive, and the impact it’s going to have on real people, on families and on the economic future of the communities that lose these facilities is going to be felt for a long, long time.”
Hospital leaders said they’re concerned about declining funding, but also patients who lose coverage and delay care, which leads to more expensive care for more serious problems in the future.
More than 330,000 Illinoisians could lose Medicaid coverage as a result of the bill while several hospitals in rural areas face closure, according to the governor’s office.

The senators said they believe congressional Republicans will eventually be pressured into undoing many of the cuts in the bill, but that persuasion will have to come from their constituents. Duckworth suggested every health care office put flyers in the waiting room explaining the impacts of the bill, which she hopes would prompt patients to contact lawmakers.
Durbin said he believes favorable results for Democrats in the 2026 election could make Republicans responsive to concerns about the bill and force Congress to make changes if Democrats control the House.
“I’ve been through a lot of election cycles, and I will tell you, the House members are the most sensitive because many of them haven’t been there that long, and they’re in marginal districts,” Durbin said. “So I think this could turn out to be a movement to change that bill back, and soon.”
Durbin said that even in a scenario with Trump in the White House and Democrats controlling the House, he expects there would be bipartisan negotiations that could undo parts of the bill.

Lundstrum and Clark were the lead sponsors of the 2021 law that was blocked in court before it could go into effect. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)A federal appeals court lifted the injunction on Arkansas’ law banning transgender minors’ health care, clearing the way Tuesday for it to be enforced after four years.
The 8-2 ruling from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came after Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office asked the court last month to take into account the U.S. Supreme Court’s June decision to uphold Tennessee’s similar law. Federal judges previously enjoined both the Tennessee and Arkansas laws.
The Save Adolescents From Experimentation (SAFE) Act, or Act 626 of 2021, banned puberty blockers, hormones and gender-affirming surgeries for Arkansas children with gender dysphoria. Four families of transgender minors challenged the law, and U.S. District Judge James Moody blocked it in July 2021 before it could go into effect.
Several months after an eight-day trial over the law, Moody ruled it was unconstitutional on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds in June 2023.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas represented the plaintiffs in the case. Executive Director Holly Dickson called Tuesday’s ruling “tragically unjust” and the SAFE Act “a dangerous law that harms children” in a news release.
“As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want transgender Arkansans to know they are far from alone and we remain as determined as ever to secure their right to safety, dignity, and equal access to the health care they need,” Dickson said.

Griffin lauded the ruling in his own news release.
“I applaud the court’s decision recognizing that Arkansas has a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological health of children and am pleased that children in Arkansas will be protected from risky, experimental procedures with lifelong consequences,” Griffin said.
 The court’s opinion

After the state appealed Moody’s ruling, the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments in the case last year in St. Louis.
In June, the appeals court asked both sides for supplemental briefs in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on the Tennessee law. The plaintiffs’ brief asked the appeals court to send the case back to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, and Tuesday’s ruling granted this request.
Both sides asked the court for rational-basis review, which means analyzing whether a law is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. The standard is less rigid than strict scrutiny, which analyzes whether a law is narrowly tailored to a governmental interest.
The SAFE Act “prohibits medical care on the basis of sex,” in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Moody wrote in his 80-page ruling. He also wrote that the rational basis test “does not apply when a classification is based upon sex.”
The appeals court disagreed, stating in its 35-page opinion that the SAFE Act “classifies based on age and medical procedure, not sex” and “regulates a class of procedures, not people.”
Moody also ruled that the SAFE Act violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s right to due process because the state did not provide sufficient evidence to support its claim that gender-affirming medical care is unsafe for minors.

USCA-OPINION-081225 
The parent plaintiffs asserted that the law infringed upon their right to make informed decisions about their children’s medical care, but “parents do not have unlimited authority to make medical decisions for their children,” the appeals court stated.
The court also disputed Moody’s claim that the SAFE Act violated the First Amendment right to freedom of speech by prohibiting physicians from referring patients to other health care professionals for gender-affirming care. Moody called this an unconstitutional “content and viewpoint-based regulation.”
U.S. Supreme Court precedent allows states to regulate professional conduct that “incidentally” includes speech, and the law’s use of the word “refer” should be applied narrowly to a formal medical referral rather than the broad interpretation of “merely informing patients about the availability of procedures,” according to the appeals court’s opinion.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 Responses

The appeals court has yet to issue a mandate for the state to enforce the SAFE Act, but Griffin said at a Tuesday press conference that he expects the order within the next couple of weeks.
State Rep. Robin Lundstrum and Sen. Alan Clark, the primary sponsors of the SAFE Act, joined Griffin at the press conference. Lundstrum, an Elm Springs Republican, thanked the conservative Family Council for its support of the SAFE Act, and the organization called Tuesday’s ruling “amazing news” in a news release stating that it expects the law to be enforced.
Lundstrum praised her fellow lawmakers for supporting the law, which had 64 cosponsors in the 135-member Legislature, and for voting to override then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s veto.
“They put their political futures at risk by saying children are more important than politics,” Lundstrum said.
Arkansas was the first state in the U.S. to ban gender-affirming health care for transgender minors, and 26 more states followed suit, including Tennessee. Officials in both states have claimed transgender health care for minors is rooted in activism and experimentation rather than evidence-based science. Lundstrum and Clark, a Lonsdale Republican, repeated these sentiments Tuesday.
Clark cited his experience as a former youth pastor as a reason not to “affirm” gender dysphoria “instead of doing the real psychological work” to determine the root of a child’s dysphoria.
“Teenagers believe one thing one day and one thing the next day,” Clark said.

Lundstrum said she introduced the 2021 legislation after hearing from “grandparents concerned about their grandchildren” and has been asked consistently in the past four years when the law will go into effect.
“The adults are walking back in the room on this issue and saying… ‘We don’t chemically or surgically castrate a child,’” she said.
Two physicians who have treated transgender minors at Arkansas Children’s Hospital are among the plaintiffs challenging the SAFE Act. They testified at trial in 2022 that they do not perform breast or genital surgeries on transgender minors or refer them for such procedures elsewhere.
Arkansas Children’s did not respond to a request for comment about the ruling Tuesday.
One parent of each of the four minor plaintiffs shared their experiences with their children’s gender transitions at the trial. Three of the four minors have since turned 18. The fourth, Brooke Dennis, is 13 years old. The Dennis family has moved from Bentonville to another state in which Brooke’s health care is not in jeopardy, according to court documents.
In 2023, the Legislature passed the Protecting Minors from Medical Malpractice Act, which created a 15-year window for malpractice lawsuits against doctors who provide transgender minors with any of the same treatments the SAFE Act sought to ban. A 2025 law added mental health care professionals to the list of providers that can be sued under the 2023 law.

Yellowstone National Park, one of the biggest drivers of Montana’s thriving tourism sector, is seeing near-record numbers of visitors this year.
Park officials announced Tuesday that Yellowstone had hosted 974,109 recreation visitors in July, down 2% from the same month last year.
But during the first seven months of the year, tourists visiting Yellowstone number 2,666,031, less than 3,000 fewer visitors than the park saw over the same period during 2021, the all-time record year with more than total 4.8 million visits.
Data from earlier this year showed that Yellowstone, and Glacier National Park in northwest Montana, were on pace for record-breaking years.
Through the end of June, the latest report available, Glacier had seen nearly 40,000 more visitors than during its record year of 2017.
The list below shows the year-to-date trend for recreation visits to Yellowstone National Park over the last several years (through July):

(Photo by Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)Backers of Arkansas’ law requiring public display of the Christian commandments asserted Tuesday that the law is constitutional and based on historical tradition rather than religion.
A federal judge in Fayetteville on Aug. 4 temporarily blocked enforcement of Act 573 of 2025 in a lawsuit brought by parents of public schoolchildren in Northwest Arkansas school districts. The ruling affects only Fayetteville, Springdale, Bentonville and Siloam Springs schools.
Pine Bluff schools put up posters of the Decalogue donated by local ministers on Aug. 5, the day the law took effect, The Pine Bluff Commercial reported. The website of RestoreAmericanSchools, a group that supplies Ten Commandment posters for schools, says 288 Arkansas schools have been “adopted” by donors. 
At a press conference in the state Capitol’s Old Supreme Court room Tuesday, the law’s principal sponsors — Sen. Jim Dotson, R-Bentonville, and Rep. Alyssa Brown, R-Heber Springs — told a small gathering that Act 573 remains in effect elsewhere in Arkansas. They and other speakers encouraged people to donate to a campaign to place posters of the Ten Commandments in public schools and buildings.
“You cannot separate the history of our nation and the founding of our laws and justice system from the Ten Commandments,” Brown said. “We stand behind this law and believe it will be upheld in a higher court.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Other speakers Tuesday repeated the message that the Ten Commandments traditionally have been displayed in public spaces and schools and that only since the 1980s have U.S. Supreme Court rulings chipped away at that tradition.
David Barton, a Texas political activist and founder of the conservative Christian organization Wallbuilders, said a 2019 Supreme Court ruling changed the criteria for determining whether Christian symbols and monuments violated the Constitution. In that case, Barton said, the high court shifted to presuming constitutionality if it could be shown to be historical and traditional.
Jeremy Dys, senior counsel with religious freedom legal group First Liberty Institute, also talked about the 2019 high court ruling, saying “the burden of proof now rests” upon those who want to take down public displays of religious symbols to show how the memorials and monuments are “out of step … with American history, with our traditions as a country.”
Dys said the Aug. 4 decision by U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks was “exactly backwards from what the Supreme Court said in the American Legion case.”
Brooks’ ruling noted that Arkansas’ law is “most likely … [a] part of a coordinated strategy among several states to inject Christian religious doctrine into public-school classrooms. These states view the past decade of rulings by the Supreme Court on religious displays in public spaces as a signal that the Court would be open to revisiting its precedent on religious displays in the public-school context.”
But, Brooks said, the Supreme Court 45 years ago struck down a state law nearly identical to Arkansas’ law. That precedent remains binding, he wrote, until the Supreme Court “puts its foot down.”
Education news outlet The 74 reported last month that a data analysis of 28 bills similar to Arkansas’ law “exposes how their language, structure and requirements are inherently identical. In dozens of instances, they match model legislation pitched by Barton verbatim.”
At Tuesday’s press conference, Patriot Mobile CEO Glenn Story presented a framed copy of a Ten Commandments poster to Secretary of State Cole Jester. Patriot Mobile describes itself as a Christian conservative wireless provider and was one of about 20 organizations whose logos were displayed with Ten Commandments posters at the press conference.

Miller,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/08/state-workers-remote-work/,Proponents of remote work for California state employees are celebrating a new state audit that finds having employees work from home could save the state hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate and facilities costs.,"In summary
Proponents of remote work for California state employees are celebrating a new state audit that finds having employees work from home could save the state hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate and facilities costs. 


Gov. Gavin Newsom appears to have arbitrarily ordered workers back to the office without using specific rationale such as data on worker productivity, according to a newly released report from the California state auditor’s office.
The audit, which state legislators requested in May 2024 after the governor first ordered workers back to the office two days per week after they had been sent to work remotely during the COVID-19 lockdown, found that Newsom’s office failed to gather important information about departments’ office space needs and costs and did not use any data about state workers’ productivity to justify its in-office mandate.
Earlier this year, Newsom signed a new executive order that upped the required in-office days from two to four, but he relented in a series of contracts his administration signed with public employee unions. 
State Auditor Grant Parks concluded that California could save as much as $225 million per year and reduce its office space by nearly a third if it sticks to having employees in the office two days a week and working remotely three days a week.
The governor’s office also ignored survey findings from its own oversight agency, the Department of General Services, which had collected estimates from departments on how much office space they would need to bring workers back more often. 
“In general, we determined that a one‑size-fits-all approach to telework is counter to state policy and may limit opportunities for significant cost savings,” Parks wrote.
Supporters of work-from-home cheered the report as further vindication for their claims that Newsom’s return-to-office mandates were capricious, politically motivated decisions rather than a true effort to increase worker productivity. Union leaders say flexible hybrid work policies can simultaneously save the state money and help achieve ambitious climate and emissions goals by reducing commuter traffic. 
“This audit confirms what has been apparent for some time: Flexible telework benefits taxpayers, state government, and state employees,” said Ted Toppin, executive director of the Professional Engineers in California Government, a union representing state engineers, in a statement Tuesday.
The audit recommended that state lawmakers require departments to identify positions that can successfully telework three days a week and offer such an option. It also instructed the state to develop guidance for departments to evaluate the effectiveness of their telework programs.
Tara Gallegos, a spokesperson for Newsom, said in a statement that the governor’s office “respectfully disagrees” with the auditor’s findings, which were based on “hypothetical theories and incomplete information.”
“This audit on state telework is not a scientific study, nor does it paint a complete picture of the state workforce or the benefits of working in person,” Gallegos wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/110722-Secretary-of-State-MG-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-12 18:57:33.752019

Beker Rengifo Del Castillo, 33, is a Venezuelan citizen who was leaving a job near Whitefish Lake on April 24 when Hingiss stopped him, according to the lawsuit, allegedly for a broken brake light. Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection, and Del Castillo was left in the custody of a Customs and Border Protection officer and subsequently taken to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Tacoma, Washington, “a horrific and traumatic experience,” according to court documents.
Whitefish City Attorney Angela Jacobs told the Daily Montanan in an email that the city cannot comment on active litigation.
The lawsuit was filed in federal district court in Missoula. Del Castillo is represented by Upper Seven Law.
In the lawsuit, Del Castillo’s attorneys allege that Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection because Beker “only speaks Spanish” and Border Patrol may “want to check him,” despite Del Castillo providing “proof of his lawful presence in the United States in the form of his valid REAL ID compliant driver’s license.”
According to the complaint, Del Castillo entered the United States in July 2024 through the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela Parole Program. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approved Del Castillo’s application for work authorization on July 23, 2024, and issued him a Social Security number.
Del Castillo was leaving a work site with a coworker, in separate vehicles, this spring when Hingiss followed behind the two cars. According to the complaint, Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection “due to a language barrier,” but then left Del Castillo with a federal officer to “continue” the immigration investigation. The complaint states that the Border Patrol agent noted that Del Castillo may have legal status.
“Del Castillo’s story shows why untrained municipal police should not masquerade as federal immigration cops,” the lawsuit states.
Following his transfer to an ICE detention facility, Del Castillo was held until April 30, and then released with “no place to stay and no way to get home.”
“Because of this incident, (Del Castillo) is reluctant to leave his home and attempts to avoid all contact with law enforcement, fearing he will again be detained and incarcerated based on discrimination and without cause,” the complaint states. “(He) quit his jobs to avoid the risk of being racially profiled and incarcerated without basis while driving to and from work.”
According to the complaint, the Whitefish Police Department has a policy about immigration violations that Hingiss broke while detaining Del Castillo and calling Border Patrol. The policies include prohibiting officers from detaining “any individual, for any length of time, for a civil violation of federal immigration laws or a related civil warrant;” and no one who is “otherwise ready to be released should continue to be detained only because questions about the individual’s status are unresolved.”
The policies, according to the lawsuit, also state that an officer must notify a supervisor when detaining someone for an immigration violation, and seek approval before conducting an arrest for an alleged immigration offense and before transferring an individual to federal immigration authorities.
During a Whitefish City Council meeting in May, Police Chief Kelch told councilors the city had policies that “that strictly prohibit biased-based policing and improper profiling,” according to reporting by the Flathead Beacon. Kelch also stated that “we did not call Border Patrol for interpretation services.”
The lawsuit seeks actual, general and punitive damages and legal costs from the city of Whitefish and the police officers.

They came with promises of transformation: thousands of jobs, surging salaries and a foothold in the booming electric vehicle market.
Imola Automotive USA, a Boca Raton, Florida-based startup, pitched officials in small, struggling towns in Georgia, Oklahoma and Arkansas on a bold vision. The company planned to build six EV plants, create 45,000 jobs —  and help these impoverished communities secure a place in America’s green future.
But more than 18 months later, the company hasn’t broken ground on a single site. And its top executive — whose background is in television and athletic shoes, not automotive manufacturing — has gone silent.
A Floodlight investigation did not uncover lost taxpayer money in Fort Valley, Georgia; Langston, Oklahoma; or Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where Imola has sought free land, municipal financing and other incentives for its shifting proposals. 
But an economic development watchdog said the episode illustrates how the frenzy to land electric vehicle jobs can leave economically distressed towns vulnerable to empty promises. 
Imola CEO Rodney Henry declined requests for an interview. He responded to Floodlight’s inquiries with a short statement, insisting the company had not given up on its plans, which have included a partnership with an Italian manufacturer of two-seat electric vehicles. 
“Our timetable has been modified due to matters outside of our control,” Henry said in a statement. “We are highly focused on bringing our goals into alignment. Due to proprietary consideration as well as NDA (nondisclosure) agreements, we are not at liberty to discuss specifics at this juncture.”
That’s a stark shift from the company’s earlier promises. In a press release issued in January 2024, Henry claimed the company had already secured land in multiple states to build half a dozen plants and create tens of thousands of jobs. 
Could someone with no experience in car manufacturing really deliver that?
“It’s ludicrous,” said Greg LeRoy, CEO of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks and analyzes economic development projects. 
Building large auto plants, he said, requires “a great deal of capital, a great deal of management skill, a great deal of engineering and marketing chops. And obviously, Tesla developed those, but they didn’t do it overnight, right?”
Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff weren’t the only towns swept up in the competition to attract electric vehicle plants. Spurred by federal policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, which unlocked billions in private investment and expanded government incentives, local officials across the country scrambled to land high-paying manufacturing jobs and a slice of the booming clean energy economy.
Since the IRA passed in 2022, more than 150 EV plants have been announced in the United States, according to E2, a nonpartisan group of business leaders who advocate for economic development good for the environment.
But that rush may be grinding to a halt. The recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which rolls back many federal tax credits and incentives for electric vehicles, is already throwing the EV sector into turmoil — threatening to stall or shrink the kinds of ambitious projects towns like Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff were counting on. E2 reports that plans for 14 EV-related plants have been canceled this year.
Bold promises, then silence
In three towns where Imola pledged massive investment, there’s no sign of construction and little more than confusion.
Langston — a town of 1,600 where more than 35% of residents live in poverty — never saw Imola’s plans take shape.
A 2023 letter to the city council from former Imola chief operating officer Eric Pettus stated that the company had run into “multiple obstacles,” including trouble acquiring enough land.
“In order for us to continue moving forward on the project we are requesting that the City of Langston convey to us any and all vacant properties owned by the city,” Pettus wrote.
Langston City Council member Magnus Scott said the company also asked the town to issue municipal bonds to help them build their plant. 
But before any land changed hands or bonds were issued, a company representative delivered unexpected news: The deal had been canceled. “I guess maybe they ran into financial problems,” Scott said.
Reached by phone, Pettus, of south Florida, said he’s no longer employed by Imola but instead works as a consultant for the company. Citing a nondisclosure agreement, he declined to discuss Imola’s plans.
Fort Valley gave its backing in early 2024 to Imola’s ambitious plan to build an EV plant that would employ 7,500 workers. 
A year later, with no sign of progress on the plant, the company came back to the Georgia town with an entirely different proposal. This time, instead of building an EV plant, they pitched a high-tech lighting system for the town. 
One city council member balked.
“You want us to sign an agreement for 99 years before you bring us the car company,” said council member Laronda Eason, according to minutes of the March 2025 meeting. “It feels like a bait and switch.” 
Eason did not respond to emails and text messages seeking comment on the Imola proposal.
In Pine Bluff, where per capita income last year was just over $21,000, city officials were initially all in. Writing to Henry in August 2024, then-Mayor Shirley Washington said the city of 39,000 stood ready to buy land, build infrastructure and issue industrial revenue bonds to support Imola’s vision. 
“With an anticipated employment base of more than 8,000 jobs,” Washington wrote, “we firmly believe this investment will marshal a pivotal turning point in our community.” 
But a year later, the project hasn’t moved. “We never did get off the ground with that,” Washington said in a brief phone interview.
LeRoy said Imola’s pitch fits a troubling pattern.
“It grabs me as an example of how the craze among governors and mayors to get the next big thing has caused some sloppy vetting,” he said of the struggling communities courted by Imola. 
Such towns, he said, are “easy prey. …They’re desperate.”
Grand vision, missing details
Henry, who lives in Florida, touts a background as a longtime TV executive producer and the founder of Protégé, an athletic footwear brand. He claims on his IMDB profile that Protégé donated a million pairs of shoes to African nations.
But despite announcements of partnerships and promises of good-paying jobs, his EV company has yet to show any tangible progress. 
Floodlight found the website for Imola — named after the Italian city where Tazzari EVs are made — is no longer accessible without a password. A search of the Tazzari website found no mention of plants in the United States. But a 2024 version of the Imola site mentions the tiny vehicles “coming soon to America.”
In early 2024, Imola Automotive USA and the Tazzari Group — an Italian firm best known for its electric two-seater micro cars — jointly announced plans for a partnership. 
The EVs that Tazzari makes in Italy aren’t designed for highway driving. Top speed on the company’s Opensky Sport model is about 56 miles per hour, while maximum speed on the Opensky Limited is about 37 mph, according to the company’s webpage.
Tazzari didn’t respond to email messages from a Floodlight reporter.
Henry said at that time that the company chose Langston and Fort Valley because of their universities. 
“Both of these locations are ideal,” he said in the January 2024 news release, “as their proximity to communities with institutions of higher learning, will allow residents and students career opportunities in the fast growing EV Technology and Innovation Industry.” 
Many local officials in Fort Valley, Langston and Pine Bluff did not respond to interview requests. Few documents were provided in response to Floodlight’s public records requests.
But it’s clear from available records that Imola’s promises stirred hope. 
Langston Mayor Michael Boyles called the proposal “transformative” in a January 2024 news release.
But some local leaders soon began to question the details.
Erica Johnson, a real estate agent and former member of Langston’s economic development commission, said parts of the plan didn’t add up. How, for instance, would the company house more than 1,000 workers in such a small town? And how were they going to build such a large plant on land without utilities or water?
Her doubts deepened when she learned that Imola wanted to lock down land agreements without putting up any earnest money.
“My early feeling was that, ‘Something is not quite okay with this,’ ” she said. “But I think the hope for our community kind of outweighed the ability to just take things slow and look at them for where they are and what they are — versus where you hope them to be.”
Eventually, the promise fizzled. 
“It was disappointing,” Johnson said. “…We could have had our energy and time focused on something that seemed more valid and more substantial.”
Still waiting for the shovels
Some residents in Fort Valley are still holding out hope.
Mayor Jeffery Lundy said early last year that it was a “priority for my administration to land a company like Imola Automotive USA.” Local officials, he said, were looking forward to the economic boost the plant would bring.
At the time, Imola claimed it would break ground on a 195-acre site by the third quarter of 2024 and open the plant within 20 months, according to a report in the Macon Telegraph. 
During a February 2024 town hall meeting, Imola officials told residents that the plant would pay employees an average of $45 an hour, according to a Facebook post. Commenters buzzed with excitement, with one writing: “Application me !!!!” 
Pettus told a local TV station that most jobs would require only a high school diploma.
In early 2024, Fort Valley rezoned land to accommodate the plant, and the city council signed off on the deal. But more than 15 months later, there’s still no sign of construction. 
Council members were told that Georgia Power couldn’t provide sufficient power for the EV company, according to minutes of their March 2025 meeting. A spokesman for Georgia Power said that while the utility doesn’t discuss economic development projects, “We’re prepared and ready to meet the energy needs of any new customer.” 
Makita Driver, one of the Facebook commenters who’d voiced excitement about the proposed EV plant, said there’s no doubt she would have applied for one of the jobs there — had the facility ever been built.
“The pay rate was really what got my attention,” she said.
As a medical assistant, Driver said she earns far less than what Imola had promised. But she eventually concluded the promises were too good to be true.
“Who really makes that kind of money starting out?” she asked.
In a brief interview with Floodlight on July 11, Mayor Lundy said he’s still in contact with Henry.
“We are patiently waiting for that groundbreaking,” Lundy said.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — When South Dakota Republican John Thune delivered his first remarks as U.S. Senate majority leader in January, he pledged to restore “regular order” to the chamber, including “bringing appropriations bills to the floor for serious deliberation.”
Tuesday, he said a stopgap spending bill will likely need to be negotiated with Democrats to avoid a government shutdown in October.
Congress didn’t finish its 12 annual spending bills before its August recess and would have to sprint to approve them by Oct. 1, which is the deadline to avoid a shutdown.
“We’re going to have a big fight at the end of September,” Thune told an audience at the Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce Inside Washington luncheon.
He told reporters after the meeting that he hopes the spending extension would be for a short amount of time if Democrats don’t “work with us in a constructive way” through the traditional appropriations process.

In May, President Donald Trump released a budget request proposing $163 billion in spending cuts. Thune said the appropriations process would allow individual programs to be reviewed by members of Congress and potentially saved from cuts if “appropriators believe that they’re getting a good return for the American taxpayer.”
“I think that it’s in everybody’s best interests if the Appropriations Committee is able to do its work and then Congress, the House and Senate, pass appropriations bills and put them on the president’s desk for him to sign into law,” Thune said.
Thune also addressed Trump’s imposition of higher tariffs. Before last year’s presidential election, Thune criticized tariff proposals like Trump’s as “a recipe for increased inflation.” Tuesday, he offered a different take, referencing trade deals that have resulted from tariff negotiations.
“I do think that the ways in which they are using them, in my view, at least right now is yielding some results,” Thune said of the White House’s strategy. 
Afterward, Thune took questions from reporters on topics including immigration.
Lack of action on immigration is ‘holding SD back,’ dairy farmers say

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law last month provides $170 billion for immigration- and border-enforcement activities. Thune said the spending helps pay for “everything we need to keep the border secure and ensure we have an orderly way of processing people who are coming into the country, whether it’s for refugee status or otherwise.”
The next step, Thune said, should be to address workforce shortages with legal immigration policies. Thune said “it’d be nice” if Congress passed legislation so polices don’t change “from one administration to the next.” 
South Dakota relies on immigrants, especially in agriculture and tourism. Growing workforce needs will force the immigration issue “to be front and center,” he added.
“It’s an economic issue because of the impact that it has,” Thune said. “If you can’t find workers in our economy, that’s a big problem.”

Two Washington agencies are proposing to dial the oil spill prevention rules for tankers and tank barges up a notch in the busy waterways between Skagit, Whatcom and San Juan counties. Even with the survival of the region’s iconic killer whales as a motivating force, the push is not exactly smooth sailing.
In recent weeks, the U.S. Coast Guard took issue with the state’s plans to expand a requirement for small to medium-sized tankers and towed barges to have tug escorts when underway with loads of oil or refined fuels. Simultaneously, multiple environmental groups and tribes are pressing the state to proceed with the rulemaking to further protect endangered orcas and the marine environment.
In a letter addressed to the state Department of Ecology and Board of Pilotage Commissioners, the Coast Guard Northwest District reasoned that an expanded tug escort requirement would increase vessel traffic unnecessarily.
“The overall reduction in oil spill incidents is negligible while significantly increasing vessel traffic in Puget Sound and adjacent waters,” wrote Captain Darwin Jensen, chief of prevention for the Coast Guard district office in Seattle. “More collisions and spills could result due to increased vessel traffic and risks to safety of navigation in congested waterways.”
More tugs traveling to and fro present an “incremental” risk that shouldn’t be discounted, but which is outweighed by the protection the tugs provide to prevent a potentially catastrophic oil spill, countered Fred Felleman, Northwest consultant to the group Friends of the Earth.
“Washington state’s admirable oil spill record is not because we’ve rested on our laurels,” Felleman said in an interview. “We’re committed to continuous improvement that has to be responsive to changes in the maritime trade – more petroleum products that are moving across the water in smaller vessels.”
The Washington Legislature tasked the pilotage board, in consultation with Ecology, to periodically review the tug escort requirement in question. That is why this debate is happening now. The tug requirement for this class of tank vessels first took effect in 2020.

Ecology estimated that tugboat companies get about 800 escort jobs per year in the Rosario Strait region due to the existing requirement. The oil tankers and towed barges targeted by these state rules are most commonly hauling refined products produced in northwest Washington – such as diesel, gasoline, jet fuel or heavy fuel oil – to customers near and far. Some crude oil also travels by barge from British Columbia via Rosario Strait to the U.S. Oil refinery in Tacoma, or less commonly to Anacortes.
The targeted class of vessels doesn’t look small when you stand close. They can exceed 600 feet long. The class – defined as 5,000-40,000 dwt, to be precise – includes an increasingly popular, efficient-to-operate type of tank vessel called an ATB, short for articulated tug barge.
The current rulemaking does not affect larger oil tankers used to import crude oil to the Pacific Northwest from Alaska and overseas. State law has long required those large oil tankers to have a tug escort to all destinations in Puget Sound when loaded.
Friends of the San Juans Marine Protection and Policy Director Lovel Pratt explained the beauty of a tug escort is that the tug can quickly assist to prevent a collision or grounding if an oil-laden vessel loses propulsion or steering.
“This is so important to prevent accidents and oil spills. If the tanker is at risk of getting into an accident, there is a tug there to help,” Pratt said.

Between 2017 and 2023, Ecology reported a handful of propulsion loss incidents and one minor collision between an oil barge and a bridge in north Puget Sound, where the agency determined an escort tug might have been helpful. None of those past incidents resulted in much, if any, oil spilling into the water.
The touchstone oil spills in Washington waters that inspired modern tanker regulations are now decades in the past. The Arco Anchorage, carrying Alaskan crude oil, ran aground in 1985 as it entered Port Angeles Harbor, spilling 239,000 gallons, which oiled several thousand seabirds. In 1988, the fuel barge Nestucca separated from its tug in heavy seas and spilled 231,000 gallons of bunker fuel along the Olympic Coast.
State regulators determined during an economic analysis that the ramped-up oil spill prevention measures would add cost to oil shippers by requiring more tug escort time. Foss Maritime’s published rates for tug escort services in north Puget Sound begin at $4,495 per hour before fuel surcharges, which easily add another $1,000 or more per hour.
The tug and barge trade association and the oil industry opposed the introduction of the Rosario Strait escort requirement back in 2019 when it first won legislative approval. This year’s proposed expansion and reaffirmation of the rules is drawing a more muted response. The American Waterways Operators and Western States Petroleum Association submitted public comments that mainly critiqued technical aspects of the Ecology Department’s risk modeling.
Tribes along the Salish Sea also appear keenly interested in what happens next. The Lummi and Swinomish tribes have long raised concerns about interference to their fishing and harvesting rights from increased vessel traffic. They renewed those concerns in letters to the pilotage board last month while also offering support for the oil spill prevention measures.
Comments submitted by the Port Gamble S’Klallam and Makah tribes dwelled on the balancing act the state must navigate between the benefits and impacts of more tug activity on the water.
Makah Tribal Chairman Timothy Greene Sr. called out the potentially harmful impacts to endangered killer whales from underwater noise generated by escort tugs. Tugboat operators themselves previously questioned whether increased underway time could be counterproductive to the state’s goals of reducing threats to the cherished resident orcas.
Pratt from Friends of the San Juans said tug escort operators could take mitigation measures to reduce underwater noise, such as going slower and maintaining a wide standoff distance when whales are present. Greene favored that approach as well and concluded that the Makah would ultimately support the state’s proposed expansion in the protection standard against oil spills, even if it only makes a marginal difference.  
“The Makah Tribal Council views the threat of oil pollution to Southern Resident killer whales (and other Makah cultural and natural resources) as a more significant threat than underwater noise, with longer-lasting and potentially more widespread impacts,” Greene wrote in his public comment.
Rosario Strait is a major route for tankers and towed barges headed to and from the oil refineries near Anacortes and Ferndale. The proposal in front of the state panel would reaffirm the existing tug escort mandate and extend the coverage zone toward Patos Island where the Strait of Georgia comes down to meet Rosario Strait. That would increase the zone’s size by about 11% to the north-northwest.
The pilotage board is also considering whether to require tank vessel captains and their tug escort to hold a short pre-escort safety conference before getting underway.
The commissioners have before them the staff’s “preferred alternative” to renew and expand the tug escort requirement. But the nine commissioners also can consider multiple alternatives that underwent environmental vetting. Those include scaling back or completely rescinding the tug escort rules for the small-to-medium class of oil tankers and towed barges, though the latter seems unlikely.
Board of Pilotage Commissioners Executive Director Jaimie Bever said her agency would ask for a meeting with the Coast Guard to get clarification of the federal concerns. Jensen said that the Coast Guard is comfortable with maintaining the existing regulatory regime.

OPI Superintendent Susie Hedalen said Tuesday she wants to ensure taxpayers aren’t funding empty buildings and teachers and parents are getting help when they reach out to the agency.
“Every day, Montana’s teachers show up, get dressed and serve Montana students. So should we,” Hedalen said in a prepared statement. “Public service at the expense of our taxpayers isn’t a come-and-go-as-you-please commitment — and our buildings shouldn’t be expensive storage units.”
  Susie Hedalen is sworn in as Montana Superintendent of Public Instruction at the Montana State Capitol on Jan. 6, 2025. (Micah Drew/Daily Montanan).
Hedalen took the helm in January 2025 of an agency challenged with high turnover and one that had caused confusion in its dealings with schools and frustration among legislators.
The agency also faced a projected $772,300 budget deficit when Hedalen took the helm, chief of staff Dylan Klapmeier said in an email. He said Hedalen closed the deficit by the end of June.
He said she shored up the budget by operating “a bare bones executive office,” leaving vacancies open until the end of the fiscal year, and looking for duplicative or unnecessary services, subscriptions and contracts.
He said she saved “tens of thousands of dollars” in duplicative contracts, subscriptions and unused services, and likely saved hundreds of thousands in unnecessary future expenditures.
But OPI also pays $1.3 million a year in rent to the state of Montana for two buildings in Helena — not including utilities and maintenance — and Hedalen said she doesn’t want the agency to waste taxpayer money.
She said a majority of the 200 employees who work for OPI are based in Helena. Roughly 70% of the employees have telework agreements, which will be reviewed as part of the audit, according to OPI.
In an interview with the Daily Montanan, Hedalen said the effort she is launching is key to protecting tax dollars, being responsive to customers and helping students learn.
“We have a lot of work to do to increase our student outcomes, and I think this is a critical step to make sure that we’re all collaborating, we’re on the same page, and we’re doing our best to support our schools and our administrators and educators,” Hedalen said.
She anticipates the transition and review will take a couple of months, and it will comprise the following:

Inventory of every workstation at both OPI buildings,
Review of telework agreements and job classifications,
Assessment of space needs outside Helena,
Audit of equipment, tech and furniture, and
Evaluation of public availability and responsiveness.

Many employees including state workers started working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. But Hedalen said other state agencies already undertook efforts to transition back to office work, and it’s time for staff at OPI to do the same.
She said the shift will come with flexibility because not all jobs are the same.
For example, some OPI employees work on the Hi-Line to directly support a school, she said, and remote work makes sense in those cases.
In another change, she said some employees used to bill hundreds of dollars a month in mileage, but it’s less expensive to use the state motor pool.
Klapmeier said OPI had been paying “high mileage” instead of “standard” to employees but without following parameters for those reimbursements laid out in state statute.
Generally, if a motor pool car is available, but an employee requests mileage reimbursement anyway, they receive it at 48.15% of the federal rate, versus at 100% if a state car is not available.
He said OPI paid roughly $80,000 in personal vehicle reimbursements last fiscal year — even after OPI started following the law when Hedalen took over in January. He said projected costs had been even higher.
“We are now exploring rental vehicle and motorpool lease options and applying standard mileage reimbursement where appropriate instead of high mileage,” Klapmeier said.
Hedalen said in addition to her interest in saving dollars, the recent initiative comes partly due to complaints she heard about a lack of response from OPI to the public and those it serves.
Hedalen said customer service — to school administrators, parents and taxpayers — is one of her priorities.
Employees learned about the effort on Monday, Hedalen said, and some who already work in the office are eager to have more peers in their midst for collaboration.
“They feel like they could get a lot more accomplished if their colleagues were here on a daily basis,” Hedalen said.
She said the initiative mirrors similar efforts to scrutinize spending by fellow Republican leaders Gov. Greg Gianforte and President Donald Trump.
A letter Monday from Hedalen to the OPI team said coming out of the pandemic in 2021, the Department of Administration launched the Remote & Office Workplace Study.
She said it was a data-driven study on the state’s real estate inventory and best practices for workstation locations by job types — similar to an effort by the federal government.
“Up to this point, OPI has not participated in a ROWS-type study to ensure that our workstations reflect best practices for optimal work performance,” Hedalen wrote. “I have reached out to the Department of Administration, and they have been willing to share their work products from ROWS to assist OPI as we conduct this work at our agency.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Education-stock.jpg,,,2025-08-12 18:57:33.752019

“We’re all feeling it,” the founder of a Vermont mRNA manufacturer said of federal cuts.

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced last week that his department would slash about $500 million in mRNA vaccine contracts, a hit to an industry already reeling from other public funding cuts. 
Those impacts are being felt in Vermont, experts say. 
Kennedy and other vaccine skeptics in President Donald Trump’s administration have espoused distrust of mRNA technology. But experts say the criticism is by and large inaccurate and the vaccines are safe and effective, having saved millions of lives during the Covid-19 pandemic.  
“We are now at a point where the most efficacious of technologies, because it’s new, is causing fear, and that fear has found a political outlet,” said Dev Majumdar, an immunologist at the University of Vermont’s Larner College of Medicine who focuses on RNA biology. “There’s no question that mRNA vaccines work.”
When used in vaccines, messenger RNA, known as mRNA, teach cells to create a protein or parts of protein that lead to an immune response, helping protect a person against a disease. Scientists can use the mRNA platform to develop vaccines more quickly, and the method is an alternative to other forms of vaccines, like those that include a weakened form of a pathogen.
The Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech used mRNA. Moderna has also developed an mRNA vaccine targeting Respiratory Syncytial Virus, known as RSV. 
Majumdar, who leads a UVM RNA lab, said scientists should continually prioritize how they talk to the public about vaccines and pandemic preparedness. It’s OK for scientists to acknowledge when past work has failed, he argued, and there should be no shame in celebrating successes.

“The public is a part of the process, and we have to constantly try to do better to bring the public in,” Majumdar said. 
In Vermont, the national debate and federal cuts to vaccine research is having an impact on a significant player in the mRNA manufacturing field.
Vernal Biosciences in Colchester manufactures mRNA — for research and clinical trials — as well as lipid nanoparticles, which help mRNA achieve scientists’ intended uses. With additional investment in recent years, the company has been able to follow stricter federal guidelines with the goal of expanding its client base.
Billions of dollars in cuts to public financing of research from the likes of the National Institutes of Health have hit the mRNA field hard, said Christian Cobaugh, Vernal’s founder and chief scientific officer. Plus, the industry, which boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic, was flooded with new players, and demand has since dropped.

“We’re all feeling it,” Cobaugh said. “It just takes more money out of the total pool.”
When it comes to the impact of reduced public investment, Cobaugh said it ranges from the “specific” to “wait and see.” Cuts to National Institutes of Health grants led Vernal to stop some work mid-contract, he said, in the short-term costing the company in the six figures with a long-term impact in the seven figures. 
In addition to infectious disease vaccines, mRNA use has shown promise in treating cancer and in gene editing therapies. So far, the latter two applications have not been as targeted by federal funding cuts. 
The most recent Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority mRNA vaccine contract clawbacks mainly impact research and development into infectious diseases, according to Cobaugh. That’s a field central to pandemic preparedness, one that’s long relied on public funding.

“We will be less prepared” for the next pandemic, he said. “I don’t want people to be scared that we’re not going to be ready for this. We’re just not going to be as ready as we could be.”
As for the future of mRNA vaccines in a landscape marred by skeptics, Cobaugh said he believes opposition to the technology is fringe. 
“What we’re dealing with here is a fundamental loss in critical thinking skills,” he said. “If people continue to outsource their decisions to politicians of all stripes, we’re going to continue to struggle with technology and where it should fit into our lives.”
Majumdar fears cuts to vaccine research may harm the industry in ways that won’t become fully clear for a decade or more. 
“It’s hurt morale a lot among the people who spend 60 to 80 hours per week working on these things,” he said. “I really, really worry that we’re looking at the precipice of a lost generation of young people that really wanted to go into this, that wanted to cure cancer and fight disease.”

Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson, alleges former Democratic state Rep. Jason Probst from Hutchinson engaged in a personal attack of him during the Kansas State Fair during a charitable event featuring the State Fair Foundation. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Rep. Kyler Sweely and former Rep. Jason Probst added a chapter to their political feud Tuesday by offering different interpretations of a verbal exchange that transpired at a charitable event for the Kansas State Fair.
The new dispute between the two men, whose legislative race was decided by 294 votes last November, involves the governor’s office, the Kansas Republican Party and an accusation that Probst made unspecified “homophobic remarks.” Probst said the accusation was a gross exaggeration.
The Kansas Republican Party released on Sweely’s behalf a letter Sweely sent to Gov. Laura Kelly alleging, without audio or visual evidence, that Probst made “homophobic remarks” during a short exchange with Sweely during the Boots and Bling event Saturday at the fairgrounds in Hutchinson. The Democratic governor appointed Probst to the State Fair Board about one month ago.
“His repeated conduct raises serious concerns about his fitness to serve in any official role representing the state of Kansas,” Sweely’s letter said. “I call on Governor Kelly to take this matter seriously. The people of the state should expect nothing less.”
In an interview, Sweely said he had a previous personal encounter with Probst that resembled the clash at the state fair foundation event.
Olivia Taylor-Puckett, a spokesperson for Kelly, said “the governor’s office is looking into the matter.”
Rob Fillion, executive director of the Kansas Republican Party, said Kelly should request Probst’s resignation from the State Fair Board.
“For a Governor Kelly appointee to make homophobic slurs to a state legislator at a public event is a disgrace,” he said.

‘Grossly exaggerating’
Probst, a Democrat who represented Hutchinson from 2017 until replaced by Sweely in January, said Sweely didn’t accurately portray their interaction at the state fair fundraiser attended by hundreds of people.
Probst said in a statement that Sweely was “doing all he can to deflect from his history of abuse and dishonesty.”
“If his feelings get hurt so easily, perhaps public service isn’t for him,” Probst said. “He is grossly exaggerating the exchange, which isn’t surprising coming from someone who can’t even be honest about something as simple as his address.”
Sweely’s letter to the governor’s office characterized the conduct of Probst approximately three hours into the event as “deeply troubling.” In the one-page letter, Sweely alleged Probst showed signs of being “visibly intoxicated.” Sweely said Probst approached him and “engaged in highly inappropriate behavior.”
“In full view of numerous attendees, including elected officials and local leaders, Mr. Probst made disturbing sexual comments, directed homophobic remarks at me and had to be physically restrained by friends due to escalating and aggressive behavior,” Sweely’s letter said.
Sweely said that regardless of political affiliation, such behavior was “disgraceful, unacceptable and damaging to the reputation of the fair board and the state of Kansas.”
 
The history
During the 2024 campaign for the Kansas House seat, Probst portrayed Sweely as someone not legitimately from Reno County. Probst said Sweely had engaged in “district shopping” to find a House seat in which a Republican could be competitive.
Several Republicans in Reno County asserted Sweely didn’t live at the residence where he signed a lease before filing as a House candidate.
Before ballots were counted in November giving Sweely a nearly 300-vote margin of victory, videos surfaced showing Sweely holding a pillow to the head of a woman lying motionless on a bed. The video was thought to have been taken during 2023 at a Wichita apartment. The video included an appearance by Rep. Avery Anderson, a Republican who serves a Newton district.
The Wichita Police Department investigated the images before they appeared online. The woman in the footage told investigators that she didn’t consider herself the victim of a crime.
Meanwhile, in February during a House floor debate, now-former Rep. Patrick Penn, R-Wichita, posed a hypothetical question to Sweely about ordering the shooting of “that guy from Hutch,” a reference to a moniker Probst adopted for himself. Their back-and-forth was part of a House hazing ritual in which freshmen representatives undergo questioning by a colleague. This verbal targeting of a peer reflected the U.S. Army service of Penn and Sweely.
In response to the remarks by Penn and Sweely, House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard issued a statement denouncing “use of inflammatory rhetoric that incites violence in any form.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100269-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-12 18:57:33.752019

Mike Simpson is pushing for $12 million in federal funding to help pay for a terminal expansion at the Idaho Falls Regional Airport.

In an announcement issued Monday, Simpson said he requested $12 million through Community Project Funding in the Fiscal Year 2026 Transportation, Housing, Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.
“As Idaho Falls continues to grow, it is essential that the airport grows with it,” Simpson said in a written statement issued Monday. “Expanding the Idaho Falls Regional Airport will better serve the Idaho Falls community, support local jobs and enhance the city’s status as a top destination for travelers and economic opportunities. I have been a steadfast supporter of our local airports, and I am pleased that this funding will facilitate these necessary improvements.”
The $12 million would be for one phase of a larger $60 million airport expansion project, said Idaho Falls Regional Airport Director Ian Turner.
The bottom line, Turner said, is the terminal has outgrown its design in almost every area. 
Since 2018, the number of passengers has grown by about 75%, he said. 
The area behind the ticket counter where checked bags are processed has been hit particularly hard. As a result, improving how checked bags are processed will be a priority during the expansion project, Turner said. 
“Growth here in east Idaho is continuing and putting pretty considerable constraints on the terminal building,” Turner said in a phone interview Tuesday.
Idaho Falls Regional Airport is the state’s second busiest airport, behind Boise Airport. In 2024, 307,942 passengers departed Idaho Falls Regional Airport and 302,699 passengers arrived at the Idaho Fall airport. 
 How would the federal funding be used to expand the Idaho Falls airport?

The airport expansion plan calls for adding space for baggage screening, adding additional office space, adding counter and ticketing space and adding space for equipment to move around. 
The expansion also calls for adding space on the second floor to add more gates when the time comes.
Over the last several years, the use and demographics at the Idaho Falls Regional Airport have changed significantly, Turner said.

Before the airport experienced rapid growth, it served a lot of business travelers. People from eastern Idaho leaving for business meetings or other trips and then coming home was a big part of the market. 
Now, Turner said recreation and tourism are drawing more people into Idaho Falls Regional Airport as they seek out national parks, skiing and other outdoor recreational activities nearby.
“The airport provides an important service to all of east Idaho, and for us to be able to continue to grow, offer new destinations to thousands of travelers and meet the community’s needs, this is a step in the right direction,” Turner said. 
Turner said he is grateful for the support of Simpson, local elected officials, the state and the Federal Aviation Administration. Without those partners, Turner said expanding the airport would not be possible.
The House Committee on Appropriations, which Simpson is a member of, approved the budget measure last month but the full U.S. House of Representatives has not yet voted on the proposal.
Congress is in recess now, and Turner said airport and city officials will wait for Congress to act before moving forward. 
“This is all up in the air until Congress passes a transportation, housing and urban development bill,” Turner said.

Article Summary

Police departments will be required to request detailed background history from past employers, who will be mandated to provide it.
The measure signed by Gov. JB Pritzker is in honor of Sonya Massey, a woman shot to death in her kitchen by a Sangamon County deputy in July 2024.
The deputy accused of murdering Massey pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to stand trial in October.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – Police agencies in Illinois will soon be required to do more thorough background checks on prospective officers.
The measure signed by Gov. JB Pritzker Tuesday came in response to the July 2024 shooting death of Sonya Massey in Sangamon County by a sheriff’s deputy. Massey had called police to report a prowler and was in her home when she was shot to death by Deputy Sean Grayson while removing a pot of boiling water from the stove, with permission.
The signing came at the governor’s Capitol office, where he was flanked by members of Massey’s family, including daughter Jeanette “Summer” Massey, son Malachi Hill-Massey and mom Donna Massey, among others.

“I just want to say I miss my mom every day – like every day. And it hurts that she’s not here with me,” Massey’s son, Hill-Massey said at a news conference. “But I am very happy that we could also get a bill put in her name and her name could live on for forever.”
The shooting
Body camera video of Massey’s shooting showed Grayson moving toward Massey and threatening to shoot her in the face after she said, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.” She was holding the pot of water after deputies gave her permission to move it.
Shortly after the shooting, the video showed an officer asking Grayson if he was ok.
“Yeah, I’m ok. This f—ing b—h is crazy,” he responded. He told other officers at the scene, “She set it up on purpose, so it is what it is,” later adding he “didn’t have a choice.”
Grayson was fired from the sheriff’s office after the shooting. He pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder charges and is scheduled for trial in Peoria in October.
Sen. Doris Turner, D-Springfield, sponsored Senate Bill 1953, which requires the hiring department to obtain and review a person’s extensive background before making a job offer.
Turner said she’s a neighbor of the Massey family and Sonya visited her home a week before she was killed. Sponsoring the bill was the “least political thing” she’s done in her 25 years of elected office, she said.
“With Gov. Pritzker’s signature on this legislation today, I feel confident that going forward and over time, our communities and law enforcement will have built a trusting relationship, and I will have kept my promise to my childhood friends and Sonya’s mother,” Turner said.
Grayson’s record
Grayson’s employment record came under scrutiny after the shooting, including that he had worked for six departments in four years and had two convictions for driving under the influence.
Capitol News Illinois reporting at the time revealed that Grayson had a history of reprimands and disobeying superiors at departments that previously employed him.
Grayson’s file from the Logan County Sheriff’s Office showed he continued a high-speed pursuit of a traffic offender even after his supervisor ordered him to terminate it, a woman filed a complaint claiming Grayson tried to watch as she was strip searched, and her fiancé, who was in Logan County jail, claimed Grayson questioned him in front of other inmates as retaliation for his girlfriend’s complaint.
He was not fired from the department. Internal investigations were closed when he resigned in April 2023 before starting at Sangamon County in May 2023.
It’s unclear whether Sangamon County obtained full personnel records from Grayson’s former employers or interviewed his superiors prior to hiring him.
“I believe that Senate Bill 1953 goes a long way to prevent individuals with backgrounds such as Sean Grayson from ever becoming associated with law enforcement,” Turner said.
The new law
Under the new law, a police department or sheriff’s office making a hire would be required to request employment personnel files from the applicant’s previous employers, including other law enforcement agencies. The previous employer would be required to share the information within 14 days.
Law enforcement applicants would be required to sign a document authorizing the release of information, including military service records, police discipline databases, employment and criminal history, driving records, academic credentials, a credit check, and more.

Information provided is to be unredacted, except for data such as financial information and social security numbers. If the former employer denies a request, the prospective employer may ask a court to intervene and could be reimbursed for associated fees and costs.
The law specifically states that if an existing collective bargaining agreement conflicts with the law, the law will not supersede it. But once the law takes effect, no expiring collective bargaining agreement can be extended in a form that contradicts the law.
It also exempts any information if a state’s attorney in the county where the applicant was previously employed provides a written directive stating the previous employer is not legally authorized to provide it.
The measure takes effect Jan. 1, 2026. It passed 101-12 in the House and 56-0 in the Senate.

(Photo by Grace Deng/Washington State Standard)A man who was held in a federal detention facility after Whitefish police pulled him over for an allegedly faulty taillight in April has filed a lawsuit alleging racial profiling and a violation of his constitutional rights against the City of Whitefish, Whitefish Police Chief Bridger Kelch, and Officer Michael Hingiss, who conducted the traffic stop.
Beker Rengifo Del Castillo, 33, is a Venezuelan citizen who was leaving a job near Whitefish Lake on April 24 when Hingiss stopped him, according to the lawsuit, allegedly for a broken brake light. Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection, and Del Castillo was left in the custody of a Customs and Border Protection officer and subsequently taken to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Tacoma, Washington, a “a horrific and traumatic experience,” according to court documents.
Whitefish City Attorney Angela Jacobs told the Daily Montanan in an email that the city cannot comment on active litigation.
The lawsuit was filed in Federal District Court of Montana in Missoula. Del Castillo is represented by Upper Seven Law.
In the lawsuit, Del Castillo’s attorneys allege that Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection because Beker “only speaks Spanish” and Border Patrol may “want to check him,” despite Del Castillo providing “proof of his lawful presence in the United States in the form of his valid REAL ID compliant driver’s license.”
According to the complaint, Del Castillo entered the United States in July 2024 through the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela Parole Program. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approved Del Castillo’s application for work authorization on July 23, 2024, and issued him a Social Security number.
Del Castillo was leaving a work site with a coworker, in separate vehicles, this spring when Hingiss followed behind the two cars. According to the complaint, Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection “due to a language barrier,” but then left Del Castillo with a federal officer to “continue” the immigration investigation. The complaint states that the Border Patrol agent noted that Del Castillo may have legal status.
“Del Castillo’s story shows why untrained municipal police should not masquerade as federal immigration cops,” the lawsuit states.
Following his transfer to an ICE detention facility, Del Castillo was held until April 30, and then released with “no place to stay and no way to get home.”
“Because of this incident, (Del Castillo) is reluctant to leave his home and attempts to avoid all contact with law enforcement, fearing he will again be detained and incarcerated based on discrimination and without cause,” the complaint states. “(He) quit his jobs to avoid the risk of being racially profiled and incarcerated without basis while driving to and from work.”
According to the complaint, the Whitefish Police Department has a policy about immigration violations that Hingiss broke while detaining Del Castillo and calling Border Patrol. The policies include prohibiting officers from detaining “any individual, for any length of time, for a civil violation of federal immigration laws or a related civil warrant;” and no one who is “otherwise ready to be released should continue to be detained only because questions about the individual’s status are unresolved.”
The policies, according to the lawsuit, also state that an officer must notify a supervisor when detaining someone for an immigration violation, and seek approval before conducting an arrest for an alleged immigration offense and before transferring an individual to federal immigration authorities.
During a Whitefish City Council meeting in May, Police Chief Kelch told councilors the city had policies that “that strictly prohibit biased-based policing and improper profiling,” according to reporting by the Flathead Beacon. Kelch also stated that “we did not call Border Patrol for interpretation services.”

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)At 32,500 miles of track, the 176-year old company known now as Burlington Northern Santa Fe could run a railroad line around the earth and have room to spare.
What it cannot do, however, according to legislators, advocacy agencies, and small-town Montana mayors, is provide prompt responses when building near the railroad becomes unavoidable. They’ve complained of exorbitant prices for permits, wait times stretching months to receive communication from BNSF and inconsistency from one of the nation’s largest freight companies. The railroad company is also in a legal battle with a company laying hundreds of miles of fiber optic cable in the Treasure State.
BNSF owns nearly all the track in the state and splits a western U.S. railroad duopoly with Union Pacific, which checks in at 32,693 miles. A large chunk of the nation’s freight is moved by BNSF, which runs about 1,200 trains per day and earned nearly $7 billion in profit last year.
Easements — small tracts of land where someone has the right to cross or otherwise use someone else’s land for a specified purpose — and the railroad’s utility permit process have caught the attention of the legislature and the ire of some towns, from Thompson Falls to Colstrip.
Water lines, sewage lines, and fiber optic cables all sometimes need to be run under or near railroad tracks. Getting the proper permits for those can take months, stretching timelines and adding financial stress to cities, which in some cases are on deadlines to spend grant money or lose it.
Permitting is a complex process involving multiple companies doing work on behalf of BNSF, with a 52-page “Utility Accommodation Policy” spelling out the rules and regulations for anyone dealing with the railroad.
“BNSF’s utility permitting process is designed to ensure safety, protect private property rights, and recover the costs associated with managing infrastructure on active railroad property,” said Lena Kent, BNSF general director of public affairs said in a statement to the Daily Montanan. “While we recognize the importance of utility projects to local communities, each application must be evaluated based on its unique scope, complexity and associated risks.”
Buying or leasing easements includes expensive fees, too. Various pieces of legislation have looked to fix timelines and expenses, including House Bill 933 this year, with the legislature considering similar legislation again in the interim after it failed during the session. HB 933 was the resuscitation of legislation from 2019, which also did not pass. 
In the past, potential easement legislation has been used to bring parties to the table and come to a resolution over specific rail issues. It remains to be seen if that will be the case this time around, and Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, a Billings Republican who leads the Legislature’s Energy and Technology Interim Committee, has pursued the issue. 
“Ball’s in their court to act like adults,” Zolnikov said of BNSF. “Not children.”

The most recent chapter in the controversy over the BNSF easement permitting process broke out during a July 28 meeting of the Legislature’s Energy and Technology Interim Committee.
Montana League of Cities and Towns Executive Director Kelly Lynch, who said she’d never addressed the committee before, requested legislators look into the issue.
“I’m here before you today to ask that you look into an issue that’s been percolating for some years now,” Lynch said. “My members of cities and towns have been struggling for many years to get approval and get through the process of either doing a utility crossing or getting access to railroad property.”
Seconds after Lynch finished her public comment, though, BNSF supporters moved to defend the railroad. Negative experiences with the freight company are not universally shared in Montana.
Mark Lambrecht, CEO of the Montana Electric Cooperatives Association, addressed the committee, bringing up HB 933, which he opposed during a House Transportation committee meeting in late March. 
The Electrical Cooperatives Association was part of an agreement with BNSF in 2019, Lambrecht said, and in March he stated HB 933 would blow it up. He said they’ve been pleased with the agreement.
“There’s a permitting process and timelines, communication, standards, things like that,” Lambrecht told the interim committee on July 28. “That agreement has worked really, really well.”

Later in the meeting, committee members indicated they were interested in pursuing legislation around railroad easements. 
Matt Jones, a BNSF lobbyist, responded with phone calls to several cities around the state. What happened next is disputed.
In a July 29 email to Energy and Technology Interim Committee members, Zolnikov wrote the calls from Jones included “some threats.”
“From what I am being told, these threats include pulling current and or future easements. BNSF has allegedly stated it will be even worse for the cities if legislation is brought forward out of the committee,” Zolnikov wrote, saying it was ironic because, “This draft (bill) was brought forward to address the issue of non-cooperative entities slow rolling and overcharging our cities and other infrastructure developments.”
When reached by BNSF, a company spokesperson initially told the Daily Montanan their was, “overall concern in even proceeding with a story based on this state senator making this crazy, unfounded accusation that we’re threatening the communities we work with and serve.”
In an emailed response to Zolnikov and the committee, Jones said his phone calls weren’t threats. Multiple sources for this story expressed concern that cities with active BNSF projects would receive reprisal from the train company if they spoke publicly.
“I contacted a few cities where we have a lot of interaction on projects to ask them if this is an issue of such concern that they are asking for legislative involvement,” Jones wrote on July 30. “There were no threats made, and I emphasized the importance of working together for the long-term on a wide variety of projects, not just utility easements.”
Jones went on to write that legislation supported by the League of Cities during the legislative session — HB 933 — “wasn’t good for municipalities,” stating it would have led to higher costs for two projects that were “pending” at that time. It’s unclear what those projects were or who would benefit by killing HB 933, though Lambrecht said they were “industrial interests” who were having issues with a crossing during the July committee meeting. 
  Rep. Neil Duram, R-Eureka
When asked by the Daily Montanan, BNSF did not specify what deal was made and with whom, but did expand on its opposition to that proposed legislation. 
“BNSF opposed House Bill 933 because it proposed an unconstitutional infringement of private property interests,” Kent said in a statement. “It would result in the taking of private property without the due process guaranteed in the Montana and U.S. Constitutions.”
Rep. Neil Duram, a Eureka Republican who brought HB 933, told the Daily Montanan the railroad company then asked him to kill the bill, which was voted down in the House 100-0. It was similar to how it’s happened in the past and said he wants to be transparent on the issue.
Duram did say the “industrial interests” were concerned with a project near Thompson Falls.
“Each session the railroad gave concessions to the aggrieved party. They’ve made an agreement with the aggrieved party to contact their legislator and request that they pull the bill,” Duram said. “That’s how it’s happened each session.”

House Bill 933, also called the Montana Railroad Crossing Clarity Act, also is part of a legal battle between BNSF and a fiber optic company, Intermountain Infrastructure Group.
BNSF filed a lawsuit on May 15 against the fiber optic company, also known as IIG, saying it is trespassing on their land and has been doing so for a long time. IIG has been active near Thompson Falls.
The suit, which was filed in Missoula and includes a copy of the 1864 Northern Pacific Act, claims IIG “misrepresented and misled BNSF” as the fiber optic company was going through the permitting process for the contested easements. 
It said IIG laid cable on BNSF’s land “without notice and without permission.”
In its response, IIG — who is represented by Graybill Law Firm along with Parsons, Behle and Latimer — said BNSF was retaliating for support of HB 933. IIG eventually dropped its support for the legislation, apparently with the understanding the rail company would work with them.
BNSF, who is represented by Billings law firm Hedger Friend, PLLC, went to court instead.
“Directly following IIG’s advocacy at the Montana legislature, BNSF informed IIG for the first time that it intended to file a lawsuit to seek removal of the longitudinal lines that IIG had placed in good faith in public road rights-of-way that are the subject of this case,” the complaint response states.
IIG, beginning in 2023, started to obtain permits from various local and state jurisdictions for the cable. During that process, court documents state, IIG began to also ask BNSF for permits and was able to receive them. In response to certain applications, BNSF asked for additional information, including maps, which IIG gave. 
During study of those maps, BNSF began to assert IIG was trespassing on its right of way, but agreed to issue remedial permits. None of the cases in the suit involve IIG crossing the railroad, only being on their land, the complaint response said, adding IIG wasn’t causing any interference with BNSF operations.

“Most of the installations were and are on the opposite side of the highway from BNSF’s track—in other words, a public highway stands between IIG’s installation and BNSF’s track,” IIG argued in its response. “Most of the installations are in locations already occupied by other public and private utilities, in some cases pervasively occupied by other infrastructure.”
In January 2025, BNSF sent IIG a trespass letter, allegedly saying it was “just a formality.”
In response, IIG didn’t contest BNSF’s position on the permits and paid for them. One permit for approximately 1,800 feet of cable cost $236,438, court documents stated.
Following support for the bill, which came after the permit issues, “BNSF refused to continue processing any of IIG’s permits,” the complaint response states. 
Those aren’t just permits in Montana either; BNSF is allegedly holding up IIG permits in other states, too, according to court documents.
BNSF allegedly also told IIG that it was attacking the railroad industry.
“In an April email, BNSF’s current counsel informed IIG that it was ‘concerning’ to BNSF that ‘while BNSF was pursuing necessary internal approvals, IIG attempted to initiate legislative action against not only BNSF but the railroad industry as a whole,’” court documents state.
In a counterclaim response to IIG, BNSF said it doesn’t have any contracts with the fiber optic company.
“IIG’s breach of contract/breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim is barred because no contract was formed between BNSF and IIG,” court documents state. “The submission of a permit application does not constitute an enforceable contract obligating BNSF to issue a license.”
IIG was established in 2017 and has constructed about 800 miles of underground fiber optic cable in the state. 
IIG said it does not comment on pending litigation when reached. BNSF does not comment on active litigation either, a company spokesperson told the Daily Montanan.
Montana is investing heavily in fiber optic cable, to the tune of nearly a billion dollars between federal and state funding, according to the state’s broadband program website, ConnectMT. 
IIG does not directly have contacts with the state for work, a company spokesperson said, but is involved in upgrading Montana’s internet infrastructure.
Brandon Coates, a spokesperson for IIG, compared the process to road systems. What IIG is creating, he said, are essentially fiber optic interstates. Other fiber optic cable companies that do have ConnectMT contracts are creating highways to connect to IIG’s larger infrastructure, Coates added, including one Gov. Greg Gianforte highlighted recently in Whitehall.

Other disputes are taking place outside the courtroom and in small Montana cities.
One of those towns is Thompson Falls and a word Mayor Rusti Leivestad used to describe the railroad easement business was “frustrating.” 
The city is working on a new wastewater system, and a lift station is near a BNSF railroad. 
Leivestad said the city initially reached out to BNSF in February 2025 with its application and didn’t get a dollar figure until the end of May. 
The price was on the high side of what city officials were expecting.
“We were informed by BNSF that the permit fee would be $88,880 along with a list of insurance requirements,” Leivestad said. 
BNSF and the city eventually negotiated down the price, and Thompson Falls, population 1,526, was given two more options. This time the city could pay a company a little more than $20,000 in a one-time fee, or it could pay $1,500 a year with a 3% increase each year. Leviestad and her town chose the first option, with the second calculated to be almost double the lump sum amount.
The amount was far greater than what the city has paid in the past to another rail company, Montana Rail Link. BNSF announced in late 2023 that it was acquiring Montana Rail Link, adding to the more than 400 companies it has swallowed during the course of its history.
“The permit with (Montana Rail Link), who was the negotiating company for the first phase of our wastewater project, that permit was $925 and we paid $500 a year for the lease,” Leivestad added. “So that kind of gives you an example.”

Another example can be found in Colstrip.
Colstrip needed a new water line, Mayor John Williams said, and was on a time crunch to finish the project. Federal funds they needed for infrastructure projects would run out if they didn’t get the project completed in time.
The Colstrip project didn’t actually cross a railroad track, Williams said, and is in fact about 120 feet away from the ties. Delays were so worrisome that Colstrip didn’t really negotiate with BNSF, like Thompson Falls was able to do, Williams said.
“When we got the number, we attempted to find, you know, what’s the basis of this? Why is it so much?” Williams told the Daily Montanan. “The information that was transferred to me was that BNSF told our engineer that if we wanted to contact him and negotiate a different number or lesser number, the city would be welcome to do that. But at the time I was contracted, and we were up against it. I thought if we try to negotiate a lower cost, we may lose the contract.”
Colstrip ended up paying more than $41,000 for the permit, Williams said, which included insurance.

BNSF’s permitting website is run by Bartlett and West, and for the internet adept, it’s user friendly.
The website directs you to create an account, and you can immediately begin the process of filing a permit. There’s several types — pipeline and wire line have the same instructions, for example — and varying timelines. Oversized loads, road resurfacing and environmental work are other permits that can be applied for. They all require a $2,000 non-refundable application fee.
The website lays out specific process instructions for those seeking a permit.
“Permit costs and timelines vary because the projects are different in scope and complexity.  The property interests involved and associated risks have different values,” Kent said in a statement. “For example, a perpendicular wireline crossing of the railroad right of way is less burden to the landowner than a mile long installation of a gas or sewer line. BNSF understands utility projects are critical infrastructure, and it’s often not possible to avoid railroad property. As a result, we regularly work with applicants to negotiate fees that are less than fair market value. These negotiations often add time to the process.”

A pipeline, for example, requires an engineering review and drawings, which takes approximately two weeks to complete. At that point, the review process is handed off to JLL, a real estate company, who sends the contract along with directions on insurance and “any additional fees.”
That signed contract is then returned to JLL and following that step, the final contract is presented. The website says “the average time from successful submission of the application to execution of the license agreement is four weeks.”
Timelines get far longer and the process more complicated for private crossings. The permitting website says the average time from submission to execution is 10 weeks. Those permits involve working with the BNSF director of field safety, as well as a contract process with JLL. 
If it’s a new crossing, add even more time and work.
“If this is a new crossing, an estimate for BNSF’s labor/material costs for placement and (future) removal of the crossing materials will be prepared,” the website reads, which added that a new crossing adds at least a month to the timeline. “Typically, the grading/drainage work for the roadway from the right of way line to the crossing is performed by the licensee’s contractor.”
Before filing a permit, the website also asks the user to read the railroad’s Utility Accommodation Policy. It is deeply detailed, noting everything from hiring flaggers for the railroad to what construction techniques are allowed by the company to dig under a rail bed.
Insurance is also noted, with BNSF having absolutely no liability if anything goes wrong.
“The Utility Owner, its successor(s), or assignees shall assume all risk and liability for accidents and damages that may occur to persons or property on account of this work, and shall indemnify and hold BNSF harmless from any and all costs, liabilities, expenses, suits, judgments or damages to persons or property, or claims of any nature whatsoever, arising out of or in connection with the permit, or the operation and performance thereunder by the utility, its agents, employees or subcontractors,” the company document reads.
It even has separate sections of rules for utilities going parallel and perpendicular to the railroad’s property. Even those, though, as illustrated in IIG’s case, can be expensive and complicated.
In a statement, BNSF defended its process and provided statistics specific to the state.
“In 2024, BNSF received 168 applications for utility permits in Montana alone.  87% of permits were completed within 65 days,” Kent said. “Regarding cycle time, BNSF’s goal is to get a draft license to the applicant within 35 days from the time a complete application is received.  In Montana last year, we sent out a license agreement for utility permits in 10.25 days on average.”

Legislation could be coming next session on railroad easements and past attempts, as well a North Dakota law, could be a blueprint.
The North Dakota law, passed in 2019, dictates the process utilities and railroad companies most follow over easements. Much of the meat of the North Dakota law, including insurance requirements and other small processes, mirrors language on BNSF’s permitting website. 
The Public Service Commission is the body that regulates railroads in Montana. Lynch brought up both that and the North Dakota law during her public comment to the legislative committee.
In a comment to the Daily Montanan, she said cities and towns want a consistent process.
“That is, we know up front what’s going to be expected of us, how long it’s going to take and how much it’s gonna cost,” Lynch said. 
BNSF, in a statement to the Daily Montanan, said it “deeply values” the communities it operates in and serves.
“We regularly work with local municipalities on a number of issues, including various public projects and real estate transactions,” the BNSF statement said. “We stand ready to collaborate and find workable solutions that are agreeable to all parties involved.”
Proposed legislation in the past — including the 2025 Montana Railroad Crossing Clarity Act — would have set caps for permit costs and created legally enforceable timelines for project. HB 933, in fact, would have capped permit costs at whatever was greater, $3,000 or $10 for every linear foot of the railroad right-of-way occupied by the crossing.
Importantly, it also protected imminent domain rights. The bill also included stipulations on costs for flaggers and other administrative bits, including insurance costs.
There were philosophical concerns with the legislation, even for Duram, the bill’s sponsor.
“There really is no harm to the railroad, this is just an opportunity for them to make some more profits off the land that they own, which they’re entitled to,” Duram said. “And that’s always been kind of my tightrope, is respecting private property rights. At what point does the state step in and tell you what you’re going to charge for people to access?”
Frustration, however, seems to be mounting, and Zolnikov brought up another option the Legislature has, though one they could be hesitant to use.
“We can raise taxes, and I do not raise taxes,” Zolnikov said. “But if they are going to threaten to sue us on any solution to this problem and they’re going to keep strong-arming cities and towns, then we can solve this problem via taxation.”

A recent ruling sending the case back to the state’s environmental court extends a dozen-year limbo for the store, which its owner still hopes to reopen.

ST. ALBANS TOWN — Earlier this month, Janet Cote brought a pastor to her half-rebuilt store in St. Albans Town, where work halted in 2017. Inside the building’s bare bones, they prayed that after being closed for more than a dozen years, she could bring the store back to what it was. 
A freak accident involving a neighbor’s tractor initially caused the store to close for repairs in 2012. But soil contamination from underground oil tanks, which were found after the accident, started an extended limbo and legal battle over who should foot the whopping bill for remediation: Cote or the state. 
In late July, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled on the lawsuit against the state Agency of Natural Resources. Cote, who is 83, still hopes that after six years in the court system, winning the suit would put her on a path to reopening the store. 
“My mission and my purpose is to restore the business,” Cote said. 
There were gas pumps in front of Maquam Shore Market when Cote took over the one-acre property from her parents in 1982. She leased out the store, an apartment upstairs, a trailer hookup outside and two white houses closer to the lake. The store itself hosted a creemee window and a deli inside on the left as you walked in. Back then, the spot was mostly surrounded by cornfields. 
“It’s the only store within five miles in every direction, almost,” Cote said. 
In 2000, Cote decided to get rid of the gas pumps. 
So she hired a state-approved contractor with money from the Department of Environmental Conservation’s petroleum cleanup fund to dig up her pumps along with three underground oil and gas tanks. The department, which is part of the agency, pays for projects like Cote’s through fees on gas and oil sales and regulations designed to follow federal regulations to protect the environment and public health.

After digging up the tanks, Cote’s contractor had to monitor the soil. The contractor “told me that the levels of hazardous whatever were below what (was) needed to continue,” Cote said. 
In hindsight, that’s when the trouble began. But she didn’t know it until 2012, when her neighbor accidentally rammed into the building while driving a large tractor along Maquam Shore Road. The crash caused so much damage, it forced her to close the store. 
In the process of getting a permit to rebuild, she learned her soil was in fact contaminated, she said.
To clean up the spill, she had to dig up a large section of her property — meaning her repairs went far beyond recovering from the crash. She would have to dig up the store’s foundation, wastewater system and electrical wiring and then rebuild the structure completely. In the process, contractors who Cote found through the department discovered, and dug out, more gas tanks from more than a decade before. 
The price tag on the additional work is more than she can cover herself, she said — and she thinks the department should pay for it all. Destroying the store completely was the only way to remediate the soil, so in her eyes the state should pay the full cost to rebuild it. 
But it hasn’t been decided whether the state will pick up the tab. 
After years of back and forth, the agency agreed to pay for only some parts of restoring the property. So she took the agency to court back in 2019. 
On July 25, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled unanimously to send the case back to the environmental division, asking for additional factual findings from that court about why the department would cover some costs and not others. 
“We understand the Supreme Court’s decision to remand the case back to the Environmental Court for more specific findings, and we will continue to represent the Agency of Natural Resources in this matter. We are confident that the Agency correctly determined the covered costs,” said the Vermont Attorney General’s office, which is representing the agency, in an emailed statement. 
For now, Cote is celebrating what she sees as a win, though she still awaits the day the legal battle can be over. 
As a retired person, she spends a huge portion of her time and energy on the lawsuit, she said.

Back to environmental court
Emails from state officials obtained by Cote through a public records request and reviewed by VTDigger show that, throughout the years, department officials knew her soil was contaminated. However, she said, they never alerted her. 
In one email from March 2013, Matt Moran, who still manages the petroleum cleanup fund for the department, wrote that Cote was “uncooperative about doing the necessary follow-up work.” He later wrote, “the owner is older and likely will be needing to sell or transfer the property soon.” 
Cote called the emails derogatory and denies that she was ever uncooperative. She thinks the state is drawing things out because of her age, she said. 
Through a spokesperson, the Agency of Natural Resources denied Cote’s allegations of age discrimination by its staff.

“Thus far, these claims have been determined to be without merit,” said agency spokesperson Stephanie Brackin. “Should Ms. Cote present any credible new evidence of misconduct by a state employee, we will review the information.”
The work has been expensive. By 2018, the state had spent more than $485,000 on her property from the state’s petroleum cleanup fund, according to court documents. After going back and forth, department officials asked Cote to send over a list of the remaining repairs. 
In 2019, they declined to cover many of those requested repairs, including on the wastewater system, work on the electrical system, concrete work and the price of hiring a general contractor. So Cote sued, arguing her costs should be covered in full. 
The case was tossed around and then put on pause for years during the pandemic. 
Then, in 2024, Environmental Court Judge Thomas Durkin reversed some of the agency’s decisions in favor of Cote. Durkin ruled that the state had to pay for concrete, wastewater and electrical work. But he allowed the agency to reject a range of other costs, some significant and others less so, from hiring a general contractor to repairing a flagpole. 
Those costs added up to at least tens of thousands of dollars that Cote did not have, she said, so she appealed the court decision.
This summer, she said she got what she was hoping for. 
All five justices reversed the part of the lower court ruling that accepted the department’s argument that the petroleum cleanup fund was not responsible for the additional costs, and passed the case back. 
In the ruling, justices reasoned that the lower court ruling did not include findings about the agency’s justification for why they would cover some costs and not others. Justices also found the lower court failed to thoroughly define what was considered a reasonable expense or how they interpreted the law. 
The language used in the lower court’s decision “forces us to speculate about whether and how each item is ineligible according to the agency,” justices wrote in the decision.
Now, the case must be passed back down to the environmental court where judges will revisit it and will issue new or additional findings, bearing in mind the legal interpretation offered by the Vermont Supreme Court. 
While Cote said she is grateful for the ruling, she’s dismayed by how long the whole process has taken. “I am not grateful that I have to keep litigating because of things that were not correct,” Cote said. 
On an August afternoon, only the skeleton of the prospective store stood in the old one’s footprint. Its red siding covered half the building. Cote stood out front and looked up at the building’s side as it cast a shadow over her.

[…]","Dozens of people packed into a room at Northwood Technical College in Ashland for the first day of hearings in a case challenging the DNR's decision to approve a permit for the reroute of the Line 5 oil pipeline. (Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)In more than five hours of public testimony on Tuesday in Ashland, the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa’s case began against a planned extension of the Canadian energy company Enbridge’s Line 5 oil pipeline through northern Wisconsin. 
For decades, Line 5 has run from Canada across northern Wisconsin, through the Bad River reservation. In 2023 a federal judge ordered that the pipeline’s section on the reservation be shut down. Since 2020, Enbridge has been working on a plan to reroute the pipeline, which runs from far northwest Wisconsin 645 miles into Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, under the Straits of Mackinac and across the U.S. border into Canada near Detroit. It transports about 23 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids daily.
The proposed new route would move the pipeline upstream of the reservation, which tribal members have argued doesn’t alleviate the environmental risks the pipeline poses to them. 
Tuesday’s hearing was the opening day of testimony in the tribe’s case against the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources’ decision to grant permits for the Line 5 reroute. The case was argued before the Wisconsin Department of Administration’s Division of Hearings and Appeals, which gives parties the ability to challenge regulatory decisions by state agencies. Four weeks of hearings are scheduled in both Ashland and Madison. The final decision by DHA can be appealed to a state circuit court. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is also weighing its own permit decision on the reroute. That decision is appealable through the federal court system. 
Before the hearing started Tuesday a line of people wound through the parking lot of Northwood Technical College. At the start of the day, the hearing room was packed, with an overflow crowd  forced to watch a livestream from an auxiliary room. 
Many of the people in attendance wore t-shirts stating “Support Line 5” or representing area unions. Tribal activists grumbled that Enbridge had chartered a bus to bring in supporters. 
The pipeline reroute has already sparked hours of public comment and thousands of written comments. The DNR’s initial permit decision drew more than 32,000 written comments and an Army Corps of Engineers hearing on its permit decision in May drew two days of additional public input. 
The day began with opening statements from the tribe’s attorneys, Clean Wisconsin — a non-profit environmental organization which has intervened in the case — and the DNR. 
DNR attorney Michael Kowalkowski said that the department is confident the project will not result in “adverse” effects to the environment or local water after one of the “most comprehensive environmental reviews” in agency history. 
But Stefanie Tsosie, an attorney for the tribe, said the proposed reroute “is not a solution.” She noted that the hearings were occurring as the wild rice harvesting season in the region begins. Wild rice is an important piece of the tribe’s culture and the wetland habitats the rice is a part of are a crucial layer of defense for the area’s waterways — including Lake Superior — against pollution from runoff and flooding. Tsosie said any errors in construction or accidents after the pipeline is operational could irreversibly damage the wild rice. 
“The band is here taking a stand,” Tsosie said, because if an oil spill occurs and the environment is harmed, “the band has nowhere else to go.”

Evan Feinauer, an attorney for Clean Wisconsin, said the project poses far too much environmental risk for the DNR’s permit approval to stand, adding that a “spill of any meaningful size would be catastrophic” to the Lake Superior watershed. 
While many opponents of Line 5 did testify, a large majority of the comments came from supporters of the project. Supporters of the project argued that they believe Enbridge’s plans do enough to protect the environment while providing an economic boost to the region and hundreds of construction jobs. 
Even though the pipeline carries oil and natural gas from Canada through the U.S. and back into Canada, many area residents testified that shutting down the pipeline could raise their own energy prices and make it harder to obtain the propane they use to heat their homes. 
The project “will generate direct economic activity, it will create 700 union construction jobs, stimulate local spending and provide contracts for businesses,” said Anna Rademacher, a representative of the regional economic development organization Area Partnership for Economic Expansion.
While the hearing Tuesday drew hours of public testimony, the meat of the case is yet to come with the parties bringing their arguments for and against the DNR’s permit decision in later court dates. 
After the hearing, Tsosie told the Wisconsin Examiner the hearings Tuesday were a good baseline before the substantive parts of the case are heard.
“Obviously this is still really a contentious issue,” she said. “There are people who we saw today speak very passionately about protecting the water resources and protecting the area, and we saw people who we’ve seen before talk about the economic impacts. But this proceeding, the contested case proceeding, we’re really looking at the permit details, we’re looking at the evidence, we’re looking at baseline data, and so I think this is a good setup, but we still have four weeks of the case left.”
The case is set to continue in Madison Sept. 3 with additional public testimony. The beginning of the parties’ arguments is scheduled to begin Sept. 4.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0299-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 18:57:33.752019

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has rescinded its previous decision to add seven segments to Iowa’s list of impaired waters due to their high nitrate concentrations. 
In November the agency decided the Iowa Department of Natural Resources’ list of impaired waters only “partially” met the requirements of the Clean Water Act to identify waterways with identified pollutants in excess of water quality standards. 
The EPA review of the list identified seven additional segments with high levels of nitrate and nitrate plus nitrite. Despite pushback from the DNR, and comments that the EPA had a “patchwork approach” to regulating nitrate across the country, the federal agency finalized the decision in January. 
According to reporting from the Des Moines Register on Tuesday, the EPA office informed the DNR in July it had rescinded its decision. A spokesperson for the DNR confirmed the action in an email with the Iowa Capital Dispatch.

The original decision highlighted segments of rivers connected to municipal drinking water sources, including segments in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers which supply water to the Des Moines metro, the Cedar River upstream of Cedar Rapids, the Iowa River near Iowa City and the South Skunk River. 
EPA said in its November 2024 decision the nitrate concentrations in these segments exceeded safe drinking water standards. 
The DNR’s director, Kayla Lyon, pushed back against the decision saying the cities that source water from these rivers are all able to supply drinking water within the safe drinking water standards. Lyon also said the agency was “holding Iowa to a very high standard that it does not enforce elsewhere.” 
Nitrate concentrations have been a topic of interest for many in central Iowa this summer. In June, Central Iowa Water Works issued its first ever lawn watering ban to account for high nitrate concentrations in source waters, the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers, and to continue to meet demand. 
The regional water authority kept nitrate concentrations in finished water below the EPA’s drinking water standards thanks to the ban, which was lifted Aug. 7, and to nitrate removal systems at several facilities. 
Data analysis: How do nitrate levels in central Iowa this year compare to last?

Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement Board president Jenny Turner said the EPA’s decision to rescind the segments from the list was “an affront to the health and well-being of Iowans.” 
“Issuing this reversal on the heels of Central Iowa Water Works first ever lawn watering ban and consistently high nitrate levels in these very same water segments is tone deaf, appalling, and dangerous,” Turner said in a statement. 
The release of Polk County’s two-year water quality study has also brought the issue to the forefront for many Iowans. A widely attended presentation on the report has been viewed more than 2,000 times online, and at the event, researchers called for regulation on the agriculture industry for its links to nitrate pollution, which the study highlighted.
Tarah Heinzen, the legal director with the environmental group Food & Water Watch said the “water crisis” in Iowa should be a “call to action.” 
“Instead, Trump’s EPA is callously turning its back,” Heinzen said in a statement. “The data is clearer than ever that central Iowa is facing persistent, toxic nitrate contamination endangering thousands — and industrial agriculture is responsible.”

The Rx Kids program opened enrollment in 2024 in an effort to combat childhood poverty and improve infant and maternal health in the city of Flint. However, the program has since expanded to offer cash-based assistance to parents of babies in Kalamazoo and Pontiac as well as Alger, Clare, Chippewa, Luce, Mackinac and Schoolcraft counties. 
Now, members of the Legislature are aiming to expand the program to the entire state. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Sen. Sylvia Santana’s (D-Detroit) Senate Bill 309 would amend the state’s Social Welfare Act, requiring the Department of Health and Human Services to contract with Michigan State University to administer the program, which offers pregnant parents within a set area $1,500 during pregnancy and babies $500 a month for either the first six or 12 months of their life.
“This cash assistance helps remove economic barriers that often prevent families from obtaining necessary items, such as baby supplies, food, rent, utility bills and clothing,” Santana said.
Mona Hanna, the program’s director, explained that while the program in Michigan is the first of its kind in the nation, it’s not a new concept, with 70% of countries across the globe offering some kind of child/family allowance.
The early months of a child’s life is crucial in development, Hanna said, noting that a child’s brain doubles in size over the first year of their life. 
This is also a period when stress and scarcity can have lifelong impacts on a child, Hanna explained, with families also facing their steepest costs during this timeframe.

These costs are compounded by a loss of income if the mother has to leave the workforce and the added cost of caregiving and childcare, Hanna said, with individuals living in poor communities facing an even greater burden from these challenges. 
To date, the program has prescribed over $13 million dollars to more than 3,000 Michigan families, Hanna said, with the program financed through a combination of funds from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and municipalities, alongside other public-private support. 
“That means that every state dollar is matched and often multiplied by private investment, stretching our public resources further and maximizing impact,” Hanna said.
The most common item Rx Kids recipients spent their cash prescription on was baby supplies, namely diapers, Hanna said. 
Additionally families in the program reported less back-owed rent and mortgage payments, alongside improved nutrition security, and improved health benefits, Hanna said. 
“We are seeing a significant reduction in postpartum depression, a reduction in anxiety and a significant reduction in parental stress. We have a massive increase in prenatal care utilization. Moms are going to prenatal care earlier, they’re going more often,” Hanna said. “Because they’re going earlier and more often, we’re increasing the detection of pregnancy illnesses like gestational diabetes and hypertension. We have less smoking [in] the third trimester, and we are also seeing significant improvements in birth weight and gestational age.”
Hanna said that has resulted in fewer admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit.
During the hearing, Sen. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs) offered effusive praise for the program, noting that part of the region he represents is participating in Rx Kids . 
“I love that there are no strings attached, that you’re actually trusting that parents are going to use this for the right things, that those maternal and paternal instincts kick in and they use it for that,” Damoose said. “You don’t have means testing, which I think is a great thing, because there’s no stigma now. Everybody can go get this. It’s also helped you to lead to a tremendously low overhead, unlike so many sort of relief programs out there.”

Alongside praise from Damoose, two mothers who had participated in the program shared how their participation had offered greater stability. 
Quianna Jenkins had her first child at 18 years old. Despite stepping into motherhood young, Jenkins said she was determined to give her children the best life she could, though it hasn’t been easy. 
“There have been days filled with uncertainty, stress and sacrifice. From doctor visits to late night feedings to budgeting every single dollar just to make sure there’s enough to get through the week, it’s a lot.… That’s why, when I heard about the program, it felt like someone finally said, ‘we see you, we believe in you,’” Jenkins said. 
Those dollars have been instrumental in providing her kids with a better quality of life, Jenkins said, using the money to start a life insurance policy, something she never thought she’d be able to afford. 
Additionally, the cash benefit gives participants the ability to handle real life as it comes, treating recipients like the capable adults they are, Jenkins said. 
Celeste Lord-Timlin said she and her husband were both living in affordable housing when she found out she was pregnant.
Lord-Timlin was also pursuing two Masters degrees at the University of Michigan-Flint, opting to reduce her class schedule to remain in good standing. However, that decision led to the loss of her FAFSA eligibility, creating stress as she thought about her upcoming hospital bill alongside having to pay tuition out of pocket. 
“This is, again, where Rx Kids stepped in. That initial $1,500 payment was a lifeline. Half went to essential baby items, like a stroller and a car seat, and the other half covered my part-time tuition, allowing me to remain in good standing,” Lord-Timlin said. 
Now that they are off the program the $500 a month payments for her daughter has put them in a much better position by giving them a year to prepare, Lord-Timlin said.

While other working moms sometimes have to leave the workforce when childcare costs outweigh their salary, Lord-Timlin said the money from Rx Kids gave her a buffer so she could remain in the workforce. 
“This past June, I proudly received my Masters in organizational leadership and I’m on track to receive my [Masters of Business Administration] this December,” Lord-Timlin said. “It’s more than just cash, it’s an investment in the potential of mothers, the stability of families and the futures of communities.”

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune) It’s been more than a month since attorneys for Ralph Menzies asked a Utah court to conduct another evaluation into whether the 67-year-old death row inmate with dementia is mentally fit enough to be executed. 
Now, with his firing squad execution less than four weeks away, his attorneys have asked a judge to speed up his ruling, worried that any further delay could impact Menzies’ due process. On Monday, they filed a motion requesting Utah 3rd District Court Judge Matthew Bates expedite his decision. 
Menzies is appealing a prior court decision with the Utah Supreme Court, and the judge’s delay, his attorneys write, “could effectively deny Mr. Menzies his due process right.” 
Menzies has been on death row since 1988, after being convicted of kidnapping and murdering Maurine Hunsaker, a 26-year-old gas station clerk who he took up Big Cottonwood Canyon. She was later found tied to a tree with her throat slashed.
Menzies’ dementia — and whether his condition deems him ineligible for execution — has been the subject of debate over the last year. Both state and federal law require that death row inmates have an understanding of why they’re being executed. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
After hearing from several medical professionals who examined Menzies, Bates ruled in May that the inmate does have dementia, but still understands the state’s reasoning for executing him. That ruling allowed the Utah Attorney General’s Office to apply for an execution warrant which Bates signed, setting a Sept. 5 date for Menzies’ death by firing squad. 
Menzies’ attorneys promptly appealed the decision with the Utah Supreme Court and a hearing is set for Aug. 21.  
However, the evaluations Bates based his ruling off of happened about a year ago, and in that time, Menzies’ attorneys say his dementia has progressed. They believe that he now meets the level to be considered incompetent. 
In a petition filed on July 7, they asked Bates to grant Menzies another evaluation from a Utah Department of Health and Human Services doctor. If granted, that would kick off a 60-day process where the doctor examines the inmate and compiles a report for the court — depending on the report’s findings, Menzies could be found incompetent, and spared from execution.
They also asked the court to pause execution proceedings to give the appeal time to play out, which Bates denied. 
‘Time is ticking’: Judge to decide whether Ralph Menzies should get another review before execution

On July 23, after hearing arguments for and against granting another competency evaluation, Bates said he would grant a ruling “as quickly as possible.” That was 20 days ago, as of Tuesday, and the petition itself was filed 37 days ago. 
“Mr. Menzies’s petition was pending when the Court issued a warrant of execution set for 58 days from its issuance. More than half of that time has now elapsed without a ruling,” court documents read. “This delay underscores precisely why a stay was necessary pending resolution of the petition.”
If Bates intends to deny Menzies another competency evaluation, his attorneys are asking for a ruling to be issued immediately so they can file an appeal. 
His attorneys also say any further delay could complicate their appeal with the Utah Supreme Court, and his upcoming commutation hearing with the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole, scheduled to begin Wednesday. 
“Because that oral argument is scheduled for ten days from today, if this Court denies the Petition to Reevaluate Competency, there will likely be insufficient time for briefing and argument before the Supreme Court on that date. Such a delay could effectively deny Mr. Menzies his due process right to adequate review,” the motion, filed on Monday, reads.

The applicant pool includes former Ethics Commission Chair Paul Richard, who was among the first crop of commissioners to serve on the board. Richard stepped down last year after five years of service.
He said he applied to finish the term of former chair Dave Anderson, who died unexpectedly in May. Anderson was also one of the first members of the commission. Richard said he could help fill in the experience gap that Anderson leaves behind.
“At the end of the day, I’m available if they want me,” he said.

Whoever fills Anderson’s seat would begin as soon as possible and finish out his term, which ends Aug. 31, 2026.
Another opening is for Ward Koeser’s seat. Koeser will leave the commission at the end of August, and his successor will serve a four-year term beginning Sept. 1.
Commissioner Murray Sagsveen’s term also ends this month, though he is seeking to be reappointed. The Ethics Commission sent a letter to the Governor’s Office expressing support for Sagsveen’s reappointment.
Members of the Ethics Commission are selected based on a consensus vote of the governor and the Senate majority and minority leaders.
The appointments come at a time when the governor and Ethics Commission have been openly at odds over the role of the regulatory agency.

The Ethics Commission was created through a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2018. It’s tasked with enforcing ethical behavior in the areas of elections, lobbying, corruption and transparency.
Commissioners’ duties include adopting ethics rules, investigating alleged violations and issuing advisory opinions to help public officials navigate ethical issues. They are paid a stipend for every day they meet, plus reimbursement for travel.

“I knew nothing would come easy, but I never doubted my right to the American dream,” Turek said in the video. “Sitting in my wheelchair nine years old, watching the Olympics, I dreamed of winning gold for my country, too. In 2016 I did just that.”
After his 2016 and 2020 wins on the U.S. wheelchair basketball team for the Paralympic Games, Turek won election to represent Iowa House District 20 in the 2022 election by a margin of 6 votes after a recount. He won reelection in the 2024 election by 5% against his Republican challenger.
Turek said his wins in the Paralympics and in politics have come from support through the AEAs and other state programs, as well as his father’s Veterans Affairs health coverage. He cited former U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin as a figure in Iowa politics who “made sure that the doors were open for kids like me” — but said Iowa’s current representation in Washington is “just closing doors.”
Ernst is putting programs and services at risk that supported his family growing up, Turek said. He pointing to her comment, “Well, we all are going to die,” at a May town hall responding to a person criticizing the Medicaid cuts included in the GOP budget reconciliation bill.
In a statement on his campaign launch, Turek said he wants to support farms and small businesses and focus on bringing down the cost of health care, prescription drugs and housing.
“Instead of cutting Medicaid for thousands of Iowans, we should make it easier for people to afford health care and address the growing rates of cancer,” Turek said. “Joni Ernst went to Washington and forgot about fighting for us. Now she’s helping her party make life worse for working people while the wealthy and big corporations thrive. I’m running for Senate to stick up for Iowans, not billionaires.”
Ernst has not said if she plans to run for another term in the 2026 election, though on Sunday she told reporters at the Iowa State Fair Sunday an announcement will be “coming soon.” Though not officially in the race, Ernst has support from GOP Senate leadership to run again, and has hired a campaign manager.
Turek must also compete with a field of Democratic candidates who are vying to become the party nominee in the midterms. Fellow state legislators Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville; state Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City, are running for the seat, as are Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris and former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage. There are also two Republicans running in the primary to challenge Ernst — Jim Carlin, a former state lawmaker, and Joshua Smith, who has previously run for public office as a Libertarian.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/turek3.18.25-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-12 17:57:29.799477

 “We will be looking overnight at our storage capacity and how we’re trending and we’ll have an update tomorrow morning,” a public works official said.

Burlington officials continue to monitor water levels after the city issued its first water conservation notice this year asking residents to “limit non-essential water usage” and “delay other important water-intensive tasks.”
Sent by email and posted online, the alert went out Tuesday after the water in a Colchester tank fell 2 feet below the minimum desired water level by midday, according to Chapin Spencer, the city’s director of public works.
While that may not sound like a lot, Spencer said it is important to maintain high levels in the water tanks because the 7 million gallon reservoir and its tanks serve the University of Vermont and UVM Medical Center’s Level 1 trauma center — in addition to other city residents and businesses. 
“So we clearly need to make sure we’re able to serve any fire or emergency,” he said.
To that end, the alert asks residents in Burlington and Colchester to help conserve water by delaying outdoor watering, turning off taps and reducing the time of showers, dish washing and teeth brushing. It also asks users to delay laundry and dishwashing until a full load can be run, and to avoid peak times: after 8 p.m. and before 6 a.m.
The advisory applies to customers who receive a water bill from Burlington Water Resources or Colchester Fire District 2, which the city also serves. The reservoir and tanks serve about 10,000 customers in Burlington and about 2,800 in Malletts Bay.
The water level dropped because people use more water during heat waves and because the aging pumps that supply a water tower in Colchester stopped functioning Tuesday morning, according to Spencer.
“We did an emergency repair on one and so the water tower level is going back up in Colchester, but our ability to fully fill both the water tower and our reservoir are dependent on people not using as much water,” he said.
Burlington’s water infrastructure is aging and the two pumps that failed are about 25 years old, he said. One has been repaired and the department is working to fix the second one. There is no estimate of how long the advisory will be in place and the department will continue to monitor water levels daily.
“We will be looking overnight at our storage capacity and how we’re trending and we’ll have an update tomorrow morning,” Spencer said. “The best place to check, besides social media, is our website.”
Failing pumps and water conservation alerts are not common. In his 12 years, Spencer said Tuesday’s alert is the first time the city has issued a water conservation notice during peak summer.
Residents have reached out with queries but have mostly been understanding, he added.
“We have a great customer base. I think everybody understands intuitively that when there’s a heat wave like this that our water system is stressed,” he said.

Josh Shapiro nominated Carrie Rowe on Feb. 18 to serve as Pennsylvania's secretary of education. (Photo courtesy of www.pa.gov)State acting Education Secretary Carrie Rowe’s nomination has cleared a key legislative panel.
Rowe, who was nominated to serve as the acting secretary by Gov. Josh Shapiro in February, was unanimously approved by the state Senate Education Committee during a vote on Tuesday afternoon.
“I do believe that education is a powerful equalizer when it is accessible, just, and shaped by individuals who understand the many needs that students face,” Rowe said during the committee meeting. “And I look forward to working with you to give every student the opportunity to succeed and to chart their own course as we make Pennsylvania a leader in public education.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Rowe, a product of Pennsylvania public schools and universities, has worked her way up through the public school ranks in the state over the past 25 years. She started her career as a Spanish teacher in the Pittsburgh Public School District and later served as the superintendent of the Beaver Area School District.
Before taking over as acting secretary, Rowe served as the deputy secretary of elementary and secondary education at the department.
Sen. Dawn Keefer (R-York), who delivered introductory remarks for Rowe during the committee meeting, said the acting secretary’s work has included oversight of initiatives related to structured literacy, workforce readiness, teacher recruitment and retention, and student mental health.
“Over more than two decades, as was previewed for you, I have gone through everything from being a Spanish teacher in an urban location and a suburban location, being a principal in a middle school, a superintendent, deputy secretary, and so many things in between that have kind of brought me to this moment,” Rowe said. “Each of those things allows me to come to this moment with a desire to bridge policy and the practice that our teachers need every day in the classroom.”
If confirmed, Rowe said her top priorities are structured literacy and student safety.

“Expanding free school meals, strengthening college and career pathways and ensuring transparency to meet the needs of our students would certainly be additional things that I would want to focus on,” she added.
The next hurdle for Rowe’s nomination will be the Senate Rules and Executive Nominations Committee, a spokesperson from Sen. Lynda Schlegel Culver’s office told the Capital-Star on Tuesday afternoon. If the panel advances the nomination, it will go to the full Senate for a vote to formally confirm her to the position.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Months after its introduction and amidst scrutiny into Iowa universities’ compliance with anti-diversity, equity and inclusion policies, the Iowa Board of Regents has revised its academic freedom policies to include caveats on how certain topics can be taught.
The Iowa Board of Regents approved changes Tuesday to its policies relating to academic freedom and treatment of syllabi to include sections about “controversial subjects” and how they should be treated by faculty and students.
Under the new policy, faculty are allowed to teach controversial topics as long as they are connected to course content and taught in a way that “fosters critical thinking and avoids indoctrination of one perspective.” Instruction must also reflect debate on the topic and different scholarly views.
Board President Sherry Bates said during Tuesday’s meeting the new policy demonstrates a more comprehensive approach to ensuring academic freedom and protection from indoctrination, something board members asked for when discussing previously proposed policy. However, if word comes that the policy is not being followed, Bates said, the board will conduct an audit into the incident and take action if necessary.
“If the board office audit determines the policy is not being followed, I will not be passive in addressing the problem. I will set up a task force of board members to correct the situation and ensure compliance with the policy,” Bates said. “Ensuring that our students can learn and think for themselves is paramount to our mission.”

Another approved policy change added language to the board’s rules on syllabi posting that requires students’ grades be determined by their understanding and application of course content rather than their perspective on viewpoints expressed in the class.
Big differences between first, final policies
A first — and very different — draft of the policy changes was introduced at the board’s June meeting, where it was met with upset from students, staff, members of the public and lawmakers.
Universities would have been restricted from requiring students to take courses with “substantial content that conveys DEI or CRT” under the original policy draft, which critics called unlawful censorship of classroom instruction. Regent David Barker said during the June meeting he believed the policy was an “important first step” in eliminating distrust in higher education and ensuring students wouldn’t be taught opinions or controversial ideas as fact.
After deciding to slow down the process of approving the policy at its June meeting and once again delaying the decision in July, the board released a draft of the new policy proposal last week.
Barker said Tuesday he believes the policy proposal was improved by the removal of references to diversity, equity and inclusion and critical race theory, and that the latter subject is an academic area that has its place in certain classes.
“The point of this policy is to teach things in a balanced manner,” Barker said. “If some controversial policy is taught, students should be informed that this is controversial and they should have an understanding of both sides of it. But this policy is not about censoring. It’s not about saying there is anything that shouldn’t be taught.”
An amendment Barker introduced to include language stating “students shall have access to a clear, confidential and timely process to report concerns that instruction is not meeting these standards.” Also included in the amendment was the requirement that colleges investigate complaints, “promptly” report them to the board and “take corrective action when warranted.”
Barker brought up multiple videos that have surfaced in past weeks appearing to show officials at the University of Iowa and Iowa State University discussing anti-DEI laws and policies. Barker said while people are in disagreement about what these videos show, they are proof that, “at least until very recently,” campus culture was against state and federal law. This culture may have impacted students’ trust in current complaint processes, he said, and the board should create another.
Provosts at each state university said during the meeting they have complaint processes in place that are reviewed annually, and have students bring their concerns to the faculty in question before moving up the ladder.
Rachel Boon, chief academic officer with the board of regents, said the board office also has its own complaint process for those with First Amendment concerns that goes directly to Executive Director Mark Braun. Both Boon and Braun are also working to compile and review each of the universities’ avenues for filing a complaint to see whether they meet board standards and expectations, she said.
The amendment failed, with only Barker and Regent Christine Hensley voting in favor.
Regents express feelings on academic freedom
Regent Robert Cramer during the meeting said it is his “personal belief” that DEI and CRT topics shouldn’t be taught in classrooms because it is unhelpful to students who should be told their progress was due to their merit and not other reasons. Schools should look at individuals and “treat them all the same and give them that equal chance” to succeed, Cramer said, no matter their race or where they came from.
“My personal belief is that we don’t want, I wouldn’t — I don’t want any of the DEI, CRT, woke left stuff, you know, being taught in our classes,” Cramer said. “But I understand the difficulty of trying to, from the outside, trying to dictate what’s being taught, and I think we do believe in academic freedom, and, of course, freedom of speech. So I think addressing how things are taught is the right path.”
Regent Nancy Dunkel, the only board member to vote against approving the new policy, said with its passage, the “academic freedom” section of the board’s policy manual should be changed to “restrictions to academic freedom.”
The revisions suggested in the proposed policy are limitations on academic freedom rather than clarifications, Dunkel said, and include vague terms like “controversial” with no language saying how controversial content is deemed so, or who makes the decision. As one faculty member put in their email to Dunkel, she said, would this policy mean that professors must teach anti-capitalist theory in economics and anti-evolution arguments in biology, or even “present both sides of the Holocaust?”
“I want to uphold our present academic freedom policy, especially 3.10-F, which says, ‘Regent universities shall not be or become an instrument of partisan political action,’” Dunkel said. “The expression of partisan political opinions and viewpoints shall be those of individuals, not institutions, because the official adoption of any political position, whether favored by a majority or a minority, tends to substitute biased information that hinders the continuing search for truth.”

,DC,2025-08-12 21:25:07+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump’s mass deportations opened the door for deploying National Guard in D.C.,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trumps-mass-deportations-opened-door-deploying-national-guard-dc,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s move to deploy 800 National Guard members in the District of Columbia over claims that crime is plaguing the city – despite historic lows –  follows his use of the military in his administration's growing immigration crackdown.“(D.C.’s) out of control, but we're going to put it in control very quickly, like we did on the southern border,” Trump said at a Monday press conference where he was flanked by members of his Cabinet, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. He vowed to do the same in more cities governed by Democrats.Trump’s return to the White House was led by a campaign promise of mass deportations, tying newly arrived immigrants at the southern border with high crime rates and the need to use troops to detain and remove those migrants.Since Inauguration Day, the president has sent thousands of National Guard members to be stationed at the U.S.-Mexico border and has militarized strips of land along the border, putting migrants into contact with military personnel.Trump’s deployment of the California National Guard in June in response to unrest over immigration raids was seen as a test case for use of the state-based military forces. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California wrote on X on Monday that Trump “was just getting warmed up in Los Angeles” with that order.“He will gaslight his way into militarizing any city he wants in America,” Newsom said. “This is what dictators do.”‘Quick Reaction Force’Now the Trump administration is evaluating plans to establish a “Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force” composed of 600 National Guard members to remain on stand-by in order to be quickly deployed to any U.S. city undergoing a protest or other civil unrest within an hour, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.The groups, who would be armed with riot gear and other weapons, would be split evenly between Alabama and Arizona, according to the Post.The DOD proposal also calls for a rotation of service members from Army and Air Force National Guard units based in Alabama, Arizona, California, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Tennessee, according to the Post.National Guard members are typically in reserve and are some of the first responders to natural disasters.The Department of Defense and the National Guard did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment about the “Quick Reaction Force” plans. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Which cities are next?At the Monday press conference, Trump specifically cited four cities that could see similar National Guard movements: Baltimore, Chicago, New York City and Oakland – all heavily Democratic cities led by Black mayors. Violent crime in all those cities has continued to trend downward, according to each city's police database.Baltimore County, Maryland, Cook County, Illinois, New York City and the entire state of California also all are on a new “sanctuary jurisdiction” list issued by the Department of Justice on Aug. 5. They are identified as “having policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”But, unlike the district, where the president has control over the National Guard, state governors, under the law, have had control over their National Guard members.Additionally, while Trump has seized control of the 3,400 officers in the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department for 29 days due to the district's Home Rule Act, experts don’t see how that can legally be done with other local police departments.“What they are doing in D.C. cannot be replicated outside of D.C. All of this is only possible because D.C. is not a state,” said Joseph Nunn, a counsel in the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program. “There's no playbook for them to do what they seem to want to do outside of D.C.”

On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified Trump’s statements about sending in National Guard members into cities.“The president is speaking about what he’d like to see take place in other cities across the country,” she said. “When the time comes we’ll talk about that. Starting with our nation's capital is a great place to begin and it should serve as a model.”Trump said he hoped other cities were “watching.”“Maybe they’ll self clean up and maybe they'll self do this and get rid of the cashless bail thing and all of the things that caused the problem,” the president said.Nunn said that even if the president were to federalize a state’s National Guard, those members would be subject to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which generally bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.“There is no statutory exception to the Posse Comitatus Act that allows the military to participate in local law enforcement,” Nunn said.Los AngelesA trial is underway this week challenging the president’s move to federalize California National Guard members, in a suit filed by Newsom, after an appeals court temporarily upheld Trump’s move.The president deployed 4,000 members of the National Guard and 700 Marines to Los Angeles after protests erupted against aggressive immigration actions by masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conducting raids in Home Depot parking lots.But the legal issue before a San Francisco court is not if the president’s actions were unlawful, but on the political question of who has authority over the National Guard.Other governors in the states Trump mentioned as candidates for National Guard activation pushed back on the notion.Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore, who served in the U.S. Army, said in a statement that the president’s decision to call in the National Guard to the District of Columbia “lacks seriousness and is deeply dangerous.”Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the president could not send in the National Guard to Chicago.“Let’s not lie to the public, you and I both know you have no authority to take over Chicago,” he said.The conflict between Trump and the Democrats comes at the same time Newsom has threatened to launch a redistricting of California’s congressional districts in order to nullify Texas’ attempt to redraw maps to add more Republican seats to the U.S. House.And Pritzker is hosting in Illinois the Texas Democrats who left the state to prevent the state legislature from having a quorum after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session for redistricting.Military forcesSince taking office for his second term, the president has signed five executive orders that lay out the use of military forces within the U.S. borders and extend other executive powers to speed up Trump’s immigration crackdown.More funding also soon will be at hand for Trump’s mass deportations. The massive tax and spending cut bill enacted in July has as its centerpiece $170 billion for the administration's immigration crackdown. It bolsters border security, increases immigration detention capacity and adds fees to legal pathways for immigration, among other things. Thousands more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are slated to be hired.Some Republican governors have agreed to deploy their own National Guard members to aid the Trump administration in immigration enforcement, such as in Iowa and Tennessee. The secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, sent National Guard to the southern border in Texas when she was governor of South Dakota.Nunn said that while it’s not typically normal for states to use National Guard members for local policing there is some precedent, such as when New York had members stationed in the New York City subway.“What is unprecedented is the federal government using military personnel for sort of crime prevention, for regular policing,” Nunn said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-08-12 17:57:29.799477

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)A Republican state House member has filed a campaign finance complaint against a colleague, alleging thousands of dollars in illegal transactions using campaign funds.
Rep. Brandi Bradley, a Littleton Republican, filed the complaint against Rep. Ron Weinberg, a Loveland Republican, with the secretary of state’s office on Friday.
In the complaint, Bradley wrote that a social media account “made (her) aware of the gross negligence and the vast violations. An account on X with the handle @govtgrifters, which regularly posts about Colorado lawmakers’ spending, posted screenshots of expenditures included in Bradley’s complaint on July 1.

The complaint details expenditures as reported by Weinberg in required regular disclosures to the secretary of state’s office, including over $1,000 for various trips to a Loveland barbershop, about $2,500 to the University Club near the Colorado Capitol for meeting expenses, about $400 to a New Jersey cigar shop categorized as gifts and donations, about $675 at the Brown Palace hotel in Denver on the last day of this year’s legislative session, and about $2,000 as a donation to the Israeli soccer team Maccabi Tel-Aviv Football Club.
Bradley also listed donations to the Salvation Army, Sertoma Club of Loveland and Loveland Rotary Club.
Weinberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Colorado campaign finance law dictates that campaign funds should only be used for expenditures “reasonably related” to the election of the candidate in question or related to their official duties once elected. Unexpended contributions can be sent to a political party, donated to a charity, returned to the donor, used for political issue education or used for a campaign for a different office. Many of the expenditures in question are listed as meeting expenses or donations.
Bradley alleged that the donation to the Israeli soccer team violated both state and federal law. The club has a foundational arm, however, that runs programs for at-risk and special needs children, and Weinberg’s expenditure lists the address that the foundation recommends donors send checks to.
The secretary of state’s office has 10 days to review the initial complaint and dismiss it, allow Weinberg to cure the violations, or decide to do a deeper investigation.

They were joined by Arkansas junior U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton and state Education Secretary Jacob Oliva on tours of Little Rock’s Don R. Roberts Elementary School and Saline County Career and Technical Campus in Benton.
“I wanted to be in places where I could actually see some of the things that I talked about at work,” McMahon said in Saline County. “Not necessarily everybody has to go to a four-year school. There are places like this that would be sponsored from the tech field, where students can earn dual credits, go right into community college, go right to work in the field. … This is the secret sauce.”
McMahon and Cotton both alluded to the need to rid schools of red tape and bureaucracy. President Donald Trump has said he plans on shuttering the U.S. Department of Education to give states more power over education and wants McMahon to put herself out of her own job — a plan McMahon has supported.
Sanders also touted the expansion of the state’s Educational Freedom Account program to around 50,000 students in Arkansas this year. The program, which is open to all Arkansas students for the first time this fall, provides state funding for allowable education expenses, such as private school tuition.
While Sanders and McMahon focused on the positive during their two stops, a handful of protestors outside Roberts Elementary held signs criticizing the state’s LEARNS Act and McMahon. The wide-ranging 2023 law made several changes to the state’s K-12 education system, including creating the school voucher program and raising the state’s minimum teacher salary to $50,000

“The parents of [Roberts Elementary] were incredibly upset when the letter was sent home yesterday … that she would be here,” said Courtney Jackson, a mother of two. She said she didn’t want her children to find out she just stood by while public education was under attack.
“The parents of this school do not want her here,” Jackson said.
Alison Metzler, another protesting parent, said she kept her kids home from school Tuesday because she didn’t want them to be used as “political pawns” by Sanders and McMahon.
“Sarah Huckabee and McMahon are actively trying to dismantle public education, and they do not care about public education. This is all for show, and it’s, it’s just disgusting,” Metzler said. “If Sarah Huckabee really stood with public education, her kids would go to public schools. Instead, they go to the private school a mile down the road, and she’s defunding these exact schools.”
Metzler also criticized Sanders and McMahon for visiting the “whitest affluent school in the Little Rock School District, a top school in the state.” She said she loved the school as a parent with a child who attended, but that if Sanders was really committed to public education, she would be visiting struggling schools in other parts of Little Rock.

This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing, and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware, and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.
In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
 Many microschools aren’t accredited

Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
 ‘Microschooling is not one thing’

Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
 Seeking choices

After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

William Kelly, through his attorney, filed a motion in June seeking the relief, which was denied Monday by Judge Geoffrey Crawford.

A federal judge has denied a request by a Florida man convicted in the EB-5 scandal that played out in northern Vermont to shorten his time on court-ordered supervised release.
Judge Geoffrey Crawford issued a one-paragraph order Monday rejecting the request filed in June in U.S. District Court in Burlington by an attorney for William Kelly to end his three-year term of supervised release a year early.
Crawford wrote in the order that Kelly’s supervised release had been transferred in March 2024 to Florida, where Kelly, 76, resides. As a result, the judge added, Kelly could make a request to a federal court in Florida to change his period of supervised release. 
Robert Goldstein, an attorney for Kelly, declined comment Tuesday.
Kelly, who prosecutors termed the “consummate fixer” who tried to “outwit” regulators when they were investigating the scandal, was eventually indicted on criminal charges in 2019 along with two of his business partners. 
Those two men were Ariel Quiros, the former owner of Jay Peak ski resort, and Bill Stenger, Jay Peak’s former president and CEO. 
All three were indicted on federal criminal charges and later reached plea deals in connection with their roles in a proposed $110 million biomedical research facility slated for Newport in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom. The project never got off the ground and was later termed “nearly a complete fraud” by regulators. 
The case left many foreign investors out of their investment and no way to meet the job-creating requirements to secure U.S. residency, or green cards, they were seeking through the EB-5 visa program.
All three men were later sentenced to prison, with Kelly receiving an 18-month term, which he has since served. He was also ordered to serve three years on supervised release, which requires regular check-in with authorities and certain travel restrictions.
Kelly was also required to make monthly payments on the $8.3 million in restitution included in his sentencing. 
The motion seeking an early end from supervised release stated Kelly “worked diligently to rebuild and contribute positively” to the community.  
“His family, church, and community have all been vital in his transformation, and he takes pride in trying to give back to his community in meaningful ways,” the filing stated.

(Photo via Google Earth)A veterinary technician who allegedly stole drugs from the clinic where she worked and a rural veterinarian accused of unlawfully distributing controlled substances have been sanctioned by the state.
According to the Iowa Board of Veterinary Medicine, veterinary technician Katherine Schwartz repeatedly stole prescription drugs from the clinic where she worked. The drugs, which Schwartz allegedly took for her personal use, included codeine, Zorbium and hydrocodone.
The board alleges that several signs of possible substance abuse by Schwartz were discovered during its investigation of the matter, and it alleged she had deleted security-camera footage from the clinic and stolen a key to a drug safe at the clinic.
According to the board, Schwartz has admitted the theft.
The board has not disclosed where or when the alleged thefts took place, or where Schwartz lives, although police records indicate she lives in Solon and the thefts occurred at the Animal Kingdom Veterinary Clinic, 620 Liberty Way, North Liberty.
According to the board, Schwartz was charged with unlawful possession of a prescription drug, a serious misdemeanor, and at some point pleaded guilty to the charge.
There are no public court records related to the criminal case, most likely because of the deferred judgment that the board says she was granted at sentencing. A deferred judgment typically results in a conviction being wiped from public court records after the successful completion of probation.
Citing the alleged conviction, the board charged Schwartz with knowingly making misleading or untrue representations in the practice of the profession; committing an act contrary to honesty, justice or good morals, and an inability to practice veterinary medicine with reasonable skill and safety.
In order to resolve the case, the board agreed to a settlement that placed Schwartz’s veterinary technician certification on probation for the duration of her criminal case probation, which appears to have already been terminated. During her probation, Schwartz was required to submit to monthly testing for substance abuse.
Although the board entered into the agreement with Schwartz in April, the charges against her and the settlement were made public only this week in response to a formal request for access to the records.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to locate Schwartz for comment.
Brooklyn vet sanctioned by board
Another veterinary board case from April that was first made public this week involves Eric Smith, a veterinarian from the Farm & Family Veterinary Clinic in Brooklyn, Iowa.
In April, the board charged Smith with violating a law related to the practice of veterinary medicine, willful or repeated failure to conform to acceptable standards of practice, and willful or repeated violations of the law or state regulations.
The charges stem from actions taken last year by the Iowa Board of Pharmacy, which issued an emergency order suspending Smith’s pharmacy license, stating he posed “an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare.” The board also charged Smith with four counts of alleged violations of Iowa laws governing the practice of pharmacy and the distribution of drugs.
In the pharmacy board case, Smith eventually agreed to have his pharmacy license placed on probation for two years and pay a $1,000 civil penalty.
The veterinary board reported that in March 2024, it fielded a complaint that alleged Smith was providing controlled substances to a dog breeding operation, rather than to the individual canine patients, without proper documentation or detailed records documenting the distribution of the drugs.
As with the pharmacy board case, the veterinary board’s case against Smith was resolved with a settlement agreement that imposes a two-year period of probation on his license and a $1,000 civil penalty.
Smith did not immediately return a call to his clinic on Tuesday.

Flood barriers have been installed since last year's flooding, but city officials are still asking for voluntary evacuations of the area. (Photo courtesy of City and Borough of Juneau)Officials in Alaska’s capital city are asking residents to voluntarily evacuate from parts of the Mendenhall Valley ahead of an expected glacial flood this week.
Last year’s flood damaged more than 290 homes in the valley, a largely suburban district of Juneau that is located near the Mendenhall Glacier, and while city officials have constructed temporary barriers to deter future flooding, those barriers haven’t yet been tested in an actual emergency.
“We are issuing those evacuation advisories, because although we are extremely confident in the HESCO barriers’ capability to protect neighborhoods, we’re not willing to bet on that with anybody’s life — or safety,” said Ryan O’Shaughnessy, director of emergency programs for the City and Borough of Juneau.
The Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area, Alaska’s most-visited tourist destination, is preparing to shut down as well. The Nugget Falls Trail, the most-used pathway in the area, was closed to the public on Monday.
Officials from the U.S. Forest Service, which operates the glacier tourist site, did not participate in a media briefing Monday. Agencies at that briefing said the Mendenhall Glacier is short-staffed. The recreation site experienced widespread layoffs as part of a broader federal reduction in force earlier this year.
Late Sunday night, cellphones across Juneau rang with warning tones as city officials sent out an alert: Water has begun to overtop an ice dam that allows the creation of a glacial lake each summer.
Officials expect that within a week, the water will gush from the dam and into Mendenhall Lake, which lays at the glacier’s foot. From there, water will surge into the Mendenhall River and toward homes.
The first glacial outburst flood at Mendenhall Glacier happened in 2011, but the flooding was initially minor. Because the glacier is shrinking due to climate change, the floods have grown worse over time, culminating in last year’s disaster.
Aaron Jacobs, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service in Juneau, said this year’s ice dam is lower by 13 feet than it was last year, but the glacial lake — located in a place called Suicide Basin — contains about as much water as it did last year because melting ice elsewhere has increased the capacity of the basin.
“We’re expecting very similar volume estimates from last year,” he said.
That volume, about 16 billion gallons, weighs almost 67 million tons, the equivalent weight of 335 fully loaded container ships rushing through a normally placid river.
Eight inches of rain fell on and near the basin in recent days, Jacobs said, and hydrographs show that the level of Mendenhall Lake and River have risen.
That’s a little misleading: The lake and river will fall over the next few days as the rain diminishes, then will surge once the ice dam fails to contain the basin.
It isn’t clear how bad the resulting flood will be. That depends on things as varied as the tide, rainfall and the success or failure of the flood barriers.
O’Shaughnessy said officials will send out another emergency text alert to Juneau cellphones before the peak flood.
An emergency evacuation shelter has been set up at nearby Floyd Dryden school, and both state and local officials have issued preemptive disaster declarations as a precaution.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-12 20:57:51+00:00,CT Mirror,Treasurer: CT baby bonds target inequality; ‘Trump accounts’ don’t,P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/12/ct-baby-bonds-trump-accounts/,"For proponents of baby bonds in Connecticut, the 'Trump accounts' are an ineffective way to address wealth disparities.","As the White House celebrated the July 4 passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, President Donald J. Trump paused to commemorate one specific aspect of measure: the creation of new savings accounts that will give each newborn baby with a Social Security number, born between 2025 and 2028, $1000 that will grow in an account established by the government. 
Days later, Connecticut State Treasurer Erick Russell stood before an audience of his own to praise a different program aimed at investing in the state’s youth. Since 2023, Connecticut has run a “baby bonds” program, giving $3,200 to babies born to families eligible for the state’s Medicaid program HUSKY. 
Children can draw on the accounts once they turn 18, and can use the saved up money to pay for college, start a business, or make a down payment on a home. So far, more than 33,000 babies in the state are eligible for the program, the first state-level baby bonds program in the nation. 
Viewed from a distance, Trump accounts and Connecticut’s baby bonds could be viewed similarly. But as he spoke last month, Russell sought to make clear that the programs couldn’t be more different. 
“Baby bonds were created to narrow Connecticut’s generational wealth gap by investing directly in children from low-income families, whereas Trump Accounts advantage families who already have the ability to save, while leaving behind those who don’t,” Russell said. 
It’s a distinction the treasurer says is deeply important. As so-called “Trump Accounts”  have drawn considerable attention in recent months, supporters have argued that the accounts will help build the financial futures of America’s children, a goal shared by supporters of baby bonds initiatives.
But critics of the federal program say it falls short, arguing the savings program may not be as effective as more traditional accounts like 529 savings or a Roth IRA. And baby bonds proponents in places like Connecticut say Trump accounts won’t address economic disparities.
“It’s important to note that baby bonds are really about addressing wealth inequality,” Russell said in a recent interview. “And that is not what the Trump accounts are designed to do.”
A new federal savings account 
Trump accounts, also known as “MAGA accounts,” first drew attention this spring as discussions of the president’s budget reconciliation bill ramped up. 
The idea on its face seemed simple: Babies born between 2025 and 2028 would be given $1,000 by the federal government, which they wouldn’t be able to touch until they turn 18. Parents, employers, charities and other organizations can add extra money — up to $5,000 a year — on top of the federal government’s one-time contribution. 
The idea has had strong support among some prominent Republicans in Congress, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, of Texas, who is credited with bringing the idea to the president after hearing about it at a poker game.
If used to their full potential, proponents argue, the money could provide a significant launchpad for America’s youth. 
“Decades of research has shown that giving children a financial head start profoundly impacts their long-term success. With these accounts, children will be much more likely to graduate from college, to start a business, to buy a home, and achieve lifelong financial stability,” Dell CEO Michael Dell said in a statement earlier this year.  
The idea behind Trump Accounts isn’t new. For years, politicians in Congress, most notably New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley have promoted a bill called the American Opportunity Accounts Act, which sought to give each child in the country $1,000, with additional contributions each year working on a progressive scale. The bill is seen as a more traditional form of the wealth building proposal known as “baby bonds.”
Baby bonds have been proposed at various points in the past few years, with economists arguing they can help address wealth disparities in ways that more traditional financial advice cannot. 
“We know that income, hard work, and savings behavior are not enough to achieve true financial independence for those who start with fewer resources,” said David Radcliffe, state and local policy director for the Institute on Race Power and Political Economy at the New School. “The power of baby bonds is the focus on the endowment itself, substantial seed capital for wealth building activities that will drive economic security.”
Traditionally, baby bonds programs focus on making larger investments for those at lower income levels, using government investment to help close the nation’s yawning racial wealth gap.
That federal money would be used is a given, says Radcliffe, who previously worked as a policy director for former Connecticut state treasurer Shawn Wooden. “One could argue, it’s through government design of policy over generations that has in many ways created the situation that we’re now in where certain groups, particularly people of color — black and Hispanic, indigenous folks — have been excluded from policies that have otherwise, you know, generated the wealth to create a middle class,” he said.
Trump accounts however, do something different. Rather than focus on wealth disparities, the accounts provide an equal investment for each child. The ability to save in the accounts then depends on how much money each child’s family can contribute: Wealthier families may have the resources to contribute more, while poorer families contribute less.
Federal policy experts focused on the wealth gap and youth saving say that this difference could create issues down the line. 
“The reality for American families is that a third of them don’t have $2,000 in an emergency savings account,” said Madeline Brown, a senior policy associate at the Urban Institute. “So the idea that every family is going to be able to contribute to this type of program is just not borne out by the reality of the financial situation of many American families.”
In Connecticut, baby bonds focus on vulnerable
When Connecticut passed its first-in-the-nation baby bonds program in 2023, the focus was on investing in the state’s poorest families. That focus, Russell explained in a July interview with the Connecticut Mirror, is deeply intentional.
“If you look at most of the work that we’re doing in Connecticut, it’s about thinking about this more holistically, and thinking about it longer term,” he said. “And I think we’ve seen that in the need, frankly, to continue to invest in communities.”
As a result, the Connecticut program makes an investment that proponents argue is more progressive, giving money to low-income children that can be used once they turn 18 to pay for education, a down payment, or starting a business. The $3,200 investment could grow to anywhere between $10,000 to $24,000 according to the treasurer’s office. 
Trump accounts meanwhile, could grow to just over $3,000 for families unable to add money, to more than $100,000 for families who can afford to max out the annual contribution each year. 
Russell explains that with wealth disparities continuing to widen in the state, “it is really critical that we’re looking at real ways to address wealth inequality and truly lift people up.”
Connecticut’s baby bonds experiment is underway. 
The state will continue to fund the program for the next decade. The treasurer’s office is currently working on an ambassador program that will provide additional resources to baby bonds-eligible communities, and also provide feedback to the state about what additional needs are. 
And the idea is continuing to gain traction: Baby bonds proposals are currently being considered in more than a dozen other states. 
Russell says that financial investment, whether through baby bonds, Trump Accounts, or another program, is just one aspect of addressing the needs of vulnerable communities. 
“The economy is going to be stronger if we are investing in people who can participate, who can contribute,” he said. “This is about investing in the future workforce, about these resources going back into our communities.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024_0626_THM_ITRErickRussell-5-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 17:57:29.799477

Berman introduced his candidacy Tuesday with a video shot on a mobile phone that stresses his working class background and rural Wisconsin upbringing.

“I’m running for Congress because Bryan Steil isn’t looking out for families like mine,” Berman says in the video. “We deserve a government that works for us, not the elite.”
Berman worked as a nurse at the Milwaukee VA hospital for 10 years and in the video highlights his service to military veterans.
He told the Wisconsin Examiner on Tuesday that he left the job when he decided to run for Congress because the federal Hatch Act bars federal employees from running for partisan  office.
The father of two and a 15-year resident of the 1st Congressional District, Berman said concern for his daughters “about whether or not they have the ability to make their own health care decisions” motivated his run for the seat.
“Seeing the cuts to the VA and just the overall gutting of Medicaid in general has also prompted me to get into this race,” he said. Cuts to Medicaid and the SNAP federal nutrition aid program were part of the Republican budget reconciliation bill that Steil voted for and President Donald Trump signed on July 4.
“These things were made for tax cuts for billionaires,” Berman said, adding that in the process, Congress added $3.5 trillion to the federal budget deficit instead of  reducing it.
“I think the No. 1  issue that we need to focus on is affordability,” Berman said. “And I think that umbrella covers many different issues … decreasing the cost of child care, decreasing the cost of health care, decreasing the cost at the grocery store.”
As of July 30, the Cook Political Report rated the 1st District a likely Republican win in 2026 with a 2-point edge for the incumbent, Steil. Cook defines seats rated “likely” for one or the other party as “not considered competitive at this point” but adds that they “have the potential to become engaged.”
Berman said he believes his life experiences will attract voters.
“I’ve lived paycheck to paycheck. I had to work three jobs in college,” Berman said. “I was a first-generation college student. I graduated with student loan debt. My wife and I, we struggled with fertility issues and our children are a blessing of IVF [in vitro fertilization]. So a lot of these kitchen table concerns for people, a lot of these things that people care about close to home, are things that I’ve experienced.”
Berman said he followed news accounts of Steil’s July 31 public event in Elkhorn, where the congressman was met with an angry, noisy crowd and questioners who loudly pushed back on many of his comments.
“I think that’s a good representation of people’s dismay and how upset they are in how Bryan Steil … his lack of representation for the district.”
A first-time political candidate, Berman said he’s been active in local politics as a volunteer, including filing a successful lawsuit that charged the Town of Raymond School District violated the state open meetings law in holding a school board retreat in 2022. The suit was settled in December 2024.
The school district was also embroiled in a dispute among parents over its  social-emotional learning curriculum and the firing of a popular principal. Berman was a leader in a campaign to recall two board members who opposed the curriculum. One of the board members resigned before the recall vote was held, while the other survived the recall election.
“Everyone in my community, everyone I’ve talked to about this opportunity, has been very encouraging,” Berman said.
A reliably Democratic seat in the 1970s and ‘80s, the 1st District has remained in GOP hands since 1994, despite recurring attempts by Democrats to unseat Republican incumbents. The seat was held for two decades by former Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Janesville), who rose to become U.S. House speaker before leaving office at the end of 2018.
Steil, a corporate lawyer who previously worked as Ryan’s aide, won his first term against Bryce with more than 54% of the vote to Bryce’s 42%. He won his two most recent races by similar margins. He beat former state Department of Revenue Secretary Peter Barca 54-44 in 2024 and Ann Roe, now a Wisconsin state representative from Janesville, 54-45 in 2022.

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.




This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.


– Christopher R. McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida



Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Self-driving cars aren’t here yet, but states are getting the rules ready

Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

Zeldin made the announcement at the Iowa State Fair and said the current DEF regulations were “unacceptable.” 
“It is unacceptable that farmers, truckers, construction workers, and many other small businesses continually experience failures of diesel-powered equipment when they need it most — costing millions of dollars in lost productivity,” Zeldin said in a statement.

DEF is added to exhaust streams to help reduce the nitrous oxide emissions of burning diesel fuel. EPA rolled out requirements for DEF in the mid 2000s and early 2010s, ensuring that on-road diesel trucks and off-road equipment, like tractors or bulldozers, were equipped with systems that would reduce speed or power of the machinery in the event the machine ran out of DEF. 
According to a press release from EPA these regulations brought the machinery in line with the agency’s emission standards, but caused “significant disruptions in logistics, agriculture, and construction.” In many cases a DEF sensor failure would cause a vehicle to derate to as slow as 5 miles per hour or become inoperable. 
Zeldin’s announcement tasks new diesel on-road trucks, beginning with model year 2027, to be engineered such that running out of DEF will not cause “sudden and severe” power losses. 
EPA has also created guidance to help manufacturers make software changes that will similarly prevent DEF derating on vehicles that are already in use. 
U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, called the previous DEF regulations a “Green New Deal” type of regulation that brought tractors to a halt. 
“The previous arbitrary diesel exhaust fluid system guidelines severely hurt farmers, truckers, and small businesses that rely on diesel powered trucks,” Ernst said in a statement. “Not only will the new guidelines save family-run farms hundreds of millions every year, but it is also simply common sense.”
Nitrous oxide, which DEF helps to reduce from diesel exhaust, is categorized by the EPA as having atmospheric warming qualities 265 times greater than carbon dioxide. It also says that 40% of global nitrous oxide emissions come from human activities. 
Zeldin’s plan would not completely eliminate DEF systems, but would significantly extend the amount of time between when the system fails and when machinery capacity is reduced. 
U.S. Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler was also at the Iowa State Fair with Zeldin for the announcement and said family farms will save an estimated $727 million annually as a result of the change.
““The Trump Administration is fighting for farmers and truckers, as evidenced by the EPA’s new DEF guidance which is a big win for the millions of small businesses who rely on diesel engines – and who have been crushed by years of costly Green New Scam regulations,” Loeffler said in a statement.
This action comes weeks after EPA officials submitted a proposal to ditch a long-held standing that greenhouse gas emissions threaten the environment and public health.

Ron DeSantis during a news conference in the Capitol on Feb. 3, 2025. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Tuesday that he filled a vacant judgeship — a vacancy that spurred a now-dropped lawsuit in the Florida Supreme Court.
A day after the American Civil Liberties Union dropped its lawsuit claiming DeSantis violated the Florida Constitution by not filling a vacant judgeship, the governor sent out a news release announcing he has appointed Kristine Van Vorst as judge for the Eighth Judicial Circuit Court.
DeSantis did fill vacant judgeship before deadline, despite ACLU lawsuit

The administration had already disclosed the Aug. 1 appointment in legal papers filed with the court but the news release lets the public in on the news.
The ACLU, in the Supreme Court on Aug. 8, argued that DeSantis did not respond to “repeated” inquiries on the status of the judgeship before it filed the lawsuit, nor did his office issue a press release at that time about the appointment.
The governor’s news release does not state the date of the appointment. “Today, Governor Ron DeSantis announces one judicial appointment,” it says.
The Aug. 1 appointment came, two days before the constitutionally required deadline. Governors are obligated to appoint a judge within 60 days of receiving a list of nominees.
The circuit includes Alachua, Baker, Bradford, Gilchrist, Levy, and Union counties.
The difference between an appointment before or after Aug. 18 would’ve been the difference between the new judge’s first election happening in 2026 or 2028, the ACLU contended, potentially giving the appointee an “extra two unlawful years” to serve before an election.

(Courtesy of South Dakota Highway Patrol)Traffic and injury accidents were up while deaths and arrests were down during the recently concluded Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.
The 85th annual event began Aug. 1 and continued through Sunday. The increased traffic followed a trend of higher attendance in round-numbered anniversary years.
The South Dakota Department of Transportation’s automated traffic counters at nine locations in Sturgis logged 537,459 vehicles entering the city during the rally, which was up 11% compared with last year, according to final numbers published Tuesday. It was also an 11% increase over the previous five-year average.
With the increased traffic came a shift toward greater accident severity. The overall number of traffic accidents reported by the Highway Patrol in the Sturgis and Rapid City areas during the rally was 93, only four more than last year, but the number of injury accidents increased from 35 to 66, while the number of non-injury accidents fell from 54 to 27.

The increased traffic was also accompanied by more tickets and warnings. There were 1,524 citations issued by the Highway Patrol this year, up from 1,455 last year, and 4,959 warnings, up from 4,445.
Meanwhile, drunken driving arrests by troopers fell from 155 to 119, misdemeanor drug arrests dropped from 281 to 266, and felony drug arrests declined from 163 to 104.
The number of traffic deaths in the state potentially attributable to this year’s rally is at least six, according to a South Dakota Searchlight analysis, down from 12 last year. Searchlight counts any motorcycle-involved traffic death anywhere in the state, not only during the official dates but also during the days just before and after the rally.
That’s different from the Highway Patrol, which only counts crashes on official rally dates and only in western South Dakota, and therefore typically undercounts rally-related deaths. Using those parameters, the Highway Patrol counted four deaths this year and three last year.
Neither method includes deaths that occur in other states while bikers are traveling to or from the rally, or deaths in nearby states such as Wyoming, where there are rally-themed events that attract bikers to ride back and forth across the state line. This year, the Wyoming Highway Patrol reported three motorcycle-involved crash deaths from the day before the rally’s official start through the rally’s end. 
 



 Recent motorcycle crash deaths in SD

The following six motorcycle-involved traffic deaths occurred in South Dakota during the days leading up to and including the 2025 Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. All information is from the state Department of Public Safety, which includes the Highway Patrol.

Thursday, July 31: Anthony Michalicki, 70, of Pompano Beach, Florida, died from injuries suffered when the Harley Davidson he was driving just east of Deadwood on U.S. Highway 14A left the road and entered the ditch, separating him from the bike. 
Friday, Aug. 1: Manuel O. Acosta, 71, of Chicago, died from injuries he suffered when his westbound Harley Davidson began wobbling and fell down on Interstate 90 three miles east of Chamberlain, sending it into the ditch and separating him from the bike.
Saturday, Aug. 2: The 58-year-old male driver of a Harley Davidson (whose name has not yet been released) was traveling in the passing lane of U.S. Highway 16A in the Mount Rushmore area when he was unable to negotiate a curve and the bike tipped onto its side, slid and collided with three other motorcycles, killing the 58-year-old man and injuring the others.
Sunday, Aug. 3: Sturgis Police attempted to stop a 28-year-old man (whose name has not yet been released) on a Harley Davidson for exhibition driving near the Iron Horse Saloon, but the driver fled, resulting in a pursuit that ended when the motorcycle left the road and entered the ditch at mile marker 52 on U.S. Highway 14A, causing the man’s death the next day from injuries suffered in the crash. 
Monday, Aug. 4: A 60-year-old male driver (whose name has not yet been released) of a Harley Davidson on U.S. Highway 16A near mile marker 43 in the Black Hills slid into two other motorcycles while attempting to navigate a sharp corner, killing the 60-year-old and injuring his female passenger and the two other drivers.
Thursday, Aug. 7: The driver of a Toyota Tacoma pickup on state Highway 44 east of Rapid City made a left turn without seeing an approaching Honda CBR motorcycle, causing a crash that killed the motorcycle’s 23-year-old male driver (whose name has not yet been released) but did not injure the driver of the pickup.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GxtGz7QWIAAn1eH-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-12 16:57:13.167358

Wyoming newspaper executives Robb and Jen Hicks and Rob Mortimore announced Tuesday they’ve reached an agreement to purchase eight local newspapers to keep them running after a corporate owner shuttered them without warning last week.
“What better news could you get,” said Marie Hamilton, reporter and managing editor for two of the papers: the Platte County Record-Times and Guernsey Gazette. “There was a lot of tears, but good tears,” she said of the staff reaction to the announcement. 
The announcement comes six days after the Illinois-based News Media Corporation suddenly closed its publications in Niobrara, Goshen, Platte, Sublette and Uinta counties. The sale agreement calls for rehiring all newspaper staff and immediately resuming publication of all titles, according to Robb Hicks. 
“We are honored to assume stewardship of these legacy community newspapers,” he said in an announcement posted to the newspapers Facebook pages. “Our foremost priority has been to ensure that these counties are not left without a credible, enduring source of local journalism.”
Mortimore expressed “an immense debt of gratitude to JJ Tompkins,” the former owner, in the announcement. 
“Our foremost priority has been to ensure that these counties are not left without a credible, enduring source of local journalism.” Robb Hicks, Wyoming publisher
“It would have been far simpler for him to yield to the demands of creditors,” Mortimore said. “Instead, he chose to work with us to safeguard the future of these Wyoming communities, to preserve their newspapers, and to ensure that every employee was paid and retained.”   
An overwhelmed and overjoyed Hamilton described Mortimore as pulling a rabbit out of a hat and emphasized the value of the new in-state ownership. 
“He’s a Goshen boy,” she said, of Mortimore, who grew up in Torrington and has long worked at and run newspapers in the state. “Wyoming problems need Wyoming solutions from Wyoming people.” 
Mortimore will continue to serve as group publisher. The Hicks have owned and operated Buffalo Bulletin, where Robb is publisher and Jen Sieve-Hicks serves as executive editor, since 1996. The Hicks family has multigenerational ties to Wyoming newspapers, dating back seven decades, the announcement said.
The agreement follows News Media Corporation’s announcement  Wednesday that it was closing its doors immediately and “permanently” — abruptly shuttering newspapers in Wheatland, Torrington, Evanston, Pinedale, Kemmerer, Lusk, Lyman and Guernsey. The eight Wyoming newspapers, with 30 employees, were among about two dozen newspapers across five states that suddenly went dark. 
Mortimore was the publisher of Wyoming Newspapers Inc., a subsidiary of News Media Corporation. Although he oversaw News Media Corporation’s publications in Wyoming and Nebraska, he said last Wednesday’s shutdown came as a “shock” to him, alongside the employees he managed.
“This closure had nothing to do with the Wyoming newspapers,” Hamilton said. “All of our papers were profitable.”
Not willing to watch their communities become news deserts overnight, Mortimore and many laid-off employees started looking for ways to keep the newspapers going. Hamilton and other staff kept working, without pay, to keep the papers going. Under the purchase agreement, Hamilton expects to receive a paycheck by the end of this week. 
Marie Hamilton was the managing editor and primary reporter for The Platte County Record-Times until she and 29 other employees lost their jobs with the closure of eight Wyoming newspapers. “We’re not done — not by a long shot,” she posted on social media of efforts to rescue local news in eastern Wyoming. (Lisa Phelps)
“We will get a paycheck on Friday, which I said, ‘I don’t care. You just told me my newspaper’s back,'” Hamilton told WyoFile.
Mortimore and the Hicks were not alone in their quest to get the papers back up and running. 
Darcie Hoffland, executive director of the state’s newspaper trade group, the Wyoming Press Association, told WyoFile late last week that the association had been scrambling to help find a solution.
“There’s a lot of people who care about these communities [and] are working really, really hard to get the job, to get these papers open as quickly as possible,” she said.
State law says newspapers must publish an edition at least once a week to be deemed an “official” newspaper and eligible to print legal notices — a coveted source of revenue that’s helped sustain Wyoming newspapers. News Media Corporation owned a significant chunk of Wyoming’s legal newspapers — eight of 39.
The newspaper closures had towns and counties across the state looking at ways to post and publish legal notices, from posting them in their clerk’s offices to moving publication to other newspapers. 
The Pinedale Roundup broke its publishing streak last week after its Illinois-based parent company instructed staff to cancel the Roundup’s Aug. 7 print edition, which had already been reported, edited and designed. Roundup Managing Editor Cali O’Hare then broke the news of the closures on the paper’s Facebook page and website. Today, the eight newspapers had more news to break online, posting to their Facebook pages the newly inked new purchase agreement.
In last Wednesday’s memo to employees, News Media Corporation CEO J.J. Tompkins said the company would “make all reasonable efforts” to issue final paychecks, while health insurance coverage was terminated immediately. 
In the memo to employees, Tompkins cited “financial challenges, a significant economic downturn impacting our industry, revenue losses and increasing expenses, and the recent failure of an attempt to sell the company…” 
Mortimore had informed staff in late July that a potential plan to sell the company to the Alabama-based Carpenter Media Group was no longer in play.
Tompkins said the company had explored “every possible avenue” to continue operating, but “reached a point where continuing business is no longer feasible.”

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.
Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
 Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom

In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
 Public health concerns

Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.
“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
 State regulations

At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) Butler Hospital’s unionized workforce declared Tuesday that they made “movement” on wages and health plan costs to hospital owner Care New England during hours of negotiations last week.
Care New England CEO Michael Wagner chose a different noun for the union’s counterproposal in an email he wrote last week: “Ultimatum.”
The breakdown of harmony between management and the Providence psychiatric hospital’s roughly 700 members of SEIU 1199NE was apparent as members of the union’s bargaining committee held a Tuesday morning press conference outside the facility’s Blackstone Boulevard entrance.     
Asked by reporters if any bargaining talks were planned in the next week, registered nurse and bargaining committee member Dawn Williams said, “Right now, we do not have anything scheduled.”
Members of the union bargaining committee said they met for 18 hours on Aug. 6 with a federal mediator and Butler’s negotiating team. As day wound into night, union members said they offered two counterproposals in the spirit of settling the dispute. But at 3 a.m., union members said that the hospital team walked away from the bargaining table.  
“The process of coming up with the last two proposals that we did on Wednesday was…very painful,” Williams said. “It was very difficult because these aren’t numbers on a page. They represent a real impact on our people, our members, their lives, and their families.”
The strike will reach the 90-day mark this Friday, and is purported to be the longest hospital labor strike in state history. The hospital and union’s relationship soured after the March 31 expiration of the four contracts which covered Butler’s SEIU 1199NE members. Despite months of sporadic negotiations, plus the involvement of federal labor meditators, including in the most recent session, the two sides have not yet found a common ground to stand on. 
Tuesday’s press conference marked the first public, collective statement from the union since Butler announced Friday it would soon close an additional 29 beds in its addiction and detox unit.
Williams and other members of the Butler workforce’s bargaining committee emphasized they want to return to work but vowed the strike will continue as long as the hospital continues to propose what the union sees as inadequate compensation for the lowest-paid workers, such as clerical, dietary and sanitation staff. The starting pay would be $18.03 for these workers in the most recent hospital proposal from July 11. Union members voted to reject that proposal on July 29.   
“Our last two counterproposals brought us within $1.2 million, over four years, between our wage proposal and the employer’s proposal,” said Courtney Threats, a social worker and bargaining team member. “That’s $300,000 a year.”
Brooke Huminski, a social worker in the inpatient assessment center, told reporters that, in their latest counterproposal, the union was willing to accept a monthly premium of $110 monthly for workers with Health Savings Accounts (HSAs).
“That is considerable movement on a plan that I deeply value,” Huminski said, citing her own experience with a chronic illness that she was able to get adequate care for — without excessive medical debt — thanks to her employee health insurance. 
“We understand the cost of health care is rising all around us, so we’re willing to pay a little bit more to have a really good health insurance plan as well as to get this done,” Huminski said. “It’s been 90 days. Why are we still out here? We are ready to go back to work.”
“We’re ready to get back to work,” Williams echoed. “We’re ready to do the work that needs to be done to get a proposal. We are ready, but where are they? Why did they walk away? Why aren’t they ready? Why aren’t Butler Hospital and Care New England ready?”
Williams continued: “The answer is because it’s never been about money for them. It’s about power and greed. They want it all.”

Care New England says union walked back progress 
Hillary Lima, a spokesperson for Butler, said Tuesday afternoon that the hospital did not have any comment on the union’s morning press event, nor did she confirm whether the beds in Butler’s addiction unit are officially shuttered.
But Care New England CEO Michael Wagner certainly had a take on the Aug. 6 bargaining talks, per an email he sent to colleagues inside and outside his hospital system. 
Wagner’s Aug. 7 email, obtained by Rhode Island Current last week, tells a different side to the story. Wagner wrote that by 3 a.m., the union had reversed any progress made earlier in the day by giving “an ultimatum to accept a narrow and costly set of wage increases.”
“Critically, we were not given the opportunity to negotiate on other elements of the contract that might have allowed us to maintain a financially sustainable agreement,” Wagner wrote. “At that point, it became clear that SEIU was no longer negotiating in good faith and had abandoned any meaningful effort to reach an agreement.”
The union, Wagner argued, “was intent on shifting the goal posts” in the most recent bargaining session. 
A Butler website also noted in an Aug. 7 post that the bargaining talks lasted 15 hours, not 18.
Mike Raia, also a spokesperson for Butler, has previously denied the claim of absent leadership, and said in an Aug. 5 email that Wagner and Butler President and Chief Operating Officer Mary Marran attended multiple bargaining sessions with union leaders. 
Typically, Raia added, the hospital’s bargaining team has full authority to reach an agreement, and it’s normal for these teams to represent employers in collective bargaining talks. 
“The content of those [July] meetings were off-the-record but it is not at all accurate for SEIU to claim Butler has refused to meet,” Raia also said in a July 30 email.
Outside the hospital, Williams volleyed the responsibility of making the next move back toward management.
“They have the ball,” she said. “It’s their turn. It is their turn to make a move. We’ve made moves. It is their turn. They have the ball, they have our proposal. It is their turn.”

The residents reached out to several tenants rights organizations, but none could give a definitive answer as to whether hiking the rent 20% was legal.

This story by Emma Roth-Wells was first published in the Valley News on August 11.
WHITE RIVER JUNCTION — Lea Henderson expected the rent and utilities for the one-bedroom apartment she’s lived in for the past three years to go up 3% as defined in her annual lease.
So when Ledgeworks, the property management company based in Lebanon, sent her a lease renewal agreement in May that included a 20% rent hike for the unit at 112 South Main St. in downtown White River Junction near the Center for Cartoon Studies, Henderson, 26, was confused.
“Looks like there was a mistake here,” she wrote in a May 20 email to Ledgeworks, the company owned by Mike Davidson that manages his more than 300 residential units in the Upper Valley.
“I was expecting to sign a renewal for $1,287/month not $1,500/month. “
Cedar O’Dowd, 27, who’s lived for three years in a unit in 104 South Main St., the building next door to Henderson’s, is in the same position.
Both O’Dowd’s and Henderson’s leases, obtained by the Valley News, state: “the Base Rent shall be increased by 3% over the previous year’s Base Rent or by a percentage equal to the increase of the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U Boston) for the preceding year, whichever is greater.”

The CPI-U Boston was also 3% from May 2024 to May 2025, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But even after Henderson and O’Dowd both pointed out this clause in the lease, Ledgeworks refused to back down.
“The renewal we have sent you is the one we are still presenting to you. Please let us know your intentions,” a Ledgeworks employee wrote to Henderson on May 30.
The two residents reached out to several tenants rights organizations in Vermont and New Hampshire, but none could give a definitive answer as to whether raising the rent more than 3% is legal.

Because there is no binding legal precedent that interprets what the law is in this situation, “unfortunately, there isn’t a straightforward answer,” Rachel Batterson, an attorney at Vermont Legal Aid, said.
Since O’Dowd and Henderson’s leases expired July 31, it is unclear whether Ledgeworks could raise the rent more than 3% after the leases ended.
“I’m just not sure how a judge would interpret the actual situation where the (rent increase) notice was sent during the term of the lease while the 3% limitation was in,” Batterson said.
Ledgeworks put the 3% rent increase clause into the lease because the company tries “to be as predicable as possible for our residents and tenants,” Tim Sidore, Ledgeworks’ chief of operations, said in a Thursday phone interview.
“Typically, we try to keep increases as modest as possible, keeping in line with the cost of living and inflation,” he said. “Sometimes increases are higher than they are in other years.”
This year’s especially high rent increases are due to jumps in the cost of oil, propane, materials and labor, Sidore said.
“Given the dramatic rise of prices and inflation, rents must increase in order to cover costs,” he said.
The increases at the South Street buildings are meant to bring the units to “market rate.”
The units should cost closer to $1,645 a month, Sidore said. That rate would be considered affordable for someone making $61,450 a year, or 80% of the median income in Windsor County, according to the Vermont Housing Finance Authority.
Henderson, who works in the cafe at King Arthur Baking Company, makes about $44,000 a year.
“This apartment is not worth $1,500,” Henderson said in a phone interview last Thursday.
The units that O’Dowd and Henderson have lived in are both about 450 square feet, according to their leases.
“These are not luxury apartments,” a letter some tenants of the buildings wrote to Davidson in June said. “They are homes to low income and working class Vermonters who work in this community and whose labor local businesses benefit from.”
O’Dowd, a coordinator and producer at Junction Arts and Media, makes about $30,000 a year. They’ve lived in the one-bedroom unit with their ex-partner, who studied at The Center for Cartoon Studies when they first moved in. Their combined income is about $45,000 a year, O’Dowd said.
“This is the right apartment for artists in their 20s and it should be a price artists in their 20s can afford,” O’Dowd said in a phone interview last month.
The letter from the tenants also alleges the buildings are not in great condition and the apartments lack some amenities.
“At 112 S. Main St. there is no on-site laundry, and at 104 S. Main St. the laundry is coin-operated and the machines often break-down,” the letter said.
Complaints also included: siding falling off of 112 S. Main St.; fuel issues that led to lapses in heat and oven/stove usage; a shared dumpster often overflows; units do not include air conditioning and are “poorly insulated;” ventilation in the bathrooms is inadequate and ceilings regularly mold, the letter said.
Davidson did not respond to the letter, Henderson said. He also did not respond to the Valley News by deadline.
“We seek to address any reported maintenance issues in a timely manner,” Sidore said in an email to the Valley News.
In recent years, Davidson has renovated the interiors of both buildings, replaced the roof, installed skylights, replaced windows at 104 S. Main, installed a new heating system and fire sprinkler system at 112 S. Main and replaced siding on the front of 112 S. Main, Sidore said.
As a result of the rent increase, Henderson and O’Dowd decided to move out of the South Main Street buildings.
Through Henderson and O’Dowd’s personal connections in the area they found a two-bedroom apartment on Fairview Terrace, about half-a-mile from the South Main Street buildings.
The two signed a lease together for $1,050 a month, including heat and water, but not electricity and internet, Henderson said. It starts in September, O’Dowd said.

Proposed ballot initiative aims to repeal Prop. 103, the California law that regulates home and auto insurance.


A proposed ballot initiative would drastically change the way property insurance is regulated in California by repealing a law voters passed almost four decades ago. 
Proposition 103 has regulated home, auto and other types of property and casualty insurance in the state since 1988. It requires insurance companies to seek approval from an elected insurance commissioner to raise their premiums, and allows members of the public to object to rate increases.
The initiative — which experts are calling a long shot — would throw all of that out. Insurance companies would not need the state’s approval to raise their policy holders’ premiums; the commissioner would be appointed by the governor instead of elected; and the public would no longer be able to intervene in rate filings.
The independent insurance agent who submitted the proposed measure, Elizabeth Hammack, wrote that she “has seen first-hand the dysfunction” that Prop. 103 has “wreaked upon our state.” Hammack did not immediately respond to CalMatters’ request for an interview.
Denni Ritter, a vice president for American Property Casualty Insurance Association, said the insurance industry group was not involved in drafting the measure and is “reserving judgment” while reviewing it.
To qualify for the November 2026 ballot, the initiative effort would need to collect more than half a million signatures by April.
If the initiative qualifies for next year’s ballot and is approved by voters, it could also throw a wrench into Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara’s plan to try to fix the state’s insurance market as insurers have refused to renew policies or write new ones as wildfire risk has grown. 
Lara crafted his plan around the confines of current insurance law while giving the insurance industry certain concessions, such as allowing them to use catastrophe modeling and to factor in their reinsurance costs when setting their rates. In exchange, the insurance department asks that insurers retain or increase their policies in areas considered at high risk for wildfires. The plan’s implementation began this year.
The insurance department did not immediately respond to questions about the proposal or how it would affect Lara’s plan.
Consumer Watchdog, the Los Angeles-based advocacy group whose founder wrote Prop. 103 mostly to address rising auto insurance rates, said in a statement that the proposal does not seem to be a “serious” or well-funded campaign. The group also cited a report that found Prop. 103 has saved California drivers more than $150 billion in auto insurance rates over the years, as well as a poll that found consumers blame insurance companies for rising premiums.
“We’re confident voters want more accountability from insurance companies,” Carmen Balber, the group’s executive director, told CalMatters. She said repealing Prop. 103 “would mean skyrocketing rates for home and auto insurance policy holders.”
Amy Bach, executive director of San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group United Policyholders, said that while Prop. 103 has “important consumer protections,” the intervenor process has resulted in approval delays — which insurers have long complained about — and political pressure that have contributed to California’s problematic insurance market. 
“I don’t give the ballot measure a high degree of success,” Bach said. “People are not happy about escalating premiums.”
Another consumer advocacy group says Prop. 103 has helped keep California home and auto insurance rates lower than the national average. 
Consumer Federation of America, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy organization, “has studied state insurance markets for decades, and this initiative would institute the regulatory system used in states that have seen some of the most dramatic rate spikes around the country,” said Douglas Heller, director of insurance for the group. 
Heller added that California is not alone in facing an insurance crisis, and that “removing oversight of the insurance companies at this moment would be like shutting down the fire department in the middle of a blaze.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092622_PressConference_LJ_CM_11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-12 16:57:13.167358

Article Summary

Illinois has long had some of the most rigorous proficiency standards in the nation for student performance.
The Illinois State Board of Education is seeking to bring them closer to other states, which will boost proficiency scores in the upcoming school year.
Illinois’ superintendent of education says the strict standards result in schools being unfairly labeled as needing interventions and students being inaccurately labeled as not on track for college or a career.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – Education officials in Illinois expect to see a marked increase this year in the percentage of students classified as proficient in reading, writing and math, along with a slight decline in proficiency rates in science.
That’s not because of any change in the way schools are teaching or how well students are learning, but rather a change in the way the state reports scores on the annual assessments students are given in those core subjects.
During a media briefing Tuesday, State Superintendent of Education Tony Sanders said the new scoring system has been in development for about 18 months. Pending final approval by the State Board of Education, which is scheduled to vote Wednesday, the new grading system will be used in the 2025 report card that is due to be released this fall and will reflect scores from the tests students took this spring.
For years, those scores have been reported on the annual Illinois Report Card, which tells the public how students are performing overall, and which groups of students are falling behind. The scores are also used to hold schools accountable for improving student performance and bringing all demographic groups, including the most disadvantaged, up to proficiency.
But state officials have also complained for years that the way scores have been reported – and especially how scores are categorized as above or below the proficiency level – do not accurately reflect how well students are doing.
For example, recent report cards have shown that about two-thirds of Illinois high school graduates go on to enroll in a two- or four-year college within 12 months of graduation. But scores from the state assessments given each spring show fewer than half of them perform at grade level in English language arts, and even fewer are classified as proficient in math.

“Put simply, as currently designed, our proficiency rates do not reflect the reality of student progress,” Sanders said. “They’re misaligned with what it actually means to succeed in college and career.”
The inaccurate picture results from what are known as “cut scores” that divide students into different performance categories, Sanders said.
Federal law requires states to administer assessments and to report publicly how students are performing on those tests. But states are given great latitude in deciding where to draw the dividing lines between proficient and nonproficient, Sanders said. For many years, Illinois has had some of the most rigorous proficiency standards in the nation.
The consequences of that kind of scoring system go beyond merely unflattering report cards that show low percentages of students performing at grade level, he said. It also results in schools being unfairly labeled as needing interventions to improve their performance, and students themselves being inaccurately labeled as not on track for college or a career.
Proposed new system
Under the proposed new system, student scores will be divided into four performance categories: below proficient, approaching proficient, proficient, and above proficient. And a new system of cut scores will be used to separate students into those four categories.
The new scoring system will apply to the Illinois Assessment of Readiness, which covers English language arts and math in grades 3 through 8, as well as the Illinois Science Assessment, which is given to students in grades 5 and 8. It will also be used for the ACT exams, which will be used starting this year as the state assessment for students in 11th grade.
Sanders emphasized that because the state is establishing new performance categories and using new cut scores to define those categories, it will not be possible to compare proficiency rates under the new system with those of prior years.
“Proficiency rates in Illinois have been trending up, but on the 2025 report card, we will not be able to tell the magnitude of year-over-year improvement based on our proficiency data because 2025 sets a new baseline,” he said.
Instead, Sanders said, officials will compare future results with prior years using a metric called the Student Growth Percentile, which uses raw test scores to measure how much students have learned in a given year relative to their peers.

Chao Archives with the political figures Tuesday. 
McConnell, the longest serving party leader of the U.S. Senate, graduated from the university in the 1960s and later established the McConnell Center, a nonpartisan academic program, for UofL students. The McConnell-Chao Archives were installed at the university in 2009 with a permanent gallery displaying exhibits, films and more about U.S. government, history and politics. 
The expansion increases the “capacity and functionality” of the archives, UofL said in a press release. Additions include an archive storage room to house collections of McConnell and Chao, a digital processing room, a new research carrel and an exhibit showcasing memorabilia related to the senator.

“I’ll say spending life with Elaine has been a blessing,” McConnell said during a ceremony with university officials and dignitaries. “Sharing this archive is an honor.” 
Chao is the first Asian American woman to serve in a cabinet-level position and held such a position in two presidential administrations. She was secretary for the U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Department of Transportation. McConnell and Chao married in 1993. 
“Campaigning, for me, in every corner of Kentucky over the years to extend his leadership has been one of the greatest honors of my life, and I am so proud that with the expansion of this archive, his extraordinary accomplishments will continue to inform and inspire leaders for generations to come,” Chao said. 
McConnell, who has represented Kentucky in the Senate since 1984, is not seeking reelection next year. 
The expansion is not yet fully open to the public, but tours were available for those attending Tuesday’s ceremony. 
UofL President Gerry Bradley called the expansion “a meaningful milestone in the life of our campus and in the preservation of American political history” and thanked donors for supporting the project. UofL’s press release did not include the cost of the expansion. 
Bradley thanked McConnell for continued support for the university, including securing federal dollars over the years. The president also expressed gratitude for recent help from McConnell’s office with international students who temporarily lost their visas a few months ago. Bradley said “a call to Sen. McConnell’s office made that go away.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/54716704941_e8ec5e14b8_k-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-08-12 16:57:13.167358

Patrick Morrisey announced Tuesday, Aug. 12, 2025,  that Marx Development Group plans to buy four of West Virginia’s state-run long-term care facilities. (Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)The state of West Virginia has reached a deal with a New York-based development group to sell four state-run long-term care facilities for $60 million, Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced Tuesday.
Marx Development Group will purchase Hopemont Hospital in Terra Alta, Jackie Withrow Hospital in Beckley, John Manchin, Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont; and Lakin Hospital in West Columbia and make “significant” investments in the state, Morrisey said. 
“The sale of these facilities would produce a significant amount of revenue for the state, spur investment in the renovation and expansion of these facilities, and, I think, increase the level of quality of health care that’s provided to patients,” Morrisey said during a news conference Tuesday afternoon. “We also believe that all this can be done in a way that preserves many jobs and retaining a lot of the staff that have been working hard for many, many years to provide care for their fellow West Virginians.”
Together the facilities are licensed for about 500 beds. 
MDG owns and operates long-term care facilities in states in the region, according to a news release from Morrisey. Through its subsidiaries, Majestic Care and Bluegrass Consulting Group, it owns 55 properties with more than 5,000 licensed beds. 
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday afternoon. 
In July 2024, the state Department of Health Facilities announced a plan to sell the facilities, including hiring Lument Securities, LLC, a firm that advises in healthcare mergers and acquisitions.
Morrisey said the facilities all operate at a loss and would require the state to invest $100 million over the next few years to rebuild and renovate. 
“Furthermore, even if the state invested this money, the long term operating costs, they’re only going to continue to rise, but they’d rise without substantially improving the level of care that’s provided to the patients. Not a good mix,” he said.
The sale is expected to close Sept. 30 with a possible 30-day extension. 
As part of the deal, the company has agreed to build three to five new facilities to replace aging facilities and source the materials and labor from West Virginia, Morrisey said. 
Morrisey said the state continues to pursue the potential sale of its other facilities, which include 
Mildred Mitchell-Bateman Hospital, Welch Community Hospital and William R. Sharpe Jr. Hospital. The long-term goal is to eliminate most of the need for the state’s Department of Health Facilities, he said.
“It’s no secret that I want to reduce the number of departments and reduce the number of agencies to drive efficiency,” he said. “So in consultation with the Legislature, I will be happy to have those conversations and look at different ways we can keep saving resources.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — As Oklahoma students return to school in the coming days, they’ll have backpacks on, pencils and laptops ready, and their cellphones out of sight.
For the next year, state law requires all Oklahoma public schools to ban student use of cellphones and personal electronic devices for the entire school day. The only devices exempt from the new law are ones that are school-issued, medically necessary or needed for emergencies.
Parents, students and educators across the state said they’re optimistic the cellphone ban will help limit distractions and keep classrooms focused on learning. But, they acknowledged the new ban could be a “challenge” to adjust to, especially during lunch and passing periods.
Some students at Classen High School of Advanced Studies at Northeast have gotten used to watching Netflix during their lunch hour or looking at social media during down time, said rising senior Amasha Samaraweera. This year, that won’t be an option.

Some teachers at the Oklahoma City high school already enforced a “phone jail” in their classrooms, but others had a more relaxed policy, said Samaraweera, who leads the Student Leadership Council in Oklahoma City Public Schools.
Oklahoma City is the largest school system in the state that didn’t have a districtwide cellphone restriction until state law changed this year. Several other Oklahoma districts — and 11 other states — had already implemented some version of the policy.
Samaraweera said she hopes the daylong ban will eliminate the temptation of Tik Tok when she has free time in the school day and force her to focus on homework and reading instead. Not all of her peers are happy with the change.
“We grew up with phones all of our lives so having it put away for eight hours a day, it can be a lot,” Samaraweera said. “I think it’s very valid for some students to feel a little bit concerned about this right now. But one big hope that I have for our student body is we’re extremely adaptable. We can change really fast. We can adapt to any sort of situation. So I’m sure that students over the years, over a course of time, they’ll get used to it.”
The district’s general counsel, Tony Childers, said he expects the policy change will be a struggle but a necessary one.
“I think it’ll be a challenge for students, but we also think it’s going to be beneficial for students,” Childers said during a back-to-school news conference Monday. “We think it’ll help us refocus in the classroom, for students to stay focused on what’s important without being too distracted by devices.”

Students already have enough screen time and distractions, even without cellphones during the school day, said Tarrah Ross, who has three children attending Broken Arrow Public Schools.
It wasn’t many years ago, she said, that her district urged families to buy students a cellphone so they could use it as a tool in the classroom. Ross said she’s glad the policy has since swung in the opposite direction.
What’s crucial, she said, is whether the cellphone ban will be applied consistently. One of her children, now a high school senior, complained that enforcement of his school’s cellphone restrictions varied from teacher to teacher.
“He’s like, ‘If everybody has to do it, fine, but if not everybody’s going to do it, then I want to be able to use it, too,’” Ross said.
The statewide ban on cellphones and personal devices won’t change much for Norman Public Schools parent Brent Norwood and his children. His fifth grader and sixth grader already are used to their school requiring cellphones to be put away.
“When we told them about this new policy, they were like, ‘I thought that was already the rule,’” he said.
Norwood said he hopes to see the long-term impact of the statewide policy when today’s middle and high school students arrive at the University of Oklahoma, where he teaches economics. He said he’s seen students become too dependent on personal devices, especially over the past five years.
The statewide cellphone ban won’t apply to colleges and universities, and Norwood doesn’t prohibit devices in his classes, either. 
But, he can’t help but notice how often students wear noise-canceling earphones, even when they visit him during his office hours. Spending less time plugged in and more time engaged would be a good thing, he said. 
At the K-12 level, he hopes students’ interpersonal skills get a boost with more face-to-face interaction.
“Less dependence on liking someone’s posts and more just going up and socializing at lunchtime, that’s what I’m hoping it does,” Norwood said.

(Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.

The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP

Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”

A greater burden on states

In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.

Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

There was little discussion Tuesday about the plan to consolidate the Missouri Schools for the Severely Disabled, or MSSD. Board members delved into the plan more thoroughly during a May meeting and a retreat last month.
“The State Board of Education believes this is the first step in providing more opportunities and strengthening education for all students enrolled in Missouri Schools for the Severely Disabled,” Board President Mary Schrag said in a news release. “This decision is not taken lightly but will result in a more efficient program that enriches quality resources provided to students and their families.”
The following schools will be required to close by the end of June 2026: Briarwood in Harrisonville, Citadel in Potosi, College View in Joplin, Crowley Ridge in Dexter, Delmar Cobble in Columbia, Dogwood Hills in Eldon, Gateway/Hubert Wheeler in St. Louis, Lakeview Woods in Lee’s Summit, Lillian Schaper in Bowling Green, Ozark Hills in Salem, Prairie View in Marshall and Rolling Meadow in Higginsville.
Six of the schools were already under “temporary emergency closure” because of staffing issues, impacting 61 students. The other six buildings set to close have a combined enrollment of 64 students and were at risk of emergency closure, Mark Wheatley, the department’s assistant commissioner of special education, told the board.
The change comes as MSSD struggles with declining enrollment, with 36% fewer students over the past 16 years, and $50 million in deferred maintenance between 34 school buildings.
A consultant hired by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education called the current program “unsustainable.”
Over the past two years, a committee has worked with consultants to give the program a direction. Their recommendation is to consolidate the schools, closing 24 existing buildings and constructing two new ones to condense the program to 12 locations.
Missouri is the only state that operates separate day schools for special education, though the practice was once commonplace nationwide.
Despite a nationwide push to better integrate students with learning disabilities, some parents say Missouri’s model works for their students. When consultants polled parents about their satisfaction, 85% said they felt that MSSD met their child’s needs better than previous schools.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051325_eslinger1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-12 16:57:13.167358

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The U.S. Coast Guard commissioned its first additional polar icebreaker in 25 years in Juneau on Sunday, marking what officials called a new era in Arctic activity for the United States.
The newly rechristened Storis, formerly the oilfield supply ship Aiviq, is the first in a series of icebreakers expected to join the Coast Guard in coming years. The Storis and subsequent ships, officials said, are critical for the United States to maintain its sovereignty and control of its borders in and near the Arctic Ocean.
“What we’re doing here today is we’re really just preparing to build our Arctic fighting force,” said Troy Edgar, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, parent agency of the Coast Guard.
Long trek to Lone Star State sparked plan for SC maritime academy

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, was one of several members of Congress who secured funding for the Coast Guard to purchase the Storis for $125 million under a special contract and operating arrangement during the Biden administration. The purchase deal passed Congress after years of lobbying and political donations by the ship’s former owners.
The Aiviq, built to support Royal Dutch Shell’s oil drilling operations in the Arctic Ocean off Alaska, was available because of a disaster that saw Shell’s drilling rig break loose from the Aiviq during a 2013 storm in the Gulf of Alaska. The rig ran aground in the Kodiak archipelago and Shell abandoned its drill plans for the Arctic.
The Aiviq was modified after post-disaster reviews found flaws in its design, and it went on to serve under contract with the Australian government in Antarctica. Then, the U.S. government became interested in the ship to fill a gap in Arctic coverage.
The U.S. Navy has no icebreakers, which leaves the Coast Guard as the agency in charge of icebreaking operations, critical for opening frozen seas to commerce, research and military missions. The agency currently has just one heavy icebreaker, and that ship is typically assigned to help operations in Antarctica. That leaves the medium icebreaker Healy as the only U.S. icebreaker available for general-purpose missions in the Arctic.
A 2023 analysis by the Coast Guard concluded that the service needs eight to nine polar icebreakers, including four or five heavy ships and four or five medium ones to perform its assigned missions.
“I think Singapore has more icebreaking capacity than we do,” Sullivan said. “That has left us far behind our adversaries. Russia has more than 50 operational icebreakers, many nuclear-powered, many weaponized. China, which has no Arctic territory, is building a polar fleet and is spending a lot of time off our shores, including this summer.”

As Sullivan spoke, China is operating at least five research icebreakers in international waters near Alaska.
Capt. Corey Kerns is the ship’s first commanding officer, fresh from an assignment in Japan as a liaison officer with the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet.
“For the Coast Guard, the big strategic thing is to show that we can operate it, get it up north, show the flag,” Kerns said.
During his time in Japan, he became familiar with the disputes over the Senkaku Islands, whose ownership is disputed among China, Taiwan and Japan.
Ships from all three nations visit the waters around those islands.
“The ability to be present guarantees your ability to to maintain sovereignty. And that’s what we’re trying to get at here in the Arctic. We need more icebreakers to be present in our waters and be clear what is our waters,” he said.
 First of many icebreakers planned for Coast Guard

In January, President Donald Trump said he would seek to acquire 40 Coast Guard icebreakers. The “Big Beautiful Bill” signed by Trump in July included almost $9 billion to build a series of heavy, medium and light ships.
Those include a series of heavy Arctic icebreakers larger than the Storis. The first of those, the Polar Sentinel, is expected to come from Bollinger Mississippi Shipbuilding in 2030, with additional ships every two years afterward.
“This is an amazing moment, because it doesn’t happen that often, but it’s going to be happening a lot more,” said acting Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Kevin E. Lunday.

The Storis is scheduled to be homeported in Juneau, where Sunday’s commissioning took place, but not for several years. For the time being, it will be homeported in Seattle, Washington.
Sullivan, speaking at the commissioning, said he would like to see the new ships homeported in Alaska as well — it’s where the ice is, he said to applause.
The Trump-signed budget measure includes $300 million for a new Coast Guard pier and other facilities in Juneau; construction has not begun, and no site has been finalized.
Both the Storis and the under-construction heavy icebreakers are too large to fit in the Coast Guard’s Kodiak base or in any port north of the Aleutian Islands. The Storis draws 34 feet, according to specifications published in 2013. The new heavy icebreakers are expected to have a similar draft. Either figure is deeper than what’s available in northern Alaska right now.
By the book, said Cmdr. Philip Baxa, chief of the Coast Guard’s aids to navigation and ice capabilities division, it takes the Coast Guard eight to 10 years to set up a new port from the time it’s chosen.
“We want to move much faster, but there’s a lot of work that has to be done to build out the pier and the shore infrastructure,” Lunday said.
He said things like housing and child care need to be available to accommodate Coast Guard personnel.
Currently, Juneau is experiencing major shortages of both.
“I chair the Coast Guard subcommittee,” Sullivan said, “so working with the Coast Guard, working with Juneau, working with the state, we’re going to press this. We’ve already made good progress on that.”
 Additional work needed aboard Storis

The Storis, too, will need work and testing before it can fully perform its duties. During a pre-commissioning cruise on Saturday for members of the media and the families of the crew, one of the ship’s variable-pitch propellers malfunctioned, helping turn a planned five-hour excursion into an eight-hour one.
The malfunction was a minor one, but fixing it may have required turning off main power for a time, the ship’s captain said, and he didn’t want to do that while families were aboard.
The Storis has a helipad, but a Coast Guard helicopter has never landed there, tried a mid-air hoist, or refueled from the ship. Some labels throughout the ship still bear the name Aiviq, and the ship’s interior art includes photos from Louisiana bayous and New Orleans streets. In the ship’s mess hall are condiments bearing the names of southern grocery stores.

On Saturday’s cruise, employees from Edison Chouest Offshore, the company that formerly owned the Storis, stood alongside uniformed Coast Guard officers on the ship’s bridge.
“He’s my coach,” said Lt. j.g. Sophia Scott of chief mate Devin Keister, who wore civilian clothes next to her.
Since the spring, employees from Edison Chouest have been operating the Storis alongside enlisted Coast Guard members and officers, a unique setup for a Coast Guard ship.
Baxa, chief of the Coast Guard’s aids to navigation and ice capabilities division, helped organize the purchase of the Storis and the sprint to get it ready.
“I’ll never forget March 4 of 2025 when Admiral Lunday, our acting Commandant of the Coast Guard, directed me and my team to prepare Storis for operations and to sail away from Pascagoula, Mississippi, where the ship had been purchased and put into storage, no later than 1 June of 2025. I’m no mathematician, but that’s less than 60 days later, and at that point, zero crew members had reported aboard,” he said.
After sailing away, the ship spent another two weeks in Seattle for additional work, then arrived in Juneau during the first week of August.
Lunday said the Coast Guard’s partnership with Edison Chouest enabled the Coast Guard to put the Storis in service “much faster than we would have traditionally done.”
“The imperative,” Lunday said, “is that we build out the nation’s icebreaker fleet. When we see the potential adversaries that are moving to build their icebreakers, we’ve got to move faster as the United States, and we’re going to do that. … The original plan was not to have Storis up here for another year, but the national imperative was to move faster, and so that’s why it’s here.”
 Storis has a mixed history

In 2012, while towing the circular drill rig Kulluk from the Arctic Ocean to Seattle, the Aiviq ran into a heavy storm south of Kodiak. The ship’s engines died, the tow line broke, and the Kulluk ran aground after the Aiviq’s crew was unable to re-establish the tow.
No oil spill resulted and no one was injured, but it contributed to Shell’s decision to abandon its Arctic drilling plans.
Two years later, the Coast Guard published a report on the accident, concluding that actions by the tow crew, management decisions and “design engineering deficiencies … relating to the Aiviq” contributed to the wreck.

Specifically, the report noted that vents allowed seawater to contaminate the ship’s fuel.
Since then, those vents have been modified, raised farther above the deck, and the ship went on to conduct two successful voyages to Antarctica. The ship is rated to break three feet of ice while moving at five knots, but during those trips, it was able to break between three and five feet while still moving forward, Baxa said.
After Shell discontinued its Alaska offshore drilling, Edison Chouest lobbied members of Congress and urged lawmakers to purchase the Aiviq for use by the federal government.
The Coast Guard initially resisted. In a 2016 hearing of the U.S. House’s Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, then-Coast Guard Vice Commandant Charles Michel told lawmakers that “our current opinion is that the ship is not suitable for military service, without substantial refit.”
Then-Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, called Michel’s statement a “bulls**t answer” because the Aiviq would be asked to move ice, not perform military duties.
In 2022, after Young’s death in office, Congress passed the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act, which approved funding for the Coast Guard to buy a “United States built available icebreaker.”
The Coast Guard, which had been considering a Finland-built ship, switched to the Aiviq as the only available ship that met Congress’ qualifications.
Subsequent reporting by ProPublica showed an extensive history of political donations by Edison Chouest to members of Congress, including Alaska’s delegation.
“It is ready for Coast Guard service,” Lunday said of the Aiviq-turned-Storis when asked about the July 2016 hearing that labeled the Aiviq as unfit.
“We’ve learned a lot since then, and we’ve had great support from Congress to have the appropriations necessary last year to purchase the ship,” he said.
Sullivan, among the members of Congress who received contributions from Edison Chouest, denied that those donations contributed to the decision to purchase the Aiviq.
“It has nothing to do with it,” Sullivan said. “Zero. I’ve been pressing for more icebreakers any way possible for our country … and the Coast Guard was looking at the idea of a commercially available one.”
 New ship carries relics of prior history

The new Storis is named after its predecessor, an icebreaker that was commissioned in 1942 and served until 2007, becoming the oldest commissioned Coast Guard cutter in the fleet at the time of its decommissioning and scrapping.
In 1957, it and several other ships sailed through the Northwest Passage, marking the first time an American ship had taken that route.
Thirty-two years after that historic voyage, the Storis assisted with the cleanup after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Ed Sasser was a crewman on board at the time. On Saturday, he sailed aboard the new edition of his former ship.
“It’s pretty cushy compared to the old Storis,” he said, noting that both ships were and are unique vessels, not part of a larger class of ships.
If he were young again, he’d serve aboard the new ship “in a New York minute.”
“Time will tell how useful it is,” he said.

Remnants of the ship’s former life remain obvious throughout.
Belowdecks are large steel containers, intended to haul bulk dry concrete or other material to offshore oil fields. For now, they’re empty until the Coast Guard either removes them or finds a use for them.
Other pieces of the Storis’ original purpose could be useful to its new mission. Its stern holds heavy-duty towing gear, and large firefighting cannons jut from its superstructure.
The ship has no internal laboratory space, as does the Coast Guard’s other medium icebreaker, the Healy, but it does have deck attachments for container modules that could allow it to accommodate labs.
Already, one of those spaces was in use Sunday, holding the ship’s brand-new armory, including four .50-caliber machine guns.
“I’ve made this joke for many, many years … it’s that if you can imagine it, and you can put it into a standard 20-foot IMO container, I can embark it on board. … we had on board a very, very senior Marine Corps officer, and he asked, ‘hey, what if I put a Marine Raider team in a box?’ I said, ‘Yes, sir, I can embark that on board.’ It really does provide that flexibility for missions,” Baxa said.
The Coast Guard’s staffing contract with Edison Chouest is scheduled to run through November, and it could be extended for one year.
Both Baxa and the ship’s captain said they’ll be recommending that extension.
Lt. Cmdr. George Greendyk, the engineer officer on board the Storis, said he hasn’t had problems with the Edison Chouest civilian crew.
“Everywhere we go, we have people that have seen something like this before, and they’ve been certainly helpful answering questions for us and guiding us as we run the engineering plant,” he said.
“Right now, our primary mission is to just focus on learning the ship, training, preparing our policy and procedures,” said Lt. D.J. Corbett, the ship’s operations officer.
Corbett said that over the next two months, the Storis will head west, to Kodiak, then through the Bering Sea and north, through the Bering Strait. The ship’s port calls are still being finalized.
Corbett said being aboard an icebreaker means being able to see and do things that no other Coast Guard cutter experiences.
“I still remember the first time that I ever saw ice,” she said. “We were going down south. We had crossed the Antarctic Circle, and all of these massive icebergs just started flowing past us. And then we had right whales that were popping up and coming to see the ship. We had orcas. It was our last sunset. As we were heading south, it would be 24 hours of sunlight. So all of this was happening, the sun was setting, and then we saw a green flash that night. At first, we didn’t believe it. We were like, Did everyone see that? And so it was my moment of, I’m living in a National Geographic special. It was really amazing.”
 The ship’s first captain looks ahead

Kearns, the ship’s first captain, is an officer who started as an enlisted man in 1996 and rose through the ranks, later earning degrees in ship design. He helped design a new class of icebreakers for the Great Lakes and served as the Coast Guard’s liaison to the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet, which patrols the western Pacific.

“Normally, you start off a ship designed by (the question): What capabilities are you trying to achieve? In this case, we need Arctic presence. That was the most important thing. So we’re willing to take some risk or we’re forced into it because our shipbuilding projects are so behind,” he said.
Critically for the ship’s future, he said, is to come up with the equivalent of the ship’s operating manual. Coast Guard officers are trained to run ships, but the Storis is unique.
“What are all the things you need to learn to do the same job on Storis? And then run all of our people through that. … I think success will be when we get all of that documentation done and then get all of our watchstanders what would be considered fully qualified,” he said.
Kerns acknowledged that there are some people who would prefer that the Storis jump quickly into law enforcement, fisheries patrols and search and rescue. He prefers a slower pace.
“We need to learn how to crawl. And that’s what we’re doing, Kerns said.
For example, the crew of the Storis hasn’t yet launched the ship’s small craft, which are stored in bays along the side of the hull, in open water.
The newly opened National Medal of Honor Museum in Texas has SC roots

“We’ve just started to gain proficiency in launching that in protected, calm seas. So next would be, what does it look like to launch that in open water? And then how do we need to drive the ship from the bridge to create the right conditions to safely launch that boat? And then that would help us build into, ‘Oh, this is how we would  perform Coast Guard mission sets.’”
Asked about the ship’s history, the critical 2014 report and whether he has safety concerns, he said no.
“I have no concerns. I feel totally safe on Storis,” Kerns said.
He said he’s familiar with reporting that analyzed what went wrong with the Aiviq and why it was unable to keep the Kulluk from running aground.
“It easily gets attributed to design flaws for the ship, which is a little bit misleading. In extreme weather, every ship has design flaws. There’s constraints on operations. Ships are designed to operate in certain conditions to a certain extent, and if you operate the ship past those constraints, you’re going to find out what’s going to fail first,” he said.
Some engineering changes were made after the Kulluk accident — the Aiviq’s fuel vents were raised, “which means you can take more water in the vicinity of them before it would down-flood. It’s not that it couldn’t possibly happen again, but it’s less likely.”
Kerns said the “creature comforts” aboard the ship are the most easily noticeable difference from a purpose-built Coast Guard ship.
The Storis has heated handrails, walkways and exterior stairs, a feature intended to eliminate the need for crew to beat ice away as it forms.
“There’s a lot of automation in places that we might not use it, because we use manpower instead,” he said.
Kerns said he’s also been impressed with the ship’s multiple redundancies.
“Almost every system has backups to the backups. They really thought about this thing being in the Arctic and independent and away from logistical support. There’s different ways to make water. There’s ways to handle sewage. I actually feel very comfortable with what the capabilities are,” he said.
“I’m definitely looking forward to doing ice breaking on this thing. It’s a lot of fun to drive,” Kerns said.

There will be rallies in Palm Coast, Jacksonville, and Tallahassee, an interactive map indicates. 

The 90-minute Tallahassee rally starts at 9 a.m. The address isn’t public and available only to those who register. 
The one-hour Palm Coast rally is being held at Old Kings Road & Palm Coast Parkway Southeast and begins at 11 a.m.  
Meanwhile, the Jacksonville rally starts at 11 a.m. at 5945 New Kings Road, Jacksonville, and is slated to last 90 minutes.


The Texas for All Coalition’s goal is to mobilize as many rallies nationally as possible, and the group created FightTheTrumpTakeover.com as a digital headquarters.
“Across Texas, and across the country, communities are speaking out in a united voice to call for an end to the Trump takeover,” Drucilla Tigner, executive director of Texas For All, said in a prepared statement.
The announcement comes as the Texas Senate approved new congressional lines in a mid-decade redistricting effort that could help Republicans keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 election, the Texas Tribune reported Tuesday. 
“The vote was 19-2, with nine Democrats absent after exiting the Senate floor moments after the maps were taken up, a show of protest against what they framed as a ‘corrupt process,’ ” the Tribune reported.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Dozens of Texas House Democrats left for Illinois and other parts of the country, bringing work on redistricting in that chamber to a halt as the chamber continues to lack the minimum headcount needed to conduct business.
  Protests are planned in these Florida cities.
Trump, concerned Republicans could lose control of the House of Representatives after next year’s midterm elections, called on Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last month to add new GOP seats.
Once Abbott agreed to do that, however, the gears began working in other states — blue and red — to follow suit.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said last month that his state had been “malapportioned” — and has touched on the need to redraw congressional districts since a Florida Supreme Court ruling upholding a map promoted by the governor that ultimately netted Florida four additional GOP seats and eliminated Black representation in North Florida.
Writing for the majority in that case, Chief Justice Carlos Muñiz concluded that legislators had a “superior” obligation to follow federal equal-protection law, and not Florida’s Fair Districts Amendments, which say districts can’t be drawn in a way that diminishes the ability of minorities to “elect representatives of their choice.” 
House Speaker Daniel Perez also appears on board and announced last week that he’s creating a Select Committee on Congressional Redistricting, with the goal of conducting hearings when the Legislature returns this fall for its already scheduled committee meetings.
“As many of you are aware, there are national conversations ongoing in other states related to midterm redistricting,” Perez wrote in a memo to members of the Florida House.

The Office of Management and Enterprise Services in a message to stakeholders said it was investigating network service issues statewide affecting multiple agencies.
The office was working on a resolution, the message said.
“We are currently investigating and have determined this as not a breach of state systems,” said Christa Helfrey, OMES spokeswoman. “Each agency determines its work schedule and when to adjust daily operations.”
The Oklahoma Department of Labor and  Oklahoma Ethics Commission closed early, according to the agencies.
The Oklahoma Department of Corrections sent administrative staff home early, said Kay Thompson, a spokeswoman.
Department of Corrections facilities saw minimal disruptions, she said.
Tuesday was election day for 22 counties.
“It is not impacting our elections today,” said Misha Mohr, a spokeswoman.
The Pardon and Parole Board was not able to connect with DOC facilities where inmates were scheduled to make personal appearances, said Tom Bates, executive director.
But the agency was able to continue with its business because attorneys were able to speak on the offenders’ behalf, he said.
Some staff at the Oklahoma Attorney General’s office went home early to continue working, said Phil Bacharach, a spokesman.
The outage did cause delays in some of the agency’s work, he said.

The Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, or AHCCCS, is the state’s Medicaid program and provides health care coverage for about two million Arizonans — about 28% of the state’s residents — including 167,000 Native Americans.
AHCCCS received approval in October from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to cover traditional healing services provided through the Indian Health Service and tribally operated health facilities in Arizona.
Arizona is one of only four states that have received federal approval to cover traditional healing practices as a Medicaid benefit, joining California, New Mexico and Oregon.
Indigenous traditional healing is a comprehensive medical system encompassing a range of holistic treatments used by Indigenous healers to treat various acute and chronic conditions, as well as to promote health and well-being, according to the National Institutes of Health/National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.
After federal approval, Gov. Katie Hobbs allocated $100,000 from the state to secure over $222 million in federal matching funds for culturally relevant traditional healing practices.
“Through our bipartisan balanced budget, we’re able to secure the necessary state funds to be able to draw down the federal funds to cover traditional healing,” Hobbs said, adding that she understands many people have advocated for decades to get the service covered.
Hobbs held a roundtable discussion with health care officials and traditional practitioners at the Center for Native American and Indigenous Futures at NAU on Aug. 8.
Hobbs heard what traditional healing means for the Navajo Nation and White Mountain Apache Tribe, the two tribes present for the roundtable.
“I am committed to ensuring that health care is accessible to Arizonans across the state, and that those deeply personal health care decisions are able to happen in the way that meets everyone’s needs,” she said. “This is a huge step forward in doing that.”
Ann Marie Chischilly, the vice president of Native American Initiatives at NAU, said Hobbs’ administration has demonstrated a strong commitment to supporting Indigenous peoples across Arizona, and her work will leave a lasting impact on the communities.
Traditional healing practices vary across tribal nations, but some standard practices include sweat lodges, prayers, talking circles and ceremonial rituals.
Chischilly said that Indigenous medicine people and traditional knowledge holders have always been “our original healers and our scientists.”
“Your steadfast commitment from time immemorial to our ways of healing is deeply honored,” she added. “We’re proud to live in a time where both Western science and Indigenous knowledges are increasingly recognized and respected as equals.”
Funding for traditional healing services provided by the Indian Health Service or tribally operated health care facilities will be 100% reimbursed by the federal government.
The state would need to pay for reimbursements involving non-Native family members of Indigenous people covered by Medicaid who receive their health care from Indigenous providers.
Even though traditional healing services have not been covered under federal programs like Medicaid previously, many health care facilities in tribal communities continue to offer these services to Indigenous patients.
For Nez-Chee, having coverage for traditional healing methods in Arizona fills that access need but also creates a path to educating young generations.
“It’s more than reimbursement, it’s reeducating and regrowing our tradition and our culture,” Nez-Chee said. “It’s a community development.”
She said that improved community understanding and access to traditional healing help people understand its role in the daily lives of many Indigenous people.
As the state moves forward, Nez-Chee said that the workgroup is trying to ensure that the process includes all 22 tribes in Arizona because they understand that each tribe is “very unique in their culture and tradition.”
“We made it to where it would be open-ended, to where they can tailor and customize the purpose of the reimbursement with their organizations and healthcare,” she said, adding that this allows healthcare providers to involve the community, traditional practitioners, and physicians in the process.
Now that traditional healing practices are covered, Nez-Chee said the work begins for everyone to engage with their community to let them know about these services within their health care facilities.
For the White Mountain Apache Tribe, Michael Tate said they are actively working to include traditional healing services within their care efforts for both behavioral and physical health.
“This is a big milestone for all tribes,” he said, because it shows that traditional healers are equivalent to what a doctor is in the system.
Tate is the chief executive officer for the White Mountain Apache Behavioral Health Services and has been actively working to secure access to traditional healing services since 2019.
“We’ve always had the option, regardless of us getting reimbursed,” Tate said. “We covered the service.”
The tribe does not have traditional practitioners on staff, and when patients request services, Tate said they usually rely on the patient to select who they want to provide that service from within the community.
Traditional healing services are not widely used within the hospital setting for the White Mountain Tribe. Tate said that it is most likely due to the fact that it is a very private experience and many don’t want to share that information openly with a health care provider.
The traditional practices aren’t meant to be written down or shared publicly, and Tate said their tribe is very concerned about that potentially happening because their communities have been taken advantage of before.
“We don’t want this to be a big fraud,” he said, explaining that the sober living facilities scam is what drives this caution because a lot of Indigenous people were exploited, especially from the White Mountain Apache Tribe.
“Organizations who are not good might take advantage of this program,” Tate said. “We don’t want this to be bigger than it needs to be.”
Tate said that the White Mountain Apache people need the service and he just wants to make sure that it is being provided for the right reasons.
“There’s always gonna be bad actors out there that’re gonna try to take advantage of this,” he said. “We need to protect our own teachings, our own way of life.”
Tate shared his concerns about the possibility of fraudulent scams happening with Hobbs and her staff during the roundtable discussion.
Zaida Dedolph Piecoro, the governor’s state health strategist, said that since the benefit is specifically for tribal health facilities, only those providers can bill for the service.
AHCCCS will not determine who traditional practitioners are or who they can reimburse, she said, because it was vital to ensure that the benefit remained about the healing practices being self-directed and self-determined.
“It’s determined by tribal leadership and determined by tribal health facilities,” Piecoro said, adding that someone can not just walk into a tribal health facility and tell them they want to provide traditional services.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis selected Republican state Sen. Jay Collins to be his next lieutenant governor on Tuesday, immediately leading to speculation that the retired Army Green Beret could be the candidate to run for governor in 2026 and continue the DeSantis legacy.
Collins, 49, had been rumored to be the pick to succeed Jeanette Nuñez for months, telling the Phoenix in May that were his name in the mix, “that’s an incredible honor.”
Speaking at the Green Beret Association in Tampa just north of MacDill Air Force Base, DeSantis said he looked for a lieutenant governor who could help deliver “more wins” for Floridians and be capable of leading the state should he leave his job before he is term-limited out of office in January 2027.
“You have to be strong on policy and you have to have a record of delivering big, conservative results,” DeSantis said.
“You’ve got to have a foundation of conservative principles. Rudderless ships will never find true north, and it’s very important that people bring with that, because we can talk about issues right now. A year from now into the future, you don’t know what’s going to go your way, so what are you going to look to as your frame of reference as you tackle big issues.”
The governor referenced Collins’ military career, including his service as a Special Forces medic in the U.S. Army and later as a member of the Green Berets. He was deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, and twice to South America. He was awarded a Purple Heart and sustained injuries that led to the amputation of a leg.
Collins works as chief operating officer for Operation BBQ Relief, which distributes meals to Americans following natural disasters. In June, he traveled to the Middle East to help Floridians return to the United States during a military conflict between Israel and Iran.
“He was in these countries during the middle of a war, personally helping to rescue his fellow Floridians and fellow Americans,” DeSantis said. “Sen. Jay Collins is the Chuck Norris of Florida politics.”
In his speech, Collins thanked DeSantis, calling him “The GOAT,” and used military argot in describing how he plans to address his role as the state’s new lieutenant governor.
“The battlefield, it may change, but the mission stays the same,” he said. “We are going to protect and preserve every single thing that matters. We will not stop our fight. We will not slow down, we will continue to take the fight forward, because this is not politics, it is about people. It is about the people who are in this audience, the people we fight for, and the people we remember each and every day.”
Collins promised to be “relentless in the pursuit of excellence.”
“Excellence is a choice. We will not falter. We will not fail. We will not stop. Until we keep fighting and achieve excellence, all we do is the Florida standard, and that is my promise to you, governor.”
Political background
Collins, a resident of Hillsborough County, first came on the political scene in 2021, when he announced he would challenge Democrat Kathy Castor for Congress.
Shortly after that, DeSantis himself recruited Collins to skip that race and instead run for the District 14 state Senate seat in 2022 that had been held by Democrat Janet Cruz. Collins went on to defeat Cruz by 10 percentage points and quickly became a close political ally of the governor.
He has been a consistently conservative voice in the Senate since then. Among the bills he has championed was legislation to repeal the state law that bans the purchase of a long gun for anyone under 21 years of age. It passed the House but languished in the Senate.
He’s been a stalwart supporter of Hope Florida, the community-based welfare program initiated by First Lady Casey DeSantis that came under fire earlier this year and whose foundation is reportedly being investigated by state prosecutors.
The question on everyone’s minds during Tuesday’s press conference (which Casey DeSantis — for a while all but promoted by the governor as a possible successor — attended) is whether Collins would run for governor of Florida next year, taking on U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump and has raised more than $22 million.
Neither DeSantis nor Collins took questions from news reporters following the press conference. Collins did tell a group of reporters earlier this month in Orlando that while he would not say whether he would enter the race, he did believe that some other Republican needed to take on Donalds.
“I think competition’s good for anybody,” he said. “And look, I don’t want anybody to say anything. I have no umbrage with Byron. I don’t. I believe we should have a choice. Byron is a conservative leader. His family have done great things in the community. And, in the end, you know, what I think our government, our people, our world works better with choice, and we will see where life goes, but, in the end, we’re going to be okay. Florida’s in a great position.”
Donalds congratulated Collins on being appointed lieutenant governor, writing on X, “I wish him all the best and look forward to working together on behalf of our great state.”
‘Performative’ politics
DeSantis has made it clear that he is looking to support someone other than Donalds next year.
“Politics has become so performative, we often lose sight of why you’re really there,” he said at one point Tuesday in praise of Collins.
“It’s not to emote on social media. It’s not to get on as many TV shows as possible. Jay embodies one of our core principals. While words can be meaningful, it’s ultimately deeds that are the most powerful. You’re in office to deliver results for the people who put you there, not to serve your own personal interests. And I think that Jay’s life story has been the embodiment of that.”
Not everyone was in support of the pick.
DeSantis Watch, an organization critical of the governor, issued a statement contending that “the list of politicians willing to be associated with his failed agenda of higher costs and fewer freedoms has dwindled.”
“With the selection of Jay Collins it is clear the only supposed allies the Governor has left are other politicians looking to play on his own narcissistic need for complete and total fealty to advance their own quests for higher office,” DeSantis Watch communications director Anders Croy said.
“It is a testament to how Ron DeSantis views his job as an elected official that the qualifications for a constitutional officer are not whether you have real solutions to lower costs or raise wages for Floridians, but whether you’re willing to stand beside his administration as its last days are defined by bullying, corruption, and political ambition over doing what’s right for the hardworking people of our state.”
Several Republican legislators were on hand, including Panhandle Rep. Michelle Salzman, who, like Collins, served in the U.S. Army. She said it was important for her to travel to Tampa to observe the event. But she evaded the question of whether she would support Collins if he runs for governor.
“I’m going to let him decide that,” she said while laughing. “I don’t want to get into the middle of all of that. But I am very excited for him. I love him very much. He’s a phenomenal leader.”

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)The Nevada Republican Party thinks the state should build its own high-security immigration detention center and name it “Coyote Compound.”
The party sent a fundraising email Aug. 8 asking if Nevada should follow Florida’s example and construct its own detention facility.
“Florida has Alligator Alcatraz — a high-security ICE detention center designed to detain and process illegal immigrants quickly and efficiently,” reads the email. “Now, we’re asking: Should Nevada have something similar? We’re calling it the Coyote Compound, and it would send a clear message: Nevada takes border security seriously.”
After the email heavily suggests what readers’ answers should be, the email urges readers to click a link to take a poll. And after submitting their preference for the “Coyote Compound” (“Yes,” “No,” or “I’m not sure”) readers are directed to a page where they’re invited to donate money to the party.
The state Republican Party, which did not respond to a request for comment, may have been more focused on raising money for itself instead of actually galvanizing government and community support for construction of a much-maligned — and expensive — detention camp.
The detention center in Florida’s Everglades was opened last month. The hastily built facility, which is expected to hold up to 5,000 beds, has been heavily criticized for abhorrent conditions, a lack of transparency concerning practices and detainees, and environmental concerns.
The ACLU has also warned of reports where people who are detained there “are fed maggot-infested food, denied medical care, not given access to water, flushing toilets, or showers, and are not allowed to go outside.”
Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis authorized $245 million in funding, provided by Florida taxpayers, to get the facility up and running.
Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo and Republican state Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus did not respond to requests for comment.
“The crisis at the border isn’t just a border state problem anymore, it’s a national emergency, and Nevada needs to be part of the solution,” the Nevada Republican Party asserted in its email.
That claim seems to be at odds with Trump, who recently asserted “We now have the most secure border in modern American history.”
The email from the state Republican Party advocating a Florida-style immigration detention camp happened to be sent the same day Lombardo confirmed he would authorize the Nevada National Guard to assist with President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda.
Laura Martin, the executive director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada and a steering committee member of the Nevada Immigrant Coalition decried the Republican Party’s push, even if only in a fundraising email, for a “Coyote Compound.”
“Joe Lombardo is the de facto leader of the Nevada Republican party and this kind of violent, racist rhetoric is exactly what is taking our state down a path of economic collapse,” Martin said. “Nevadans deserve strong leadership that respects all residents, not culture war-chasing gimmicks designed to remind people why our nickname is the Mississippi of the West.”

On Feb. 14, Congress approved a 90% reduction in funding for the healthcare navigators, which had started as the country approved the Affordable Care Act. Those navigators are part of the “Cover Montana” program. Those changes will begin at the end of this month when the funding for the navigator program runs out. These navigators, both in person and via the phone, have helped thousands of Montanans get signed up for healthcare, whether through the healthcare.gov website, or begin the Medicaid process.
For example, as the COVID-19 pandemic hit, navigators also helped people enroll in federal health insurance. As redetermination happened — a process of reverifying a resident’s eligibility for programs like Medicaid — navigators were there for that, too.
But beginning in September, the navigator pool in Montana will shrink by around 90%, as federal funding has left the Montana Primary Care Association, which runs the “Cover Montana” program and its team of navigators with no other choice than layoffs. Olivia Riutta, who manages the state’s navigators, said seven full-time staff members will lose their jobs as well as some contracted employees who work with residents to navigate the healthcare system in the Treasure State.
 

  Federal fallout: Medicaid and insurance in Montana 

The Daily Montanan is launching a series of articles that breaks down some of the biggest changes implemented by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump in the so-called “Big, beautiful bill.”
All four members of Montana’s Congressional delegation — Republicans Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, along with Reps. Troy Downing and Ryan Zinke — voted for these changes. 
Today’s stories are the second installment:
Navigators no more: In February, Congress also voted to defund most of the health insurance navigators at the state level. In Montana, 90% of the navigators won’t be available after many of these changes become reality, leaving residents to answer questions on their own, or try their luck accessing one of the few left after the cuts. These navigators helped residents find insurance, understand their eligibility and explain policy differences. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Less leeway: States like Montana had previously come up with their own work eligibility and verification programs. But with the new Trump rules surrounding Medicaid, that means states have less flexibility and fewer resources to navigate the changes (Story by KFF Health News)
Our previous stories have included:  
Another big change in the Big Sky: Whether you’re one of more than 100,000 people on Medicaid or whether you purchase your health insurance on the marketplace (healthcare.gov), recent federal changes will mean a decrease in people who qualify under expanded Medicaid, as well as hefty health insurance premium hikes from those who purchase a plan. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Is $50 billion enough: Congress has allocated $50 billion to be used for rural state hospitals, which had been identified as particularly vulnerable in the “Big, beautiful” bill. Republicans from rural states demanded the money in exchange for the support, but will the fund be enough? And, what happens after it’s depleted? (Story by Stateline)



Though the cuts will decimate the program, it won’t leave it completely shuttered. Riutta said they’ll still be able to continue a phone hotline for people who need help, but that could come with longer wait times and no face-to-face contact. In the remaining days of August, while the funding is still in place, the team is also putting together online materials that could help residents manage the sometimes tricky world of health insurances.

Riutta said the first Donald Trump administration had also cut back on healthcare navigators, so it wasn’t surprising to see another cut. During the Joe Biden administration, those cuts were restored and, in some cases, expanded.
However, Montana has also been a success story. Before Medicaid expansion, the state claimed one of the highest uninsured rates in the country. Since then, navigators helped more than 77,000 residents enroll in insurance, according to the Cover Montana. Still, many of those changes could be undercut by upcoming changes made through the “big, beautiful bill” Congress passed. Those changes include the elimination of enhanced tax credits for health insurance on the federal marketplace, and now more onerous work requirements for those enrolled in Medicaid. Those changes, Riutta said, could leave many people confused.
“We won’t have the same capacity as open enrollment happens and, at the same time, there are big changes coming,” she said. “What we know is that for folks to enroll and effectively use coverage, they often need someone to walk alongside them and show them the process.
“It will be really sad that we won’t be able to help with that.”
Currently, Riutta’s teams are spread throughout the state to help Montanans navigate the changes face to face. Those teams will cease operations.
“Our capacity will be limited, and let’s face it: Some folks are just better suited to in-person visits,” Riutta said.
She said the navigators have also been a helpful resource as the healthcare context changed. For example, when the Affordable Care Act rolled out, residents had to learn about the marketplace; when Medicaid expanded in Montana, navigators helped with eligibility; when COVID-19 changed insurance programs, navigators were there, and even as the redetermination process upended some of the system, navigators helped make sure coverage was re-established for those who needed it.
“We were just able to spend time and get residents were comfortable,” Riutta said.
She said sometimes navigators are residents’ last stop before giving up on insurance — something that could leave them vulnerable in the future.
“People want to call someone in their community. They want to go down the road or meet face to face because it’s complicated and complex,” she said. “There have always been ongoing changes. We are expecting more Montanans to have questions.
“If we want Montanans to have health insurance so that they get preventative services and get established with a primary care provider, then we need to take time for what they need and how to enroll. Sometimes, we have to show them how to use their coverage so that they can do the things they want to do.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Navigators_01-resized-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 15:57:41.401831

Georgia is the only state with a work requirement in place for Medicaid, but several states have been pursuing such a policy for years, only to be blocked by courts or, most recently, the Biden administration. Some seek state-specific touches to the new rules. Others aim to implement work requirements before the federal law takes effect at the end of 2026.
These states’ moves and Trump’s massive tax-and-spending law share one demand: To keep their Medicaid health coverage, adults who can work must prove they’re logging a minimum number of hours at a job or school, or else qualify for one of the few exemptions.
But now, states that jumped ahead need to ensure their proposals, which require federal approval, don’t stray too far from Trump’s law.
“The statute sets both the floor and ceiling” for work requirements, said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor with George Washington University.
South Dakota, for example, announced in July that it would not submit an application for work requirements as previously planned amid concerns that the state’s laxer rules would not be allowed under the new federal law. The state’s Department of Social Services secretary had warned that working on a state proposal while the federal rules are being hashed out could be “an exercise in futility.”
Arkansas’ plan, on the other hand, is more stringent than the federal law. There are no exemptions to its work requirements in the application, which is pending with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
Arizona’s proposal also includes something that’s not in the federal law: A ban on “able-bodied adults” receiving Medicaid benefits for longer than five years total in their lives.
Arkansas and Arizona government officials said they were working with federal officials to square their plans with the new standards.
Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the department is analyzing how the new federal standards interact with state waivers.
The federal health department must release rules by next June that outline how states are to implement work requirements, according to Elizabeth Hinton, who has been tracking such waivers as part of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
“We don’t exactly know what that will cover,” Hinton said.
It’s unclear how federal officials will respond to the states’ requests, she added, but “we are aware that some folks think there is no wiggle room here.”
States can tweak their Medicaid programs through what are known as demonstration waivers, which are subject to federal approval. The waivers are designed to test new ideas in policy gray areas.
The states that have filed or plan to file such applications with work requirements include Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah.
Congressional Republicans who passed the budget reconciliation bill left room for states to use waivers to fast-track the national standards. Tara Sklar, a professor leading the University of Arizona’s Health Law & Policy Program, said she expects states seeking certain stricter requirements to have a chance of approval, while more lenient ones may face denials.
Federal officials may look favorably on Arizona’s plan, Sklar said, as a five-year lifetime Medicaid limit is different from work requirements. Even if the federal government greenlights stricter work requirements than the federal law calls for, those programs are likely to face legal challenges, she added.
The federal law includes an 80-hour-per-month minimum for work or education, with exemptions for certain adults, including people who are medically frail and parents with young, dependent children.
Montana is the first state to draft a waiver application since Congress finalized national work requirements. State lawmakers first approved work requirements — called “community engagement” standards under the state plan — in 2019, but the state’s application stalled through the end of the first Trump term and the Biden administration.
After Trump was elected again, Montana lawmakers lifted the 2025 expiration date of its Medicaid expansion program, making permanent the program that covered more than 76,000 adults in April, with the expectation that the Trump administration would approve work requirements. In mid-July, state officials released their draft plan to make that a reality “as soon as is practicable.”
The Montana plan largely aligns with the federal law, but it would create additional exemptions, including for people who are homeless or fleeing domestic violence.
Republican state Sen. Gayle Lammers said work requirements that also protect such people who need Medicaid were a big part of persuading legislators to keep the expansion program. At the time, officials didn’t know where the federal government would land on work requirements. And now, Lammers said, it makes sense for Montana to stick to its plan.
“The state should have a say,” Lammers said. “We’re very independent, and everyone is different.”
In South Carolina, state officials are seeking to roll out work requirements for a limited number of newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. South Carolina is one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, and yet the state submitted a request with the federal government in June for a partial Medicaid expansion that includes a work requirement component that largely reflects the new federal standards.
In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, called South Carolina’s proposal “a state-specific solution.”
The only state with an active work requirement program now wants to scale it back and awaits federal approval to do so. “Georgia Pathways to Coverage” expires at the end of September unless CMS greenlights an extension of the program with a key change: requiring enrollees to document once a year that they’re working, not monthly. That’s a pivot away from the program’s initial design but also differs from the new federal rules, which call for checks every six months.
Fiona Roberts, a spokesperson for Georgia’s Medicaid agency, said the state is still waiting to hear whether it needs to alter its plan.
So Georgia is among the states in limbo, awaiting guidance from the federal government.

Later this summer, a fluorescent reddish-pink spiral will bloom across the Wilkinson Basin in the Gulf of Maine, about 40 miles northeast of Cape Cod. Scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will release the nontoxic water tracer dye behind their research vessel, where it will unfurl into a half-mile wide temporary plume, bright enough to catch the attention of passing boats and even satellites.
As it spreads, the researchers will track its movement to monitor a tightly controlled, federally approved experiment testing whether the ocean can be engineered to absorb more carbon, and in turn, help combat the climate crisis.
As the world struggles to stay below the 1.5-degree Celsius global warming threshold—a goal set out in the Paris Agreement to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change—experts agree that reducing greenhouse gas emissions won’t be enough to avoid overshooting this target. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, published in 2023, emphasizes the urgent need to actively remove carbon from the atmosphere, too.
“If we really want to have a shot at mitigating the worst effects of climate change, carbon removal needs to start scaling to the point where it can supplement large-scale emissions reductions,” said Adam Subhas, an associate scientist in marine chemistry and geochemistry at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who will oversee the week-long experiment.
The test is part of the LOC-NESS project—short for Locking away Ocean Carbon in the Northeast Shelf and Slope—which Subhas has been leading since 2023. The ongoing research initiative is evaluating the effectiveness and environmental impact of a marine carbon dioxide removal approach called ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE).
This method of marine carbon dioxide removal involves adding alkaline substances to the ocean to boost its natural ability to neutralize acids produced by greenhouse gases. It’s promising, Subhas said, because it has the potential to lock away carbon permanently.
“Ocean alkalinity enhancement does have the potential to reach sort of gigatons per year of carbon removal, which is the scale at which you would need to supplement emissions reductions,” Subhas said. “Once the alkalinity is dissolved in seawater, it reacts with carbon dioxide and forms bicarbonate—essentially dissolved baking soda. That bicarbonate is one of the most stable forms of carbon in the ocean, and it can stay locked away for tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years.”
But it will be a long time before this could happen at the magnitude needed to mitigate climate change.

According to Wil Burns, co-director of the Institute for Responsible Carbon Removal at American University, between 6 and 10 gigatons of carbon need to be removed from the atmosphere annually by 2050 in order to meet the Paris Agreement climate target. “It’s a titanic task,” he said.
Most marine carbon dioxide removal initiatives, including those involving OAE, are still in a nascent stage.
“We’re really far from having any of these technologies be mature,” said Lisa Levin, an oceanographer and professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, who spoke on a panel at the United Nations Ocean Conference in June about the potential environmental risks of mining and carbon dioxide removal on deep-sea ecosystems.“We’re looking at a decade until any serious, large-scale marine carbon removal is going to be able to happen—or more.”
“In the meantime, everybody acknowledges that what we have to do is to reduce emissions, right, and not rely on taking carbon out of the atmosphere,” she said.
Marine carbon dioxide removal
So far, most carbon removal efforts have centered on land-based strategies, such as planting trees, restoring soils and building machines that capture carbon dioxide directly from the air. Increasingly, researchers are exploring whether the oceans might help.
“Looking at the oceans makes a lot of sense when it comes to carbon removal, because the oceans sequester 70 times more CO2 than terrestrial sources,” Burns said. What if it can hold more?
That question is drawing growing attention, not only from scientists. In recent years, a wave of private companies have started piloting various methods of removing carbon from the oceans.
“It’s really the private sector that’s pushing the scaling of this very quickly,” Subhas said. In the U.S. and Canada, he said, there are at least four companies piloting varied ocean alkalinity enhancement techniques.
Last year, Ebb Carbon, a California-based startup focused on marine carbon dioxide removal, signed a deal with Microsoft to remove up to 350,000 metric tons of CO2 over the next decade using an ocean alkalinity enhancement process that splits seawater into acidic and alkaline streams. The alkaline stream is then returned to the sea where it reacts with CO2 and stores it as bicarbonate, enabling the ocean to absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In return, Microsoft will purchase carbon removal credits from the startup.

Another company called Vesta, which has headquarters in San Francisco, is using an approach called Coastal Carbon Capture. This involves adding finely ground olivine—a naturally occurring olive-green colored mineral—to sandy beaches. From there, ocean tides and waves carry it into the sea. Olivine reacts quickly with seawater in a process known as enhanced weathering, increasing ocean alkalinity. The company piloted one of their projects in Duck, North Carolina, last year where it estimated approximately 5,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide would be removed through coastal carbon capture after accounting for project emissions, according to its website. 
But these efforts are not without risk, AU’s Burns said. “We have to proceed in an extremely precautionary manner,” he said.
Some scientists are concerned that OAE initiatives that involve olivine, which contains heavy metals like nickel and chromium, may harm marine life, he said. Another concern is that the olivine could cloud certain ocean areas and block light from penetrating to deeper depths. If too much alkalinity is introduced too fast in concentrated areas, he said, some animals might not be able to adjust.
Other marine carbon dioxide removal projects are using other methods besides OAE. Some involve adding iron to the ocean to stimulate growth in microscopic plants called phytoplankton, which absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. Others include the cultivation of large-scale farms of kelp and seaweed, which also absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. The marine plants can then be sunk in the deep ocean to store the carbon they absorbed.
  In 2023, researchers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution conducted their first OAE-related field experiment from the 90-foot research vessel R/V Connecticut south of Massachusetts. As part of this first experiment, nontoxic water tracer dye was released into the ocean. Researchers tracked its movement through the water for 72 hours to model the dispersion of a plume of alkalinity over time. Credit: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
One technique that has not yet been tried, but may be piloted in the future, according to the science-based conservation nonprofit Ocean Visions, would employ new technology to accelerate the ocean’s natural process of transferring surface water and carbon to the deep ocean. That’s called artificial downwelling. In a reverse process—artificial upwelling—cooler, nutrient-rich waters from the deep ocean would be pumped to the surface to spur phytoplankton growth.
So far, UC San Diego’s Levin said she is not convinced that these trials will lead to impactful carbon removal.
“I do not think the ocean is ever going to be a really large part of that solution,” she said. However, she added, “It might be part of the storage solution. Right now, people are looking at injecting carbon dioxide that’s removed from industry activities on land and transporting it to the ocean and injecting it into basalt.”
Levin said she’s also worried that we don’t know enough yet about the consequences of altering natural ocean processes.
“I am concerned about how many field trials would be required to actually understand what would happen, and whether we could truly understand the environmental risk of a fully scaled-up operation,” she said.
The experiment
Most marine carbon dioxide removal projects that have kicked off already are significantly larger in scale than the LOC-NESS experiment, which Subhas estimates will remove around 50 tons of CO2.
But, he emphasized, the goal of this project is not to compete in size or scale. He said the aim is to provide independent academic research that can help guide and inform the future of this industry and ensure it does not have negative repercussions on the marine environment.
There is some concern, he said, that commercial entities may pursue large-scale OAE initiatives to capitalize on the growing voluntary carbon market without first conducting adequate testing for safety and efficacy. Unlike those initiatives, there is no profit to be made from LOC-NESS. No carbon credits will be sold, Subhas said.
The project is funded by a collection of government and philanthropic sources including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Carbon to Sea Initiative, a nonprofit that brings funders and scientists together to support marine carbon dioxide removal research and technology.
“We really feel like it’s necessary for the scientific community to be delivering transparent, trusted and rigorous science to evaluate these things as these activities are currently happening and scaling in the ocean by the private sector,” Subhas said.
The LOC-NESS field trial in Wilkinson Basin will be the first “academic only” OAE experiment conducted from a ship in U.S. waters. It is also the first of its kind to receive a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency under the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act.
“There’s no research in the past or planned that gets even close to providing a learning opportunity that this research is providing for OAE in the pelagic environment,” said Carbon to Sea Initiative’s Antonius Gagern, referring to the open sea experiment.
The permit was granted in April after a year of consultations between the EPA and other federal agencies.
During the process’ public comment periods, commenters expressed concerns about the potential impact on marine life, including the critically endangered North Atlantic right whales, small crustaceans that they eat called copepods and larvae for the commercially important squid and mackerel fisheries. In a written response to some of these comments, the EPA stated that the small-scale project “demonstrates scientific rigor” and is “not expected to significantly affect human health, the marine environment or other uses of the ocean.”
Subhas and his interdisciplinary team of chemists, biologists, engineers and physicists from Woods Hole have spent the last few years planning this experiment and conducting a series of trials at their lab on Cape Cod to ensure they can safely execute and effectively monitor the results of the open-water test they will conduct this summer in the Gulf of Maine.
They specifically tested the effects of sodium hydroxide—an alkaline substance also known as lye or caustic soda—on marine microbes, phytoplankton and copepods, a crucial food source for many marine species in the region in addition to the right whales. “We chose sodium hydroxide, because it’s incredibly pure,” Subhas said. It’s widely used in the U.S. to reduce acidity in drinking water.
It also helps counter ocean acidification, according to Subhas. “It’s like Tums for the ocean,” he said.
Ocean acidification occurs when the ocean absorbs excess carbon dioxide, causing its pH to drop. This makes it harder for corals, krill and shellfish like oysters and clams to develop their hard calcium carbonate shells or skeletons.
This month, the team plans to release 50 tons of sodium hydroxide into a designated area of the Wilkinson Basin from the back of one of two research vessels participating in the LOC-NESS operation.
The basin is an ideal test site, according to Subhas, because there is little presence of phytoplankton, zooplankton, commercial fish larvae and endangered species, including some whales, during this season. Still, as a precautionary measure, Woods Hole has contracted a protected species observer to keep a look out for marine species and mitigate potential harm if they are spotted. That person will be on board as the vessel travels to and from the field trial site, including while the team releases the sodium hydroxide into the ocean.
The alkaline substance will be dispersed over four to 12 hours off the back of one of the research vessels, along with the nontoxic fluorescent red water tracer dye called rhodamine. The dye will help track the location and spread of the sodium hydroxide once released into the ocean, and the vessel’s wake will help mix the solution in with the ocean water.
After about an hour, Subhas said, it will form into a “pinkish” patch of water that can be picked up on satellites. “We’re going to be taking pictures from space and looking at how this patch sort of evolves, dilutes and stretches and disperses over time.”
For a week after that, scientists aboard the vessels will take rotating shifts to collect data around the clock. They will deploy drones and analyze over 20 types of samples from the research vessel to monitor how the surrounding waters and marine life respond to the experiment. They’ll track changes in ocean chemistry, nutrient levels, plankton populations and water clarity, while also measuring acidity and dissolved CO2.
In March, the team did a large-scale dry run of the dispersal at an open air testing facility on a naval base in New Jersey. According to Subhas, the trial demonstrated their ability to safely and effectively deliver alkalinity to surface seawater.
“The next step is being able to measure the carbon uptake from seawater—from the atmosphere into seawater,” he said. That is a slower process. He said he expects to have some preliminary results on carbon uptake, as well as environmental impacts, early next year.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/OAE-Chris-Murray-lab-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 15:57:41.401831

She is the agency's seventh director.,"Katie Blount, who oversaw the opening of two state history museums in 2017 and helped coordinate a redesign of the state flag in 2020, said Tuesday that she will retire next year as director of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History.
Blount joined the department in 1994 as public relations coordinator. She worked as assistant to the director and deputy director for communication before being named director in 2015. She is the second woman to hold the job. Charlotte Capers led the department from 1955 to 1969.
“Embracing complex stories draws audiences and earns the trust of partners in a position to pour resources into Mississippi,” Blount said in a press release.
She said she will retire June 30, the end of the current state budget year. Blount said the department’s employees deserve credit for telling the state’s story and preserving history.
In recent years, the department has repatriated ancestral remains and burial objects to Native American tribes. It also has worked on projects including stabilization of the Windsor Ruins and revitalization of the Grand Village of the Natchez Indians, both in southwestern Mississippi, and development of a new Vicksburg Civil War Visitor Center set to open in 2028.

Mug shots of Freedom Riders are displayed on the halls of one of the galleries inside of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum.
The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and the Museum of Mississippi History are under one roof in downtown Jackson and are collectively called the Two Mississippi Museums. They opened during the state’s bicentennial celebration.
After legislators voted in 2020 to replace a Confederate-themed state flag that had been used since 1894, Blount joined Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and then-House Speaker Philip Gunn in a ceremony to retire the old flag to the museums.
A commission to design a new flag met that summer at the two museums, choosing a magnolia surrounded by stars and the phrase, “In God We Trust.” The design went on the November 2020 ballot, and voters overwhelmingly ratified the choice.

Reuben Anderson, a former Mississippi Supreme Court justice who chaired the flag commission and is a past president of the Department of Archives and History Board of Trustees, said in a statement to Mississippi Today on Tuesday that his message to Blount is: “Just a Big Thank You for all you have done for the Museum the City of Jackson and Mississippi.”
In June, Blount received a lifetime achievement award from the American Association for State and Local History.
Spence Flatgard, current president of the Archives and History board, praised Blount’s work.
“Katie is universally respected by her peers and state leaders,” Flatgard said in the department’s press release. “Her love for public service and for Mississippians has helped us tell our story to schoolchildren and to presidents.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/06214352/IMG_0079.jpg,,,2025-08-12 15:57:41.401831

The Gillette Republican and former Speaker of the House will vie for the state’s top post in 2026. 
The post Sen. Eric Barlow will run for Wyoming governor appeared first on WyoFile .","Sen. Eric Barlow will run for Wyoming governor in 2026, the Gillette Republican and former Speaker of the House announced Tuesday. 
“I ask for your support as we embark on this vital journey for our state’s future,” Barlow said at a campaign event in Wright, according to a press release.
Barlow is the biggest name to officially announce a run for governor. Without an incumbent in the race, several other notable Wyoming politicians have either expressed an interest in running or are rumored to be mulling the possibility. They include U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, who sought the job in 2018, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Senate President Bo Biteman and Speaker of the House Chip Neiman. All are Republicans.
Current Gov. Mark Gordon is technically prevented from seeking a third-term in office, though he could challenge that, as the Wyoming Supreme Court has ruled that term limits on the other top elected positions in the state were unconstitutional.
Barlow is not the first candidate to announce — former gubernatorial candidate Brent Bien announced last year and political newcomer Joseph Kibler announced in April. 
Born in Gillette and raised on the family ranch southwest of town, Barlow served as a U.S. Marine and worked as a large-animal veterinarian and a rancher before getting elected to House District 3 in 2013. 
As a lawmaker, Barlow led the House as speaker in 2021 and 2022 and now chairs the Senate Labor, Health and Social Services Committee as well as the Mental Health and Vulnerable Adult Task Force.  
“I am a leader who stands firmly on sound, conservative principles and who will fiercely defend your rights, including the Second Amendment and the sanctity of life,” Barlow said in his announcement. “I will protect your private property rights, safeguard our public lands, and keep Washington, D.C. out of Wyoming’s business.”

His office has estimated that counties need more than 9,000 people to fully staff the state’s polling sites and county election offices for each election. The agency said retired Nebraskans have historically made up the largest portion of the state’s poll workers, but Evnen is urging young Nebraskans to join them. 
“We could not conduct our elections smoothly and independently without the work of thousands of Nebraskans who step up and serve their communities as poll workers,” Evnen said. 
Nationally, 772,000 Americans served as poll workers in the 2024 presidential election, according to the 2024 Election Administration and Voting Survey Report. That’s down from what’s typically been 1 million.

The effort is recognition of National Poll Worker Recruitment Day, when the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, a federal agency that works with state and local election officials to improve the voting process, kicks off a national effort to encourage more people to volunteer at their local county clerk’s office and sign up to be election workers ahead of the November general election. 
The effort was established in 2020, during a pandemic that left many retirees at home. 
Poll workers are paid both for their training and service on Election Day. Poll workers must be at least 16 years of age and, if 18 or older, registered to vote in their county. 
Nebraska has a unique backup plan for addressing the shortage of election workers — a draft.  Douglas County primarily uses the process, and it works a lot like jury duty.
The next statewide elections in Nebraska are in 2026, where the state will likely be in the national spotlight. Evnen said the state is “continually recognized as a leader in election procedures and security, and that is due in large part to our county election officials and their poll workers.” 
Evnen is running for re-election in 2026 and is trying to balance defending the state’s elections his office administers and echoing the concerns of some Republicans and President Donald Trump over election integrity since the 2020 presidential election, which former President Joe Biden won.

Bailey was hoping the state’s highest court would block a temporary injunction issued by Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang on July 3 that allowed surgical abortions to resume in Missouri. 
Zhang’s injunction pointed to the constitutional amendment approved by Missouri voters last year enshrining the right to an abortion in the state constitution. The attorney general contends Zhang abused her discretion in issuing the injunction. 
In a 7-0 ruling Tuesday, the Supreme Court said Bailey should not have skipped the court of appeals in his quest to overturn Zhang’s order. 
“​​For this reason, this court transfers the case to the court of appeals, where appellate jurisdiction properly lies,” wrote Judge Mary Russell.
The current fight over abortion rights has been a state question since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision. The decision triggered a law that banned all abortions in the state except in cases of medical emergency that endangered a woman’s life.
In response, voters last year approved Amendment 3, legalizing abortion up until the point of fetal viability. But because the amendment did not directly repeal state laws banning or regulating abortion, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, based in Kansas City, and Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, based in St. Louis, sued to block enforcement of those laws.
Zhang has not yet ruled on the lawsuit, but did issue the temporary injunction preventing the state from enforcing numerous regulations, including a 72-hour waiting period and special licensing laws applying only to abortion facilities. 
The order keeps in place rules that only doctors can provide abortion services and that the woman seeking an abortion must have an in-person appointment.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092623_supremecourt1-1024x669.jpg,,,2025-08-12 14:58:09.633806

Credit: Courtesy of CBS SolarLast week the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy recently announced grant support for a number of pilot projects in the MI Solar for All program, aimed at bringing renewable energy into low income communities. 
However, President Donald Trump’s administration has since canceled its support for the program amid an effort to clawback $7 billion in solar energy funds, a move the head of the state’s environmental agency says is regrettable. 
With the One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminating the federal Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which included Solar For All funding, Environmental Protection Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a Thursday social media post that the agency no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program, nor the funds to keep it alive. As a result, state leaders who were promised funds have been left in confusion. 
EGLE Director Phil Roos said in a statement Tuesday that the state’s MI Solar for All Program would provide an average savings of $400 per family per year while creating approximately 700 high-quality local jobs, all while increasing Michigan’s energy independence and building resilience against power outages and extreme weather events.
“Regrettably, the EPA wants to retroactively cut funding for this vital program at a time when such initiatives should be prioritized. We are currently working with Michigan’s Attorney General to determine our next steps,” Roos said in the statement.
According to EGLE, the state was obligated $156.1 million in federal funds to provide direct investments into rooftop solar, community solar, energy storage and upgrades, as well as workforce development, community education and outreach and technical assistance.
The state agency has also announced $13.9 million in awards to 13 pilot projects across the state, including projects in Berrien, Chippewa, Delta, Kent, Oakland, Ottawa, Washtenaw, Wayne and Wexford counties. The future of those programs is uncertain in the wake of the federal grant withdrawal.

An estimated 15 live within the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge on the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula.  (Photo credit John Froschauer)Two members of North Carolina’s congressional delegation introduced a bipartisan resolution on Monday to back red wolf repopulation and recovery efforts.
Filed by Democratic Congresswoman Valerie Foushee (NC-04) and Republican Congressman Greg Murphy (NC-03), the resolution asks for continued support and approval of federal programs and initiatives, such as wildlife corridors, to aid in protecting North Carolina’s native red wolf population.
North Carolina is home to the only wild population of red wolves in the world. An estimated 15 live within the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge on the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula.
The species has declined by more than 85% in the 2010s from roughly 130 to 15 wolves, according to the North Carolina Wildlife Federation.
“It is imperative that we ensure that red wolves do not go extinct,” Foushee (NC-04) said in a statement.
Red wolves once roamed throughout the eastern seaboard, spanning from New York to Florida, and as far west as Texas, the resolution read.
Threats to the survival of red wolves include habitat loss, collisions with vehicles, gunshot mortality, and hybridization with coyotes, according to the Wildlife Federation.
“With the only wild population of red wolves being located in Eastern North Carolina, it’s vital that we recognize the preservation efforts,” said Murphy.
There are around 270 captive red wolves around the country at zoological parks and repopulation programs, according to the resolution.
In 1967, the red wolf was classified as “threatened with extinction” under the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966.
Recovery efforts began after this. The Red Wolf Recovery Program was established in 1973, leading to the first-ever reintroduction of a carnivorous species declared extinct in the wild in 1987, according to the resolution.
The Red Wolf Recovery Program is the lone federal effort dedicated to restoring the species’ wild population.

(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)A provision of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act that caps the federal tax deduction for gambling losses at 90% will be costly for gamblers and the Nevada economy, but a potential boon to the illegal betting industry, say experts who joined U.S. Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) Monday in Las Vegas to discuss her effort to restore the full deduction.
Under current law, gamblers can deduct up to 100% of their losses against their winnings. But under the new law, even a gambler who breaks even would end up with a tax liability. 
A bettor who wins $100,000 in a year and then loses it would owe taxes on $10,000. 
The town hall coincided with the opening of Bet Bash, an annual gathering of gamblers at Circa in downtown Las Vegas, just blocks from the panel at Las Vegas City Hall. 
“I’m a 28-year old from New Jersey. I wagered $10 million myself last year with a 4% edge,” an unidentified man told the panel, adding that under the new law he’d be “paying taxes on a million dollars despite winning $400,000.” 
In a 37% tax bracket, the levy amounts to $370,000, resulting in a net profit for the year of $30,000. 
The cap applies to recreational and professional gamblers, who report their winnings and losses as business income and expenses on Schedule C, according to tax experts. Pros can also deduct business expenses such as travel and tournament entry fees 
“If you’re professional, you get self-employment tax on top of that,” said Russell Fox, a local tax professional and member of the panel.

The new law is expected to cut into gambling action across the board, but is especially problematic for professionals, according to Adam Robinson of American Bettors’ Voice, an organization representing the interests of domestic gamblers. 
“If you’re pulling anywhere from 3% to 8% a year on the total amount of money you’ve wagered, in terms of the professional profitability bell curve, you’re probably in pretty good shape,” Robinson said, adding that under Trump’s tax provision, “if you’re not beating the market by 11% or more, it doesn’t make financial sense.” 
The hold (the amount of money a betting operation retains from wagers) in Nevada sports books is currently, on average, about 5% to 6%, up from lower percentages in previous years.  
DraftKings, which enjoyed record revenue in the second quarter of this year, announced its hold for the quarter “exceeded 11.5%,” up from 9.5% in the first quarter. 
The site is known, as are casino sports books, to limit the play of some savvy bettors. 
DraftKings did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In a recent interview, DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said the cap on gambling deductions “doesn’t make sense. If you can’t deduct all your losses, you know, how does that make sense that you pay income tax on something that’s not actually income.”
“It’s not just an accounting quirk,” said Robinson with American Bettors’ Voice. “It’s a policy with massive unintended consequences.” Among them, he says, is damage to Nevada’s economy.
“High Volume VIP play and professional play is the backbone of casino handle in sports betting liquidity. If it’s no longer financially viable to bet recreationally or professionally, those players are going to take their action elsewhere,” Robinson said. “That means fewer trips, fewer hotel nights, fewer restaurant visits, fewer tips, fewer jobs.”
Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican who endorsed and was endorsed by Trump, did not respond when asked if he’s reached out to the president about the policy’s impact to the state’s economy. 
The policy will also undercut the gambling tax base developing in other states, Robinson asserts. “I’m from Illinois. I can tell you emphatically that they’re leaning on gaming for tax revenue. If the big players leave, state revenues will drop across the board.”
Lawmakers will respond, he says, by raising taxes on operators, who will “respond with worse odds, higher fees, fewer promotions.” 
Players, he says “aren’t dumb. They understand the tax implications of what’s happening here, and they know if they’ll be taxed unfairly at regulated books, they’ll just move their action to offshore sites, or they’ll go back to their local book, or they’ll look to emerging prediction markets.”
The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) projects the measure will raise roughly $1.1 billion over ten years.
“I don’t think you can raise $1 billion, because if you make people pay taxes on fake money, they’re not going to deduct it or report it or even gamble here,” Titus suggested. “They’ll go offshore or to the black market.” 
Titus is sponsoring the FAIR BET (Fair Accounting for Income Realized from Betting Earnings Taxation) Act, to restore the full deduction. “It’s not partisan. We’ve got some Republicans who are co-sponsors. It’s not ideological. It’s just not fair tax policy.” 
GOP, Dems agree Las Vegas is the perfect place to discuss ‘big’ bill, but for very different reasons

Titus noted that Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, while at a field hearing in Las Vegas last month, admitted the policy “needed to be fixed. It’s kind of like the arsonist saying, ‘let me help you put the fire out.’” 
Tourism and hospitality generate more than a third of Nevada’s gross domestic product, account for 28% of the state’s employment, and 22% of wages earned.
Titus noted gambling is in every state with the exceptions of Hawaii and Utah. “But members of Congress don’t really understand all the complications of gaming, because it’s not as big a deal in their district as it is here.” 
Ripple effect
The cap on the gambling loss deduction, scheduled to go into effect next year, comes as Americans face increased costs from tariffs, cuts to federal food, energy, and education assistance, and the elimination of coverage for millions who receive Medicaid, Titus noted.  
“It’s a perfect storm, and Nevada is always kind of the canary in the coal mine,” she said. “The economy is hit hardest here, and it takes us longer to recover. People have to have a little money in their pocket to go on holiday, and if they’re hurting around the country, we’re going to feel it.”
Visitation to Southern Nevada was off 11.3% in June compared with last year, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. 
“We’re the only state that I’m aware of that can actually lay claim to the fact that the gambling industry is our main industry driver,” former Nevada Gaming Control Board chairwoman Becky Harris said, adding she’s “frankly surprised that gambling caught the attention of somebody to have them want to mess with the tax policy.” 
Nevada Resort Association President and CEO Virginia Valentine noted that how the new law will affect player behavior remains to be seen, but warned even the perception of a lack of fairness “is probably enough” to turn off some customers. 
“The proposition when you walk into the casino is that you’re going to play your money, the game’s going to be fair, and at the end of the day, you’re going to be taxed fairly,” she said.
Harris observed that even stock market losses are deductible. She wondered what’s next from the feds. 
“What is the federal government going to come in and fiddle with next that’s going to be to everybody’s disadvantage?” she asked. “Why are you inserting yourself into my jurisdiction? Why are you trying to dictate policy?”
Harris noted that Nevada sports books were once “almost taxed out of existence” by the federal government.
In 1951, two decades after Nevada legalized gambling, the feds imposed a 10% tax on sportsbooks in response to opposition. The effort put some books out of business and drove others underground. The tax came down to 4% in 1974. Today, sports books pay a federal excise tax of 0.25% on each wager.  
“I remember a quote from the late Paul Volker, who was a chair of the Federal Reserve,” said Fox, the tax accountant. ‘Whatever you tax, you get less of.’”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-632829324-1024x623.jpg,,,2025-08-12 14:58:09.633806
,Mississippi Today,2025-08-12 18:05:56+00:00,Mississippi Today,Tommy Duff tries to stake out ‘outsider’ identity in first political speech,Michael Goldberg,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/12/tommy-duff-tries-to-stake-out-outsider-identity-in-first-political-speech/,"Billionaire Duff, in speech to Rankin County Republicans, stopped short again of announcing a run for Mississippi 
Governor.","It took Tommy Duff precisely 20 seconds to invoke the outsider businessman who rose to power with no experience holding elected office. Duff would have mentioned President Donald Trump even sooner had he not paused a few seconds to wait for applause to hush. 
Trump, Duff exclaimed before a room full of Republican insiders at a hotel in Rankin County on Monday night, has surpassed his 200th day in office. He said the changes Trump has brought about are self-evident, and the impact of the administration’s agenda is as direct as the president at its helm. He said Trump is someone who says “this is what we’re doing, and then does it.”
“And I think the thing that appeals to me the most about President Trump and watching his policies is the fact that he’s an outsider,” Duff added. “He looks at things in a different perspective. He thinks that if we’ve operated this way for so long, why don’t we change? Because maybe what we’ve been doing has not been working.” 
In what Duff’s advisers characterized as the first political speech of his life, the billionaire tire baron on Monday outlined some of the challenges he believes Mississippi must tackle, and the “vision” he has for doing so. That vision was largely short on policy specifics. 
In a sit-down interview with Mississippi Today in June, at an event with business leaders in July, and at a “Lincoln-Reagan-Trump” dinner on Monday, Duff has hinted at the broad outlines of what could become a gubernatorial campaign agenda. But Duff has largely done so without offering specific policy proposals, citing the nearly 27 months remaining until Election Day in 2027. 
Duff, Mississippi’s richest man, again stopped short of formally announcing a run for governor in 2027, but he has said publicly he is considering entering the race. 
His speech on Monday was not a divergence from his recent public appearances, as he remarks did not shed light on where he stands on a wide range of ongoing public policy debates in Mississippi, including the intra-party Republican fights on school choice and Medicaid expansion.
But he expanded on his prior calls for Mississippi to get serious about fixing its brain drain problem. Mississippi has seen a large share of its college graduates flee to other states in search of, among other priorities, lucrative jobs. 
Keeping more Mississippi-educated college students and offering the job opportunities that may incentivize them to stay, along with improving the state’s labor force participation rate, will set the stage for what Duff sees as the state’s central challenge: overtaking other southeastern states in the race for economic investment. That should involve increasing economic activity in Mississippi in areas of the state that are losing population, such as the Delta, Duff said. 
“We’re doing great in education. I am so proud of our educational advances and what we’re doing, and I give great tribute to the leaders of Mississippi for that,” Duff said. “We are doing great as a state as far as our economic activity, but there are pockets of our state that are just desperate for assistance, desperate. How can we continue to grow our state?” 
Education and economic development were the dominant themes in a speech that ran just under 30 minutes. 
Duff, who with his brother is reportedly worth a combined $7 billion, said he supported the Legislature’s “reduction” of the state income tax. In 2025, Mississippi’s Republican majority passed legislation that will gradually eliminate the tax over several years. 
But Duff also used the occasion to draw historical parallels that could prove helpful later. By the second minute of his remarks, he had mentioned not only Trump, but Kirk Fordice, who entered Mississippi’s 1992 gubernatorial race as a businessman and political outsider. Fordice rode that political image to the governor’s mansion, becoming the first Republican governor in Mississippi since Reconstruction.
For Fordice and other Republicans, Rankin County has been a key GOP stronghold. 
Duff spoke in Flowood at the Sheraton’s The Refuge, the same hotel where incumbent Republican Gov. Tate Reeves celebrated his reelection in 2023. 
The event, which organizers said was sold out, charged $100 for individual tickets. Tables cost $1,000, with the priciest tier landing at $10,000 for access to a VIP sponsor reception and two VIP tables. State legislators mingled with local party officials and lobbyists inside a cavernous ballroom, outside which a bar overlooked the hotel golf course. 
Duff’s political action committee promoted fundraising for the event, with proceeds going to the Rankin County Republican Executive Committee. 
Duff keynoted a speaking program that included at least one of his potential rivals for the governor’s mansion: Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson.
Gipson, 48, a former state lawmaker, lawyer, and Baptist minister, has already thrown his cowboy hat in the ring for the governor’s race. Gipson, who has served in state government for 17 years, delivered the invocation on Monday, informing the crowd that a higher power had made clear Mississippi’s biggest problem had nothing to do with public policy. 
“You saw our greatest problem was not education. Our greatest problem was not financing. Our greatest problem was not health care. Our problem was sin,” Gipson said.  
The speakers also included Secretary of State Michael Watson, seen as a likely candidate for lieutenant governor in 2027. Watson introduced Duff, highlighting his business success as an exemplar of both the American Dream and a Republican Party that venerates individualism. 
“He could clock out, but he hasn’t because he cares. And I think that’s an important piece of being an elected official, not that he is one, but just in case,” Watson said. “We believe it’s good to celebrate freedom, rugged individualism, hard work, entrepreneurship and success. We celebrate the positive things happening in Mississippi and America right now, and we celebrate that the American Dream is alive and well.” 
When Duff took the stage, he cast the story behind his business empire in a less individualistic light, pointing out that he had help along the way. 
“I went about a year without a paycheck. But luckily, I lived at home, and mom and dad took care of it. But we worked and we had fun, and as we grew, I learned a lot of things. One is that I’m not that important. The culture and the people are what’s important.” 
With respect to the current culture war, Duff’s remarks were short on red meat, though Duff did mention an episode from years ago when he and his brother Jim were asked by a Forbes Magazine reporter whether they had a DEI policy (the answer was no). 
Duff also mentioned his eight-year stint on the state Institutions of Higher Learning Board, claiming to have helped improve the financial health of the state’s higher education system. Duff has also done that through private donations – he and his brother have donated about $50 million to Mississippi universities.
Duff’s remarks also drew from a conversation he reported having with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. The men each spoke at a July 28 summit hosted by Mississippi Today and Deep South Today. 
Duff said Dimon asked him why only just over half of Mississippi adults eligible to work are working, as shown by a labor-force participation rate that lags most other states. Duff, who through his companies employs thousands of Mississippi residents, said the answer is a lack of well-paying jobs.
That sentiment seemed to be shared by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who, in another private conversation with Duff, reportedly nudged him to bring more of his company’s jobs to the state. 
“She said, let’s talk about how you’re going to have more (employees). Let’s talk about what other businesses you can put in our state. And I stopped, and I said, this lady really learned from Donald Trump,” Duff said. “She really understands things, because she approaches it in a different manner.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05145514/3X0A0670-scaled.jpg,,,2025-08-12 14:58:09.633806

DemasMembers of one of the state’s foremost environmental advocacy groups are taking the state’s largest electrical utilities to task for more than $250,000 in political contributions made over the past six months. 
In a statement last week, the Michigan League of Conservation voters called out Consumers Energy and DTE Energy for political contributions to more than half of members in the Legislature, particularly members sitting on energy policy committees. 
“While Michigan families continue to pay the highest rates in the Midwest for the worst service, DTE and Consumers are writing check after check to lawmakers helping their CEOs protect this broken status quo,” Bob Allison, deputy director of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters said in a statement. “Michiganders of all political stripes chafe at our elected leaders being so blatantly influenced by the very utilities they, by law, are responsible for overseeing on behalf of us.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The issue of political contributions is a bipartisan one, the league said, with DTE cutting $10,000 checks to the Republican and Democratic caucuses in the House and Senate in both the first and second quarter of the year. The company also made political contributions to individual lawmakers. Consumers Energy followed a similar strategy, with both caucuses and several lawmakers receiving thousands in campaign contributions, the league said. 
According to the Citizens Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group and energy watchdog, the two companies serve more than 80% of electricity customers in the state, while Michigan ranks among the worst in the nation for energy reliability and affordability.
Additionally, the League notes that the most recent round of donations is only what is publicly reported, pointing to an article from Bridge Michigan which noted that a “dark money” nonprofit linked to Consumers Energy spent more than $4.5 million on campaign donations in 2022 while a nonprofit linked to DTE spent $4.9 million. 
In a statement to the Michigan Advance, DTE spokesperson Ryan Lowry said the company is in compliance with all applicable laws regarding corporate donations and political contributions. 
“These disclosures showcase DTE’s commitment to our customers and communities we serve, helping us meet our aspiration of being best in the world and best for the world. The political contributions the company makes are supported by the DTE voluntary employee PAC or DTE shareholders – not from customer revenue,” Lowry said.
Consumers Energy Spokesperson Brian Wheeler similarly noted that its political contributions either originate from investor funds, or voluntary contributions employees make to their CMS Energy Employees for Better Government Political Action Committee – never customer dollars.
“[The PAC], is nonprofit, nonpartisan, and governed by an employee-run steering committee that is independent of the Corporation’s officers and Board. Participation in the PAC is voluntary and gives employees a voice in the political process, and all PAC contributions are publicly disclosed on the Secretary of State’s website,” Wheeler said.
The Michigan League of Conservation Voters is one of a host of organizations challenging lawmakers to forgo donations from Michigan’s energy utilities, with 24 members of the Legislature signing on. 
The coalition is also backing a ballot initiative to ban regulated utility companies and companies seeking government contracts from making political contributions.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_1696-2-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-12 14:58:09.633806

(Courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)North Idaho health officials on Tuesday identified the state’s first confirmed measles infection in a resident since 2023. The case was reported amid the nation’s worst outbreak of the disease in decades. 
The Panhandle Health District reported the case was an unvaccinated child in Kootenai County; the confirmation of the infection marked the first case in the state’s Panhandle area since 1991, according to a press release from the health district. 
Health officials last week reported that the measles virus was detected in wastewater in Coeur d’Alene, indicating someone in the area was infected, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Measles is a highly contagious virus and spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, the Panhandle Health District press release said. The virus can stay in the air two hours after an infected person has left. Symptoms typically appear seven to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a distinctive rash. 
Traveler visiting eastern Idaho had measles. But officials don’t think the public was exposed.

While many recover without problems, measles can lead to serious complications, especially in very young children and people with weakened immune systems.
Cases of the disease nationwide reported in 2025 have already surpassed the total number of cases in 2024, the release said. Measles has been reported in 41 jurisdictions, including in Washington, Montana, Oregon and Wyoming. Among those cases, 13% have been hospitalized, most of them children, the release said. 
State health officials also previously reported that a child from another country visiting eastern Idaho had measles, the Sun reported. 
Health officials encourage people to verify their family’s vaccination records with their primary care provider or through the Docket App. A person is considered immune if they were born before Jan. 1, 1957, have a documented history of laboratory-confirmed measles or have documentation that they received both doses of the MMR vaccine. 
“The measles vaccine is highly effective, and for most people, two childhood doses of vaccine is all they will ever need to protect themselves against measles for their lifetime,” the release said. The MMR vaccine is typically given between 12 and 15 months of age followed by another dose at 4 to 6 years of age. It can be given as early as 6 months of age for those who are traveling to areas with known measles infections or in the event of a local outbreak of measles, the release said.
 What to do if you’re exposed to measles

The virus’s serious complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain) and, in rare cases, death. A high fever, cough, runny nose, rash and red, watery eyes are common measles symptoms, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, says. 
There is no antiviral treatment for measles, according to the CDC.
People with measles symptoms should not enter health care settings without calling ahead, and should contact their health care providers. People exposed to measles should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure.

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/ Stateline)At least 12 states have received federal approval to restrict recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from using their benefits to purchase certain foods such as soda and candy.
The states receiving waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are overwhelmingly Republican. Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia received approval last week. The feds granted waivers to Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and Utah earlier this year.
SNAP served on average nearly 42 million people a month in fiscal 2024, with about 12% of the U.S. population receiving benefits.
The trend is part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s agenda to “make America healthy again” by inviting states to apply for waivers to change SNAP rules to limit what types of food recipients can buy.
Kennedy said in a statement that SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to “fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics.”
“These waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health,” the statement said.
Critics of these waivers say the policy could harm people in places such as food deserts, where healthy options are limited, and take away recipients’ power to make their own food choices.
Craig Gundersen, a professor in the Department of Economics at Baylor University, told Stateline that these changes could harm the integrity of the program.
“One of the main reasons why SNAP is such a successful program is because it gives dignity and autonomy to recipients. It gives dignity to recipients by allowing them to shop in the same manner as their neighbors, friends and family, and it gives autonomy to recipients by saying to families: You are the best ones to make decisions for your families about what to purchase,” Gundersen said.
Gundersen said he worries the restrictions could stigmatize SNAP, which he called one of the best programs for fighting food insecurity.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-12 17:56:51+00:00,CT Mirror,Immigration enforcement officers arrest two men inside Stamford courthouse,Jim Haddadin | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/12/ice-stamford-courthouse-arrests/,"Officers took two men into custody inside the Stamford court, witnesses said, enacting an immigration enforcement arrest within a state judicial building.","Federal officers took two men into custody Monday inside the Stamford court, according to two people who witnessed the event, enacting an immigration enforcement arrest within a state judicial building.
The incident unfolded around 11:15 a.m. Mike Tejpal said he was outside when he saw a Dodge Charger, Nissan Maxima and Ford Explorer pull up to the entrance. Men dressed in military-style vests got out and moved swiftly through the glass doors at the front of the building, he said. Most were wearing masks and dark baseball caps, he said.
“It was like a storming of the courthouse,” said Tejpal, who is part of a local group that documents immigration arrests in the vicinity of the building.
Criminal defense lawyer Francisco Cardona said he was inside the court clerk’s office when he heard a commotion. Cardona said he turned and saw five or six officers running toward a bathroom.
“I thought it was just somebody trying to fight in the courthouse, but as soon as we stepped outside it was clear to everyone that it was ICE agents,” he said.
Cardona said the officers pushed against the bathroom door, which was obstructed from the other side. Connecticut judicial marshals, who provide security for the building, then cleared lawyers and members of the public from the area, he said.
Cardona said he saw federal officers leave a few minutes later, taking two men in custody with them. He said one of the opaque panels on the bathroom door was broken, and he could smell an odor that resembled pepper spray.
“It was quite the scene,” Cardona said. “It’s just like you see in the movies.”
Watching from outside, Tejpal said one of the detained men was crying and spitting as he emerged in handcuffs. Video he captured shows officers walking the men out of the building and loading them into vehicles.
Tejpal said about five to seven minutes transpired between when the officers arrived and left.
Representatives of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to an email seeking comment about the arrests.
Rhonda Hebert, a spokesperson for the Connecticut Judicial Branch, responded to questions about the incident with a written statement. In it, she referred to restrictions put in place by the Trust Act, a state law that limits cooperation between state and local law enforcement and ICE.
“The Judicial Branch adheres to the Trust Act,” Hebert said. “Under the act, we are not to prevent or assist ICE in the apprehension of individuals in the courthouse.”
Members of local advocacy groups say they have observed federal immigration officers operating around the Stamford court since at least early July.
Arrest data shows migrants in the state with pending criminal charges have increasingly been a focus for local ICE officers.
However, in Stamford, arrests were previously thought to have occurred only outside the court building, said David Michel, a former Connecticut state representative who regularly documents immigration arrests in the area.
Michel, who is part of a coalition called Stamford Norwalk United with Immigrants, said lawmakers and the governor should strengthen protections for migrants in Connecticut.
“It feels like we’re in a state of lawlessness,” Michel said. “When I document this, I feel like I’m in another country.”

SNAP served on average nearly 42 million people a month in fiscal 2024, with about 12% of the U.S. population receiving benefits.
The trend is part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s agenda to “make America healthy again” by inviting states to apply for waivers to change SNAP rules to limit what types of food recipients can buy.
Kennedy said in a statement that SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to “fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics.”
“These waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health,” the statement said.
Critics of these waivers say the policy could harm people in places such as food deserts, where healthy options are limited, and take away recipients’ power to make their own food choices.
Craig Gundersen, a professor in the Department of Economics at Baylor University, told Stateline that these changes could harm the integrity of the program.
“One of the main reasons why SNAP is such a successful program is because it gives dignity and autonomy to recipients. It gives dignity to recipients by allowing them to shop in the same manner as their neighbors, friends, and family, and it gives autonomy to recipients by saying to families: You are the best ones to make decisions for your families about what to purchase,” Gundersen said.
Gundersen said he worries the restrictions could stigmatize SNAP, which he called one of the best programs for fighting food insecurity.

The Delaware Court of Chancery will introduce a new automated case assignment system, known as “wheelspin,” on September 15, 2025. 
The changes, part of a broader upgrade to the court’s electronic filing system, are designed to streamline case management, balance workloads among judges, and remove discretion from the case assignment process.
Among the updates, the court will replace its Supplemental Information Sheet with a graphical user interface featuring drop-down menus. The goal is to generate more uniform, accurate, and accessible data to help the court monitor case trends.
“We also hope that the electronic format will make new filings easier for filers,” said Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick.
 The updates also bring a new, narrower definition of “related cases”: “cases are related if they arise from the same factual predicate or transaction and involve overlapping companies or parties.” This change means that a case will not automatically be assigned to a judge who previously handled litigation involving a defendant corporation unless the new matter stems from the “same factual predicate or transaction.”
RELATED STORY: Gene Truono named Delaware Republican Party Chair
Categories previously handled by Magistrate Judges, such as books and records and advancement actions, will remain with them. A Standing Order also allows certain contract disputes to be sent to Superior Court Judges in the Complex Commercial Litigation Division.
“The current assignment system resulted from a collaborative pilot program spearheaded by Vice Chancellor Morgan T. Zurn. I am grateful for her leadership on this matter,” said Chancellor McCormick.
The procedural overhaul has been welcomed by Citizens for Judicial Fairness, which has long pushed for randomized case assignments in the Court of Chancery.
Delaware Speaker of the House Rep. Melissa Minor-Brown, who has supported the shift to automated assignments, added: 
“Fairness and justice are the guiding principles of our judicial system, but we can’t fully uphold them by standing still. We have to continually look at how innovation and improved systems can move us forward. Bringing wheelspin, or automated randomized case assignments, to our courts will improve their operations and ensure they remain a beacon of fairness.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/tingey-injury-law-firm-veNb0DDegzE-unsplash-2-scaled-e1755017349629-1024x459.jpg,,,2025-08-12 13:56:47.534661

Kim Reynolds announced Aug. 12, 2025. Guard members are shown here marching in a parade at the Iowa State Fair. (Photo courtesy of Iowa National Guard)Iowa National Guard soldiers will deploy to provide support for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in September, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds announced Tuesday.
The deployment, set to begin Sept. 8, will involve 20 National Guard soldiers providing “administrative and logistical support” to ICE officials based in Iowa who are enforcing immigration laws, according to the news release. U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has authorized the National Guard action as a supportive federal Title 32 mission, meaning the soldiers will be on active duty under state control but with federal pay.
Reynolds said the announcement comes in response to a request from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to provide assistance to ICE as the agency carries out President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts. The New York Times reported in July National Guard deployments are planned in 20 states with GOP governors, including Florida, Tennessee and Virginia.
Iowa is one of the states participating in this effort. In a statement, Reynolds linked the announcement to previous Iowa National Guard deployments to the U.S. southern border. The governor has sent state National Guard members to Texas to assist with state immigration enforcement efforts in 2023 and 2024, in addition to sending Iowa Department of Public Safety officers and Iowa State Patrol troopers to assist with missions in previous years.
“Just as we supported Texas when the Biden Administration left them to defend the border, Iowa will continue to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration laws — this time, by working with the Trump Administration to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in our state,” Reynolds said in a statement. “By providing administrative and logistical support, the Iowa National Guard will free up local ICE officials to continue their work outside the office to enforce the law and keep our state safe.”
The governor has repeatedly emphasized her commitment to working with the Trump administration and ICE in the national immigration crackdown. But some immigrant rights advocates say these actions will hurt Iowa’s immigrant communities.
Alejandra Escobar with the organization Escucha Mi Voz Iowa said in a statement earlier in August the decision to use the Iowa National Guard in ICE efforts “represents an unprecedented escalation in anti-immigrant policy” that could result in civil liberties violations and risk the safety of Iowa families.
“Escucha Mi Voz members demand Governor Reynolds keep the Iowa National Guard out of immigration enforcement,” Escobar said. “Deploying the National Guard against our state’s hard working immigrant communities is morally indefensible and risks widespread violations of civil liberties and constitutional rights. We will be closely monitoring this situation and are prepared to mobilize communities statewide against any action that threatens Iowa families.”
The state government has also taken other actions to be involved in federal immigration law enforcement. The Iowa Department of Public Safety signed an agreement with ICE in March to establish a three-person task force of special agents, deputized to carry out certain federal immigration law enforcement actions, like issuing immigration detainers.
Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird also pursued a lawsuit against Winneshiek County and its sheriff, Dan Marx, after he made a Facebook post saying he would not honor ICE detainer quests for people suspected of being undocumented immigrants, if requests had not been approved by the courts. The lawsuit was dismissed in July, as Bird said Marx and the county “have committed to continue to honor ICE detainers and cooperate with federal immigration authorities.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iowa-national-guard-e1738277998553.jpeg,,,2025-08-12 13:56:47.534661

Sessions are designed to engage Nebraskans, particularly members of Black, Native American, Latino, immigrant and rural communities who disproportionately face barriers in accessing legal support and in navigating the justice system, the coalition said in a statement.
Organizers hope to spark community conversations about challenges and gather feedback to develop solutions. In addition to sharing concerns and service gaps, community education will be provided on basic legal issues.
A’Jamal Byndon, chair of Movement in Omaha for Racial Equity (MORE), a key coalition partner, said the “Justice Access Engagement Sessions” are a critical step to expanding access and eliminating justice deserts.
“Your voice matters, and it is essential to building a more equitable legal system for everyone,” he said.
Food will be served at the sessions that are free and open to the public. Registration is requested online or by phone, at 402-212-7083. 
Similar sessions will be scheduled this fall in Scottsbluff and Lincoln. 
In addition to MORE, the coalition includes the Omaha and Lincoln chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Nebraska Appleseed, ACLU of Nebraska, Legal Aid of Nebraska, the Nebraska State Bar Association, Legal Aid of Nebraska and local private attorneys.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-12 17:31:24+00:00,CT Mirror,Sorting out Covid vaccine confusion: New and conflicting federal policies raise questions,Michelle Andrews | KFF Health News,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/12/covid-vaccine-federal-policies/,"HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has upended COVID vaccine approvals and recommendations, creating uncertainty where coverage was routine.","If you want a covid-19 shot this fall, will your employer’s health insurance plan pay for it? There’s no clear answer. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has upended the way covid vaccines are approved and for whom they’re recommended, creating uncertainty where coverage was routine.Agencies within HHS responsible for spelling out who should get vaccinated aren’t necessarily in sync, issuing seemingly contradictory recommendations based on age or risk factors for serious disease.But the ambiguity may not affect your coverage, at least this year.“I think in 2025 it’s highly likely that the employer plans will cover” the covid vaccines, said Jeff Levin-Scherz, a primary care doctor who is the population health leader for the management consultancy WTW and an assistant professor at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. They’ve already budgeted for it, “and it would be a large administrative effort to try to exclude coverage for those not at increased risk,” he said.With so much in flux, it’s important to check with your employer or insurer about coverage policies before you roll up your sleeve.Here’s what we know so far, and what remains unclear.Q: How have the recommendations changed?What used to be straightforward is now much murkier. Last year, the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech covid vaccines were recommended for anyone at least 6 months old.This year, the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is narrower. Although the vaccines are broadly recommended for adults 19 and older, they are no longer recommended for healthy pregnant people or for healthy children 6 months through 17 years old.Kennedy announced the changes in a video in May, citing safety risks for young people and pregnant people as justification.But his claims have been widely disputed by experts in vaccines, pediatrics, and women’s health. An analysis by FactCheck.org found that the secretary “misrepresented scientific research to make unfounded claims about vaccine safety for pregnant people and children.”In addition, recently announced changes to the vaccine approval framework have further chipped away at eligibility.Moderna announced July 10 that the FDA had fully approved its Spikevax covid vaccine — but approval is restricted to adults 65 and older, and for people from 6 months through 64 years old who are at increased risk of developing a serious case of covid.Two other covid vaccines expected to be available this fall, Novavax’s Nuvaxovid and Moderna’s mNexspike, are also restricted. They are approved for people 65 or older and those 12 to 64 who have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of developing severe covid.Notably, Pfizer’s Comirnaty covid vaccine is still approved or authorized for people 6 months of age and older without any restrictions based on risk factors for covid — at least for now. But the FDA could change that at any time, experts said.Increasing restrictions “is definitely the direction they are moving,” said Jen Kates, a senior vice president at KFF who authored a KFF analysis of vaccine insurance coverage rules. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.HHS did not provide an on-the-record comment for this article.Q: How might these changes alter my insurance coverage for the vaccine?That’s the big question, and the answer is uncertain. Without insurance coverage, people could owe hundreds of dollars for the shot.Most private health plans are required by law to cover recommended vaccines, whether for covid, measles, or the flu, without charging their members. But that requirement kicks in after the shots are recommended by a federal panel — the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — and adopted by the CDC director, according to the KFF analysis. The committee hasn’t yet voted on covid vaccine recommendations for this fall. Its next meeting is expected to occur in August or September.Still, employers and insurers can opt to cover the vaccines on their own, as many did before the law required them to do so. But they may require people to pay something for it.In addition, the narrower recommendations from different HHS agencies might result in some health plans declining to pay for certain categories of people to get certain vaccines, experts said.“I don’t think an employer or insurer would deny coverage,” Kates said. “But they could say: You have to get this product.”That could mean a 45-year-old with no underlying health conditions raising their covid risk might have to get the Pfizer shot rather than the Moderna version if they want their health plan to pay for it, experts said.In addition, up to 200 million people may qualify for the vaccines because they have health conditions such as asthma or diabetes that increase their risk of severe disease, according to a commentary published by FDA officials in the New England Journal of Medicine.Health care professionals can help people determine whether they qualify for the shot based on health conditions.Tina Stow, a spokesperson for AHIP, which represents health plans, said in a statement that plans will continue to follow federal requirements for vaccine coverage.Q: What are the options for people who are pregnant or have children they want to have vaccinated?Many parents are confused about getting their kids vaccinated, according to a KFF poll released on Aug. 1. About half said they don’t know whether federal agencies recommend healthy children get the vaccine this fall. Among the other half, more said the vaccine is not recommended than recommended.Meanwhile, Kennedy’s recommendation that healthy children not get vaccinated has a notable caveat: If a parent wishes a child to get a covid vaccine and a health care provider recommends it, the child can receive it under the “shared clinical decision-making” model, and it should be covered without cost sharing.Some policy experts point out that this is the way care for kids is typically provided anyway.“Outside of any requirements, vaccines have always been provided through shared decision-making,” said Amanda Jezek, senior vice president of public policy and government relations at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.There’s no similar allowance for pregnant people. However, even though Kennedy has stated that covid vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy pregnant people, pregnancy is one of the underlying medical conditions that put people at high risk for getting very sick from covid, according to the CDC. That could make pregnant people eligible for the shot.Depending on the stage of someone’s pregnancy, it could be difficult to know whether someone should be denied the shot based on their condition. “This is uncharted territory,” said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.Q: How will these changes affect access to the vaccine? Will I still be able to go to the pharmacy for the shot?“If far fewer are expected to be vaccinated, fewer sites will offer the vaccinations,” Levin-Scherz said. This could be an especially notable hurdle for people looking for pediatric doses of a covid vaccine, he said.In addition, pharmacists’ authority to administer vaccines depends on several factors. For example, in some states they can administer shots that have been approved by the FDA, while in others the shots must have been recommended by the ACIP, said Hannah Fish, senior director of strategic initiatives at the National Community Pharmacists Association. Since ACIP hasn’t yet recommended covid shots for the fall, that could create a speed bump in some states.“Depending on the rules, you still may be able to get the shot at the pharmacy, but they might have to call the physician to send over a prescription,” Fish said.Q: What do these changes mean long-term?It’s impossible to know. But given Kennedy’s vocal skepticism of vaccines and his embrace of long-disproven theories about connections between vaccines and autism, among other things, medical and public health professionals are concerned those views will shape future policies.“The recommendation changes that were made with respect to children and pregnant women were not necessarily made in good science,” Corlette said.It’s already a challenge to convince people they need annual covid shots, and shifting guidelines may make it tougher, some public health experts warn.“What’s concerning is that this could even further depress the uptake of the covid vaccines,” Jezek said.KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

On July 29, Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Jonathan D. Frieden ruled in favor of nine Democratic senators who filed the lawsuit after the appointees continued serving without being confirmed by the General Assembly. Frieden opined that the Senate committee on Privileges and Elections’ rejection of the appointees served as a signal that the legislature wasn’t willing to confirm the new additions to the boards.
The senators consider George Mason University Rector Charles Stimson, University of Virginia Rector Rachel Sheridan, and Virginia Military Institute Board of Visitors President James P. Inman, all of whom are named in the suit, as responsible for allowing the rejected appointments to serve on their respective boards.
Miyares said the temporary injunction granted by Reid is causing more problems than it solves for the courts and the institutional leaders.
“A central purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo between the parties while litigation is ongoing,” wrote Miyares. “But the circuit court’s preliminary injunction disrupts the status quo, compelling the Rectors to take the unprecedented step of barring participation by board members who have been serving for months—a step they do not have the legal power to take.”
In his petition, Miyares argues that the circuit court’s injunction is incorrect because the Senators don’t have the right to sue and are targeting the wrong defendants, specifically the university rectors. 
He also stated that the senators did not demonstrate that they would suffer any irreparable harm and are unlikely to succeed on their constitutional claim. He explained that the refusal of the appointees must involve a “completed and final refusal” by both the House and Senate, not just the committee of senators who rejected the appointments. The attorney general added that the senators’ theory that a vote by one committee of one chamber constitutes refusal by the General Assembly is wrong.
Before the appeal was filed, Democrats stated that the court affirmed the Senate’s constitutional authority to confirm or reject board nominees, and that the Senate’s authority cannot be bypassed. Democrats including President Pro Tempore L. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, and Committee Chair Aaron Rouse, Virginia Beach filed the initial suit. 
In response to Miyares’ petition, Surovell said Tuesday he was puzzled by the AG’s argument that “the General Assembly has been confirming people in the wrong way for the last 100 years” when Miyares served in the House of Delegates for six of those years and “never said anything.”
On Tuesday afternoon, Senate Democrats posted a video on social media reiterating their intent to defend Virginia’s public universities from partisan attacks.
No court date has been set, as the Supreme Court will determine whether to hear the case.

Why are there only a few people growing it?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Dave Altimari to discuss his article, “Made in the shade: CT tobacco farmers roll with the times,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Dave’s story here.
WSHU: You smoke cigars. So it must be fascinating to look behind the scenes into tobacco growing in Connecticut, considering shade tobacco leaves grown in the upper Connecticut River Valley are some of the best in the world. So tell us a little bit about the Connecticut tobacco and the shade tobacco specifically, and what you found when you went to look into this.
DA: So Connecticut shade tobacco has always been known as the best tobacco to wrap a cigar in the world, and I was surprised to learn that it’s basically not really grown here anymore. The only person who grows Connecticut shade tobacco now is a farmer in Southwick, Massachusetts.
WSHU: Wow. Why so? If it’s much sought after, why have the farmers left the business?
DA: Several reasons. First, it is a hard crop to grow. There are six pickings. It’s very susceptible to bugs and bad weather, and it doesn’t like a lot of wet weather. And it’s also, you know, after you pick it, you have to hang it, and you have to let it hang for like two months. So it’s a little tricky to handle. But the real reason was that some of the major cigar companies realized that, for some reason, Ecuador and the Upper Connecticut River Valley have almost the same climate and soil, and that they could move their operations to Ecuador and pay significantly less to get the tobacco.
WSHU: So labor was responsible.
DA: A lot of the major companies now grow what they call Connecticut seed shade tobacco in Ecuador. But it is not the same thing.
WSHU: Okay. Now, what happens with the tobacco leaves? You said it takes a while for them to be dried out, and picking the tobacco is labor-intensive. I was fascinated when I read in your article that people had to crawl on the ground to pick the leaves. Could you just describe that?
DA: Some of the plants are 10- 12 feet high. There were six pickings, and we went to the first one, which was in late July. So they had to literally pick the leaves off the bottom of the plants. So what they do is scoot along the ground, pick the leaves, and put them in a little plastic bin.
WSHU: And this cannot be mechanized. It has to be done by hand.
DA: All by hand. There were about 50 people picking on the day we were there. It was mostly a mix of older Jamaican guys and high school kids. Some of these guys have been doing this for 40 years, and for some of the others, it was their second day on the job. So it’s quite a mix of people. And Dwight Arnold, the farmer who grows it in Southwick. You know, he’s basically there running the show. He knows everybody’s name. He’s moving people between different rows of tobacco. It’s all also underneath this, like a white cloth covering.
WSHU: That’s why it’s called the shade tobacco, because it has a shade.
DA: To keep it from the sun and also to it, it’s very warm. It almost makes it more tropical. It was interesting to see the difference between standing outside and then going underneath the cloth, the shade cloth. It was definitely a little more humid, which is good for the tobacco. So he has about 35 acres now that he’s planting. There used to be well over 1000 acres of shade tobacco planted in Connecticut, not that long ago, in the 80s and maybe the early 90s. Tobacco hasn’t disappeared. A lot of those farmers now grow what they call broadleaf tobacco, and that is used more as tobacco to fill a cigar, not as a wrapper. It’s different, so easier to grow, not as temperament, not as temperamental. And so a lot of farmers have switched to growing what they call Connecticut broadleaf.
WSHU: Now, tell us, what is the difference between the wrapper and the filler? Was that distinction made?
DA: So broadleaf, the leaves, that they pull the whole plant. It’s not just one or two leaves six times. They do it one harvest, pull the whole plant, and hang the whole plant upside down to let it dry. The process of drying is very similar. You still need the sheds and to hang everything from, but it’s much easier to get it to that point. You just pull the whole plant and hang it upside down. It dries quicker. You don’t have to worry about it ripping. You know, the Connecticut shade is only used for a wrapper, so you have to, if you rip it or tear it, it’s no good. The tobacco browns as it hangs. It’s hard to handle. You have to; it’s a delicate thing to handle, and you don’t want to rip it at that point, because now it’s almost ready to be sent to the factory.
WSHU: So if it is ripped, it can’t be used to wrap.
DA: Yeah, you’re not going to wrap a cigar with a ripped wrapper; it won’t work.
WSHU: And the shade tobacco that’s grown here is sent to the Dominican Republic for drying again.
DA: Yes. So what happened is Dwight has a contract with the company that sells Macanudo cigars, and so they basically have told him, We will buy whatever you grow, and we will use it on our high-end Macanudo cigars as Connecticut shade wrapper cigars. So he probably after he picks it, he probably dries it out in his sheds for six weeks to two months, depending on circumstances and weather, and then it gets shipped down to the Dominican, where the Macanudos are made, and it is dried some more. It generally takes roughly a year from when a leaf is picked until somebody wraps a cigar in it.
WSHU: Wow. So what’s the future for the tobacco farmers of Connecticut?
DA: Actually, after my story ran, I got two phone calls from farmers who used to grow Connecticut shade, and they wanted Dwight’s phone number. They missed growing it. And so what’s happened is a lot of these farms that you know pass down between generations. So the 27-year-old manager of one of the farms called me this morning and she said, Can you get me Dwight’s number? I picked it when I was small, and I miss it. And you’d be surprised how many farmers miss growing it. So Dwight has a client, as I said, and they seem to take whatever he grows. He’s expanded. He started at 15 acres. He’s up to 35, I think he’s going to go, possibly go to 50 next year.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Time to start shopping for a buyer with the cash and creativity to make over the Providence Place mall.
A July 28 order by Providence County Superior Court Judge Brian Stern lets court-appointed receivers list the mall property for sale, redirecting profits to private lenders owed more than $250 million in principal and interest from a 2011 mortgage loan. The listing expected to hit the market in September also offers a chance to revive the sprawling shopping destination in the heart of downtown Providence — either as a mall, or something else entirely.
Once the symbol of the capital city’s renaissance, the 25-year-old mall has lost its luster  amid losses in flagship tenants and changes to consumer shopping habits. Its future was put in further jeopardy after it was placed in court-appointed receivership last fall. Private lenders in a petition filed on Oct. 29 in Providence County Superior Court alleged former mall owner and operator Brookfield Properties owed them $259 million in principal and interest from a loan taken out in 2011, which was backed by nearly all of its 1.3-million-square-foot footprint.
John Dorsey Jr. and Mark Russo, the pair of West Warwick lawyers named permanent receivers, spent the last eight months readying the property for sale, bringing in a new management company to oversee daily operations and investing nearly $100,000 in repairs and improvements to the shopping center and adjacent parking garage. The receivers also implemented a new code of conduct in March, including a provision that visitors under 18 be accompanied by an adult after 5 p.m. 
The protocol was met with public criticism, but has received positive feedback from tenants and security officers, Dorsey and Russo wrote in a June 17 status update to the court. They also touted improved tenant sales, extensions to existing leases and $800,000 in property insurance premium savings as examples of the turnaround under their watch.
Upcoming improvements include a parking garage maintenance and repair plan, a survey of the mall’s heating and cooling systems and a new housekeeping vendor. These costs helped to shape a final operational budget, which was submitted to Stern, but not made available for public viewing.
But positive changes to mall operations and infrastructure can’t erase the financial troubles of its past. Brookfield, which has owned Providence Place since it acquired prior mall owner GGP Inc. in 2018, still owed $258.5 million in April to the U.S. National Bank Association, the primary creditor for the $305 million loan granted in 2011, according to court filings. The loan matured in May 2024; every extra day the balance goes unpaid comes with an extra $39,000 in interest owed.

Stern’s latest order affirms the request of local bankruptcy attorney Joseph DiOrio, who represents U.S. National Bank Association, to direct any proceeds from the sale of the mall or its assets to its creditors to repay what they are owed.
DiOrio acknowledged requests for comment Tuesday but did not immediately provide a response.
With Stern’s permission, the receivers inked a deal with Chicago-based firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) to serve as broker for the property sale. The agreement was submitted to Stern, but also not available for public view.
Dorsey was removed from the receivership case on Aug. 5 after being tapped to serve as a federal bankruptcy judge.
The mall is expected to go to market in mid-September after JLL finishes its “due diligence” and analysis, Mark Russo, now the sole receiver in the case, confirmed via email Tuesday. 
“As for the process moving forward, JLL will lead a robust marketing effort to identify the highest and best offer for the property,” Russo said.
Rating agency KBRA estimated the appraised value of the property at $240 million in May 2021, down from a $558 million value when the mortgage loan was secured in 2011. Russo did not immediately respond to questions Tuesday regarding whether there will be a new appraisal prior to the listing.
The mall opened in 1999 after a series of delays and changes to financing and development terms. The final funding package for the $460 million project featured a state bond and a tax treaty with the city of Providence. The state deal used mall sales tax revenue to repay the debt on the bond that paid for construction. The state made its final, $73 million payment on the bond in 2019.
A separate, 30-year tax treaty with the city of Providence is set to end in 2028. Under the agreement, the mall pays $500,000 a year in city property taxes. If taxed at fiscal 2026 city commercial rates, the property would be paying nearly $24.9 million in taxes.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Tuesday.

A new restaurant there uses a program that supports vendors who are legally blind.,"A new restaurant at the former Sun-n-Sand Motor Hotel in downtown Jackson says it will serve up comfort food in partnership with a state program that provides support to Mississippians who are legally blind.
Hen & Egg was founded by the Mississippi Department of Finance and Administration, the Mississippi Department of Rehabilitation Services and Chef Nick Wallace. 
The old Sun-n-Sand is a midcentury modern structure that’s a short walk from the Capitol. The hotel operated from 1960 to 2001 and was a longtime gathering spot for state legislators and lobbyists, as well as civil rights activists. The Mississippi Department of Archives and History designated it a state landmark in 2020.

Hen & Egg opened to the public Tuesday with operating hours of 7 a.m.-7 p.m Monday through Friday and 10 a.m.-3 p.m. Sundays. The restaurant has an event space on the second floor.
Wallace, who was born and raised in Mississippi, has been featured on several cooking shows, such as “Chopped” and “Top Chef.” He runs Nissan Cafe in the Two Mississippi Museums in downtown Jackson, also in partnership with the Department of Rehabilitation Services. 
Wallace said when the department reached out three years ago to ask him to join the project at the old Sun-n-Sand, it was easy for him to agree. 
“They’re very honest people, and they just want the best for Mississippians,” he said Monday.
The restaurant is part of the Business Enterprise Program, which provides support and opportunities for Mississippians who are legally blind to become food service vendors.

By state and federal law, vendors who are legally blind get priority to operate vending facilities in state-owned and federally-owned buildings.
Hen & Egg’s vendor is Eddie Turner, a Brandon resident who is also the vendor for the Roy M. Wheat Galley at Naval Air Station Meridian and the Micro Market at the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks.
Turner, who has been blind his entire life, credits the program with helping him and others make a living and be independent. 
“I just can’t say enough about it. It’s just a great program,” Turner said. “There’s a lot of blind people across the country that benefit from it.”

Dorothy Young is director of the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation for the Blind, which runs the Business Enterprise Program. Young said Hen & Egg was also the idea of the state Department of Finance and Administration.
“The Department of Finance and Administration … wanted to revitalize a lot of state agencies around downtown, and this was just one of the buildings that they invested in,” she said.
The Sun-n-Sand fell into disrepair in the years after it closed. The state bought the building in 2019, demolishing most of it to create a parking lot for state employees. After outcry from preservationists, the commercial part of the hotel was restored in 2021 and turned into a meeting and event space, and now the restaurant.

Narrow yellow signs of “POSTED, no trespassing” hang on the doors and windows of every building.
Half a dozen cars, held hostage with yellow parking boots, remain in a lot behind the student center.
And questions hang in the air: What’s next for the now-empty college that educated students in Gaffney for nearly two centuries? What can the town do to prevent the private university’s campus from falling into disrepair?
As more institutions of higher education close across the country each year, due to financial struggles and falling enrollment, small college towns are grappling with what to do with the sweeping quads, expansive athletic fields and mammoth historic buildings left in the wake.

At least 16 colleges closed in 2024, according to Inside Higher Ed. Fifteen closed the year before.
Now it’s Upstate South Carolina’s turn to face the challenge.
‘A neighborhood school’
Limestone employed nearly 480 people before its closure, all of whom lost their jobs in a city of less than 13,000.
“Obviously we’re devastated that the college closed,” James Taylor, Gaffney’s town administrator, told the SC Daily Gazette. “It’s been a significant contributor to both the economy and culture of Gaffney.”
The campus sits on the site of the former Limestone Springs community. A limestone quarry supported the town. Nearby springs were said to have healing qualities, and the town’s former hotel, which became the college administrative offices, once drew travelers fleeting stifling summers and malaria outbreaks in the Lowcountry.
Founded in 1845 by Thomas Curtis, a Baptist minister from England, the college began as Limestone Springs Female High School. At the time of its opening, it was the first women’s college in South Carolina and among the first in the country.
SC governor calls for study to consider consolidating colleges ahead of ‘enrollment cliff’

As the college grew, Gaffney’s historic residential district built up around it. Hundred-year-old homes stand on either side of the tree-lined boulevard that stretches between downtown Gaffney and the campus.
“These neighborhood folks definitely care about what happens to the college due to the fact that it truly is a ‘neighborhood school,'” said Cassidy Holman, a real estate agent who is helping sell several homes in the area. “People see it every day when they are driving home, riding bikes, walking their dogs or going for their early morning runs.”
Holman said the school often opened up its auditorium to community events, such as musicals, beauty pageants and the annual Peach Festival talent show. The same was true for the tennis courts when the school team wasn’t using them.
State Sen. Harvey Peeler, a Gaffney native and powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, passes by the school nearly every day.
Both his wife and mother are Limestone alumnae and his grandfather’s farm backed up to college property.
“Students on one side of the road and cows on the other side,” Peeler said.
“It’s such a beautiful campus and has such a great history,” he added. “You just think of all the memories there, and it’s just hard to swallow. It’s a gut punch.”
Taylor said the school is using what’s left of its meager endowment to keep the power on and regularly patrol the campus to deter vandals.
‘We may be talking years’
City leaders have been in discussions with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which holds the main lien on the property for a $30 million loan it granted in 2018.
Taylor said it’s the city’s hope the school will remain an educational facility, rather than subdivided into multiple uses.
But as much as residents would like for something to happen quickly, he’s realistic.
“We may be talking years instead of months,” he said.
Holman said her real estate firm has handled listings for university employees who have left town to find new jobs. There are also rental homes that previously catered to the students and sports teams.
“The silver lining is that our real estate market in the Upstate of South Carolina is strong, and potential buyers are definitely out there,” she said.
At least one potential developer has announced plans for repurposing the property.
A private equity firm wants to re-open the campus as a college focused on science, technology, engineering and math, according to the project’s leader and Clover native Dwayne McClure.

“Gaffney sits right on Interstate 85, between the nation’s second largest banking city after New York and one of the fastest-growing manufacturing and innovation hubs in the country,” McClure told the Daily Gazette. “There’s no reason why a university with its geographic proximity to both Charlotte and Greenville-Spartanburg shouldn’t be successful.”
McClure said his firm hopes to do what the administrators of Limestone could not by raising money from private investors to restart the school. He said they’ll work to secure government and industry contracts to keep it operating long term.
“A for-profit institution that derives most of its profit from intellectual property and contracting, that is going to be the economic engine behind the university that will finance further development,” McClure said.
McClure said his firm, Quantum Foundry Capital, has already begun raising $55 million needed to pay off all loans, cover sums still owed to former faculty and ensure all buildings are up to code. The federal government has yet to let bidders inside locked buildings on the 125-acre campus.
If chosen as the buyer, McClure’s group will have to get the school re-accredited. While it goes through that process, he said they hope to work with the state’s technical college system to operate workforce training programs that don’t require accreditation.
McClure said his firm also is working with a group of Limestone alumni, which calls itself Saving Limestone. The goal, after 10 years, would be to turn over management of the school’s endowment to those alumni who wish to invest and remain involved.
Online students lose thousands of dollars following closure of SC’s Limestone University

“If there’s one thing that we’ve noticed from this whole process, it’s that they’ve had no voice in this,” McClure said of the school’s alumni.
The college means a lot to its graduates, he said. It’s where they met their spouse, got married, made some of the biggest decisions in their life.
About a third of McClure’s own high school teachers in Clover were Limestone graduates.
“It was the local institution of higher learning,” he said.
Instead of Limestone becoming part of South Carolina’s history, McClure said his firm wants to see it continue to move the town of Gaffney into the future.
Not many success stories
When it comes to redeveloping empty college campuses across the country, McClure said the sad part is there are not many success stories.
“If you’re lucky, the university gets turned into some sort of (U.S. Department of Defense) outpost, like a training center, or a police academy. Or maybe it gets incorporated with the school district,” he said.
But those publicly-funded uses tend not to come with the same level of economic impact for the community.
The town of Gaffney estimates Limestone previously contributed $150 million annually to the local economy through staff salaries, visitors coming for sporting events and student spending in the town.
“It works, but at best it’s about half the level it was prior,” McClure said “That’s a hard pill to swallow, because every dollar that leaves the community is now a denial of the future of that place.”
SC’s Limestone University to close after nearly 2 centuries

Peeler compared it to how the city of Columbia would look if the University of South Carolina closed its doors.
“To add to the challenge, Limestone is a private institution,” said Peeler, the Senate’s chief budget writer. “The citizens are wanting the state to step up, but it’s a private college. It’s not state supported. It would be easier if it was.”
In Alabama, Birmingham-Southern University, a 168-year-old college affiliated with the United Methodist Church, remains closed after two potential sales fell through over the past year.
A trash disposal company purchased the former College of St. Joseph campus in Vermont, turning it into a commercial driver’s license training hub for employees.
A nonprofit has repurposed the former campus of a Catholic university in Ohio, Chatfield College. It offers high school students access to college financial aid and career coaching to jobless adults, especially those recovering from addiction.
And in Philippi, West Virginia, repurposing of Alderson Broaddus University is gradually proceeding since the Baptist-affiliated closed after more than 150 years in operation.
The story of Alderson Broaddus
“I didn’t want to see this place start to crumble,” said Craig Phillips, who bought the campus at auction for $5 million in January 2024. “I was just afraid it was going to go to shambles.”
Phillips, who has made his living developing grocery stores and small shopping centers, said he and his daughter have rented some office space to local businesses. They host weddings and class reunions in the campus chapel and event space. And area sports teams have used the athletics fields for summer camps.
“Everything we can do to keep it going until something bigger comes along,” Phillips told the Daily Gazette.
It hasn’t been easy. The 187-acre campus came with 625,000 square feet of building space.
Meanwhile, the town has a population of less than 3,000. The county — Barbour County — has less than 15,500 people, according to 2020 Census data, with an economy mostly reliant on coal mining.
Phillips has replaced water lines on the campus and a couple roofs. When the school closed, it was sudden and the entire staff left without making any preparations for winter. When he first walked through the buildings, coffee mugs were still sitting on desks, just as they had been left.
Last September, Phillips inked a deal with West Virginia Wesleyan College to open a satellite campus in one of the buildings.
Wesleyan, using a state grant aimed at helping meet West Virginia’s health care needs, has enrolled more than 18 working nurses in a program that will take them from licensed practical nurses, a two-year degree, to a bachelor’s degree, said Provost Lynn Linder.
Alderson Broaddus had been known for its physicians assistant program. Wesleyan used the grant funding to update Alderson Broaddus’ simulation lab so it could continue educating people for the health field.
Closure of the private college was hard on the community. Some 150 people lost their jobs. The town lost a major employer and part of its identity.
Linder saw how difficult it was firsthand while speaking with a former Alderson Broaddus student who was enrolling at Wesleyan to finish her degree. The student’s parents were with her. Both the wife and husband had been Alderson Broaddus employees.
Linder said she is confident Wesleyan’s program on the Alderson Broaddus campus will succeed because it’s focused on a major workforce need for the area and supports nearby Broaddus Hospital.
“Colleges cant just do business as usual and expect not only to survive but to thrive,” Linder said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC_0842-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 13:56:47.534661

A nonprofit plans to ask four states to participate in a $19.5 million initiative aimed at transforming how people transition from prison to the workforce.
The Fair Chance to Advance initiative, led by the national nonprofit Jobs for the Future, hopes to provide funding and support over four years to help states expand access to postsecondary education in prison and strengthen connections to employment after release.
The new initiative comes as state prison systems across the country continue to launch and expand education and work training programs. With the restoration and expansion of federal Pell Grant eligibility to incarcerated students in July 2023, the U.S. Department of Education estimated then that 760,000 people were newly eligible for federal financial aid — fueling interest in prison education efforts.
But that momentum has not always been enough to connect formerly incarcerated people to well-paying jobs and opportunities that align with their qualifications — even for those who have earned advanced degrees — due to systemic barriers such as employer bias and restrictive occupational licensing requirements.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“What’s been the missing piece is making sure that those pathways are connected to quality jobs,” said Rebecca Villarreal, the senior director in the Center for Justice and Economic Advancement at Jobs for the Future.
Approximately 77 million U.S. adults, or about 1 in 3, have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, and can face persistent barriers to securing education, employment, housing and other basic resources after incarceration.
States can apply for the program; full proposals are due in October. Each of the four participating states chosen will represent a different U.S. Census region, according to Villarreal. Each state is expected to receive funding, technical assistance and access to a national peer learning network as part of a two-phase process beginning in February 2026.
A key goal of the initiative, Villarreal said, is to make education and workforce training acquired during incarceration more visible and transferable to employers. The program also aims to ensure that prison-based education and work training align with in-demand occupations and the broader labor market needs of each participating state.
As part of the initiative, participating states also will collect data to track post-incarceration education and employment outcomes.

Fueled by hot summer weather and persistent drought conditions across the western half of the state, wildfires as of Aug. 8 had burned more than 100,000 acres in Colorado in 2025.
By that time it was already Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020, when multiple historic blazes burned a record-setting 625,357 acres, according to National Interagency Fire Center data.
Drought conditions classified as “severe” or “extreme” extend across the majority of the Western Slope, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. A critical fire weather advisory for western Colorado and several neighboring states has been issued by the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, a Denver-based branch of the NIFC, and will remain in place through at least mid-August.

“After a dry winter with minimal snowpack fuel moistures are well below normal, and much of the region is under severe to extreme drought,” the agency warns. “Extreme fire behavior marked by rapid spread, torching, and resistance to control is being driven by critically dry … fuels, and drought-stressed brush and trees. As heat intensifies and fuel moistures decline further, fire potential will remain elevated across the area.”
Here is a look at three 2025 Colorado fires:

The Lee Fire, west of the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County, has burned an estimated 116,859 acres with 6% containment as of Aug. 12. It’s believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The nearby Elk Fire, southeast of Meeker, is also believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2. It has burned an estimated 14,549 as of Aug. 12, and is 30% contained.
The Turner Gulch Fire, east of Gateway near the Colorado-Utah border in Mesa County, is 51% contained and has burned an estimated 28,569 acres since it was started by lightning on July 12.

Due to climate change, much of Colorado has grown hotter and drier in recent decades, increasing wildfire risk. The three largest wildfires in Colorado history all occurred in 2020, and the state’s 20 biggest fires on record have all occurred in the past 20 years. Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of the Western Slope to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, and the region’s current “megadrought” is its worst dry spell in at least 1,200 years.
Most wildfires are caused by human activity. To minimize the risk of sparking a fire, authorities urge visitors to national forests and other public lands to follow local fire restrictions, ensure that vehicles are properly maintained and trailer chains are secured, and avoid driving or parking on dry grass.
In 2017, the State Forest Service reported that more than 2.9 million Coloradans lived in the “wildland-urban interface” — areas at risk of being impacted by wildfires. Fire safety experts urge residents of such zones to familiarize themselves with the “Ready, Set, Go” system of precautions.

Containment of the Lee Fire west of Meeker has dropped slightly to 6%, compared to its 7% containment Monday. A Tuesday morning map of the fire, which is the fifth-largest in state history, showed 116,859 acres burned. That’s more than 3,000 new acres burned since Monday.
The Lee Fire started in Rio Blanco County and has spread toward Rifle in Garfield County, pushed by strong winds and dry conditions.
During a community meeting at Colorado Mountain College on Monday night, incident meteorologist Rose Schoenfeld said smoke conditions are expected to improve in Rifle throughout Tuesday as winds change. But fire crews still face challenges ahead, especially moving into Wednesday, Schoenfeld added.
“Wednesday is really the day to watch with regards to fire weather,” Schoenfeld said. “Wednesday is going to be warmer, and it’s going to be more of an unstable atmosphere.”
“In the past 30 days, we have gotten 5% of the normal precipitation, putting the area in extreme drought,” she added.

Lee Fire becomes 5th largest in Colorado history as Oak Fire burns to the south


By: Delilah Brumer - Monday August 11, 2025 12:19 pm


















The Lee Fire near the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County has grown to be the fifth-largest wildfire in state history as crews continued to battle fires in several parts of Colorado on Monday.
Dry weather and strong winds have pushed the Lee Fire south toward Garfield County, blazing through more than 113,000 acres. It was at 7% containment as of Monday. The fire was believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The state’s newest wildfire, the Oak Fire, sparked Sunday west of Pagosa Springs in Archuleta County. The blaze prompted mandatory evacuations in Elk Park and pre-evacuation orders in other nearby areas.

Western Slope wildfires already add up to Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020


By: Chase Woodruff - Wednesday August 6, 2025 2:23 pm


















High winds and extreme drought conditions in northwest Colorado have fueled the rapid growth of two wildfires this week near Meeker in Rio Blanco County, where firefighting crews say they’re prioritizing structure protection with “limited resources” on hand.
The Lee Fire, west of Meeker, nearly doubled in size Tuesday and has now burned 22,497 acres, predominantly on Bureau of Land Management land south of Colorado Highway 13. About 20 miles to the east, the Elk Fire is estimated at 8,304 acres in size. Both fires are believed to have been started by lightning strikes on Aug. 2.
With the latest growth, the estimated area burned in Colorado by 11 major wildfires in 2025 now stands at 64,196 acres, according to federal data. That doesn’t include smaller fires suppressed by state and local first responders, but it already makes for the state’s worst fire year since 2020.

When the Affordable Care Act was passed in March 2010, the goal was to help more Americans get health insurance. And, indeed, the establishment of online marketplaces and a broadening of the eligibility guidelines for Medicaid accomplished that.
Fifteen years later, however, that system is anything but user-friendly.
Young adults looking for health insurance will likely benefit from talking with so-called navigators who work for the online marketplaces. But if you want to go it alone, here are some tips about shopping for a plan, based on the advice of policy experts and people who have spent hundreds of hours helping others navigate this unwieldy set-up.
Buckle up.
Start here
Begin your search at least two months before your 26th birthday. In some cases, you can sign up for a plan in advance so that it takes effect on your birthday.
First, find out if your family plan ends on your birthday or at the end of your birthday month. A few states allow young adults to stay on their family plan until they are 29, with certain conditions and, generally, higher costs. A navigator will know more.
You may have the option to stay, for a limited time, on your family’s plan under COBRA, a federal program that allows those with group health plans to extend their coverage past age 26. Odds that you will be approved for an extension are even higher if you can claim a disability.
Be aware, though, that this option will involve a considerable expense, since you will be required to pay the entire premium (the employer will no longer pay what is usually a substantial share). Those who claim a disability can often stay on the family plan after age 26, depending on the type of insurance the family holds.
If you’re undergoing medical treatment and can’t change hospitals or doctors, paying this premium may be your best course. You don’t have this option, however, if your family is insured through an Obamacare plan.
Before you start your search, make a list of the medicines and physicians you rely on, and highlight those you can’t do without. Rank them, even.
It’s quite likely that you will have fewer choices on the marketplace than you had on a parent’s plan. Be prepared to make some switches and trade-offs.

Find the right marketplace
Thirty-two states have adopted the federal marketplace as the place residents can go to compare and buy insurance policies. The rest run their own online marketplaces. You can find out here where to shop for insurance policies in your state.
Make sure you land at an official ACA website. There are many look-alikes run by private insurance brokers. The federal marketplace is found at healthcare.gov and nowhere else.
Note that official state marketplaces sometimes have unusual names. The New York State of Health, Kynect (Kentucky), Covered California, and CoverMe (Maine) are examples.
In states that use the federal marketplace, shoppers can find assistance here. On the state-based marketplaces, there is often a “find local help” button or a tab that directs you to a person who can help you find a good plan.
You will generally be asked to choose a broker, who is paid a commission if you sign up, or an “assister,” who provides the service at no cost. Assisters have received special training in the marketplace they serve, and, because they provide the service free, they have no financial incentive to steer you to a plan that pays a commission to the seller.
Assisters are often navigators who are funded by the marketplace, but in some cases they work for hospitals, health plans, or local nonprofits. You’ll have to ask.
While navigators are generally a surefire option for sound advice, they may become harder to find now that the Trump administration has cut funding for them in states that rely on the federal marketplace. (States that run their own marketplaces are unaffected.)
Many nonprofits and states run excellent programs that offer free assistance. And if, for example, you’re in the middle of cancer treatment, an assister affiliated with your hospital may offer better advice on picking a plan, since they will know which ones have contracts that may cover more of your expenses.
Ideally, these experts will walk you through the process and know which buttons to push to ensure you get the best coverage for your needs at the best rate for which you are eligible.
Sign up
Once you’re on an official website that markets plans under the ACA, you will be asked to enter your personal information as well as an estimate of your income.
Forty states and the District of Columbia cover single young adults with no children under Medicaid if their income is low enough to qualify. If you’re eligible, you should be redirected to the Medicaid website to start the enrollment process, or you may enroll directly on the marketplace site.
But be aware that the Republicans’ recently passed domestic policy bill has increased the requirements and the paperwork required to get on, and stay on, Medicaid.
Medicaid, a joint federal and state program that provides health insurance to low-income Americans, does not charge its members a premium, and it covers medications at a nominal cost or free. The caveat is that those enrolled in the program have a smaller number of in-network doctors and hospitals to choose from.
If your income is above the threshold for Medicaid, you will need to shop on the marketplace for a policy.
On most sites, a search tool allows you to check whether your doctor or hospital is in a particular plan’s network. But beware: The directories on which this search relies are notoriously inaccurate, despite federal laws mandating otherwise.
So, before you select a plan, call the doctor or hospital to confirm they accept the insurance plan you’re considering purchasing.
Do the math
When it comes to the math, it’s better to work on a computer than a phone. Generally, you can compare the costs of, and coverage offered by, only three plans at a time.
The following factors include premiums (taking account of any subsidy you get based on your income), as well as other expenses you’ll have to pay, called collective cost sharing:

The deductible — the amount you generally have to pay out-of-pocket before your insurance kicks in. (You may get a few “covered” visits with a primary care doctor; these won’t count against the deductible.)
Copayments — a fixed payment that you owe for any visit to a doctor or emergency room.
Coinsurance (this one can break the bank) — a percentage of the total bill, generally applied to hospital bills, that you have to pay. The plan may make it sound small, say, 10% to 30%. But if you have, for example, the common 80-20 split (in which the insurer pays 80% and you pay 20%), that can add up to a substantial sum. A single day in the hospital can cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, and 20% percent of that is a large amount.
The out-of-pocket maximum — the most you’ll have to pay out in a year, so long as you stay in network and pay the deductible.

Doing the math means looking at this holistically, balancing what you can pay in a premium against what you can afford for the above charges. If the deductible is over $3,000 and the out-of-pocket maximum allowed yearly is $9,200 — do you have that much money on hand?
Generally, the lower the monthly premium in a plan, the higher the share of costs you’ll have to pay should you need medical care. Note that an insurer may offer very different plans on the same marketplace, with different payment policies and networks.
People with incomes up to 2½ times the poverty level may gain some relief from cost-sharing charges, but only if they sign up for silver plans. Plans are typically labeled bronze, silver, gold, and platinum; each tier reflects the percentage of your medical expenses that your plan pays overall. Bronze plans offer the least amount of coverage.
Choose wisely
Once you’ve narrowed your choices to a few plans, study each closely.
A plan with a low deductible might require a $1,000 daily copayment, or 50% coinsurance (you pay 50%) for hospital stays. A plan that lists your desired hospital system as in-network may include only some of its locations, and not necessarily the ones close to you or that offer the type of care you need.
When looking at a plan’s details, make sure to scroll down and read its “summary of benefits and coverage” for examples of the plan’s coverage of common medical needs. Pay close attention to which services require preauthorization and, for example, how many physical therapy visits they’ll cover each year. Preauthorization can be a long and cumbersome process.
Generally, the lower the premium, the more preauthorization will be required and the more limited the coverage will be. And check what drugs the plan covers (called the formulary) to see if yours are included, as well as its network of providers, to see whether your doctors are in it.
Marketplace plans tend to have limited offerings compared with job-based insurance; there aren’t as many doctors and hospitals to choose from. Click on the “provider directory” to see if an insurer’s network includes doctors and specialists you’re most likely to need, and hospitals that are acceptable and accessible to you.
Check to see if the policy offers any coverage for out-of-network providers. Some will pay, say, 60% or 70% of approved charges. It’s a useful perk if you need to see an out-of-network specialist, or if the wait for an in-network appointment is too long.
One study found that patients with marketplace plans have access to only 40% of doctors near their home, on average, and in some areas that figure was as low as 25%. It’s quite likely even lower for mental health providers.
A backstop
If you’ve tried to choose a plan and you’re still confused, look for one of the “easy pricing” or standard plans. These conform to certain basic standards laid out by the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which oversees the marketplaces for the federal government. These plans offer some primary care appointments before you have to start paying the deductible.
The government says these plans must carry the label “easy pricing” on federal marketplace sites. But they may be identified differently on state-run marketplaces. In New York state, for example, they are simply marked with an ST (for standard).
Still, funding for premium subsidies is in place for this year at least, and free expert assistance is still out there, so don’t delay. There are good deals to be had, if only you put in the work.
Good luck.

That is the age at which the Affordable Care Act declares that young adults generally must get off their family’s plan and figure out their coverage themselves.
When the ACA was voted into law in 2010, what’s known as its dependent coverage expansion was immediately effective, guaranteeing health insurance to millions of young Americans up to age 26 who would otherwise not have had coverage.
But for years, Republicans have whittled away at the infrastructure of the original ACA. Long gone is the requirement to buy insurance. Plans sold in the ACA’s online insurance marketplaces have no stringent quality standards. Costs keep rising, and eligibility requirements and subsidies are moving targets.
The erosion of the law has now created an “insurance cliff” for Americans who are turning 26 and don’t have a job that provides medical coverage.
Some, scared off by the complexity of picking a policy and by the price tags, tumble over the edge and go without insurance in a health system where the rate for an emergency room visit can be thousands, if not tens of thousands, of dollars.

Today, an estimated 15% of 26-year-olds go uninsured, which, according to a KFF analysis, is the highest rate among Americans of any age.
If they qualify, young adults can sign up for Medicaid, the federal-state program for Americans with low incomes or disabilities, in most but not all states.
Otherwise, many buy cheap subpar insurance that leaves them with insurmountable debt following a medical crisis. Others choose plans with extremely limited networks, losing access to longtime doctors and medicines.
They often find those policies online, in what has become a dizzyingly complicated system of government-regulated insurance marketplaces created by the ACA.
The marketplaces vary in quality from state to state; some are far better than others. But they generally offer few easily identifiable, affordable, and workable choices.
“The good news is that the ACA gave young people more options,” said Karen Pollitz, who directed consumer information and insurance oversight at the Department of Health and Human Services during the Obama administration.
“The bad news is the good stuff is hidden in a minefield of really bad options that’ll leave you broke if you get sick.”

Publicly funded counselors called “navigators” or “assisters” can help insurance seekers choose a plan. But those programs vary by state, and often customers don’t realize that the help is available. The Trump administration has cut funding to publicize and operate those navigator programs.
In addition, changes to Medicaid eligibility in the policy bill recently passed by Congress could mean that millions more ACA enrollees lose their insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Those changes threaten the very viability of the ACA marketplaces, which currently provide insurance to 24 million Americans.
In dozens of interviews, young adults described the unsettling and devastating consequences of having inadequate insurance, or no insurance at all.
MUST READ: A guide to finding health insurance once you turn 26
Damian Phillips, 26, a reporter at a West Virginia newspaper, considered joining the Navy to get insurance as his 26th birthday approached. Instead, he felt he “didn’t make enough to justify having health insurance” and has reluctantly gone without it.
Ethan Evans, a 27-year-old aspiring actor in Chicago who works in retail, fell off his parents’ plan and temporarily signed up for Medicaid. But the diminished mental health coverage meant cutting back on visits to his longtime therapist.
Rep. Maxwell Frost, a Florida Democrat and the first Gen Z member of Congress, was able to quit his job and run for office at 25 only because he could stay on his mother’s plan until he turned 26, he said.
Now 28, he is insured through his federal job.
“The ACA was groundbreaking legislation, including the idea that every American needs health care,” he said. “But there are pitfalls, and one of them is that when young adults turn 26, they fall into this abyss.”
Why 26?
Back in 2010, the decision to make 26 the cutoff age for staying on a parent’s insurance was “kind of arbitrary,” recalled Nancy-Ann DeParle, deputy chief of staff for policy in the Obama White House.
“My kids were young , and I was trying to imagine when my child would be an adult.”
Before that time, children were often kicked off family plans at much younger ages, typically 18.
The Obama administration’s idea was that young adults were most likely settling into careers and jobs with insurance by 26. If they still didn’t have access to job-based insurance, Medicaid and the ACA marketplaces would offer alternatives, the thinking went.
But over the years, the courts, Congress, and the first Trump administration eviscerated provisions of the ACA. By 2022, a shopper on a federal government-run marketplace had more than 100 choices, many of which included expensive trade-offs, presented in a way that made comparisons difficult without spreadsheets.
Jack Galanty, 26, a freelance designer in Los Angeles, tried to plan for his 26th birthday by seeking coverage on the California insurance marketplace that would ensure treatment for his mild cerebral palsy and for HIV prevention.
“You’re scrolling for what feels like years, looking at 450 little slides, at the little bars, and trying to remember, ‘Was the one I liked No. 12 or 13?’” he recalled. “It feels like it’s nearly impossible to make a good choice in this scenario.”
https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Kayla-Anderson_final.mp4
Out-of-pocket expenses have soared. Complex plans in the lightly regulated marketplaces featured rising premiums, high deductibles, and requirements that patients pay a significant portion of the cost of care, often 20% — a charge known as coinsurance.
More than half of Americans ages 18 to 29 have incurred medical debt in the past five years, a KFF Health News data investigation found. Few have the reserves to pay it off.
The networks of doctors to choose from in these plans are often so limited that an insured person struggles to get timely appointments. It can even be hard to find the official websites amid an explosion of look-alikes operated by commercial brokers.
Sharing her contact information with one site that appeared legitimate left Lydia Herne, a social media producer in Brooklyn, “drowning” in texts and phone calls offering plans of uncertain and unregulated quality. “It never ends,” said Herne, 27.
Young Invincibles, an advocacy group representing young adults, runs its own “navigator” program to help young people choose health insurance plans.
“We hear the frustration,” said Martha Sanchez, the group’s former director of health policy and advocacy. “Twenty-six-year-olds have had negative experiences in a process that’s become really complex. Many throw up their hands.”
Elizabeth Mathis, 29, and Evan Pack, 30, a married couple in Salt Lake City, turned to the marketplaces two years ago, after Pack went uninsured for a “really scary” year after he turned 26.
“Every time he got in the car, I thought, ‘What if?’” Mathis said.
The couple pays more than $200 a month for a high-deductible health plan backed by a federal subsidy (the kind set to expire next year). It’s a significant expense, but they wanted to be sure they had access to contraception and an antidepressant.
But last year, Pack suffered serious eye problems and underwent an emergency appendectomy. Their plan left them $9,000 in debt, for medical care billed at over $20,000.
“Technically, we gambled in the right direction,” Mathis said. “But I don’t feel like we’ve won.”
The affordability problem
The ACA was supposed to help consumers find affordable, high-quality plans online. The legislation also tried to expand Medicaid programs, which are administered by states, to provide health insurance to low-income Americans.
But the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could not be forced to expand Medicaid. Ten states, led mostly by Republicans, have not done so, leaving up to 1.5 million Americans, who could have qualified for coverage, without insurance.
Even where Medicaid is available to 26-year-olds, the transition has often proved precarious.
Madeline Nelkin of New Jersey, who was studying social work, applied for Medicaid coverage before her 26th birthday in April 2024 because her university’s insurance premiums were more than $5,000 annually.
But it was September before her Medicaid coverage kicked in, leaving her uninsured while she fought a chest infection over the summer.
“People tell you to think ahead, but I didn’t think that meant six months,” she said.
https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Daisy-Creager_final.mp4
When Megan Hughes, 27, of Hartland, Maine, hit the cliff, she went without. An aide for children with developmental delays, she has a thyroid condition and polycystic ovary syndrome.
She looked for a health care plan but found it hard to understand the marketplace. (She didn’t know there were navigators who could help.) Now she can’t afford her medicine or see her endocrinologist.
“I’m tired all the time,” Hughes said. “My cycles are not regular anymore at all. When I do get one, it’s debilitating.” She is hoping a new job will provide insurance later this year.
Traditionally, most Americans with private health insurance got it through their jobs. But the job market has changed dramatically since the ACA became law, particularly in the wake of the pandemic, with the rise of a gig economy.
Over 30% of people ages 18 to 29 said in recent surveys that they were working or have worked in short-term, part-time, or irregular jobs.
The ACA requires organizations with 50 or more employees to offer insurance to people working 30 hours per week. This has led to a growing number of contract employees who work up to, but not past, the hourly limit.
Many companies, which say they can’t afford the rising costs of traditional insurance, offer their employees only a modicum of help, perhaps around $200 per month toward buying a marketplace plan, or a bare-bones company plan.
Young people juggling part-time jobs and insurance options face bumpy, daunting transitions.
In Oklahoma, Daisy Creager, 29, has had three employers over the past three years. Insurance was important to her, not least because her former husband had Type 1 diabetes.
As she left the first of those jobs, her husband’s endocrinologist helped the couple stockpile less expensive insulin from Canada, since they would be uninsured.
After a few months, they bought a marketplace plan, but it was expensive and “didn’t cover a lot,” she said.
When she found a new job, she dropped that plan, only to discover that her new insurance coverage didn’t start until the end of her first month of employment. The couple would be uninsured for a few weeks.
A few days later, she came home to find her husband unconscious on the floor, in a diabetic coma. After hovering near death in an intensive care unit for four days, he woke up and began to recover.
“I think I’ve done everything right,” Creager said. “So why am I in a position where the health insurance available to me doesn’t cover what I need, or I can barely afford my premiums, or worse, at times I don’t even have it?”
Kathryn Russell, 27, developed excruciating back pain two months before her 26th birthday. After extensive testing, doctors determined she needed a complex surgery, which her surgeon couldn’t schedule until after she would be off her family’s insurance plan.
Forget the pain and the fear of the operation, she said, it was insurance that kept her up at night. “There’s this impending terror of, ‘What am I going to do?’” she recalled.
(One day before she turned 26, her father’s company agreed to keep her on his plan for six more months, if he paid higher premiums.)
The idea that the ACA would offer a variety of good options for people turning 26 has not worked as well as the legislation’s authors had hoped. The “job lock” tying insurance to employment has long plagued the United States workforce.
Young adults need guidance on their options beforehand, said Sanchez of Young Invincibles. None of those interviewed for this story, for example, knew there were navigators to help them find insurance on the online marketplaces.
Experts agree that the marketplaces need stronger regulation.
In 2023, the federal government defined clearer standards for what plans in each tier of insurance should offer, such as better prescription drug benefits, defined copays for X-rays, or coverage for emergency room visits.
Certain types of basic care, such as primary care, should require just a small copay for at least a small number of initial visits. Each insurer must offer at least one plan that complies with these new standards for every level, known as an “easy pricing” option or a “standard plan.”
Most plans on the marketplaces don’t meet these criteria. Federal and state regulators had long planned to cull such “noncompliant” plans, gradually — fearing that doing so too quickly would scare insurers away from participating.
But with the priorities of the new Trump administration now in focus, and a Republican majority in Congress, it’s far from clear what course President Donald Trump, who sought to repeal the ACA outright in his first term, will take.
There are hints: Subsidies to help Americans buy insurance, adopted during the Biden administration, are set to expire at the end of 2025 unless the Republican-led Congress extends them.
If the subsidies expire, premiums are likely to rise sharply for plans sold on the marketplaces, leaving insurance out of reach for many more young adults.

Smith is uniquely qualified and dedicated to this mission to strengthen our schools and help students thrive,” Braun said.
Smith is a national instructor for the National Association of School Resource Officers as well as regional director for the Midwest states, and is president of the Indiana School Resource Officers Association.
“I’ve dedicated my career to keeping students safe, and it’s an honor to put my experience to work strengthening Indiana schools and communities as the Director of the Office of School Safety,” she said.
Braun created the Office of School Safety as part of his public safety agenda.
Indiana’s Secured School Safety Board will be absorbed by Braun’s Office of School Safety. The board, already under the Department of Homeland Security, oversees millions of dollars in annual safety grants awarded to Indiana schools.
Last year, for example, the board approved $24 million in safety grant funding shared to nearly 500 Indiana schools. In the new state biennial budget, the amount grows to to $27.1 million each year.

State Attorney General James Uthmeier is refusing to defend the law, which he considers unconstitutional. (Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/New Jersey Monitor)A gun violence prevention group is calling upon the U.S. Supreme Court to reject a legal challenge to Florida’s ban on individuals under 21 years of age purchasing long guns.
Brady, the gun safety group formerly known as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court on Friday urging the justices to decline the opportunity to rule on the 2018 state law.
That provision was just one part of the wide-ranging Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act signed into law by then-Gov. Rick Scott just weeks after 17 people were slain in the mass shooting in Parkland on Valentine’s Day in 2018.
Uthmeier, appointed to serve as the state’s attorney general by Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier this year, announced in March that he and the governor believe the law is unconstitutional, saying that if “the NRA decides to seek further review at SCOTUS, I am directing my office not to defend this law.”
The NRA filed its petition for certiorari in May. It calls for the Supreme Court justices to review the split among federal circuit courts over whether adults under 21 enjoy Second Amendment rights. The Third, Fifth, and Eighth Circuits have ruled that they do, while the Tenth and Eleventh circuits have upheld laws banning firearm purchases by adults under 21.
Jeffrey DeSousa, the acting solicitor general in the Florida Office of Legal Affairs, has so far filed two 30-day extensions in response to the NRA’s petition, with his response now due at the high court by Aug. 20.
The Brady group is criticizing Uthmeier for his refusal to defend the law.
“After the horrors at Stoneman Douglas in Parkland in 2018 and courageous advocacy by traumatized  survivors, the Republican majorities in the Florida Legislature and Republican Governor Ron DeSantis collaborated on a commonsense age requirement for purchasing and receiving firearms,” said Brady Chief Legal Officer Douglas Letter, forgetting that it was actually Rick Scott who signed the law.
“Not only have similar age restrictions existed since our founding as a Nation, they are consistent with modern scientific knowledge regarding physical brain development and our constantly expanding knowledge and understanding of mature brain functioning,” Letter said in a statement.
“In refusing to do his job, Attorney General Uthmeier shamefully denies these facts and denies the success of the law in saving lives and decreasing the rates of gun deaths of the state’s minors. The Supreme Court should deny the NRA’s profit-driven request, and allow this bipartisan success to continue.”
The Florida House in March passed a bill (HB 759) that would lower the age for individuals in Florida to purchase shotguns and rifles from 21 to 18. It was the third straight year the chamber has done so, but both times the legislation failed to become law because it never moved in the Florida Senate.
Bob Jarvis, professor of constitutional law at Nova Southeastern University’s Shepard Broad College of Law, says he does expect the state to file a response in the NRA case, and that there’s a parallel to how a group of blue states reacted to the evolving issue of same-sex marriage a decade ago.
“In the Obergefell case some years ago (involving same-sex marriage bans), the attorneys general of California, Illinois, and Pennsylvania (among others) refused to defend their state’s same-sex marriage bans,” he said. “Instead, they filed an amicus brief supporting Obergefell. I would expect Florida to do the same thing here (i.e., not defend Florida’s law and file an amicus brief in support of the NRA).”

(Photo by Ryan Berry for Washington State Standard)John Braun, the top Republican in the Washington state Senate, launched his campaign Tuesday to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. Marle Gluesenkamp Perez next year.
Braun, Senate Minority Leader since 2020, will take on the two-term incumbent in southwest Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, which has drawn national attention as an electoral battleground that helps decide which party controls the U.S. House.
“I think the incumbent is genuine and good at press releases but hasn’t really done much to improve the lives of residents in southwest Washington,” Braun told the Standard on Tuesday.
The district encompasses Clark, Cowlitz, Lewis, Pacific, Wahkiakum, and Skamania counties and a small part of Thurston County. 
President Donald Trump won it three times. But Republicans lost the congressional seat in 2022 when Gluesenkamp Perez, co-owner of an auto repair and machine shop, beat Republican Joe Kent, a former Army Special Forces soldier who Trump backed.
It was one of that year’s biggest ballot upsets and thinned the ranks of Republicans in Washington’s 12-member congressional delegation from three to two.
Gluesenkamp Perez defeated Kent in their rematch last year while in the presidential race, Trump soundly beat Democrat Kamala Harris in the congressional district.
Braun, a Centralia resident in his fourth term as a state senator, brings legislative experience, electoral know-how and a brand of Republicanism he hopes will appeal to independent and GOP voters who shunned Kent.
But Braun must mend fences with those supporters. Some of them weren’t happy that the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, under Braun’s guidance, recruited and backed candidates in legislative races in 2024 that were not on board with the MAGA agenda.
In a tacit acknowledgement, Braun seemed to make a move in their direction this past week with his boisterous defense of Trump’s signature policy for tax cuts and spending reforms. This after he and the caucus had been intentional in their efforts to distance themselves from their party’s actions in the other Washington.
Asked whether he has Trump’s backing, Braun said there is “a clear path to earning the president’s support. We’ve got to do the work first.”

“I worry, if the judge does not set the bond hearing and up until the court date, and, obviously, she does get sent back to Mexico,” said Gina Martinez, the mother of Giovanna Hernandez Martinez, with the help of a translator on Sunday. “All of our family is here, all of her siblings, she has built her education here, she has all of her friends here.”
Giovanna Martinez has been at an ICE detention facility in Richwood, Louisiana since Friday. She had been in the Pickens County Jail since Tuesday after she was stopped along Interstate 20 because of an alleged traffic violation, according to the Leeds Police Department.

According to a statement issued by Paul Irwin on Thursday, chief of police for the Leeds Police Department, an officer in an unmarked vehicle driving along the interstate when the car driven by Giovanna passed the officer and was driving “at a high rate of speed of over 80 mph. The vehicle came within feet of striking other vehicles and erratically changed lanes.”
Giovanna’s brother, Dilan Hernandez, disputes that she was driving recklessly.
“On the dash cam it was obvious that wasn’t the case at all,” he said. “My sister was speeding a little bit, but we feel that, under the circumstances, it wasn’t fair at all.”
An officer in a different police vehicle then stopped Giovanna Martinez and asked for her driver’s license. She provided an identification card issued from Mexico. Officers then reached out to immigration agents per the department’s policy who then arrived on scene and took her into custody.
“I was really afraid at first,” Gina Martinez said when she first learned of her daughter’s arrest. “I didn’t know what was going on, what was going to happen. I didn’t know if it was a regular traffic stop or if immigration had gotten her. I didn’t know where she was going, and she didn’t pick up her phone.”
Giovanna’s parents brought her and her siblings to the country from Mexico in 2008, and she has been trying to get her citizenship, according to her family.
Multiple groups and organizations have spoken out in support of Giovanna Martinez since she was taken into custody by ICE on Tuesday. The Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama said in a statement last week that she is a trusted community partner and a role model. Giovanna Martinez operates a consulting business, Juntos Coaching and Consulting, that assists youth in Alabama.
“This is another example of the administration’s indiscriminate immigration enforcement actions,” said UnidosUS President and CEO Janet Murguía in a statement on Friday. “They are not going after ‘the worst of the worst,’ but are instead detaining a hardworking, beloved member of the community.”
Steven J. Raica, the bishop of Birmingham, urged people to work toward improving the immigration system.
“As always, we urge our lawmakers, community leaders, and every person of good will to take this issue seriously, to work diligently toward reasonable solutions and sensible accommodations whenever necessary, and to strengthen our nation as a place of hope for those yearning to ‘breathe free,’” he said.
Gina and her children attended mass at St. Theresa’s Catholic Church in Leeds, Alabama on Sunday where congregants prayed for Giovanna. Afterward, some attended a workshop where an immigration attorney informed people of their rights should they encounter immigration agents and provided an update on SB 53, recently passed by the Alabama Legislature, that creates the crime of human smuggling.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250810_152354-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-12 12:59:06.304648

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds celebrates SNAP waivers approval in Washington, D.C.

Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)Former U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown is planning to challenge U.S. Sen. Jon Husted next year for one of Ohio’s two seats in the Senate, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported Tuesday. The race would surely take on a national profile as Democrats try to take control of a closely divided chamber and act as a counterweight to President Donald Trump.
The paper said that Ohio labor leaders have confirmed that Brown is getting into the race after losing Ohio’s other U.S. Senate seat in 2024, which he had held since 2007. Brown, 72, has maintained strong ties to organized labor.
Spokespeople for the Ohio Democratic Party and several others with ties to Brown couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. 
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, has traveled to Columbus twice in recent weeks, apparently trying to persuade Brown to make the race.
Husted, who was formerly the Republican lieutenant governor, is seeking his first election to the Senate seat in November 2026. Gov. Mike DeWine appointed him earlier this year to fill the seat that was vacated when JD Vance was elevated to the vice presidency. 
Brown, who had served as Ohio secretary of state, defeated then-U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine in 2006. Known as a Democrat who can attract independent and Republican votes, Brown lost by less than four percentage points in 2024 in a state that Trump carried by more than 11.
The presence of Brown in the Ohio U.S. Senate race might in some ways be a repeat of last year’s against Bernie Moreno, a Cleveland auto dealer. That contest turned out to be one of the most expensive races in U.S. history.
The Senate currently has 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats, and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. 
The Cook Political Report last week rated the races that are on the ballot this cycle. Of the 22 seats held by Republicans, it rated only one — an open seat in North Carolina — as a toss-up. Another, held by Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, was rated as leaning Republican. 
Three more, including the Ohio seat held by Husted, were rated likely Republican. It’s unknown whether that will change if Brown makes the race.
With tariffs and deportations possibly feeding inflation and weakening the job market — and with legislation that blew up the deficit and slashed the social safety net while cutting taxes for the rich — Trump’s popularity is well under water. If problems worsen into the next year, that could drag down his fellow Republicans who stand for election.
Right now, gaming and technology businessman Chris Volpe of Columbus is the only officially announced Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in 2026, pending an announcement from Brown.
Ohio 2026 Election
In addition to the statewide race for the U.S. Senate seat held by Husted, Ohio voters will also have an open-seat race for governor in 2026, along with all of Ohio’s other statewide executive offices, as all current officeholders are term-limited.
In the governor’s race, Dr. Amy Acton, the former director of the Ohio Department of Health, is the only announced Democratic candidate. On the Republican side, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy and political newcomer Heather Hill are vying for the GOP nomination.
While there has been speculation that Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel might also run in the Republican primary, he has not yet made any announcement of a decision either way. The Ohio Republican Party officially endorsed Ramaswamy in May.
Current Republican Ohio Auditor Keith Faber is running for attorney general in 2026; current Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is running for auditor in 2026; and current Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague is running for secretary of state in 2026. Also running in the Republican primary for secretary of state is retired Air Force intel officer Marcell Strbich.
A Republican primary for the nomination for Ohio treasurer features former state Sen. Niraj Antani, current state Sen. Kristina Roegner, and Lake County Treasurer Michael Zuren.
Bryan Hambley, a cancer doctor with University of Cincinnati Health, is the only announced Democratic candidate for Ohio Secretary of State. Former state representative Elliot Forhan has announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Ohio Attorney General. No Democrats have yet announced their candidacy in 2026 for Ohio auditor or treasurer.
The state also has one Ohio Supreme Court race in 2026. The sole remaining Democratic justice on the 6-1 court, Jennifer Brunner, faces a challenge from Republican Justice Patrick F. Fischer, as Fischer would be, by law, too old to run for reelection to his own seat in 2028.

Sometimes the increased government control may be justified, other times not so much. But every time emergency measures are proposed, the instinct of most Coloradans has been to investigate the facts for fear of yet another power grab.
Oddly, there’s one government “emergency” that an alarming number of citizens, media outlets, and elected officials across the political spectrum not only won’t investigate, not only will attack or censor anyone questioning, but will promote outright disinformation around it to ensure a lack of transparency or accountability.
That “emergency”? Wildfire.

What is it about the fear of wildfire that cuts off rational thinking, despite it only killing about 500 people since 1990 in the U.S., an average of 14 people per year?
While every death from wildfire is of course a tragedy, the most credible threat is home loss, firefighting expenses, and costs of rebuilding. Luckily, the overwhelming scientific consensus points to home hardening and defensible space pruning up to 100 feet around houses as the most effective way to save homes and lives.
While there has been some small progress on home hardening in Colorado, the vast majority of funding and conversation around wildfire is still focused on cutting down vast swaths of public forests in the name of “community protection.”
Surely, if we’re spending millions of taxpayer dollars on “wildfire fuel reduction” logging while gutting environmental laws to push through even more — including rescinding the Roadless Rule, “emergency” logging authorization across 112 million acres of National Forests, and what appears to be the largest logging project in Colorado history, the “Lower North-South Vegetation Management” in Pike National Forest southwest of Denver — that’s because there’s no doubt that cutting forests keeps our homes from burning, right?
At least, that’s what you’ve been told by those carrying out or financially benefiting from “fuel reduction” logging on public lands. But the truth is the science is at best conflicted — at worst, shows such logging can increase the likelihood of homes burning — evidence many of these entities privately acknowledge but publicly deny.
Forest Fire Malfeasance, the new report from Eco-Integrity Alliance, uncovers how the unprecedented scale of cutting biodiverse, carbon-storing forests in Colorado is in part the result of an effort to mislead citizens, elected officials, and media through the bad-faith denial, misrepresentation, and dismissal of peer-reviewed science and community concerns while scientists and citizen advocates are publicly smeared and defamed as disreputable.
Hundreds of emails from a Colorado Open Records Act request show evidence of Jefferson County commissioners and Open Space staff working with 23 government officials, land management agencies, logging industry trade groups, a university, and other entities to push through thousands of acres of controversial “fuel reduction” logging in Colorado public forests.
One such email from federally-funded Colorado Forest Restoration Institute at Colorado State University to U.S. Forest Service’s Pike National Forest, and forwarded through Jefferson County Open Space, privately acknowledges that abundant science contests the efficacy of “wildfire fuel reduction,” and that the agencies “overpromise” results from such cutting, while advising to never admit this to the public or media.
A quote: “There are numerous studies demonstrating both effectiveness and lack of effectiveness of forest density reduction (‘forest thinning’) projects on altering fire behavior and effects. Engaging in toe-to-toe trench warfare with competing science papers would result in stalemate — and win for the opponents.”
Other emails show land management agencies and logging industry trade groups providing provably false information and defaming ecological advocates to reporters to (often successfully) convince outlets to not report on the story.
Sadly, the consequences of these policies are not simply harm to forest ecosystems, watersheds, wildlife populations including endangered species, carbon-storage, and recreational opportunities. Ironically, the outcome is a likely increase in community vulnerability to wildfire through widespread tree removal.
This practice dries out and heats up the forest microclimate and opens stands to wind, which can rapidly spread flames, potentially overwhelming evacuees and firefighters — while commandeering taxpayer dollars and attention away from the only actions scientifically proven to protect communities: home hardening and defensible space pruning up to 100 feet around structures.

Free.,Trump taps economist from far-right foundation to head agency that tracks jobs numbers,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-taps-economist-far-right-foundation-head-agency-tracks-jobs-numbers,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump nominated conservative economist E.J. Antoni to fill the top spot at the Bureau of Labor Statistics after abruptly firing the previous statistician following a disappointing jobs report earlier this month.Trump announced the nominee late Monday on his Truth Social platform, stating that “Our Economy is booming, and E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.”Antoni, an economist at the far-right Heritage Foundation, has harshly criticized the previous BLS commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, who was nominated by former President Joe Biden in 2023 and confirmed by the U.S. Senate 86-6 in January 2024. The bureau tracks national economic data, including employment figures.Without providing evidence, Trump slammed the latest jobs report, released Aug. 1, as “RIGGED” and fired McEntarfer hours later.The economy gained just 73,000 jobs in July, according to the monthly report. BLS also significantly adjusted May and June figures, to 33,000 for both months, down from the previously reported 291,000. Revisions to past reports often happen after the bureau receives updated data from businesses and federal agencies.U.S. economic data collection is often referred to as the “gold standard,” as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a Trump appointee, said last month.Trump faced backlash for firing McEntarfer, including from his own former BLS commissioner.William Beach, whom Trump tapped in 2017 to lead BLS, told CNN McEntarfer’s firing was “groundless.”BLS data is “more accurate now than they were 30 years ago,” Beach said during the Aug. 3 interview.In an Aug. 4 appearance on Steve Bannon’s WarRoom podcast, Antoni said BLS data collection is “outdated.”“You need somebody who is willing to overhaul the entire thing,” he told Bannon.Shortly after Trump’s November win, Antoni posted on X that “DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to BLS.”Kevin Roberts, Heritage Foundation’s president, said Tuesday that Trump made a “stellar choice” in nominating Antoni.""EJ Antoni is one of the sharpest economic minds in the nation—a fearless truth-teller who grasps that sound economics must serve the interests of American families, not globalist elites,” Roberts said in a statement. “His leadership as chief economist at The Heritage Foundation has been instrumental in advancing our mission to protect American families and rebuild a resilient economy rooted in free enterprise.”Antoni contributed to the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, a roughly 900-page far-right blueprint to overhaul government institutions published ahead of Trump’s election win.",,,,2025-08-12 12:59:06.304648

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)   A federal judge in Rhode Island has sided with a coalition of domestic violence support groups in momentarily barring the federal government from enforcing a newly imposed set of restraints on Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants.
Senior District Judge William E. Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued his 27-page ruling on Friday, Aug. 8, granting the preliminary stay requested by the plaintiffs — an assembly of 17 state-level coalitions who work with domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
The preliminary stay halts the Office on Violence Against Women, an agency within the U.S. Department of Justice which distributes the VAWA grants, from instituting conditions the agency was set to apply to grant applications starting Tuesday, Aug. 12. The funding policy change would require grant applicants to align their projects and services with President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging directives to discontinue federal funding of DEI and what the administration calls “gender ideology.”
“This order is a critical step toward protecting survivors and ensuring that communities across the country can continue to provide the services Congress mandated,” the plaintiffs said in a joint statement issued Friday. “The administration’s attempt to politicize essential funding that supports survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault was not just unlawful, it was cruel.”
The plaintiffs’ legal team included attorneys from Democracy Forward, the ACLU of Rhode Island, the National Women’s Law Center, the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, and Daniel Jacobson, a former counsel for the U.S. Office of Management and Budget during the Biden administration, and now head of Jacobson Lawyers Group.
Jacobson and Democracy Forward’s Kristen Bateman made their case during a July 29 hearing before Smith, arguing that the Office on Violence Against Women violated the Administrative Procedure Act by unlawfully instituting the new funding conditions.

The organizations who rely on these funds, the attorneys argued, would see their work imperiled if they had to forgo federal funding critical to their operations. Applicants also had to certify adherence with the new restrictions, which attorneys argued could trigger future federal prosecution under the False Claims Act.
Smith agreed in his ruling that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on at least one of their Administrative Procedure Act claims. There was not enough evidence for the court to conclude whether or not the restrictions are fundamentally invalid, Smith wrote. But, the judge argued, administrative law is designed to provide clear reasoning for the actions taken by federal agencies — something absent in the office’s adoption of the new funding conditions.  
“The Court understands that this matter arises on an expedited basis, and perhaps a fuller administrative record will disclose more of the Office’s decisionmaking process,” Smith wrote. “But on the present record, the Court can only conclude that the Office engaged in a wholly under-reasoned and arbitrary process.”
Smith’s ruling returned several times to a court document he had discussed at the July 29 hearing: a declaration from Ginger Baran Lyons, the deputy director of the Office on Violence Against Women, that was filed on behalf of the federal government’s case. 
“The Office provides, as the only basis for its decision, a single declaration by an Office supervisory official,” Smith wrote. “While helpful, that declaration is not a substitute for an administrative record.”
During the hearing, Smith noted that Lyons’ declaration painted a vastly different landscape of how her office would interpret the new funding conditions, compared to the conditions’ actual language. Smith underlined that disconnect in his ruling, writing that the plaintiff groups would only find “cold comfort” in the agency’s reassurance that it would not treat survivors of violence differently than it has in the past.     
“In the context of this case and the present Administration,” Smith wrote, “the words of President Ronald Reagan have never rang more true: ‘The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I’m from the Government, and I’m here to help.’”
Smith was also unmoved by the feds’ arguments that the office “would be ‘unlikely to recover the grant funds once they are disbursed,’” and that “the public . . . has an interest in the judiciary respecting the Executive Branch’s ability to lawfully direct and guide agencies’ spending decisions.” 
The relief sought by the coalitions, Smith noted, did not require any disbursement of grant funds, just a shift in the conditions attached to them.  
“And speaking of respect,” Smith added, “the public has an interest in the Executive respecting the Legislature’s spending decisions.”

Back in April, Uncloseted Media documented every move President Donald Trump made on LGBTQ issues in his first 100 days and uncovered a relentless and unprecedented attack against the community. That attack has only intensified. Here’s the Trump administration’s complete track record from days 101-200.



May 1, 2025
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) publishes “Treatment for Pediatric Gender Dysphoria: Review of Evidence and Best Practices,” a 409‑page report promoting “gender exploratory therapy.” The report’s nine authors are left anonymous in a move experts have called unusual. MIT philosophy professor Alex Byrne would later come forward as one of the authors, drawing criticism for his lack of medical expertise. Medical experts and advocacy groups criticize the review as biased, misleading and akin to conversion therapy.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) cuts more than $800 million in research grants meant to study the health of LGBTQ people. The cuts abandon studies of cancers and viruses and setback efforts to defeat a resurgence of sexually transmitted infections, according to an analysis of federal data by The New York Times. They also eliminate swaths of medical research on diseases that disproportionately afflict LGBTQ people.
In termination letters, the NIH justifies the cuts by telling scientists that their work “no longer effectuates agency priorities.” In some cases, they say the research had been “based on gender identity,” which gave rise to “unscientific” results that ignored “biological realities.”

The Department of Justice (DOJ) removes all references to gender or gender identity from at least four federal surveys. The changes will make it nearly impossible to monitor crimes and other forms of violence experienced by transgender people.

The Supreme Court rules that President Trump’s ban on transgender troops serving in the military can go into effect immediately while the courts decide a final outcome. Alaina Kupec, a retired transgender U.S. Navy lieutenant, says the decision punishes people who are qualified and want to serve the country. “[This is] a really dark day for our country where basically we’re allowed to discriminate against a class of people.”

Trump does not acknowledge Pride month. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt says, “There are no plans for a proclamation for the month of June, but I can tell you this president is very proud to be a president for all Americans, regardless of race, religion or creed,” notably leaving out the LGBTQ community and never using the word “Pride.”

NIH staffers issue the Bethesda declaration, stating that the Trump administration has forced the NIH to “[politicize] research by halting high-quality, peer reviewed grants and contracts” as well as “[censor] critical research” on subjects including health disparities, health impacts of climate change and gender identity. The declaration has been signed by at least 484 staffers.
NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya would later push back, saying the cuts align with the president’s agenda. “Making America healthy again involves deprioritizing research that doesn’t have a chance of making America healthy, [such as] a lot of ideological research.”
June 17, 2025
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) announces that the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline will shutter LGBTQ youth services on July 17, with the Trump administration saying the program promotes “radical gender ideology” without parental consent. In the announcement, SAMHSA notably drops the “T” in their references to the “LBG+” community.
The same day, a White House spokesperson attacks a federal judge’s ruling to block the Trump administration from disallowing transgender and intersex Americans to obtain passports aligned with their gender identity, calling it an attempt to “push radical gender ideology.” The judge rules that Trump’s executive order likely violates the Fifth Amendment as it discriminates on the basis of sex.
Reid Solomon-Lane, a transgender man and a plaintiff in Orr v. Trump, responds to the attacks: “I thought that 18 years after transitioning, I would be able to live my life in safety. … Now, as a married father of three … if my passport were to reflect a sex designation that is inconsistent with who I am, I would be forcibly outed every time I used [it] for travel or identification, causing potential harm to my safety and my family’s safety.”

In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court rules in favor of United States v. Skrmetti, upholding Tennessee’s SB1 law, which bans gender-affirming care for minors. As a result, 25 statewide bans on gender-affirming care remain in effect.
In an interview with Uncloseted Media, five trans youth speak out about the decision, with one saying, “Lawmakers don’t need to be involved in my doctor visits. … They’ve got a lane and they should stay in it.”
That same day, the acting chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission admits at her confirmation hearing that transgender workers are protected under civil rights laws. Despite this, she defends dropping lawsuits on their behalf, saying the agency must follow Trump’s executive orders.

The Trump administration withholds nearly $7 billion in school funding as it investigates whether the funds support undocumented students or LGBTQ-inclusive education.
But after pressure led by Democratic Congresswoman Alma S. Adams, Trump administration officials would later announce that they will release the funds.

Responding to Trump’s executive order that bans gender-affirming care for people younger than 19, major health networks and many regional centers begin suspending care. The lines drawn are arbitrary. At Stanford, patients as old as 18 are affected. Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) announces that in July they will begin cutting off care for patients as old as 25. CHLA states that they were left with “no viable alternative” because they could not risk any cuts to their federal funding.

The Trump administration officially shuts down the LGBTQ-specific option on the 988 youth suicide hotline. Notably, there are no plans to shut down the other targeted hotline options, including the Veterans Crisis Line, the Spanish Language Line and the Native and Strong Lifeline.
Arden, who called when they were 16, told Uncloseted Media, “If it weren’t for the hotline, I would have killed myself.”
July 18, 2025
State Department officials tell the Guardian that nearly $10 million in U.S.-funded contraceptives, purchased for now-defunct foreign aid programs, are set to be destroyed after being unable to find any “eligible buyers,” in part due to a gag rule reinstated and expanded by Trump that bans funding to overseas reproductive health, family planning and HIV-prevention programs as well as LGBTQ health initiatives. The contraceptives are currently being stored in a Belgian warehouse until their eventual demise, with the Washington Post reporting that, as of April, the stock included over 26 million condoms, millions of birth control packets, hundreds of thousands of contraceptive implants, nearly 2 million injectable contraceptive doses and more than 50,000 vials of HIV-prevention medication.
That same day, a federal judge issues a preliminary injunction against a law requiring clergy in Washington State to report child abuse disclosed during confession, finding the law likely violates the First Amendment by forcing priests to choose between their religious vows and civil obligations. The ruling, which upholds the absolute confidentiality of confession, follows the Trump administration’s DOJ joining a lawsuit on the side of the plaintiffs the month prior.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) dismisses abuse allegations from Andry Hernández Romero, a gay Venezuelan makeup artist the Trump administration deported to an El Salvadoran maximum-security prison, where he spent 125 days. Hernández Romero reports torture, sexual assault and other inhumane treatment. DHS labels him and others as “criminal, illegal gang members,” despite his clean record and lawful attempt to seek asylum in the U.S.

American painter Amy Sherald cancels a Smithsonian art show after the institution attempts to remove her painting “Trans Forming Liberty” that depicts a transgender woman as the Statue of Liberty. Sherald speculates that the Smithsonian’s decision was motivated in part by “institutional fear” of an anti-trans political climate.

Sixteen states and the District of Columbia sue the Trump administration for its attempts to institute a de facto national ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth. “The federal government is running a cruel and targeted harassment campaign against providers who offer lawful, lifesaving care to children,” writes New York Attorney General Letitia James.
