(Photo by Maya Mitchell/New Hampshire Bulletin)It has been months since New Hampshire passed its state budget, and the status of $15 million appropriated for child care employers remains a point of confusion, including for lawmakers.
During the two-year budget process earlier this year, Gov. Kelly Ayotte proposed a series of spending reductions due to declining tax revenues. Among the cuts was $15 million that in the previous biennial budget had been appropriated to the Department of Health and Human Services for “the purpose of financing recruitment and retention bonus benefits and grants for New Hampshire child care employers.”
The loss of funding could have a detrimental impact on the child care industry, which is already struggling with low wages and a workforce shortage across the state. Child care employers used this money to help recruit new staff; for employee bonuses, professional development, and staff training; and to ensure employment eligibility, since in New Hampshire you must have specific certifications to be left alone with children under age 5.
So lawmakers offered a compromise: What if the state used extra federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, funds to help child care employers, rather than state general funds, as they had previously done? 
TANF is a federal program designed to help low-income families with children achieve “economic security and stability,” according to the federal Administration of Children and Families. Through the program, states receive grants to help design and operate programs that fall under TANF’s statutory purposes. 
According to Phil Sletten, research director at the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, the state receives about $38 million in TANF funds from the federal government every year. Thirty percent of the money is transferred to programs such as the Child Care Development Fund and the state’s Child Care Scholarship Program. A separate amount is also placed into a reserve savings fund each year, and the legislators proposed pulling money from there to fund the $15 million for child care employers. 
“Currently in New Hampshire law, there is a TANF backstop that a portion of TANF funds are set aside to make sure that those dollars are available in case the state runs out of [money] that supports the Child Care Scholarship Program,” Sletten said. “It hasn’t been needed in 15 years or so.” 
The allotted funds for child care employers would require approval, however, since that expenditure does not align with one of TANF’s statutory purposes. The Legislature passed the budget in June knowing it would need to ask for it, and so the law states that funding is “contingent upon the department seeking formal approval from the federal Department of Health and Human Services to use the funds for the purposes specified.”
The state Department of Health and Human Services was required by law to send its letter with the request by Aug. 1. 
“During the legislative session, there was a lot of advocacy around the $15 million,” said Rep. Mary Jane Wallner, a Concord Democrat, who serves on the House Finance Committee. “Providers had the funds to help their workforce and address workforce issues in the last biennium. Without the $15 million, that’s a real backsliding for the child care community.”
Before the federal government responded, state Department of Health and Human Services officials were skeptical that the state’s proposed funding method would work. Karen Herbert, director of the department’s economic stability division, said in a meeting with child care stakeholders in June that the department anticipated the federal government would not allow the funds to be used. 
“It’s a complicated funding program and even the rules around it can be very complicated,” she said. “But we will get through it, and we will do the best that we can.” 
 The federal government’s response last month confirmed those fears. 
On Oct. 2, Herbert received an email from Kisha Russell, a regional program manager for the Administration for Children and Families, the federal Health and Human Services agency responsible for allocating TANF funds.  
Russell wrote that TANF funds put into the Child Care Development Fund “can be used for child care worker bonuses and other retention activities.” However, Russell also wrote “it is not clear” to the agency “how recruitment and retention bonuses for New Hampshire child care employers meet a TANF purpose.” 
Jake Leon, director of communications for the state Department of Health and Human Services, said the Administration for Children and Families confirmed it “is not an allowable use” to use TANF funds to pay child care providers staff bonuses, although the department can continue to transfer TANF funds to support the development fund. 
“Funding childcare recruitment and retention initiatives does not fall into one of the four purposes of the TANF program specified in federal law,” Leon wrote in an email. 
The $15 million in funding is now in limbo, however Leon said the department is “committed” to growing the child care workforce in New Hampshire by working with community colleges and universities, nonprofits, and private-sector partners. 
The budget does not outline what the next steps would be in the event the federal government rejected the state plan. To address this, Wallner is proposing a bill next legislative session to find the money elsewhere. 
“I thought that it would be a good idea that we at least bring forth a piece of legislation that would say if the federal government answers back, ‘No, you cannot use the funds that way,’ or never answer … we would then use general funds for the $15 million,” Wallner said. 
The regular legislative session is scheduled to begin on Jan. 7, 2026.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/statehousetanf-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-18 14:57:26.894376

Credit: Related DigitalFollowing up on a request by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, the regulatory body overseeing Michigan energy companies announced on Tuesday that it would hold a public hearing to take comments on DTE Electric Co.’s application to approve contracts to supply power to a data center project in Saline Township. 
The Michigan Public Service Commission will hold the hearing on Wednesday, Dec. 3, between 6:30 and 8:30 p.m. on Microsoft Teams. Participants can join through the meeting’s Microsoft Teams link or by dialing 1-248-509-0316 and entering the conference ID 593258092# when prompted.
DTE filed an ex-parte request with the commission on Oct. 31, seeking the commission’s approval to provide 1.4 gigawatts of power to a data center announced a day earlier. The project is being developed in Saline Township by Oracle, Chat GPT creator Open AI and Related Digital following a legal battle between Related Digital and the host community over the township board’s vote against rezoning the land for the project. 
On Nov. 6, Nessel filed a notice with the public service commission, asking the regulatory body to take public testimony on the matter and to treat the matter as a contested case, as the type of request DTE filed does not carry public hearing requirements.
While Dan Scripps, the chair of the public service commission, said the hearing will add an important element of transparency in evaluating DTE’s request and ensuring costs from the project are not borne by other ratepayers, Nessel argued the commission has failed to allow for meaningful intervention and review of the contracts.
“Without formal hearings and a contested case declaration, this alone would amount to little more than performative listening rather than thorough public scrutiny,” Nessel said in a statement. “I am concerned that the [commission] has yet to respond to my request to intervene and hold true hearings, and I am fearful that today’s announcement signals they have no intention to hold the formal hearings our residents and ratepayers deserve. To protect Michiganders in this crucial moment we must demand a full, formal contested case, where parties can issue demands for discovery, submit informed expert testimony, and create a record of evidence upon which the MPSC, and everyone across the State, can fairly evaluate these contracts.”

You can read more about the section here.

After reading about Katina Rankin’s “degrading” hospital stay, I felt compelled to do three things: (1) offer her my sincerest apologies, (2) share my perspective from a family member of a patient who was recently in two Mississippi hospitals and (3) propose a cost-effective solution to keeping our hospitals open. 
Ms. Rankin, thank you for sharing your story. You stated that you almost did not write about your experience, but I am so thankful that you did. It gave me, and I am sure others, a very candid picture of what it felt like to be in your shoes.  
When you shared that you “dragged” yourself to the restroom after waiting 15 minutes after pressing the call button for assistance, I visualized that scene and felt your distress. While you did not get the care that you deserved, I am respectfully answering your call by first saying that I am truly sorry about your experience. While our health care system has problems, it also has the potential to be greater, and it will take courageous patients like you to share their stories to strengthen our hospitals, not tear them down.  
Not to belittle Ms. Rankin’s experience, but I must share a completely different perspective after spending over two months in the hospital with my aunt.  It is important to note that our experiences are mutually exclusive of illness and other circumstances.  However, both are based on our own personal interactions and observations, which shaped our realities.  
On Aug. 23, my reality was that my aunt was critically injured in a car accident that took the life of her sister. That evening, my aunt was airlifted to a Level 1 trauma center where she was placed on life support. At this very critical and early stage of her care, there was nothing that the doctors or nurses could do other than pray, keep her comfortable and provide regular updates on findings from her lab work, scans and X-rays, which they did with intellect, grace and compassion.

Once my aunt was able to tolerate being off the ventilator for several hours, she was transferred to a long-term acute care hospital where her care and recovery were remarkable.  
As soon as I entered this hospital, I was visually reminded of the true healer in health care by Bible scriptures on the walls, including the 23rd Psalm, which reads, “The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.”  
Considering that my aunt was indefinitely confined to a hospital bed, I did not want her progress to be further complicated by pressure sores. Thanks to the attention, skill and compassion shown by her staff, she did not develop any ulcers in her over two-month hospital stay.  
Each time I pressed the call button for assistance, within five minutes, either a nurse or an aide arrived to help. It is important to note that their response and care were without their knowledge of my background in health care.
Ms. Rankin stated that she waited for 15 minutes after pressing the call button for help. Although there is no universal standard for response times after a call button has been pressed, a 2012 study by “BMC Health Services Research” found that the quicker the response time, the lower the rates of falls and associated injuries.  
Considering that Ms. Rankin carried her IV pole with her to the restroom, and further, with an unspecified neurological condition, those responsible for her care would have a lot of cleaning up to do had she fallen.  
Ms. Rankin identified several problems during her hospitalization, including personal cell phone use by hospital staff. A 2024 study published in “Hospital Topics” found that personal cell phone usage by nurses “is a barrier to effective nursing care in hospitals.” This risk also opens the door to medical malpractice lawsuits when patient safety is compromised; a problem that we do not need, especially when so many of our hospitals have closed and others are at risk of closing. 
Ms. Rankin also found that compassion and communication skills among the hospital staff were lacking. Additionally, she characterized emotional intelligence, also known as emotional quotient.  A 2025 overview of EQ by “Cleveland Clinic” explains that this quotient allows us to “respond and interact with others in a way that’s honest, reflective and respectful,” components that Ms. Rankin says were also missing during her hospital stay.
Patients such as Ms. Rankin have every right to report these and other weaknesses within our health care settings. However, we must use these experiences to strengthen our health care system so that all Mississippians can receive exceptional health care that will put us at the top, not the bottom of national rankings.   
As a family member of a patient of two Jackson-based hospitals that graciously aided in her recovery, I have hope that we are still the “City with Soul,” although with the unfortunate experiences of Ms. Rankin, it may not always be so obvious.  
As we have learned from Ms. Rankin, our health care system does need improvement, such as health care workers responding efficiently and therapeutically to the needs of their patients. What was a “degrading” experience for her, just may be the defining moment for health care providers to develop a universal response time to call button activations.  
Perhaps, the optimal response time could be five minutes or less as in the case with my aunt. However, further research is needed to develop evidence-based practices.  
Ms. Rankin, based on my answer to your call, I hope that it is clear that you and all Mississippians are important to me and that our hospitals need both patients and providers to survive. Again, I am sorry about your negative hospital stay experience and you have my prayers for a full recovery.  
We’re all a part of God’s body. The act of fostering compassion, emotional intelligence, and therapeutic communication does not cost a thing to start making small but significant improvements in our complex health care system.  
The transformation that we seek will also require others sharing their stories, whether positive or negative to move Mississippi forward.

The agents wore uniforms marked with the insignias of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations and the FBI. 
An ICE spokesperson said in a statement that its officers and partners served a search warrant “in furtherance of a federal criminal investigation.” 
“There is no threat to public safety, and the investigation remains ongoing at this time,” the statement said.

One witness told the Reformer that she saw at least two people zip tied and loaded into a van by agents. The witness requested that her name be withheld for fear of retribution. 
A call to Bro-Tex had not been returned at the time of publication. 
At around 9 a.m., agents marked off a large perimeter around Bro-Tex with crime scene tape. Protesters chanted messages expressing opposition to ICE, and heckled agents, most of whom were masked. 
As the officers attempted to leave the scene, protesters linked arms to block their vehicles. Agents shot chemical irritants into the crowd, and in some cases, pepper sprayed protesters in the face. Some officers exited their vehicles to shove protesters out of the way, and drivers forced their way through the crowd, pushing some people to the ground with their vehicles.

“Community doesn’t want this blatant show of force — this blatant show of cruelty — and we want answers. We want accountability,” said Miguel Hernandez, a member of the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which runs a rapid response network to mobilize anti-ICE protesters when raids happen.
During a visit to Minnesota last month, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said thousands of newly hired ICE agents would be deployed around the country in the coming weeks, including in St. Paul. 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the GOP megalaw signed on July 4, more than tripled ICE’s budget.
Notably absent from the scene was the St. Paul Police Department; after a similar raid and community response in Minneapolis over the summer, immigrant rights advocates have criticized the Minneapolis Police Department for providing crowd control while ICE executed a search warrant. St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter chatted with protesters after the agents dispersed. 
“Though we don’t have many details right now, I share the concern and fear this raises for our workers, families and entire community,” Carter said in a statement posted to social media. 
He added: “Our officers will help de-escalate situations when possible. And they do not wear face coverings.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NN251118_0137-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 14:57:26.894376

U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco, a Trump appointee, ordered the implementation of Remedial Plan 3, which Secretary of State Wes Allen, the defendant in the case, said was the “least bad of several bad options” in October to allow Black voters an opportunity to pick their preferred leaders in Senate Districts 25 and 26. The plaintiffs in the case said that the map was the “weakest remedy” to Manasco’s August ruling.

“Ultimately, the record makes clear that Remedial Plan 3 unpacks District 26 by reassigning some Black voters to District 25 such that both districts are Black opportunity districts,” Manasco wrote. “The court thus finds that Remedial Plan 3 completely remedies the unlawful vote dilution the court found in the Enacted Plan.”

Monday was the recommended deadline by Secretary Allen for a map to be implemented to be used for the 2026 midterm elections. 
The current map was drawn after the 2020 census. The state Senate map is one of two maps that were challenged in court due to Section 2 violations, in which plaintiffs argued that the drawing of the maps made it impossible for Black voters to have a meaningful voice in elections. Alabama’s congressional districts were challenged in 2021, ultimately leading to the redrawing of the 2nd Congressional District, currently represented by U.S. Rep. Shomari Figures, D-Mobile.
A federal judge ruled that the current State Senate districts in the Montgomery area violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. (Map from court documents)
Manasco ruled in August that Alabama’s Senate maps violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. That provision prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. 
“The court orders the use of a remedial map that was prepared race-blind and affords Black voters in the Montgomery area an equal opportunity, but certainly not a guarantee, to elect Senators of their choice,” Manasco wrote in the Monday court filing.
Manasco ordered new district lines to be drawn in Senate Districts 25 and 26, represented by Sens. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, and Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, respectively. She ordered a second district in Montgomery that had a 50% Black voting age population, or something close to it. 
After multiple check-ins with Manasco and lawyers with both sides, Gov. Kay Ivey said in September that she would not call a special session to redraw the map, citing a similar case in the U.S. Supreme Court, Callais v. Louisiana, in which the justices are considering whether majority-minority districts are constitutional. A ruling is expected by next summer.
Manasco then appointed the same team that redrew the state’s congressional districts in 2023 to remedy the state Senate issue. Richard Allen, the Special Master, recommended two maps to remedy the VRA violation.
The special master recommended three maps, with two being what he thought was best. Should the U.S. Supreme Court rule for Louisiana in the Callais case, Alabama’s 2nd and 7th congressional districts — represented by Figures and U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Birmingham — could be placed in jeopardy. In 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ruling of a lower court panel, which included Manasco, that Alabama’s congressional maps denied Black voters a proper say in their governance, and ordered new ones drawn.
Each party has 30 days to appeal Manasco’s order.
Davin Rosborough, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a phone interview Tuesday afternoon that his team has not discussed Manasco’s order yet and declined to comment further.
“I believe that the map that was ordered yesterday, regardless of any appeals, is what’s going to go into place next year,” Rosborough said.
Secretary Allen declined to comment on the litigation and referred to the Attorney General’s office. A message seeking comment from it was left Tuesday afternoon.

The special master’s maps

Remedial Plan 3 was not the special master’s recommendation. The map extends Senate District 25 into southern Montgomery and extends Senate District 26 into Elmore County, which is currently in District 25.
Remedial Plan 1 provides a weaker remedy to the Voting Rights Act violation than Remedial Plan 2, according to court-appointed Special Master Richard Allen. (Map from court documents)
Remedial Plan 2 aligns more with the current State Senate districts and provides a better Voting Rights Act remedy, according to court-appointed Special Master Richard Allen. (Map from court documents)
Remedial Plan 3 changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 51.1% in Senate District 25 and 66.1% to 43.9% in Senate District 26. 
The special master recommended either Remedial Plan 1 or 2.
Remedial Plan 1 reallocates South Montgomery in Senate District 26 to Senate District 25, leaving a tail of the south-western portion of Montgomery County in District 26. The northern part of the district is extended into Elmore County, which is currently in Senate District 30 represented by Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville.
Remedial Plan 1 changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 51.6% in Senate District 25, 66.1% to 49.7% in Senate District 26 and 23.6% to 20% in Senate District 30. 
The second map, Remedial Plan 2, completely reallocates the southern portion of District 26 to District 25. It also extends northward into District 30, but not as far. 
Remedial Plan 2 changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 53.6% in Senate District 25, 66.1% to 48.3% in Senate District 26 and 23.6% to 19.1% in Senate District 30.
According to Manasco’s order, Remedial Plan 3 should be used for the 2026 and 2030 midterm elections, as well as any special elections in Senate Districts 25 or 26.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AL_Senate_023-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-18 14:57:26.894376

The U.S. Supreme Court has set a date for a hearing on Idaho’s transgender athletics ban.
The court will hear arguments on Jan. 13. The hearing — and the court’s ruling, likely to come later in 2026 — will resonate well beyond Idaho, and mark a pivotal moment in the national debate over transgender athletics.
Idaho was the first state in the nation to pass a law banning transgender athletes from playing in women’s and girls’ sports. But the 2020 law has been mired in the courts since then, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has blocked it from going into effect.
The state of Idaho appealed, and the Supreme Court agreed in July to hear Idaho’s case. A hearing date hadn’t been set until last week.
But some legal maneuvering continues to surround the case.
Lindsay Hecox, the transgender Boise State University student who has fought the Idaho law, has asked the Supreme Court to drop the matter. Hecox argues that the case is moot, because she is focused on graduating college and has no plans to play in women’s sports. The state has opposed her motion to close the case.
Last month, Chief U.S. District Court Judge David Nye kept the case open in Idaho’s federal court, rejecting Hecox’s motion to drop the matter.
Since Idaho passed its transgender athletics ban five years ago, 26 other states have followed suit.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)After New Hampshire banned surprise ambulance billing this year, the state is set to undergo a cost study on how much ambulance providers should charge for their services.
Senate Bill 245, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte in late July, bans the practice of surprise ambulance billing starting Jan. 1. Surprise billing, also known as balance billing, happens when an ambulance costs more than the patient’s insurer is willing to pay and the patient is billed, often unexpectedly, for the remainder.
Notably, the bill also sets the rate providers are allowed to charge. Throughout the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers fiercely debated what the rate should be. SB 245, which was sponsored by state Sen. Sue Prentiss, a West Lebanon Democrat, beat out several competing bills with different ideas on how to determine that rate. It set the rate at 325% of the federal Medicare rate, which varies depending on the location and other factors, for the first two years. After those two years, the legislation instructs the state Insurance Department to set a new, updated rate based on an actuarial study that takes into account inflation and other market factors.
During its meeting Wednesday, the New Hampshire Executive Council approved a contract with the RAND Corporation, an economic policy institute based in California, to complete the study at a cost of $400,000.
“We found a good partner, we believe,” Insurance Commissioner D.J. Bettencourt told councilors at the meeting, “that has a lot of experience to be able to do that work so that when we come back when the temporary rates sunset in two years we’re going to have hard actuarial numbers that we’ll be able to put into statute.”
The state has done a study like this before. In 2024, the Insurance Department hired Public Consulting Group LLC, a consulting firm, to conduct a similar study. The study was released in January and recommended a rate of 202% the Medicare rate. One of the competing bills to SB 245, House Bill 316, sponsored by Rindge Republican Rep. John Hunt earlier this year, used that rate in addition to banning surprise billing. That bill was lambasted by ambulance providers who wanted a higher rate. In response to the backlash, lawmakers approved SB 245 and its significantly higher rate.

Kennedy, members of New Mexico's congressional delegation said Head Start sites in 18 states and Puerto Rico ""have already been forced to halt operations and close their doors."" (Photo by SDI Productions via Getty Images)The New Mexico congressional delegation on Monday called for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to release November grant reimbursements to Head Start programs, including three of the state’s Tribal Head Start programs.
Head Start is a federally funded program that provides early education, early screening, meals and supports families. Due to the recent federal government shutdown and prior funding delays, New Mexico Tribal Head Start Programs Raman Navajo School Board, Alamo Navajo School Board and San Felipe Pueblo did not receive their federal grant reimbursements for Fiscal Year 2026 on Nov. 1. 
In a letter sent to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the New Mexico delegation asked for the department to send grant notifications and reimbursements to programs affected during this grant cycle across the country. 
“As of November 5th, Head Start sites in 18 states and Puerto Rico have already been forced to halt operations and close their doors,” the letter reads. The letter further points out that programs struggling to remain open to children may make cuts elsewhere, such as in staffing, transportation and operating hours. “Still others had to take out loans or use reserve funds, which have placed them in financial risk and strain already limited resources.”
The delegation also requested that the HHS maintain communication with Head Start grantees so the local programs can plan and sustain “essential services.”
The letter noted that about 60,000 U.S. children were impacted by the lapse in funding, including more than 250 New Mexico children supported by the three Tribal Head Start Programs.
According to the New Mexico Early Childhood Education Department, more than 7,800 children were served by Head Start and Early Head Start programs in Fiscal Year 2024. There were also 20 active Tribal Head Start and Early Head Start programs in the same time frame.
Last month, U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) introduced the Every Child Deserves a Head Start Act to protect Head Start from calls to eliminate it, as well as restore the programs’ regional offices. 
“Affordable, accessible childcare is a critical lifeline for working families in New Mexico,” the delegation’s letter reads. “Head Start programs play an indispensable role in delivering high-quality early learning, health, and family well-being services that are especially vital in underserved and low-income communities.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/preschoolchildren-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 14:57:26.894376

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden launched a campaign to keep his job with an expression of his philosophy.
“Good policy makes good politics,” he said.
The comment came during remarks Tuesday at the Hotel Alex Johnson in downtown Rapid City, where Rhoden formally announced his intention to seek the Republican nomination for governor next year in the June 2 primary election.
He has competition from three other declared candidates for the party’s nomination: U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, businessman Toby Doeden and state House Speaker Jon Hansen.
Rhoden was elevated from lieutenant governor in January when Noem resigned to become secretary of the federal Department of Homeland Security. Since then, while serving the remainder of Noem’s second term, Rhoden has been attempting to prove his policy-over-politics mantra.

During the legislative session that ended in March, Rhoden stepped into a long-running controversy over a company’s proposed carbon capture pipeline through South Dakota. He signed a bill into law that bans such pipelines from using a legal process known as eminent domain to gain access to privately owned land.
He also proposed and convinced legislators to pass legislation containing multiple methods for slowing property tax increases. And he shut down Noem’s effort to build a prison on a strongly opposed location in rural Lincoln County, instead opting to appoint a task force that ultimately selected a site in Sioux Falls and won legislative approval for a $650 million project.
Rhoden said Tuesday that his policy efforts have succeeded because legislative leaders know he’s sincere about putting politics second.
“Even leaders want to be led, but they want to be led by somebody they trust,” he said. “And I think I’ve developed that reputation.”
Rhoden’s efforts have put him in a competitive position. An October poll of registered Republican voters commissioned by South Dakota News Watch and the Chiesman Center for Democracy found Johnson with 28% support, followed by Rhoden with 27%, Doeden with 15% and Hanson with 10%, plus about 20% of respondents who were undecided.
Johnson came into the race as the presumed favorite, having served four terms in Congress and built up campaign funds in excess of $6 million from his prior races. The funding status of the other candidates is unknown, because they don’t have a reporting deadline until January.

In response to a question from South Dakota Searchlight about Rhoden’s announcement, Johnson sent a statement saying Rhoden has been “a worthy caretaker for South Dakota.”
“However, the next 20 years could be the best in our state’s history,” Johnson said. “That is going to take energy, vision and a real plan. That is what I’m offering in this race.”
Doeden called himself the only “outsider” in the race.
“Their faces and names are different, but Larry Rhoden and Dusty Johnson are one and the same: career politicians that answer to big donors, special-interest groups, and the rich and powerful,” Doeden said.
Hansen avoided mentioning his opponents by name.
“If you want to vote for the proven conservative Republican fighter who will put you and your family first again, I am the only candidate in this race for you,” Hansen said.

To beat Johnson, Doeden and Hansen, the 66-year-old Rhoden will have to do something he’s never done: win his own statewide campaign. Rhoden was twice elected as lieutenant governor while he was Noem’s running mate, but when he ran in a five-way race for the Republican nomination for an open U.S. Senate seat in 2014, he finished a distant second to former Gov. Mike Rounds, who went on to win the general election.
Rhoden is a rancher and welder from rural Union Center, a sparsely populated area about 45 miles east of Sturgis where he grew up. He and his wife, first lady Sandy Rhoden, have four grown sons and seven grandchildren.
Rhoden was elected to the state Legislature in 2000 and served for 16 years before becoming lieutenant governor. After he ascended to the governor’s office, Rhoden chose Tony Venhuizen — who was representing Sioux Falls in the Legislature at the time — as his lieutenant governor. Venhuizen appeared with Rhoden at the campaign launch Tuesday, confirming that they plan to run together.
Other declared candidates for governor include Democratic college student Robert Arnold and independent Lakota activist Allison Renville.

Free.,US House nears vote requiring release of Epstein files,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-nears-vote-requiring-release-epstein-files,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to pass legislation Tuesday to force the release of unclassified investigative files from the case against convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a friend to the rich and powerful who died in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 awaiting federal trial on sex trafficking charges.President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson opposed the effort until this week.Johnson said Tuesday morning that he will vote for the measure that has been forced to the floor after Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., gathered enough signatures on a discharge petition to override leadership.

The Louisiana Republican told reporters at his regular House leadership press conference that the “forcing mechanism here prevents the very deliberate, professional, careful manner in which Congress is supposed to do this.”“But having now forced the vote, none of us want to go on record and in any way be accused of not being for maximum transparency,” Johnson said.The vote comes less than a week after lawmakers on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released some 20,000 pages of emails from Epstein’s estate that repeatedly mentioned Trump’s name. In one email from Epstein to convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, the financier and sex offender claimed Trump “knew about the girls.”Trump denies any involvement with Epstein’s alleged crimes, and has said that he kicked Epstein out of his private Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, because he alleged the financier had poached young female staffers from the club. Epstein was convicted in Florida of soliciting minors for sex in 2008. During a press conference in the Oval Office Tuesday alongside the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Trump told reporters, “As far as the Epstein files, I have nothing to do with Jeffery Epstein. I threw him out of my club many years ago because I thought he was a sick pervert.”Trump added, as he has repeatedly said before, that the files are a “Democratic hoax.”Stories of abuse Women who told stories of being abused by Epstein as teens rallied outside the U.S. Capitol Tuesday morning, alongside Massie, Khanna and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., whom Trump attacked online this weekend, nicknaming her a “traitor.”Haley Robson, who has prominently shared her account of sexual abuse by Epstein, said that as a Republican herself, the advocacy from Massie and Greene is “unbelievable to watch, and we are so grateful.”“And to the president of the United States of America, who is not here today, I want to send a clear message to you: While I do understand that your position has changed on the Epstein files, and I'm grateful that you have pledged to sign this bill, I can't help to be skeptical of what the agenda is,” Robson said.

In a Sunday night post on his own social media platform, Trump told Republicans to vote in favor of the bipartisan legislation Tuesday, which lawmakers have named the Epstein Files Transparency Act.Greene, who also spoke at the press conference, said the administration’s refusal to release what are collectively referred to as the Epstein files “has ripped MAGA apart.”“The only thing that will speak to the powerful, courageous women behind me is when action is actually taken to release these files, and the American people won't tolerate any other b- - - -t,” Greene said.GOP Reps. Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Lauren Boebert of Colorado were the other Republicans to join Massie, Greene and all Democrats to sign the petition.Grijalva signatureIn a second press conference outside the Capitol later Tuesday morning, the House’s newest Democratic member, Arizona’s Adelita Grijalva, spoke alongside sexual abuse prevention advocates. “The momentum behind this did not come from politicians. It came from survivors and the public who demanded answers. This is why the discharge petition crossed 218 signatures, despite Speaker Johnson doing everything in his power to prevent this from happening, including calling an early summer release, and delaying myself my swearing in for seven weeks,” Grijalva said.

Grijalva became the petition’s 218th signature on Wednesday, immediately after her swearing-in ceremony. Johnson refused to swear in Grijalva, who won her seat on Sept. 23, during the government shutdown despite precedent of other representatives swearing an oath while the House is out of session.U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., also spoke at the press conference, warning that Senate leadership should not “delay this any further.”“They need to schedule a vote on this so this can get passed into law,” Kelly said.Trump told NBC News Monday he would sign the legislation.

Roughly a dozen public protesters stood outside the police barricade surrounding the press conference, holding signs demanding the release of the Epstein files.Robin Galbraith, 61, of Maryland, held a sign protesting Johnson’s refusal to allow an earlier floor vote to disclose the files.“These survivors deserve justice. And you know, all women and girls deserve justice,” Galbraith told States Newsroom in an interview. “Like when you have the richest people in the world trafficking girls, I mean, as somebody who has daughters and sons, we all want to see that children are not victims like this anymore.”FBI memo The U.S. Department of Justice has estimated that Epstein had over 1,000 victims. In July, the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a memo stating the department would not publicly release any further information on the Epstein case.The sudden reversal, after Trump and his supporters campaigned on releasing the files, sparked upheaval among the president’s base and trained a magnifying glass on Trump’s well-documented friendship with Epstein.Trump denies any wrongdoing.The president sued The Wall Street Journal for reporting on a 50th birthday card Trump allegedly gave to Epstein. The card featured a cryptic message and a doodle of a naked woman with Trump’s apparent signature mimicking pubic hair. Trump denies that he created and signed the birthday doodle.The Journal also reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi briefed the president in May that his name appeared in the Epstein case files. The context in which his name appeared is unclear. A series in the Miami Herald in 2018 by journalist Julie K. Brown drew wide attention to Epstein’s crimes and Trump’s appointment in 2017 of former Miami federal prosecutor Alex Acosta, who cut a deal in 2008 to end a federal investigation into Epstein, as the secretary of Labor.Jennifer Shutt contributed to this report.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-11-18 14:57:26.894376

Smith will be succeeded by Stratton Politzer, the organization’s co-founder and deputy director, according to a press release issued Monday by Equality Florida.
“It has been the honor of a lifetime to help build Equality Florida into the most impactful statewide LGBTQ organization in the nation. Together, we have created a movement that has changed laws, saved lives, and inspired hope across our state, and served as a blueprint nationwide,” Smith said in a written statement.
“I step into this next chapter carrying Florida with me. I will remain rooted in this state, and my commitment to Equality Florida is forever. We’ve told the country for years that Florida is the front line, and you don’t abandon the front line in a fight. I’ll continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with this team and this movement.”
Politizer co-founded Equality Florida with Smith in the 1990s. The organization says that under the two of them, Equality Florida has grown into the largest LGBTQ civil rights organization in the state, with nearly half a million members. He says the group was built on the principle “that no single person defines our movement.”

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)Maine regulators on Tuesday rejected Central Maine Power’s proposed rate increase, saying the private utility needs to resubmit a plan that takes into greater consideration long term resilience planning and the impact on ratepayers.
Public Utilities Commission Chair Phil Bartlett said during a hearing Tuesday the state is at an “inflection point.”
“We have real mounting concerns around affordability,” he said. “We have a new grid planning, which is designed to help us better assess and think about how the utilities are building out their system and modernizing their grid. And we’re also really trying to ramp up the use of more performance incentives to drive the kind of outcomes for customers.” 
This proposal, he added, “misses the mark in terms of meeting the moment that we’re at.”
While the three commission members opted to dismiss the request, Bartlett said the commission would provide CMP, one of Maine’s two private utility companies, guidance for developing another plan.
He said the dismissal does not mean a rate increase will not be considered in the future, nor that CMP’s proposed system investments are unnecessary. 
The proposal drew significant pushback from ratepayers and advocates who said Mainers, especially seniors and low-income households, can’t afford another increase when the cost of living is already so high.
Maine Public Advocate Sanborn said the commission’s decision “reflects the fact that Mainers were very engaged and spoke out about the unaffordability of CMP’s proposal.” 
In statements released Tuesday, she and other public officials commended the utility regulators for rejecting the proposal. 
“At a time when thousands of Maine people are already struggling to afford their electric bills,” she said, “CMP’s plan simply asked for far too much.”
In September, Gov. Janet Mills directed the Maine Department of Energy Resources to request the commission dismiss the request, arguing that CMP can’t prove the proposed rates meet the standard of being “just and reasonable” without first seeing the 10-year integrated grid plan the power company is supposed to file with the commission in January. 
In a statement, Mills called CMP’s request “outrageous.” 
“While strengthening the grid is important and much needed, CMP’s request – the largest ever in Maine history – was excessive and completely out of touch with the economic reality facing Maine people,” Mills said. 
The plan would have increased rates for the average customer by $35 per month or $420 per year by 2030. About half of that increase, or $17, would have been felt as soon as October 2026. The proposal also would have resulted in increased profits for company shareholders.
In a statement after the hearing, Rebecca Schultz, climate and clean energy senior advocate with the Natural Resources Council of Maine, said CMP’s proposal was “unworkably skewed to serve the company’s interests at the literal expense of Maine families and businesses.
“Maine’s outdated grid needs investment so it can better withstand storms fueled by climate change and deliver lower cost clean energy sources,” Schultz added, “but that must be balanced with respect for the high costs facing everyday people.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6665-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-18 14:57:26.894376

“Accelerate is really important, because you now have the platform to grow and dream as much as you want,” said Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann during one session last week.
Innovate Mississippi is a nonprofit that helps grow the state’s entrepreneurship scene. Innovate Executive Director Tony Jeff described it as a “connect the dots” organization, introducing entrepreneurs, business people and investors. 
Campusknot, a Starkville-based company, is an Innovate success story and recently raised over $1 million in new funding. 
One of Innovate’s flagship programs is CoBuilders. The 12-week accelerator program helps early stage entrepreneurs get their ideas ready to pitch to investors. Startups first have to participate in one of eight regional competitions. Innovate heard over 120 pitches for this year’s program. Only seven made it into the final stage.
“The companies need to show that the market wants what they have, validating that, and then demonstrating they have the plan to go out and replicate that times a hundred,” Jeff said. 
A month before the event, Sugam Panthi, co-founder of MagnoliaEd, was “really confident” about the company’s product but was still nervous about the impending competition. 
Panthi cofounded MagnoliaEd with Fan Zhang, a professor at University of Southern Mississippi. Zhang was looking for a better way to manage all the classes she was teaching when Panthi, her research assistant, proposed an artificial intelligence tutor. He built an early prototype of what became MagnoliaEd over a few months and students found the tool helpful, especially in large online classes. 
Their AI agent creates a personalized chatbot trained on course content that can help students around the clock. 
During the competition, those pitching ideas fielded tough questions from the audience about their revenue model and potential competitors. But at the end of MagnoliaEd’s 15 minutes on stage, Panthi was grinning. 
Panthi said the University of Southern Mississippi and Innovate went the “extra length” to help him prepare. He said it was an exciting opportunity to make more connections and have discussions about what role AI should have in the classroom. 
These conversations are exactly what the conference was designed to do, generating new ideas to build innovative companies.
At the end of the competition, Jeff reminded the crowd that Innovate will soon be accepting pitches for its next round.

Matt Morgan, R-Richmond, surveys a map of proposed new congressional districts in Texas, as Democratic lawmakers, who left the state to deny Republicans the opportunity to redraw the state's 38 congressional districts, began returning to the Texas Capitol in Austin on Aug. 20, 2025. REUTERS/Sergio FloresTexas cannot use its new congressional map for the 2026 election and will instead need to stick with the lines passed in 2021, a three-judge panel ruled Tuesday.
“The public perception of this case is that it’s about politics,” U.S. Judge Jeffrey Brown, a Trump appointee, wrote in the ruling. “To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.”
Brown ordered that the 2026 congressional election “shall proceed under the map that the Texas Legislature enacted in 2021.” The case will likely be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but time is short: Candidates only have until Dec. 8 to file for the upcoming election.
The decision is a major blow for Republicans, in Texas and nationally, who pushed through this unusual mid-decade redistricting at the behest of President Donald Trump. They were hoping the new map would yield control of 30 of the state’s 38 congressional districts — up from the 25 they currently hold — and help protect the narrow GOP majority in the U.S. House.
The map cleared the GOP-controlled Legislature in August and was quickly signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott. Several advocacy groups sued over the new district lines, saying lawmakers intentionally diluted the voting power of Black and Hispanic Texans and drew racially gerrymandered maps. Over the course of a nine-day hearing in El Paso earlier this month, they aimed to convince the judges that it was in voters’ best interest to shelve the new map until a full trial could be held.
It was not immediately clear if the state still has a legal path to restoring the new map in time for 2026. Unlike most federal lawsuits, which are heard by a single district judge and then appealed to a circuit court, voting rights lawsuits are initially heard by two district judges and one circuit judge, and their ruling can only be appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The decision comes 10 days into the monthlong period when candidates can sign up for the March primary. The filing deadline is Dec. 8.
This is just the opening gambit in what promises to be a yearslong legal battle over Texas’ congressional map. A lawsuit over the state’s 2021 redistricting — including its state legislative and education board seats — went to trial earlier this summer and remains pending before the same three-judge panel. The judges have indicated they may want to see how the U.S. Supreme Court rules on a major voting rights case before issuing their full ruling on Texas’ maps.
But for Trump, and many of his Republican supporters in Texas, the short-term goal of having this map for the 2026 election was as important as the long game.
“I’m convinced that if Texas does not take this action, there is an extreme risk that [the] Republican majority will be lost,” Sen. Phil King, R-Weatherford, said on the floor of the state Senate before the new map passed. “If it does, the next two years after the midterm, there will be nothing but inquisitions and impeachments and humiliation for our country.”

“The biggest drivers of poor health outcomes appear to be education, employment and income, particularly for low income communities and those with lower educational attainment,” said Karley Abramson, a health policy research associate for the Citizen’s Research Council. 
The report centers on social determinants of health, which is a very broad term to describe the “structural, cultural, environmental, financial, and political limitations that impact a person’s health behaviors and health outcomes,” the report explains. 
Michigan ranks below average in just about every major metric of health, the report explains. That includes life expectancy, infant mortality, and prevalence of diseases like cancer and diabetes. The state also has sharp racial disparities in some of these metrics — life expectancy for Black Michiganders is 5.5 years shorter than that for white residents, one of the highest differences in the country. 
Abramson explained that one main goal of the report was to explain how policies that may not generally be considered related to health — issues like education and employment — have distinct impacts on health outcomes for the state. 
“This was meant to provide a grounding for policymakers on how to zoom out, to get them to focus on how public health is much more than health policy,” she said. “While health policy is very necessary for better health outcomes, health outcomes are largely driven by other things.”
Financial Resources as Pathways to Health Outcomes | Citizens Research Council of Michigan
For example, Abramson explained, if someone gets sick and requires medication, they generally have to go to the doctor to get that medication. That requires paying for the doctor’s visit, which usually requires health insurance, and for most people, that insurance comes from their employer. Beyond that, access to reliable transportation to get to the doctor at all is required, as is social support — for example, someone reminding you to take your medication. All of these things are not explicitly questions of health policy, but they all impact someone’s ability to get the medication that they need. 
“We’re trying to tackle the sickest populations, and how huge those health disparities are,” she said. “To make the people who are most in need healthier and then making them more able to contribute to a more prosperous state, that feedback loop, then a prosperous state is what is needed to improve health outcomes across the board.”
“There’s an inherent value of a healthy population to the state,” Abramson noted, adding that the feedback loop serves to benefit the state by attracting new residents and boosting the economy.
The other “fundamental resources” outside of financial considerations that the report examines are health care, food and nutrition, safety, and social support. But the report concludes that financial resources are central to all of the rest of those social determinants of health because it sets the foundation for the other resources. 
Abramson also urged lawmakers to avoid “disconnected and piecemeal attempts at policy aimed at addressing social determinants of health,” and to instead look for long-term solutions to the underlying problems. 
“We don’t always get back to the root of why all those barriers exist, which many times is this access to financial resources,” she said.

Education reporter Corey McDonald explains why public-service journalism is essential as lawmakers debate the future of Vermont’s schools.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s education system is at a crossroads. Help us report what happens next..","Dear Readers, 
There’s a tremendous amount of uncertainty right now in Vermont’s public education system. I’ve been reporting on the effects of the state’s new education reform bill, Act 73, since it was signed into law in July.
When people don’t have access to solid, fact-based reporting, decisions get made behind closed doors. I report on Vermont’s schools so that doesn’t happen. So you can see what’s coming and why it matters. 
If you value that kind of transparency, please make a donation today during our year end drive.

Act 73 set big changes in motion, but there’s (literally) no map on the table as the legislative session approaches. Our job is to explain what’s at stake clearly so Vermonters can form their own opinions about what should come next.
Whatever lawmakers decide could have an enormous impact on teachers, school district employees, and students and their families. We’ve been doing deep dives into how this law is already affecting school districts throughout the state. But there is sure to be even more debate in the Statehouse when the legislative session begins.
Your donation will help support us as we shine a light on that debate and on how those changes will impact schools and students throughout Vermont.

This image of Mattivi is from an Oct. 1, 2025, news conference with Attorney General Kris Kobach. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Bureau of Investigation tracked down and placed in custody of federal immigration officers 10 people in Kansas found guilty of criminal offenses, including a Somalian refugee convicted of involuntary manslaughter in a Garden City traffic accident.
The individuals without U.S. citizenship, who were from Mexico, Guatemala, Cuba, Ethiopia and Somalia, were located by the KBI between Oct. 24 and Nov. 14 as agents worked in Hutchinson, Newton, Garden City and Dodge City.
The KBI said each was transferred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for proceedings that could result in their deportation.
In February, KBI entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that created opportunities for state law enforcement officers to receive ICE training in execution of warrants for alleged violation of federal immigration law. The KBI roundup was tied to the ICE partnership.
“Each of these offenders had been tried and convicted of a sex offense, a drug offense or a violent offense,” said Tony Mattivi, director of the KBI. “Anyone without citizenship who commits serious crimes against Kansans should not be allowed to stay in our communities.”
Attorney General Kris Kobach, who has administrative jurisdiction over the KBI, said immigration enforcement activities performed by the KBI were allowed under 287(g) authority, a section of federal law that enables state or local law enforcement agencies to collaborate with ICE.
“Had my office not obtained 287(g) authority and investigated these cases, these dangerous illegal aliens would have continued to live in Kansas communities hiding in plain sight,” Kobach said.
The roster of individuals placed into custody included Bashir Omar, a refugee from Somalia, who was charged in Garden City with driving under the influence and other offenses in October 2017. The vehicle Omar was driving struck the motorcycle driven by Robert Becker, 67, of Garden City. Becker died at the scene of injuries sustained when Omar’s Jeep hit the motorcycle from behind.
A plea bargain led to Omar’s conviction for involuntary manslaughter and failure to stop at the scene of an accident resulting in a fatality. The statement from Kobach and Mattivi mistakenly indicated Omar had been found guilty of “second-degree intentional murder.”
Omar was incarcerated in custody of the Kansas Department of Corrections until February 2022, state records show. Three of Becker’s children said in a post to change.org the four-year sentence received by Omar was insufficient because “Bashir murdered our dad.”
Six of the 10 individuals taken into custody by the KBI were from Mexico. They were: Jose Luis Gomez Sr., distribution of narcotics; Alonzo Mendez, indecent liberties with a child; Diego Nevarez, intent to distribute heroin; Jose Rivera-Avila, aggravated assault and criminal discharge of firearm; Jose Eduardo Garcia-Peralta, distribution of narcotics; and Ramiro Erik Flores-Hernandez, cultivation and distribution of controlled substances.
In addition to Omar, the KBI detained Gilberto Taracena Monte of Guatemala for molestation of a child, Nigisti Geberemedehni Beyene of Ethiopia for aggravated battery and Yuliesky Hernandez-Padron of Cuba for aggravated robbery.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA010242-1024x866.jpg,,,2025-11-18 13:57:48.213603

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Islanders anxiously awaiting confirmation of a deal to save Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital from closing will have to keep waiting after a hearing in federal bankruptcy court in Dallas Tuesday morning.
But time is running out.
A cost-sharing agreement between Prospect Medical Holdings, the hospitals’ bankrupt owner, and the state attorney general’s office guaranteed funding for Roger Williams and Fatima to stay open through November — less than two weeks away. 
The parties are working to extend the funding split through December with the expectation a new buyer will take over, said Thomas Califano, an attorney with Sidley Austin LLP representing Prospect.
“Hopefully, it will be resolved early in the month, but we just want to make sure we have that stipulation to have that extra time,” Califano said.
Firmer details on the financing extension, along with more substantive updates on a hospital buyer, will be shared next week at another hearing before Chief Judge Stacey Jernigan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Tuesday. 
Prospect, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January, signaled its desire to close the facilities by the end of the year amid delays in the sale to new owners. 
Faced with the threat of closure, Neronha agreed to put up half of the $6 million cost to keep the facilities operating in November, using money from a state-controlled escrow account funded by the hospitals’ former owner, private equity firm Leonard Green. 
The remainder of hospitals’ November costs were to be put up by Prospect’s legal bankruptcy estate. However, the new buyer is expected to replenish Prospect’s estate and the state escrow account for the money spent once a deal closes.
Two suitors, The Centurion Foundation and Prime Healthcare, are on the table in different stages of commitment.
Centurion, an Atlanta nonprofit, secured conditional approval from Rhode Island regulators to buy the hospitals in June 2024, but has struggled to find investors to back the bonds needed to close the deal. Prime, which owns Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket among 50 other hospitals nationwide, recently entered the picture at the request of state officials, but has not made an offer yet — nor had it been accepted by state regulators. 
Providers and elected officials warn that closing the hospitals would have catastrophic consequences for the state’s fragile health care system. 
The hospitals offer 500 beds between them, including 104 beds for behavioral health patients, which represents more than one-fifth of the state’s behavioral health beds. They took in 50,000 emergency room visits last year, while employing 2,400 people. Roger Williams houses the only fully accredited bone marrow transplant unit in the state. 
Despite the ticking clock, the mood was optimistic in Jernigan’s Dallas courtroom Tuesday.
Referring to Prime as “the buyer that has been disclosed in the press but I don’t have authority to mention,” Califano said the California hospital operator is still reviewing a potential acquisition, with a “somewhat positive response.” 
Centurion has shifted attention from the bond market to a short-term loan from Bank of America, which its attorneys said could complete the financing picture by early or mid-December.
Two hospitals that went for years without any interested buyers might ultimately end with two offers ready to choose from, said Andrew Troop, a New York bankruptcy lawyer hired by the AG’s office to represent the state in bankruptcy proceedings.
Prime and Centurion did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Tuesday.

(Photo courtesy of South Bow)The operator of the Keystone Pipeline says a crack along a weld caused an oil leak in southeast North Dakota earlier this year. 
South Bow temporarily shut down the Keystone Pipeline on April 8 after a drop in pressure. South Bow later estimated that about 3,500 barrels, or 147,000 gallons, of oil spilled in a farm field near Fort Ransom. The spill was contained to the farm field.
The 30-inch pipeline was back in service in mid-April. 
The company said the release of the independent analysis of the cause has been impacted by the U.S. federal government shutdown. The report would be released by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.
The agency had issued a corrective action order shortly after the leak, including reducing the  pressure in parts of the pipeline.
The leaking section of pipe was excavated and replaced, according to PHMSA. 
South Bow’s findings showed the pipe and the welds conformed to industry standards.
The leak resulted from a crack along the pipe’s manufactured longseam weld.
The company said it is trying to improve its pipeline inspection system. 
Bill Suess, spill investigation program manager for the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality, said Tuesday that cleanup at the spill site had been completed. 
The Keystone Pipeline carries Canadian oil through the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba then south through the Midwest.
South Bow estimated the spill cost the company $55 million. The company said it hopes to recover the cost of the leak through insurance policies. As of Sept. 30, South Bow has received about $16 million in insurance claims.

That’s according to a new report published Tuesday by the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. The report is the state’s latest long-term economic and demographic projections, meant to help guide policy decisions for years to come.

“Utah’s demographic and economic future will be marked by significant growth and change,” the report says, attributing “record levels of net in-migration, declining natural change (births minus deaths), an aging population, and continuing urbanization” to the growth. 
By the end of 2065, “Utah’s population will be larger, older, and more urban,” the report says, predicting a “service-oriented economy that remains well-diversified.” Researchers wrote that health care, professional services, finance and construction will play a vital role and lead growth through the next 40 years. 
Here are some key takeaways listed in the report: 



Population: Utah’s population is expected to continue to grow, projected to hit 5.6 million in 2065. 
Employment: An estimated 1.2 million jobs will be added in that time frame, with the largest increases expected in health care, social assistance, professional, scientific and technical services, along with finance and insurance. 
Migration: Net migration will continue to drive population growth across the state — except for eight years in the 2030s. “Economic growth, combined with declining fertility and an aging population, drive this trend,” the report says. 
Household growth: Across the state, projected population growth coincides with substantial household growth, from 1.2 million in 2025 to 2.3 million in 2065. 
Smaller household sizes: Household sizes are projected to continue to decrease, driven by an aging population. A typical Utah household is expected to decrease from three people in 2025 to 2.3 in 2065. 
Aging: Utah’s median age is projected to increase from 32.8 in 2025 to 45.3 in 2065, as a result of declining fertility rates and an aging population. Those ages 65 and older will increase from 1 in 8 residents to nearly 1 in 4 Utahns by 2065. 
Most populated counties: The state’s most populated county is expected to continue to be Salt Lake County with 1.6 million in 2065, but Utah County (at 1.5 million) is expected to trail close behind. 
Job growth in urban counties: Even though employment growth is projected to be the largest in Salt Lake County (with 600,000 new jobs), Utah County is expected to see the fastest growth (60%) followed closely by Summit and Iron counties with 58.6%.

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)Health care isn’t something that always can be scheduled during regular business hours.
There’s an effort underway in the Florida Legislature to make sure the managed care companies that receive billions of dollars to provide care to the poor, sick, and elderly remain open between 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. Monday through Friday and on the weekends.
Specifically, the bill would amend Medicaid statutes to require that at least 50% of a managed care plan’s primary care provider network offer availability to Medicaid enrollees during off hours.
The Senate Health Policy Committee on Tuesday passed SB 40,  offered by Sen. Barbara Sharief, D-Miramar.
“The goal is simple: It’s just to ensure Medicaid enrollees can see providers outside of regular business hours when families may need the care,” Sharief said Tuesday in presenting her bill. “As you know, many Medicaid recipients, especially working parents and caregivers, struggle to get appointments after 5 p.m. weekdays or on weekends, and the lack of access pushes them into the emergency room, into our more expensive modes of treatment. ”
Contractual requirements
The 50% requirement is higher than what plans contractually agreed to offer earlier this year when they signed new Medicaid managed care contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
Those contracts require all managed care plans statewide to require at least 40% of their participating primary care providers to offer after-hour appointments by Sept. 30, 2026.
The percentage of providers accepting after-hour appointments increases to at least 50% effective Sept. 30, 2027, for a large swath of the state — from Northwest Florida east to Jacksonville, through the so-called Florida Heartland north and west of Lake Okeechobee, and south to the Florida Keys.
Managed care plans in Medicaid Regions C and D, which includes Pasco, Hillsborough, Manatee, Polk, Hardy, and Highlands counties, would be required to have 45% of their primary care providers offer after-hours access to care by Sept. 30, 2027.
The requirement doesn’t change for Medicaid managed care plans operating in Region F, which includes Sarasota, DeSoto, Charlotte, Glades Lee, Hendry, and Collier counties. After-hour access requirements for managed care plans now are negotiated through contractual agreements between the Agency for Health Care Administration and the managed care plans.
The bill is supported by the Florida Association of Nurse Practitioners as well as AARP Florida.
Before the vote, committee member Sen. Rosalind Osgood, D-Fort Lauderdale, thanked Sharief for her efforts.
“In my other job, I work with a lot of individuals that fall into this category, and a lot of times they’re working so they can’t meet the regular doctor ‘s scheduled hours. So, having opportunities to access medical care and nontraditional hours would be very beneficial,” she said.
HB 163 is the companion measure sponsored by Miami Gardens Democratic Rep. Felicia Robinson. That bill has been referred to the House Health Care Facilities & Systems Subcommittee; the House  Health Care Budget Subcommittee; and the House Health & Human Services Committee. It has yet to be placed on any agenda.

The women have also been deprived of proper prenatal, postpartum, lactation and miscarriage care, they said.The letter argues that ICE’s own regulations do not require pregnant, postpartum or nursing immigrants to be detained and detainment should only occur if the release is “prohibited by law or exceptional circumstances exist.”“By detaining vulnerable women in appalling conditions while pregnant, you are subjecting both the pregnant individual and the unborn child to significant risks and possible death,” according to the letter. “We urge the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE to follow its own rules and regulations on detention of pregnant women and demand their humane treatment.”Lawmakers are asking for ICE to immediately release any detained immigrants who are pregnant. They are also pushing for ICE to answer several questions, including the number of pregnant immigrants in detention; the number of births or still births that took place in detention; the number of medical incidents experienced by pregnant detainees; and how many pregnant immigrants have been shackled by ICE. Lawmakers asked ICE for a response within 45 days. ICE officials did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment. House lawmakers who signed the letter include:Robin Kelly of IllinoisDelia Ramirez of IllinoisSydney Kamlager-Dove of CaliforniaSylvia Garcia of TexasTeresa Leger Fernández of New MexicoJoyce Beatty of OhioJasmine Crockett of TexasLaMonica McIver of New JerseyEmily Randall of Washington stateSheila Cherfilus-McCormick of FloridaDeborah Ross of North CarolinaNikema Williams of GeorgiaJulie Johnson of TexasPramila Jayapal of Washington stateNorma Torres of CaliforniaMelanie Stansbury of New MexicoAndrea Salinas of OregonLois Frankel of FloridaLucy McBath of GeorgiaJudy Chu of CaliforniaKelly Morrison of MinnesotaLateefah Simon of CaliforniaValerie P.

A review of lobbying records shows those following the bill include the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, which represents some of the largest hospitals across the state; The Doctors Company, a national physician-owned medical liability carrier; and the Florida Justice Reform Institute, a Florida Chamber of Commerce-supported organization fighting “wasteful civil litigation through legislation.”
Lobbyists for those organizations all waived their right to speak against the bill before the Civil Justice and Claims Subcommittee on Tuesday, merely registering opposition for the record.
Indeed, most of the public debate on the bill came from Democrats on the subcommittee who pressed St. Augustine Republican and bill sponsor Rep. Sam Greco about unintended consequences women could face if the bill passes. St. Petersburg Democrat Rep. Michele Rayner, an attorney, voiced multiple concerns with the bill, not least that it could allow abusive ex-partners to sue over abortions or miscarriages.

“This bill is couched as a measure for a fetus, but it’s actually another measure that shows up that the state of Florida does not value women, does not value rape victims, and just like what happened in a botched prosecution of the Epstein victims in human trafficking ring,” Rayner said.
She continued: “We always talk about bad actors. And to me, this bill, as a woman, as a Black woman, opens this wide up for rapists and abusers to be fully empowered. So, I will be voting no on this bill. “
Before voting to pass HB 289, members of the subcommittee tagged on an amendment to narrow language that protects the mother of the “unborn child” and health care providers, including assistance reproductive technology providers, from being sued. 
The amendment tightened the exemption by requiring that the health care being delivered not only be lawful but also is “provided in compliance with the applicable standard of care.”
The amendment brings the House’s version of the bill closer in line with the Senate’s proposal, SB 164, offered by Fort Pierce Republican Sen. Erin Grall. That bill passed the Senate Senate Committee on Judiciary 5-4 and heads to the Appropriations Committee on Criminal and Civil Justice and Rules committees next.
Senate judiciary panel OKs fetal wrongful death bill

HB 289, meanwhile, heads next to its second, and last, committee of reference, the Judiciary Committee.
While the bills aren’t identically drafted, they now are substantively the same.
 The way it is and would be

Under existing law, damages for the death of an unborn child are not recoverable under the state’s Wrongful Death Act, which allows for recovery of medical or funeral bills and future pain and suffering. However, per a 1997 Florida Supreme Court ruling, damages may be recoverable for a “negligent stillbirth” under common law. Those damages are limited to mental pain and anguish and medical expenses incurred incident to the pregnancy.
Common law refers a body of law developed through judicial decisions and precedents, not by statute. 
The legislation would allow parents to file wrongful death suits, which allows damages for mental pain and loss of support, meaning jurors could determine the salary the fetus could have earned over its life as part of the damages to which parents could be entitled.

The Montana Public Service Commission needs to investigate NorthWestern Energy’s actions in relation to data centers to protect existing consumers, says a complaint announced Tuesday by Earthjustice.
The complaint alleges NorthWestern Energy’s plan to supply electricity to data centers before the Public Service Commission determines that doing so won’t hurt other customers is against the law, and regulators need to investigate the monopoly utility.
Earthjustice filed the complaint Monday with the Public Service Commission on behalf of a coalition of groups representing conservation, Indigenous, senior citizen, faith, and social justice interests.
NorthWestern Energy, the state’s largest public utility, has entered letters of intent to provide as much as 1,400 megawatts of electricity to three data center developers in Montana, roughly double its current average, said the complaint.
“To serve this extreme demand, NorthWestern would need to make transmission upgrades and likely obtain new sources of electricity generation, which would likely lead to further increases in utility bills for NorthWestern’s other customers,” Earthjustice said in its announcement.
NorthWestern Energy has said it will not serve data center customers before “a specific contract for electric service” with that customer is approved by the commission.
But the complaint said NorthWestern has asserted it will not seek review by the Public Service Commission until after it has executed electricity supply contracts with data centers, “which directly contradicts the plain language” of the law.
As such, the groups are asking the Public Service Commission to inform NorthWestern that it “shall not” provide electricity to large load customers until regulators determine the service will not hurt other customers over the long run.
To make the determination, the groups ask the Public Service Commission to set a hearing to investigate the issues outlined in the complaint.



In the complaint, Earthjustice represents Big Sky 55+, Butte Watchdogs for Social and Environmental Justice, Climate Smart Missoula, Golden Triangle Resource Council, Helena Interfaith Climate Advocates, Honor the Earth, Montana Environmental Information Center, Montana Public Interest Research Group, and NW Energy Coalition.
“Montana’s seniors, many on fixed incomes, should not be forced to subsidize artificial intelligence data centers,” said Terry Minow, chair of Big Sky 55+, in a statement provided by Earthjustice. “We ask the PSC to require large load data centers to pay their fair share of utility costs. Otherwise, Montanans will be left struggling with the burden of even higher utility costs while big, out-of-state businesses take home the profits.”

Instead of annual totals, the department historically responded to public records requests with partial counts, cobbled together from multiple sources. News outlets and researchers unknowingly reported the incorrect numbers to the public: Did 125 incarcerated people die in 2023? Or 134? Maybe 137?
“Deaths are reported as they occur,” DOC Communications Director Karen Pojmann wrote in an email to The Marshall Project – St. Louis in October. “At no point during the year is the department required to present a total/comprehensive tally to any outside agency or other organization.” 

This article was published in partnership with The Marshall Project – St. Louis, a nonprofit news team covering Missouri’s criminal justice systems. Subscribe to their email list, and follow The Marshall Project on Instagram, Reddit and YouTube.

The department is required to report each death to the federal government, but those records are also flawed and missing multiple Missouri deaths, a Marshall Project investigation found. Missouri’s Department of Public Safety collects death records from the prison system, but a DPS spokesman said those are closed to the public. According to its website, DPS “does not review, compile, evaluate or analyze the submitted reports.”
Some states, like Illinois, share annual reports on prison deaths openly. But in Missouri, the prison system isn’t required to report year-end totals to anyone. 
The numerous discrepancies underscore how easily people in prison can disappear from the record — and how little residents, researchers and policymakers actually know about who dies in prison and how. Experts say withholding details and aggregate data from the public makes it harder to identify trends, and easier for the system to evade accountability for deaths that could have been prevented. 
The lack of year-end death data is “extremely concerning,” said Dr. Roger Mitchell Jr., co-author of the book “Death in Custody” and president of the National Medical Association. “There should be mortality reviews so that we review those cases, not just to hold people accountable for things that weren’t done correctly, but so that if things can improve — we improve those things.”
In early 2024, the DOC updated its data collection method, automatically pulling each death from its “offender management system” into a single document and updating it weekly. But the new process wasn’t applied retroactively, meaning death records prior to 2024 were incomplete.
However, in response to repeated questions from The Marshall Project – St. Louis about discrepancies in previously provided death records, the department’s research team generated a new report. This report includes every death recorded by the DOC from 2018 to 2024, and marks the first time comprehensive prison death totals have been made publicly available. 

A total of 844 people died over the seven-year period, according to the new report, more than has previously been reported. The department’s pattern of inconsistent record-keeping — which mirrors national trends — highlights the need for skepticism toward any death in custody data, experts say.  
Even the newest data released by the state provides an incomplete picture of deaths in prison. It does not include age, race, gender or the cause and circumstances of a death. The missing details make it impossible to spot patterns or use the data to better understand why people are dying. 
Sometimes, coroner records can fill in the gaps. In April, The Marshall Project – St. Louis obtained access to seven years of death investigations at South Central Correctional Center, a prison in Licking, Missouri. The archival records from the county coroner cover deaths from 2018 to 2024 and offer a critical window into the facility’s struggle to adequately address drug use and chronic health conditions behind bars. 
According to its new record-keeping system, and confirmed by coroner records, the department recorded 18 deaths at South Central in 2024 — the second-highest count of any Missouri facility. South Central also had the second–highest rate of deaths per 100 people incarcerated in the state’s facilities last year, according to data from the prison.

“People [in prison] are calling South Central ‘death row,’” said Déna Notz, a former corrections officer at the prison who left after a year and became a prison reform advocate. “Because of how many people end up dying there, and how many people end up getting to the point where they could have died.”
Drug overdose was the top cause of death at South Central from 2018 to 2024, the coroner records show, revealing the scale of the drug problem inside the prison. The overdoses, most often from fentanyl, represent roughly a third of deaths in 2024. Complications from chronic health conditions such as heart disease or diabetes made up another third of the deaths that year. Outside prison walls, these conditions can be more readily monitored and treated. 

The records also reveal discrepancies in the manner of death: the broad categories used on death certificates to describe how someone died. In two cases, deaths with causes that were listed as “unknown” in the DOC’s records were ruled by the coroner to be homicides. 
Pojmann, the DOC’s communications director, said the in-custody death rate for Missouri is “average among corrections systems” in the U.S. and lower than that of six of the nine bordering states. The death rate also continues to decline, she said. 
While the department has pointed to an aging population as one of the primary reasons for prison deaths, more than half of the people who died at South Central were 55 years old or younger. 
The life expectancy for men in Missouri is ranked 40th in the country, at slightly over 71 years. At South Central last year, men died on average just shy of 53 years old.

A coroner’s death investigation can include everything from the autopsy and toxicology reports to medical records and the prison’s own notes about a death. These reports sometimes reveal the circumstances surrounding a person’s death, such as when they were found, who notified prison officials and whether the person was alone. 
In the absence of details from the prison, coroner records can be illuminating. On occasion, coroner investigations can clarify, or complicate, the often sparse narratives offered by the prison. For example, the DOC reported that a man died in January 2020 from an accident at South Central, with few other details mentioned in the death log besides his name. Coroner records reveal that the man was found out of his cell, dead in a janitor’s closet from a drug overdose and soaked in an unknown liquid. (The coroner’s report reads: “urine?”) 
Later that year, a 46-year-old Haitian man suffered a sudden heart attack at the prison during breakfast, and was pronounced dead that afternoon. The prison’s investigation reported “no major health history,” according to the autopsy report, despite a well-documented history in his medical records of heart disease and high cholesterol, and a previous heart attack at the prison in 2011.
The DOC reported that a man died of natural causes at South Central in December 2022. His autopsy report, included in coroner records, identified an untreated tooth infection as the contributing factor in his death. 
And in September 2023, the DOC reported that a man died by suicide, again with little information besides his name. The coroner’s investigation found that the man had a known history of mental health challenges, and hung himself in his cell two months after the prison system stopped providing proper medication for his depression. 
Experts say preventing future deaths across the prison system hinges on recording information about deaths in their totality, rather than one by one.
“You need the [total] number, and not just the number,” said Mitchell. “It’s the cause, it’s the circumstances, it’s the level of treatment. It’s full reviews of those deaths.”
Nationally, researchers have called for an overhaul of record-keeping for deaths in custody. Some states have medical review boards that investigate deaths behind bars and recommend changes correctional and medical staff must make to prevent similar deaths in the future. 
But spotting trends isn’t possible without robust historical death data. And inadequate record-keeping presents a challenge not only for policymakers, but also for grieving families who must fight for answers about how their loved ones died. For some elected officials in Missouri, the lack of reporting requirements and external oversight is a sign that the DOC is overdue for reform. 
“There should be some level of documentation and there should be some kind of scrutiny,” said state Rep. Gregg Bush, a Jefferson City Democrat who is a nurse by training.
“It’s just so unconscionable to me,” Bush said, that families of the deceased are “having to piece these things together, contextualizing the death of somebody who’s in our custody, who we’re responsible for their wellbeing.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Rose_Wong_STL-PRISON-DEATHS-DATA_header-1024x536.jpg,,,2025-11-18 13:00:14.301619

(Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline) One of the first casualties of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s planned crackdown in the capital city was Raleigh’s new City Hall.
The $260 million building, which will be 17 stories when it’s complete, is being built on the site of the city’s former police station. Normally the site is buzzing with activity. On Tuesday morning, hours after word of the immigration raids spread, work was at a standstill. Heavy equipment was parked. Workers were scarce.
“Usually you have at least about 200 people on the site,” Bob Johnson, one of the few construction workers on the site, told NC Newsline.
Only a handful of workers were on site Tuesday. Even the operators of the food truck stayed away.
He acknowledged that his co-workers were worried about ICE agents.
“There’s a lot that can’t be done. I mean, you have framing, electrical, you have guys working painting, you know, precast,” said Johnson. “There’s a lot of trades that are not here because of that situation.”
Johnson said the fear that the announced immigration raids generated was definitely holding up the work planned for this week.
“Well, we’re talking about losing profit. The project itself will be behind schedule because it can cause a chain of events when it comes to other workers and other trades as well,” he said.
While federal agents have said the raids are designed to target criminals, Johnson said most of the people he works with on the city hall project are here because they want a better opportunity until they can become legal.
“I definitely don’t shun them at all. They’re very helpful. They make up half of our workforce. This is a dying trade.”
CBP’s immigration raids not only affected the massive construction project, but the small food truck that normally provides drinks and meals for the workers. Johnson noted even they stayed away rather than venture into downtown Raleigh.
“And I just feel bad for the families that are dependent on the guys to work the hours,” Johnson said.
“You’re talking about fathers and brothers being the prime breadwinner for their home.”
Johnson said while he supports the overall goal of improving public safety, he would like to see a less disruptive approach, especially in a profession where immigrant workers are needed.
“Heck, if Americans won’t or can’t do [the work], why not give it to those that’s coming in? They’re doing a job for us.”
The immigration enforcement surge in the Charlotte area has resulted in the arrest of over 130 immigrants in two days. The Department of Homeland Security released a statement listing several detainees it describe as “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.”
As the Border Patrol expands its enforcement efforts to Raleigh, Siembra NC said that there was little evidence that the operation conducted in Charlotte was targeting individuals with criminal records.
“Safety is created by community members looking out for each other and standing up for each other, not by masked federal agents who are here to create chaos and bring fear,” said Nikki Marín Baena, co-director of Siembra NC, in a prepared statement.
For many workers, the danger was not on the job site, but the fear of being swept up in a possible raid by Border Patrol agents. (Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251118_092008-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-18 13:00:14.301619

Rosa DeLauro said the Italian American Congressional Delegation will send a letter urging the administration to pause proposed tariffs.,"The city’s pastificios are boiling over the Trump administration’s proposal to impose a 107 percent tariff on their favorite Italian imports — including boxes of pasta, which a Wooster Square importer warned would double in price from $3 to $6.
Local importers and U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro gathered at Vinnie’s Italia Importing Company on Monday to slam the Trump administration for threatening new duties on Italian imports. DeLauro also announced that the bipartisan Italian American Congressional Delegation will send a letter on Wednesday urging the administration to pause the proposed tariffs.
“It’s crazy,” lamented Mike DiVirgilio, the owner of Vinnie’s. He said he’s already had to raise prices on his customers, which include Adriana’s, Goodfellas, Consiglio’s, Portofino, and 50 other restaurants throughout Southern Connecticut.
The pasta makers affected include Barilla, Rummo, La Molisana, and Garofalo.
Whether pasta is $3 or $6, families “still gotta use” it for dinner, said DiVirgilio. But as tariffs continue to push prices higher, customers have started cutting back on steak and other meats, impairing Vinnie’s economics. According to DiVirgilio, the price of Dutch veal — a popular choice for holiday dinners — has climbed from $9 to $12.50 per pound due to tariffs.
“We’re losing money,” said DiVirgilio. When asked what he would say to the Trump administration, he opted to say nothing, citing fear of being “arrested.”
Francesca Liuzzi Fiorillo and Nadia Liuzzi, part-owners of North Haven’s Liuzzi Gourmet Food Market, said they’ve watched customers “struggling to pay” the higher prices, especially on imported staples like canned tomatoes and olive oil.
We “couldn’t really prepare” for the tariffs, said Liuzzi Fiorillo, since over 90 percent of their goods are imported.
The family chooses to import for the better quality, she added. Pasta from Italy is made without preservatives, chemicals, or dyes, while much of what’s produced in the U.S. contains those additives, Fiorillo said. They manufacture in the U.S. when they can, like with cheese.
For the Liuzzi family, pasta is a centerpiece to family gatherings. “It’s a Sunday thing,” said Liuzzi. “Our grandma and grandpa would make it” for the whole family.
Their favorites are malfaldine — a thin lasagna noodle — and mezzi rigatoni — a short, small version of rigatoni.
“I definitely don’t agree” with Italian-American support for Trump, said Liuzzi Fiorillo, but added that, as a business owner, she prefers to stay mostly “neutral.”
On Monday, DeLauro described the cultural importance of pasta to Italian-American families like her own.
“Pasta is the most important staple in our house,” said DeLauro. She told the Independent that her favorite pasta shapes are linguine and macaroni, and she ate spaghetti with clams last night for dinner.
For her, pasta can be a way to “connect to a broader sense of self and broader history.” And, she said, with food prices having already risen by 25 percent over the last four years, a rising proportion of families living paycheck to paycheck, and the Trump administration dragging their heels on disbursing November’s food stamp payments, the new tariffs will only intensify the affordability crisis for American families.
“This is not like dealing with China,” argued DeLauro. Tariffs as high as what the Trump administration has proposed could stir the pot, impairing the long-standing relationship between U.S. and Italy.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-18 16:37:48+00:00,CT Mirror,EPA seeks to limit scope of clean water law to reduce wetlands covered,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/18/epa-clean-water-rollback-wotus/,"The proposal is among dozens of environmental regulations being rolled back in an effort to accelerate economic prosperity, EPA said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday it is redefining the scope of the nation’s bedrock clean water law to significantly limit the wetlands it covers, building on a Supreme Court decision two years ago that removed federal protections for vast areas.
When finalized, the new “Waters of the United States” rule will ensure that federal jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act is focused on relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water, such as streams, oceans, rivers and lakes, along with wetlands that are directly connected to such bodies of water, the EPA said.
The proposal is among dozens of environmental regulations being rolled back by the Trump administration as part of what EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin says is a concerted effort to accelerate economic prosperity while putting ” a dagger through the heart of climate change religion.” Critics call the water rule a giveaway to ranchers and industry.
At a news conference at agency headquarters, Zeldin said the new rule will fully implement the direction provided by the Supreme Court in a case known as Sackett v. EPA. The 2023 ruling sharply limited the federal government’s authority to police water pollution into certain wetlands, and boosted property rights over concerns about clean water in a ruling in favor of Michael and Chantell Sackett, an Idaho couple who sought to build a house near a lake.
Zeldin, a former Republican congressman who has led a drive to roll back regulations perceived as climate-friendly, said Democratic administrations had long “weaponized the definition of navigable waters to seize more power from American farmers, landowners and families.” Still, he said the proposed rule change was not motivated by ideology or partisanship, but instead was intended to be a “clear, simple, prescriptive rule that will stand the test of time.”
Asked why he is confident the rule will be sustained after decades of partisan back-and-forth over water regulation, Zeldin offered a one-word answer: “Sackett.”
“That’s one of the big differences from the past, is that you have the Supreme Court weighing in, and we’re following Sackett very closely,” Zeldin said. “We’re treating it with respect. The words are being interpreted strictly. We are sticking to the prescriptive language of the Supreme Court decision. And that is a very significant difference from the past.”
The rule, which faces at least 45 days of public comment, will cut red tape and provide clarity for farmers, ranchers, industry and other private landowners, Zeldin said. The proposal will also protect water quality by striking a balance between federal and state authority, he said, adding that any lands that are removed from federal jurisdiction will still face regulation from states and tribes.
Environmentalists slammed the proposal as a giveaway to industry by President Donald Trump.
“The Trump EPA’s shortsighted push to encourage industries to plow over more wetlands and streams will destroy thousands of miles of waterways critical to wildlife across the United States,” said J.W. Glass, a policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group. “This political gift from Trump to the polluters that support him will wipe out life-sustaining waterways in every corner of the nation, and it will destroy countless natural areas that protect us from increasingly destructive storm surges driven by the climate crisis.”
“By gutting protections for wetlands and streams, EPA is trying to disown its legal obligation to protect our drinking water and our communities,” added Andrew Wetzler, senior vice president at the Natural Resources Defense Council, another environmental group. “Wetlands are nature’s safeguard against flooding, and stripping away protections for them puts millions of people in harm’s way.”
But Zeldin, who has traveled to all 50 states since taking office earlier this year, said complaints about the invasive nature of the water rule have emerged in every state. The Trump administration has listened to concerns from farmers and other groups worried about federal interference in how they use their land, he said, and has moved to set limited, predictable and lasting rules defining which waterways the Clean Water Act protects.
“If you want to really appreciate the impact of the WOTUS rule — past, present and future — I would encourage you to speak to all of those impacted stakeholders, all those impacted landowners,” Zeldin said.
Testimony that affected him the most came from “some small farmer who’s struggling to make ends meet, and they have no idea whether or not the water on their property is a water of the United States or not,” Zeldin said. “Their frustration skyrockets when something on their property being interpreted as a water of the United States doesn’t make any sense. Then their advocacy and passion really starts coming out.”
Trump sought to shrink the water law’s reach in his first term, while Democratic administrations have expanded federal power to regulate the nation’s lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands and oceans. The change in administrations has created drastic swings in how the water law is interpreted and applied.
The Supreme Court ruling in the Sackett case largely agreed with the Trump administration’s limited approach and led the Biden administration to rewrite protections to comply with the ruling. Some conservative groups have complained that the revised rule still protected too many wetlands and improperly limited private property rights.
Damien Schiff, a senior attorney at the Pacific Legal Foundation who represented the Sacketts in court, said the latest proposal “represents a meaningful step toward relief for property owners still burdened by unjustified and illegal Clean Water Act regulations.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25321806840597-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 11:58:14.540262

Thomas Massie speaks with reporters inside the U.S. Capitol building on Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)After Kentucky Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie led the charge for months to release federal investigation files about sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, U.S. House members are expected to vote on the motion Tuesday afternoon. 
“We fought the president, the attorney general, the FBI director, the speaker of the House and the vice president, to get this win,” Massie said during a Tuesday morning press conference. “But they’re on our side today, though, so let’s give them some credit as well. They’re finally on the side of justice.”
President Donald Trump, who has blasted Massie and even recruited a Republican opponent to run against him, abruptly reversed his opposition to releasing the Epstein files as it became clear the Republican-controlled House would vote for releasing the investigation records. 
In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump said that House Republicans “should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat ‘Shutdown.’”
Massie filed a discharge petition to release the files in September, much to Trump’s ire. The president went so far as to endorse a primary challenger against Massie in Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District, former Navy SEAL Ed Gallrein. 
Massie was poised to gain the 218th signature needed to bring the petition forward after the election of Democratic U.S. Rep. Adelita Grijalva. However, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed her swearing-in amid the government shutdown until last week. 
Ahead of the expected vote, Massie joined survivors of Epstein along with California Democratic U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna and Georgia Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene for a Tuesday morning press conference in Washington, D.C. Massie thanked the survivors for sharing their stories and encouraged senators to vote in favor of releasing the files once they receive the discharge petition. 
Survivors of Epstein’s abuse publicly told their stories in September aiming to encourage members of Congress to vote in favor of releasing the federal investigation files. They described emotional manipulation and physical coercion, beginning as early as age 14 in some cases, at the hands of Epstein and convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell.
Epstein died in 2019 in jail while awaiting trial on federal charges of sex trafficking minors. His death was ruled a suicide. 
Trump had campaigned on releasing the Epstein files, but backed off releasing the files after he became president earlier this year. 
In his criticism of Massie and the discharge petition, the president has issued personal attacks against the congressman. On Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social about Massie’s announcement of his second marriage to Carolyn Grace Moffa, a former staffer for U.S. Sen. Rand Paul. Massie’s late wife, Rhonda Massie, died unexpectedly last year. 
“Anyway, have a great life Thomas and (?),” the president wrote. “His wife will soon find out that she’s stuck with a LOSER!”
The primary opponent Trump endorsed against Massie, Gallrein, said online Saturday in response to one of the congressman’s posts on X: “You’ve voted so often with radical Dems that all you’ve got left is howling ‘Epstein.’” 
Gallrein’s campaign did not immediately return an emailed request for comment Tuesday after Trump’s position on the files changed.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/massiesept32025-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-18 11:58:14.540262

Among the program’s flaws in Washington: They plan for the future by looking backward, using the past as a baseline for calculating future needs, thereby ignoring potential demographic shifts and economic forecasts.
And, yet, Washington state lawmakers are once again determined to fill the account.
Why? Because it’s a wildly popular benefit.
Minnesota state officials and the 350 workers who will be rolling out the state’s new paid leave benefit are trying to learn from mistakes in Washington and the nearly dozen other states with paid leave — all while under the microscope of election year politics.
Minnesota’s paid leave program will launch on Jan. 1, ushering in a new system for Minnesota workers that grants up to 12 weeks of family leave and 12 weeks of medical leave per year, capped at 20 weeks in a single year. Employers and workers will pay into a fund, with the payout determined by a wage-based formula, capped at $1,423 per week. The program also includes job protections.
The stakes couldn’t be higher, for the businesses and workers affected, but also for Gov. Tim Walz and Democratic-Farmer-Labor lawmakers. Paid leave was a signature accomplishment during the 2023 DFL trifecta. Walz often cites paid leave when he argues that Minnesota is among the best states to raise a family.
But now they’ve got to make it work, and if they don’t they can expect to pay the consequences. Walz is seeking an unprecedented third, four-year term in 2026; voters will also determine control of the narrowly divided Legislature.
Risks for the Walz administration include the potential for fraud that has beset other Minnesota public programs. Then there’s foreboding technology glitches, like the 2017 revamp of the Minnesota Licensing and Registration System that caused massive headaches for thousands of drivers trying to get their licenses and registration tabs renewed.
To ensure a smooth rollout, Walz recruited an out-of-state paid leave director who helped launch Massachusetts’ paid leave program.
Massachusetts was the eighth state with paid leave; Greg Norfleet helped raise the curtain in 2021 despite interruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Norfleet said his team is learning from others. For example, Minnesota employers will be more engaged in the application process — the state will notify bosses if one of their workers applies for leave. In other states, employers have been blindsided by their workers, who would only notify their bosses after the state signed off on their leave, Norfleet said in a Reformer interview.
When he was asked if there’s anything that’s keeping him up at night about Minnesota’s rollout, Norfleet said no.
“I’m sleeping pretty well,” Norfleet said.

The Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, however, thinks he should be tossing and turning a bit more.
The Chamber — which opposed the paid leave bill at the Legislature, citing the burdens of higher taxes and finding replacement workers — said in a statement to the Reformer that they’ve been conducting outreach efforts to help members comply with the new law, but they remain concerned: “It’s clear there are still significant awareness gaps and plenty of implementation questions, particularly for small businesses, many of whom thought they were exempt from the law.”
“As employers of all sizes are trying to figure out how to coordinate with this new mandate, we are increasingly concerned about readiness,” the Chamber statement reads.
Norfleet says the agency is well-staffed and has hosted many engagement sessions with businesses and Minnesotans to answer questions.
“That foundation that we’ve built gives me a lot of confidence of where we are and how we’re going to be able to meet the moment for Minnesotans,” Norfleet said.
How it works
Minnesota’s paid leave program is partnered with the state’s unemployment insurance system, from which the Department of Employment and Economic Development has gathered data to avoid redundant reporting requirements from businesses.
The state is also ahead of the game in another respect: In most states with paid leave, a payroll tax goes into effect about a year before the program rolls out to build up enough funds for the benefits. This means employees pay a tax without reaping any rewards.
Minnesota lawmakers in 2023 allocated $668 million in initial funding for the paid leave account and $122 million for administrative costs, paid for with an $18 billion budget surplus.
In Minnesota, a 0.88% payroll tax will go into effect in January, split between employers and their employees. Most employees will pay half, or 44 cents for every $100 in taxable wages. (Small businesses — those that employ 30 or fewer people — pay a reduced rate of 0.66%.)
Paid leave may boost wages for women
California implemented paid family leave in 2004. In the decades since, numerous studies have shown that access to paid leave to care for newborns and children have positive health impacts on parents and children alike.
Surveys of people who’ve taken paid leave say they have boosted morale, better job security and economic stability. Paid leave, when offered with job protections, can also help states that have a dire need for elder care, as people can afford to take time off to be family caregivers after a fall or illness, for example.
According to the left-leaning Center for American Progress, workers lose $22.5 billion in wages each year because of a lack of paid leave.
Women who take paid leave are also more likely to return to work after their child’s birth compared to those who don’t take leave,and paid leave is associated with higher wages among mothers.
Research on paid leave’s effect on businesses is mixed. While it’s associated with less employee turnover and higher productivity, the cost of employees taking family leave can hurt small businesses that struggle to absorb short-term losses.
A Center for Economic and Policy Research study of the Connecticut paid leave program’s impact on businesses found that most employers reported a modest impact or no impact on their costs or business operations. About a year-and-a-half after the law’s implementation, about 75% of 251 Connecticut employers said they support the paid leave law.
Jessica Mason, a senior policy analyst with the National Partnership for Women & Families, said the program is a net win for families, especially during uncertain budget times.
“These days, folks are really watching our dollars, so it’s important to feel like everything we’re making investments in is really worth it — and the evidence is really clear that paid leave is one of those things,” Mason said.
Local government, school districts concerned about cost
Minnesota’s paid leave law applies to nearly every employer, not just businesses, and many are anxious about the new program.
Given already tight budgets, a new payroll tax may lead cities to raise property taxes to pay higher personnel costs, said Lisa Schaefer, the League of Minnesota Cities’ human resources director.
Schaefer said city governments confront many unknowns. Among the conundrums unique to government entities: If an elected official is unable to serve for 90 days, a vacancy can be declared under state law. It’s unclear how the paid leave law would apply in that situation, Schaefer said.
Many cities also have unionized employees who have paid leave negotiated in their contracts, so cities and unions will have to renegotiate new terms, she said.
Minnesota school districts’ main concern about paid leave is the prospect of losing important educators. Schools are already facing substitute teacher shortages, and weeks-long absences for paid leave will exacerbate the issue, said Tiffany Gustin, director of management and insurance trust services with the Minnesota School Boards Association.
Gustin said the issue with paid leave boils down to “the responsibility that school districts have to still provide an education to its students.” Many districts will also have to renegotiate their union contracts if they include paid leave, Gustin said.
The ‘baby bump’
Almost every state with paid leave has encountered what Norfleet said in the paid leave world is known as the “baby bump,” meaning an influx of applications from parents who welcomed a child into their home a year prior to paid leave rolling out.
Minnesota parents who welcomed a child into their home this year can claim the state’s paid leave benefit in 2026, even if they’ve already taken leave through their employer.
Norfleet said paid leave for parents who had a kid in 2025 is the most-called about question, and Minnesota is ready to meet the moment.
Mason, the policy analyst, said that states have struggled to predict the number of applications that will come in on day one and don’t hire enough people to handle the abundance of claims.
Norfleet said DEED is hiring temporary workers to help with an anticipated 17,000 to 20,000 applications for leave in the first month — including between 5,000 to 7,000 “baby bump” applications.
Walz and the DFL architects of the program hope that by allowing parents to spend time nurturing the youngest Minnesotans, they’ll feel more secure having more babies. The children, meanwhile, will enjoy lifelong benefits of stable and attentive parenting, at least for 12 weeks, or perhaps 24 if parents decide to take the leave back-to-back instead of together.
Norfleet explained his mission with a line that could fit on a Hallmark card: “Paid leave is really about making time for moments that matter,” Norfleet said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/P1139698-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 11:58:14.540262

(File photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)South Carolina’s Grand Strand sees among the highest rates of opioid overdoses in the state, but those who seek treatment tend to drop out early. Meanwhile, the Midlands’ most populous county sees more overdose deaths but posts the lowest diagnosis rate for addiction statewide.
Those are among the findings of researchers with the S.C. Center of Excellence in Addiction, who are dissecting the data to help cities and counties come up with potential solutions.
A finding for Georgetown County, for example, is that people seeking help could stay in treatment if they had transportation to get there. And patients in Richland County could benefit from more doctors and first responders being trained in recognizing the signs of addiction and knowing who to call.
The center isn’t actually a place. It’s a partnership between the state agencies for public health and addiction services and South Carolina’s three research universities: the University of South Carolina, Clemson University, and the Medical University of South Carolina.
The group acts as the state’s information clearinghouse in the battle against the national opioid crisis, according to its director Jodi Manz.
It was created by an agreement signed three years ago as the state began collecting millions of dollars annually from South Carolina’s eventual $750 million share of legal settlements with the makers and distributors of opioid medications. The goal of the research center is to help local governments receiving money decide how to best spend it to save lives.
USC researchers began by gathering and analyzing public data from the state’s Medicaid rolls and uninsured patients. The state doesn’t require private insurance companies to report.
The team at Clemson steps in next, helping counties and cities form plans and track effectiveness once they establish programs. The idea is to use the data to expand successful approaches and correct those that aren’t.
“It’s about monitoring data over time because that’s what everyone wants to see is how is this working,” said Sara Goldsby, director of the state Office of Substance Use Services.
South Carolina to receive nearly $73 million from national opioid settlement

“Our core purpose is to maximize those dollars,” she told the SC Daily Gazette.
Rather than hiring an out-of-state consultant, the center means South Carolina is doing this prep work in house and at a lower cost, she said.
And MUSC gives these city and county employees, who dole out the funds but often don’t have a background in addiction treatment, ongoing training and a monthly virtual meeting space to talk with other administrators about their progress, Manz said.
The settlement money, coming in installments over two decades, began arriving in 2022, when the Legislature passed a law creating a nine-member board to oversee the distribution.
In 2023, the Legislature provided $2 million through the state budget to officially open and ramp up the center.
It’s also received grants from the settlement pool — $1 million each of the last two years. The board recently approved a third round, Manz said.
In addition to helping cities and counties, the center also helps doctors directly.
It operates a hotline that medical personnel can call during regular working hours, connecting them to a specialist in treating addiction.
SC Chief Justice talks caseloads, magistrate system changes in first ‘State of the Judiciary’

A general practitioner might have a patient come into their office with the flu but also admit they’re addicted to painkillers. Those doctors may know how to treat a wide swath of common diseases, Manz said, but don’t specialize in treating addiction.
Or an emergency room nurse can administer naloxone to an overdose victim or tell when someone is going through signs of withdrawal, but they might not always know what to do next. The larger hospital systems, such as Prisma Health, have specialized teams in-house. But small, rural emergency departments often don’t, Goldsby said.
The hotline option gives health care workers the option to phone an expert for a consultation.
Building up in-hospital teams is also one way many counties and cities are choosing to spend their own opioid funds, according to records on the opioid board’s website.
Goldsby said the opioid dollars also have brought programs into South Carolina not previously available in the state.
A big one is efforts to set up medication treatment programs in county jails. These programs provide medicines, such as methadone, to opioid-addicted inmates. The medicine brings down cravings gradually so a person doesn’t go into withdrawal, which often comes with nausea, vomiting, anxiety and insomnia — symptoms that can cause problems in a jail population.
Manz also highlighted a program set up by the Mount Pleasant Police Department that sends people to treatment instead of jail.
If an officer is about to arrest someone for a minor drug crime, they’re trained to bring in a treatment specialist first. The specialist tries to get that person medical help for an addiction they can’t control rather than involving them in the criminal justice system.
Care for opioid-addicted mothers and infants is one way SC is spending opioid settlement dollars

Goldsby said jails were among the first to start making use of opioid settlement dollars. These programs didn’t exist before the settlement, she said, because jails weren’t eligible for any of her agency’s federal grant money.
“Cities and counties had been asking for resources for a very long time,” she said. “Federal money can’t be used behind the walls.”
A mobile treatment unit run by Prisma Health marks another success story — this one in bringing treatment to more rural areas, Manz said. Instead of addiction patients coming into the doctors office for a refill on a methadone prescription, the hospital system’s team takes transport vans out to meet patients in their homes.
As far as what comes next in the effort to battle the opioid crisis in the Palmetto State, Manz said she expects the center and counties to enter into a new evolution.
The first two years were about finding out what the needs were and standing up programs. This third year marks a shift, she said, as data starts to pour in on what’s working and what is not.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/opioid-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 11:01:06.781003

(Joshua Bowling/Source New Mexico)New Mexico’s Legislative Finance Committee director on Monday told state lawmakers that social services such as the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program are receiving all of their federal funds under the government’s Nov. 12 reopening.
Federal interruptions to SNAP, in particular, led to confusion over whether such a program—which is considered a “mandatory program” exempt from cuts, along with other social services such as unemployment insurance, veteran’s benefits and Medicaid— could be targeted in the first place. The federal cuts sparked alarm among New Mexico’s lawmakers, who convened a special session in November and committed $162.5 million of state funds to cover statewide food assistance into early 2026, if needed.
Approximately 460,000 state residents receive SNAP benefits.
Legislative Finance Committee Director Charles Sallee at Monday’s hearing told state lawmakers that SNAP, in particular, is a “mandatory program” and its federal funding should not be threatened in the future.
“We learned something new with this latest government shutdown: the mandatory outlays are the ones that are kind of on autopilot—Congress has set up a funding mechanism as well as an allocation mechanism for things like Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security benefits,” Sallee said.. “There are different legal interpretations over whether the administration legally turned off that funding or if it should’ve continued to flow.”
SNAP funding was disrupted over the federal government’s determination that it didn’t have enough contingency funds to cover November’s expense of $8 billion. Several states filed lawsuits protesting the decision and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in late October authorized $30 million of emergency spending to counteract any interruptions to federal funding.
The New Mexico Health Care Authority spent $250,000 to upgrade its IT system and distribute the state funds, Sallee said. SNAP benefits in New Mexico usually cost $81 million per month. The ratio of statewide SNAP cases to each case worker have steadily declined since 2022, according to LFC documents.
Programs that should not be affected by cuts, Sallee said, include SNAP, as well as Social Security, veteran’s benefits, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, unemployment insurance and Supplemental Security Income. Cuts to Medicare are capped at 4%, he said.
Sallee, however, warned lawmakers about the possibility of future cuts to non-mandatory programs, known as “Pay-As-You-Go” or PAYGO. These include Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting programs, Promoting Safe and Stable Families programs and federal mineral leasing. New Mexico, in particular, receives a huge portion of revenue from federal mineral leasing. In 2024, the federal government paid out nearly $4.3 billion from federal mining permits — $2.8 million went to New Mexico, Sallee said.
“I raised alarms on a provision called PAYGO… if Congress increases the deficit, they have to figure out a way to pay for it. And if they don’t, there would be cuts enacted,” Sallee said. “That would mean that a whole bunch of those other programs would have, frankly, needed to have been eliminated for that entire year. What was concerning for us was there hadn’t been much discussion about it in all the talk in D.C. I was concerned it was lost in the shuffle.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6460-1-1024x499.jpg,,,2025-11-18 11:01:06.781003

Oletha Faust-Goudeau, a Wichita Democrat, hears testimony Feb. 26, 2025, at the Senate Local Government, Transparency and Ethics Committee. (Grace Hills/ Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas Senate bill would let inmates seek resentencing after a set period of time based on their age during the offense — an effort to reduce excessive prison time, especially for young offenders. 
SB 255, the “Second Look Act,” would allow inmates to petition for resentencing 10 years after their sentencing if the inmate was younger than 25 or older than 50 when the offense was committed and 15 years after if they were between 25 and 50 years old. 
The bill would also allow petitions 10 years after sentencing if prisoners’ veteran status was not considered, or if they’ve completed all rehabilitative programming required. They could also petition on the effective date of a law that would have shortened their sentence had it been applied retroactively. 
Scott Schultz, the executive director for the Kansas Sentencing Commission, said that if the law was enacted, roughly 4,000 prisoners could petition for resentencing.
  (Graphic by Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)
He said there are currently 2,831 inmates who have served more than 10 years and were younger than 25 years old at the time of the offense. There are 90 inmates who have served more than 10 years and were more than 50 years old at the time of the offense, and there are 884 inmates who have served more than 15 years and were between 25 and 49 years old at the time of the offense. 
The bill was introduced by Wichita Democrat Sen. Oletha Faust Goudeau. The Joint Committee on Corrections and Juvenile Justice Oversight heard testimony Friday, Nov. 7. 
Goudeau said she heard from the parents of a prisoner in her district who was sentenced at a young age. She said the parents wanted to see their son before they died. 
A yearning to see family was echoed across testimonies from both prisoners who wrote in and and a mother of a prisoner. 
“My youngest, and only son Robert was sentenced at just 23 years of age to a 38-year sentence,” Dania Long testified. “He has now served over 10 of those years. I am not here to say he’s innocent. He made mistakes, as so many young people do. He was immature. His brain was still developing, and he was impulsive. However, the young man who went into prison at 23 is not the same person who sits there today.”
She continued: “Robert has grown, he has matured, and he has reflected deeply on his choices and the harm they caused. He is taking responsibility. He just needs the opportunity.” 
Robert Long and two other young co-defendants were charged with robbery and battery in 2016. 
“A second chance would give me an opportunity to amend the wrongs I have done in my life,” wrote Dean Bolen Jr., who is currently serving a 25-years-to-life sentence in a child sex case. 
He’s 47 now, went to prison at 30, and could be released at age 56 at the earliest. 
  (Graphic by Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)
Bolen Jr. and the eight other prisoners who wrote testimony outlined the steps they’ve taken to better themselves, with most pointing to a strong religious influence. Some reflected on their childhoods. 
Ronald Beard was 21 when he was charged with murder. He’s 38 now. He wrote about being homeless, stealing food and getting jumped. He felt like his whole world was his friends: “We shared the same hurt, and brokenness.” 
“Yes I was a gang member. Due to abandonment issues of my dad going to prison. I was hurt as a child, and I didn’t know how to talk about my hurt,” he wrote. 
Curtis Coleman also wrote about his upbringing. He was convicted when he was 15 years old and has spent 27 years in prison for the murder of a 10-year-old girl. 
“Growing up in Kansas City, Kansas there were so many outlets for a young person trying to find his/her way. But for me, those outlets were already chosen for me,” Coleman wrote. “My father was a well known street dude in every sense of the words, my mother young with 3 kids and a fourth on the way while she was blindly committed to a man that wasn’t ready to be a father nor committed to anything other than himself.” 
Recent investigations have left some convinced Coleman’s conviction was the result of corruption. Coleman’s case is entangled with disgraced 1990s Kansas City, Kansas, police detective Roger Golubski — who was accused of misconduct, including forcing confessions from young Black men. Golubski died by suicide the day his trail was to begin. 
Coleman didn’t address the corruption in his letter. Instead, he asked for a second chance. 
“If given a second chance, (I would be) continuing to be part of the solution, and do my best to help change the direction of many misguided and traumatized people,” Coleman wrote. 
Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit, supported the Second Look Act. Daniel Landsman, the nonprofit’s vice president of policy, testified that the Second Look Act in D.C. is the “best second look act mechanism in the nation.”

(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)Weeks after a pro-marijuana group sued the DeSantis administration in the Florida Supreme Court for allegedly slow-walking the process to put an amendment on the ballot, Florida election officials announced that they have taken that step.
Attorney General James Uthmeier asked the court in a brief Tuesday to dismiss the case because, a day earlier, Division of Elections Director Maria Matthews completed the step that Smart & Safe Florida sued the state over in late October.
This involved issuing a letter acknowledging that the organization had enough support to advance its proposal to legalize recreational marijuana.
“The sole relief sought by Smart & Safe’s petition is an order ‘compelling Respondents to issue the … letter, thus advancing the [Initiative] Petition,'” the state’s response petition reads. “Respondents have now sent the demanded … letter to Smart & Safe and submitted the initiative petition to the Attorney General.”
This is the second lawsuit Smart & Safe had filed against the DeSantis administration over its proposal, and came months after the pro-marijuana group nearly legalized recreational use of the drug during the 2024 election cycle. Although the initiative garnered 56% support from Floridians, it fell short of the 60% threshold needed to become part of the state Constitution.
That failure came on the heels of a massive and expensive statewide campaign by Gov. Ron DeSantis, First Lady Casey DeSantis, and other top officials who were vehemently opposed to legalizing weed, alleging in a slew of press conferences that everything from the smell to corporate greed would damage the state.
Uthmeier, the governor’s former chief of staff, came under fire after his political committee to defeat the amendment received millions that originated from a Medicaid settlement doled out to Casey DeSantis’ charity, Hope Florida.
A grand jury is now reportedly investigating the DeSantis administration’s role in defeating the 2024 measure and Hope Florida’s financials.
What happened?
In Smart & Safe’s Oct. 31 lawsuit against the state, the organization claimed it had notified Matthews and Secretary of State Cord Byrd in August that the proposal had secured more than three times the number of verified petitions (more than 660,000) needed to make it to the ballot.
Smart & Safe had asked the officials to take the next step in the ballot initiative process, which would be to send Smart & Safe a letter acknowledging that its petition had enough signatures, so that the state could submit the proposal to the attorney general, who then would forward the initiative for Supreme Court review. The organization needs 880,000 signatures total to win a ballot space.
But that didn’t happen.
Smart & Safe, in its petition demanding the Florida Supreme Court force the state to send the letter, alleged that Florida was purposely roadblocking the marijuana amendment by attempting to stall out Smart & Safe’s proposal, the Phoenix previously reported.
That referred to Byrd’s Oct. 3 order to county supervisors that they trash as many as 200,000 signatures — nearly one-quarter of what’s needed to qualify for next year’s ballot — because organizers failed to provide the entire amendment to people it reached out to by mail.
This was the basis of Smart & Safe’s Oct. 19 suit against the administration in circuit court.

In north Jackson and rural areas of Hinds and Madison Counties, some residents can vote in a runoff for the Senate District 26 seat, vacated by former state Sen. John Horhn when he became mayor of Jackson in July. 
The candidates in that runoff election are Canton municipal judge Kamesha Mumford and attorney Letitia Johnson, who received 39% and 28%, respectively, in a special election earlier this month. 
Mumford, who also owns a small business, has described herself as a “quality of life“ candidate who will advocate for improvements to infrastructure, public safety and education.  
Johnson, a former Jackson Public Schools board member, has pledged to advocate for Mississippi’s public education system, calling it her “largest priority” in the face of legislation to divert state funds to private schools. 
In portions of Leflore, Panola and Tallahatchie counties, voters can participate in the runoff for the Senate District 24 seat, vacated by former state Sen. David Jordan when he retired from the Legislature in July. 
The candidates are Curressia Brown, a retired college educator and administrator, and Justin Pope, a corporate deputy with Progressive Health Group. 
Brown on social media says she advocates expanding Medicaid access to the working poor, funding education fully and strengthening the public employee pension system. 
Pope on social media says that, if elected, he would bring accountability, responsibility and transparency to his legislative district and work to ensure the district has a “ strong voice in Jackson.”

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Monday, the fifth day of the special legislative session, came and went without any public movement being made on the Summerlin film studio bill.
That lack of movement on Assembly Bill 4, which would authorize the state’s largest ever public subsidy and massively expand the state’s transferable tax credit  program, was not unexpected. Procedural rules in the Senate, where the bill currently sits, made it so lawmakers could not vote on the bill Monday without first voting to declare the bill an emergency measure — a motion that would require two-thirds approval.
A vote by the Senate could come as soon as 11 a.m. on Tuesday. The bill only needs a simple majority of the chamber’s 21 members to pass.
At least two state senators are confirmed as having physically left the Legislative Building and rumors abound that additional senators have obligations in the upcoming days. It’s unclear if they might return for the vote or vote remotely as done in the Assembly, where the 22-20 vote included two members permitted by Speaker Steve Yeager to vote remotely.
The special session’s other high-profile bill, Gov. Joe Lombardo’s crime bill, has largely been progressing through the legislative process in tandem with the film bill.

(Andrew Fraieli/Colorado Newsline)A group of Democratic secretaries of state in a letter to top Trump administration officials say they’re concerned the administration misled them about how it would use voter data collected from their states.
The letter, dated Tuesday, is addressed to Pam Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, and Kristi Noem, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Justice, overseen by Bondi, in recent months has demanded voter information from numerous states. The information would allow the DOJ to evaluate state compliance with federal voting laws, department officials had said.
But federal officials later acknowledged that the DOJ shared voter roll information with Homeland Security to search it for noncitizens as a way to “scrub aliens from voter rolls.”
The secretaries in their letter express “immense concern” about how the information is being shared, and they “seek clarity on whether DOJ and DHS actively misled election officials regarding the uses of voter data.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The letter is signed by Colorado’s Jena Griswold as well as Adrian Fontes of Arizona, Shirley Weber of California, Shenna Bellows of Maine, Steve Simon of Minnesota, Francisco Aguilar of Nevada, Maggie Toulouse Oliver of New Mexico, Tobias Read of Oregon, Sarah Copeland Hanzas of Vermont, and Steve Hobbs of Washington.
The secretaries fear Trump officials could misuse the information.
“Is the administration collecting in an unprecedented way mass voter data and dumping it into an untested, unverified federal system to spread voter disinformation — disinformation to undermine our elections?” Griswold said in an interview with Newsline.
DHS operates Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, which can identify the citizenship status of a person. The system can be prone to errors.
“We would like to know what the Trump administration is doing with voter data, and I am proud to stand with nine other secretaries of state to demand answers and accountability,” Griswold said. “We ultimately would like to know what the Trump administration is doing and whether they’re taking appropriate steps required under the law to protect voter information.”
The secretaries of state met with senior DOJ and DHS officials twice, on Aug. 28 and Sept. 11, according to the letter. A DOJ official during the first meeting told the secretaries the department intended to use voter data “to assess compliance with the voter list maintenance provisions of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) and the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA).”
On Sept. 11, Heather Honey, an election conspiracist who is a Homeland Security “election integrity” official, told the secretaries the department had not requested voter data and had no intention of using it, the letter says.
“The same day, DHS publicly contradicted her representation and confirmed that they had received this data and would input it into the unproven and potentially insecure citizenship-check system, SAVE,” the letter says.
The secretaries request details on the sharing of voter data between federal agencies, the security of the information, and contradictory statements by federal officials. They request a response by Dec. 1.
Sweeping requests for information
The DOJ has sent requests for voter data to at least 40 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. The request to Colorado in May was among the most sweeping — it sought “all records” related to the 2024 election, among other information.
In response, Griswold’s office supplied two copies of the state’s master voter list — one from 2022 and one from May — and one copy of the master voter history list dating from after the election in November 2024. The data includes the names of voters, their residential addresses, birth year, and, if provided by the voter, phone numbers — all public information. It does not include a voter’s social security number, driver’s license number, month and day of birth, signature or email address.
Other states, including Maine, refused to hand over any information. New Hampshire’s Republican secretary of state David Scanlan, citing a state prohibition, said he wasn’t authorized to provide the DOJ with his state’s voter roll.
Voters in Colorado are less vulnerable to misuse of their information than those in some other states, from which federal officials specifically requested sensitive information such as driver’s licenses and social security numbers, Griswold said. But the voter data requests are just one of many ways the Trump administration has “made our elections less secure,” she said.
In March, Trump issued an executive order that, though a court has blocked key parts of it, would disenfranchise millions of Americans if it were implemented, according to voter advocates. The administration has dismantled federal entities that had worked to support election security or counter foreign election disinformation. It is attempting to eliminate mail-in ballots, which are used by virtually every voter in Colorado. It is trying to free Tina Peters, the election-denying former Mesa County clerk who is serving a prison term for her role in a scheme to breach the security of her own election equipment. 
“I do think it’s very important for elected officials to stand up whenever they can,” Griswold said. “It’s all these small situations that grow on top of each other, and we can’t ignore what’s happening at large. And in this situation, I’m proud that 10 of us are coming together and saying we demand answers from Pam Bondi and Kristi Noem to shine light on whatever the Trump administration is doing with this data.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Anchorage Republican Rep. David Nelson will not run for re-election to the state House district covering Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson and Government Hill, he confirmed in a Monday phone call.
Nelson initially announced his decision on social media, saying that his choice was driven by his upcoming marriage.
“Next summer, Breanna and I will be getting married,” he wrote in the statement, “and together we’ll be focusing on the life we are building. We’ve been best friends since we met as students at UAA and have unwaveringly supported and encouraged each other as we built our careers.”
By phone, Nelson said the wedding will take place in Palmer in August.
In recent years, Nelson and Anchorage Democrat Cliff Groh have traded the state House seat that covers JBER. Nelson defeated Rep. Gabrielle LeDoux, R-Anchorage, in 2020 and served until he was defeated by Groh in 2022. Nelson defeated Groh in 2024, and Groh has already signed up to run for the seat again in 2026.
If Groh were to win the seat, it would give Democrats an additional vote in the Alaska House of Representatives, increasing the odds that a coalition majority would continue to control the House. 
A coalition of independents, Democrats and moderate Republicans has controlled the House since the 2024 election, and Nelson has been a member of the House’s 19-person Republican minority caucus. 
In the House, Nelson has been a reliable supporter of the U.S. military and has both sponsored and voted for bills intended to ease the return of veterans into civilian life. 
This year, he also sponsored a bill intended to legalize sports gambling by cellphone in Alaska. That proposal has not yet advanced.

This photo was taken Nov. 10 (Wiley Price/St. Louis American).
On May 16, a ruthless tornado tore through parts of St. Louis city, county and the Metro East. In less than 30 minutes, the storm carved a 20-mile scar across north St. Louis, flattening blocks in Fountain Park, Penrose, the Ville and Kingshighway West. Nearly 5,000 homes, churches and businesses were destroyed, with damage estimates topping $1.6 billion.
Six months later, the city is still in the midst of healing — physically and emotionally. The most powerful storm to hit in nearly a century left some neighborhoods unrecognizable. Yet amid the devastation, St. Louisans have shown remarkable strength and generosity, with thousands pitching in to deliver food, clear debris and comfort neighbors where official help lagged.
Across north St. Louis, recovery remains slow and uncertain. But stories of resilience and community continue to define the city’s long road home.
 Faith, loss and rebuilding

When the tornado struck, DeMarco Davidson, executive director of Metropolitan Congregations United, was inside Centennial Christian Church in Fountain Park. The storm reduced it to rubble, killing beloved church member Patricia Ann Penelton.
“It’s hard to believe it’s been six months,” Davidson said. “Sometimes it feels like a year ago; other times, like yesterday.”
He’s still recovering from back and hip injuries. “I was the last person to see Mrs. Pat alive,” he said. “That connection will always stay with me.”
Nine members from his home church, St. John’s UCC, dug him out of the rubble. “God is community,” Davidson said. “When I saw how people showed up, I knew I had to keep doing the work.”
That work now includes organizing food networks and faith partnerships to support families still struggling — what he calls his “survivor’s responsibility.”
A few blocks away, Larry Gray was sitting in his truck when the storm hit.
“I laid down in my truck. It only seemed to last two minutes, but when I looked up, almost everything was destroyed,” he said.
His rented home was spared demolition but suffered heavy roof damage. “If they’d gone inside, they probably would have condemned it,” he said.
The next morning, Gray fired up his grill to cook for neighbors. What began as an act of kindness became a community ritual. On cold mornings, he’s still outside with a blackened half-barrel smoker, flipping burgers and handing out free clothes and household goods.
“It wasn’t a plan,” he said. “It started with me feeding my neighbors. People started bringing more food, and it grew.”
Now, cars pull up for hot meals or to drop off donations. “It feels nice when someone comes along who doesn’t have a coat and you can give them one,” Gray said. “God put this in my hands.”
A few miles away, contractor Erion “Prop Man” Johnson launched a tiny home initiative to teach teens construction skills while building temporary housing for displaced residents.
“It showed we can do things that seem impossible,” Johnson said. “North and West St. Louis can come from this — we’re going to do it together.”
 ‘Pretty much on me’

When the tornado hit, Rochel Starling was away on a women’s retreat in Kentucky. She had an international trip planned immediately after, keeping her away for two more weeks. By the time she returned, her house was unrecognizable.
“My chimney had fallen, splitting my den in half,” she said. “My roof was gone, two trees were uprooted, every ceiling on the second floor except one had fallen in — and all the ceilings on the first floor except for two.”
Without insurance — her policy lapsed two years earlier — Starling was left to rebuild alone. “All the companies helping people, I missed them,” she said. “When I came back, it was pretty much on me.”
Her late grandfather had restored the home “room by room.” Losing it meant losing a piece of him. “The only thing to survive was his dining room table.”
ˆ
Starling scraped together what funds she could: $1,000 from her employer, $600 from the Red Cross, $1,000 from Veterans Affairs and $35,000 from FEMA. She even withdrew $25,000 from her 401(k). A family friend and contractor, Rusty Watts, helped her rebuild one room at a time — just like her grandfather did.
“He understands I’m on a budget, so we’re taking it one room at a time,” she said. “The roof is finally done, and the den is patched.”
Today, she’s staying with her grandmother, mother and daughter — four generations under one roof.
“I still can’t go to my house,” Starling said. “It’s going to be a long-term recovery, but without my parents and sister, I don’t think I would’ve survived. When I saw devastation, they saw opportunity — and reminded me it was fixable.”
Still, she worries about others. “I still see people staying in tents next to their houses,” she said. “We need to figure out somewhere for them to go before winter.”
 Filling the gap

In the storm’s aftermath, city officials urged residents not to self-deploy. Local nonprofits mobilized on their own.
Aaron Williams, president of 4theVille, was leaving Sumner High School’s graduation when the tornado struck. “I had just pulled away from our storefront on MLK 10 minutes before it hit,” he said.
By morning, the 4theVille storefront had become a command center. “I came back with a chainsaw,” Williams said. “That turned into a call for help, then people showing up asking what they could do.”
Working with Invest STL, Dream Builders for Equity, Action St. Louis and others, Williams helped distribute supplies and coordinate volunteers to stabilize homes.
“The major programs hadn’t been mobilized yet,” he said. “What was being offered was what we created — ‘we’ being the community-based and advocacy organizations.”
 The people’s response

Action St. Louis was among the first groups on the scene. Executive Director Kayla Reed said her team knew government relief would be slow.
“We knew folks would immediately need food, water, hygiene products — and help cleaning up,” she said.
Action St. Louis and ForTheCultureSTL helped compile “The People’s Response Impact Report,” documenting how residents “self-deployed” while government systems caught up. Created with the University of Missouri’s Community Innovation and Action Center, the report found nearly 90% of renters and 67% of homeowners in the hardest-hit neighborhoods were uninsured. Between May 16 and June 28, more than 10,000 volunteers cleared debris, distributed 8,000 supply packages and served 21,000 meals.
“North St. Louis is our North Star,” the report declared. “Black families deserve stability, safety and the resources to thrive.”
 Six months later

Some homes are rebuilt; many remain in ruins. In The Ville, 86-year-old Rita Henderson’s historic home — once owned by civil rights advocate Homer G. Phillips — still stands roofless, wrapped in tarp.
Her daughter, Bernetta Thornton, looks down their block on Cottage Avenue. “The neighborhood still looks the same,” she said. “But we’re hopeful. This block ain’t going anywhere.”
City leaders have committed millions of dollars in recovery aid, but rollout has been slow. Thornton worries that recovery north of Delmar Boulevard lags behind wealthier areas.
“The Central West End is back up,” she said. “Their neighborhoods don’t look raggedy like ours.”
Still, Henderson finds faith in her neighbors. “When the kids came around handing out water and saying, ‘It’s gonna be alright,’” she said, tears welling, “we had to believe them.”
As winter approaches, North St. Louis continues to rebuild — one block, one home and one heart at a time.

Though it doesn’t sound like a big deal that Culver City changed the minimum number of staircases apartment buildings must have, this obscure tweak could supercharge urban housing construction in California, supporters say.
As CalMatters’ Ben Christopher explains, nearly every other city in the U.S. requires buildings taller than three stories to have at least two staircases that are connected by a corridor. But in September, the Los Angeles County city passed an ordinance that allows complexes up to six stories tall, under certain conditions, to have only one staircase.
Some pro-housing advocates welcome the shift, arguing it not only could boost city housing construction, but it could also encourage building more attractive units that have more windows and are better lit.

Bubba Fish, the Culver City councilmember who introduced the single-stair ordinance: “This is bigger than a staircase. The vast majority of the world builds apartments this way. We are an outlier. It touches on the housing crisis, the affordability crisis.”

But despite data that found that single-stair buildings and other residential structures have both low and equal fatality rates, critics say the rule change is dangerous because it gives occupants one fewer means of escape during a fire or other emergency.

Sean DeCrane, with the International Association of Fire Fighters union: “What if something happens and that one stairwell is blocked?”

Regardless of the concerns, Culver City is moving ahead with its new standard. It will also likely be the last California city to do so for some time: Legislators passed a law this summer to freeze changes to local building codes through at least 2031. The city passed its ordinance before the law went into effect, giving itself six years to show California how effective this new policy could be.

From CalMatters visual editor Miguel Gutierrez Jr.:
The visuals team at CalMatters understands the power that photography brings to our reporting. This week, we’re highlighting five photos that show exactly why. 
In the photo above by Jungho Kim, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s profile is illuminated by a distant light, as he addresses supporters after the passage of Proposition 50. The frame is clean and simple and the governor is the focus of this victory lap.
In the first photo below, Jules Hotz captures the intimacy and privacy of voting. She places herself low and uses the empty voting booths to layer the frame. The focus is solely on the voter and their right to cast a secret ballot, a core value of the U.S. 
Next, photographer Fred Greaves takes us underwater for a rare glimpse of the invasive golden mussel. The mussels are clustered on a submerged object and a distorted reflection is visible above. 
In the third photo, taken by me, former Newsom aide Dana Williamson is surrounded by the press as she leaves the federal courthouse in Sacramento. The image captures the frenzy of the moment, as Williamson walks to a waiting vehicle.
Lastly, National Guard troops sort produce at an L.A. County food bank. The slightly tilted image gives a sense of motion and urgency. The red bell peppers stand out against the muted browns of the boxes and the troops’ uniforms.

UC, union still at odds


University of California’s service and patient care workers strike at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento on Feb. 26, 2025. Photo by Penny Collins, Reuters




The union representing 37,000 custodians, hospital technicians, food service workers and other staff at the University of California are wrapping up their two-day strike today.
After 16 months of negotiations, AFSCME Local 3299 is striking for higher wages, better staffing management and housing benefits. Locations for the walkoff include nine universities across the state and nine UC medical centers.
The university system said in a statement that the union has not “presented any substantive counterproposals since April 2025,” and that the UC in June began implementing some provisions of its most recent offer, including a $25 hourly minimum wage.
Union members from the California Nurses Association and the University Professional and Technical Employees were expected to also strike Monday with AFSCME, but both unions reached tentative agreements with the UC last week. As a result, the university system averted a much larger strike that would have totaled more than 80,000 workers. 



And lastly: Sober housing and HOA fines

Newsom vetoed a bill in October that would have let cities and counties spend up to 10% of state homelessness funds on recovery housing, where people live in a sober environment.

His murder, not long after the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, sparked nationwide protests. Millions of Americans marched in communities across the country while diverse leaders from across sectors turned their attention and influence towards issues of racial inequality. 
Support for the Black Lives Matter movement was at an all-time high as Black, Latino, and Asian American communities marked a period of significant progress. In Massachusetts, the Legislature passed a version of police reform, while the City of Boston declared racism a public health crisis and incorporated fair housing standards into city planning. Meanwhile, a diverse cross-section of corporate leaders founded the New Commonwealth Fund, raising nearly $50 million for frontline nonprofits. 
It appeared that the country was on the cusp of lasting change when it comes to race relations. 
Five years later, however, the landscape is starkly different. The share of Americans who express support for the Black Lives Matter movement has lessened across all demographics, dropping by an average of 15 percentage points within the Asian and Latino communities. 
Even before President Trump signed an executive order eliminating DEI policies in the federal government, commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts had begun to be scaled back. The teaching of critical race theory in schools has been undermined under pressure from the federal government, while voter suppression measures, which disproportionately affect minority voters, have been passed in states like Georgia and North Carolina. These federal policies, and numerous others, have erased many of our communities’ gains from the past five years. 
Additionally, the cruelty of the Trump administration and its insistence on separating families, hunting people, criminalizing their existence, and mass detention of immigrants has been reserved for immigrants of color — reminiscent of Jim Crow’s cruelty and legal structure. To add insult to injury, the Trump administration’s granting of refugee status to White Afrikaaners underscored its disdain for our communities. 
Sadly, this is not surprising. Since post-Civil War Reconstruction, history is patterned with this type of racial progress followed by backlash and retrenchment led by those benefiting from the status quo. 
While disheartening, this moment offers our diverse communities an invaluable opportunity to work together to maintain, and if possible, regain progress that was made in the aftermath of what was considered a pivotal event. Diverse communities have a long history of allyship to advance social change. 
From the alliance between Latino and Filipino farmworkers during the farmworkers strike of 1965 to cross-community solidarity during the Civil Rights Movement, many of the victories we have won, from voting rights to education, have been a result of our shared campaigns. 
Building on these while sustaining authentic coalitions, however, is an ongoing challenge. Discord between our communities often arises from lack of education, resulting in a lack of empathy regarding our shared historical experiences, hindering trust and cooperation. Additionally, even well-intentioned communities and organizations often slip into a scarcity, siloed mentality, particularly during times of crisis, 
Recent events have highlighted these potential divisions. 
While the majority of communities of color voted for Kamala Harris, the support for Donald Trump by a large percentage of the Latino community left many in the Black community, especially Black women, feeling betrayed. The Supreme Court ruling in Students for Fair Admission v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, which effectively prohibits the consideration of race and ethnicity as factors in college admissions, was organized by conservative activist Edward Blum, who recruited and enlisted Asian American students and parents as part of his decades-long efforts to overturn affirmative action. 
To be accurate, recent polls and studies have shown that Asian Americans, Blacks, and Latinx communities are very much aligned in their views towards affirmative action, diversity efforts, and even police reform. However, the optics surrounding each of those issues has reopened long-simmering perceptions that our communities are often on opposite sides of issues of diversity and racial justice, and that our goals and interests are often not in allyship with each other. 
If our communities do not approach this moment of crisis with a sense of unity, these issues have the potential to create irreparable schisms between us. We need to recruit, educate, and empower allies across all demographic lines as we work to preserve, protect, and grow our multi-racial, multi-ethnic democracy. 
Massachusetts, in particular, has demonstrated this potential time and again. During COVID-19, we witnessed unprecedented collaboration as diverse communities allied with health care workers, labor unions, public officials, small business owners, and corporate leaders to save lives. Innovative funding mechanisms were spawned, including the Asian Community Fund and the Coalition for an Equitable Economy, both of which mobilized millions of dollars in funding and grants for small businesses and community organizations. 
More recently, a multi-ethnic coalition of non-profit organizations, educators, health care professionals, and legislators helped pass legislation calling for data disaggregation to collect data broken down into specific ethnic subgroups within our diverse communities, helping policymakers, community organizations and businesses better understand our needs and challenges. The Dorchester Not for Sale effort brought a multi-racial, multi-generational, and multi-organizational allyship together in an effort to prevent gentrification and change that neighborhood’s development process. 
We should continue to utilize these collaborative, community-led, multi-sector models to develop solutions that address wealth inequality, protect democracy, and expand opportunity. 
This fight for equality will be ongoing and intergenerational. Thus, much of our effort must also focus on our next generation of leaders to give them the knowledge, funding, and tools required to move these efforts forward. Equity in educational opportunities will offer level playing fields and more thorough historical perspectives. 
The movement for educational equity offers a special opportunity for multi-generational and cross-racial organizing, both in K-12 and higher education. Passing legislation similar to Minnesota’s ethnic studies mandate as a model can help ensure all Massachusetts elementary and secondary school students learn about our shared histories of successes, struggles, and losses. 
In higher education, the movement to end legacy preferences unites unions, students of all colors, and working-class white students. Legacy admissions is a practice originating in the 1920s that grants preferential treatment to applicants based on the fact that an applicant’s parents, grandparents, or siblings attended the same college or university – a practice that disproportionately impacts non-white communities negatively.  
Getting rid of legacy admissions is widely supported across the country by both Democrats and Republicans, and by three-quarters of all Americans. Colorado and California have both banned the use of legacy preferences by public universities. It’s time Massachusetts took it a step further to ban this practice at both private and public institutions by passing “An Act Relative to Equitable Higher Education Admission Policies”. 
We can also accelerate pipelines for future community leaders by promoting and investing in programs similar to The Coalition for Anti-Racism and Equity’s and Commonwealth Seminar’s “Leadership Next Gen” initiative, which provides paid fellowships and a program offering classroom training and real-life experience in community-based organizations and legislative offices.  
We must empower our next generation of entrepreneurs and investors by creating new funding streams prioritizing investments in diverse communities. Partnering with community development financial institutions like Boston Impact Initiative, alongside diverse venture capital firms like BLCK VC, A2C-Boston, and Visible Hands, will ensure that catalytic capital flows to our start-ups and entrepreneurs. 
Now more than ever, embracing intersectional, multi-racial solidarity is essential because all our interests are interconnected. Our current state of affairs offers an invaluable opportunity for people in the Black, Indigenous, Asian, and Latino (often referred to as BIPOC) communities to engage in dialogue, allyships, and creative, intersectional action to ensure more diverse pipelines to academic, professional, and economic resources and to build and strengthen relationships between our communities. 
We need to champion an abundance mindset and one that is rooted in collaboration and empowering our next generation of leaders as we double down in our efforts to protect and fearlessly advance diversity, equity, and inclusion as a vital tool to build the equitable society we envision.

Anonymous sources told NBC News a “growing frustration with the pace of daily arrests” among President Donald Trump’s top aids has prompted the internal shakeup. 
Once complete, Border Patrol’s power grab of its sister agency will likely mark a dramatic shift in how immigration agents conduct enforcement operations.  Don’t expect improvements.
People who live in California’s southern borderlands have experienced decades of the Border Patrol’s unaccountable antics. Californians should be concerned that this culture of impunity and wide scale fascination with cruelty will drive a new phase of immigration raids.
Los Angeles and surrounding Southern California counties have endured a relentless onslaught of Border Patrol raids. Agents have indiscriminately targeted working people at car washes, home improvement store parking lots and bus stops, where arrest warrants are not required.  
Community members are documenting daily incidents on social media of pervasive violations of the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.  But Border Patrol agents leading the most egregious enforcement actions often are misidentified as ICE officials.
ICE and Border Patrol, different yet similar
Both ICE and Border Patrol immigration raids have been ruthless. Though not always the case, ICE officials rely on investigations to target people for arrest. They have warrants guiding their operations. 
Border Patrol agents, on the other hand, capitalize on dubious interpretations of “articulable facts” to racially profile people, and sometimes this means targeting a lot of people at once.
The Supreme Court now agrees with this misguided logic — so if you fit a racial profile, consider yourself a target. 
Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego, has worked to hold the parent agency of Border Patrol — Customs and Border Protection —  accountable. She is concerned about the possible leadership change.
 “The gap between what Border Patrol does and what is humane, safe and effective law enforcement is so vast that it is unfathomable that the most abusive, unaccountable agency would be asked to step up and lead another, she said.  
Border Patrol’s violence is part of the international record. In a landmark case decided in April, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights held the United States responsible for the 2010 extrajudicial torture and killing of Anastasio Hernández Rojas, a longtime San Diego resident who emigrated from Mexico. 
Hernandez Rojas was a construction worker and father of five who immigration agents were transporting to the border. The commission found that more than a dozen Border Patrol and ICE agents assaulted Hernandez Rojas, tasering him multiple times, punching and kicking him while he was restrained, in view of dozens of border crossers. He arrived at a hospital brain dead. 
Later the Border Patrol used a “shadow unit” to alter, conceal and destroy evidence of the encounter.
In June Congress confirmed Rodney Scott as Customs and Border Protection’s newest commissioner. Scott had a senior supervisorial role for the Border Patrol’s San Diego Sector in 2010.
At the confirmation hearing, Scott implicated himself in the attempted cover-up of Hernandez Rojas’ death by admitting he signed an administrative subpoena to acquire Hernandez Rojas’ medical records. It is unlawful to intrude into an active investigation, but Scott said he wanted to gather evidence on Hernandez Rojas and this was “standard procedure.”
Hernandez Rojas had hoped for a better future for his children, said his widow, Maria Puga. She believes that Border Patrol officials commanding ICE agents will lead to more aggressive arrests. 
“My family is forever devastated by what they did to Anastasio, and I am worried about our families and our loved ones,” she said. “And just like what happened to my husband, when Border Patrol uses violence, there are never charges against them; there is only impunity.”

Puga is correct in her assessment. Despite hundreds of documented cases of serious abusive practices, not a single Border Patrol agent has been charged for criminal wrongdoing while on duty.
Trump classified Customs and Border Protection as a “security agency” during his first term, allowing  Border Patrol agents to enjoy greater protection from public disclosures should they be involved in malfeasance or misconduct. 
Hundreds of deaths, no prosecutions
A group of nonprofits called the Southern Border Communities Coalition has compiled 351 incidents since 2010 where Border Patrol and other Customs and Border Protection components were involved in fatal, violent encounters, with no accountability. 
These include when Border Patrol agents fatally shot a child multiple times in the back —the child was in Mexico— and when an agent fatally shot a U.S. citizen, a mother, in Chula Vista, and when agents intentionally rammed their patrol vessel into a boat, causing a migrant woman to drown off the coast of Encinitas, in San Diego County. 
More recently, Border Patrol agents chased 52-year-old Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdés of Guatemala from a Home Depot parking lot in Monrovia on August 14. He was struck by a vehicle and died.
The Border Patrol’s militaristic approach to enforcement has been endemic to border communities. The agents revel in the infrastructure of militarization, from the 30-foot-high border walls to the razor sharp, concertina wire that once was characterized as  “a new way of thinking about border security in San Diego.”
Militarizing interior communities — or the “borderfication” of the country, as Guerrero calls it — is what Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector Chief Gregory Bovino has been doing in Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities.
Bovino is the face of Trump’s violent raids, and he’s one of the persons charged with overhauling the ICE district offices, which will include San Diego and Los Angeles. He did not respond to requests for comment about enforcement strategies of Border Patrol agents.
Unprofessional and undisciplined
A former Customs and Border Protection commissioner was more forthcoming. Gil Kerlikowske, who was the commissioner from 2014 to 2017, expressed misgivings about Border Patrol’s ability to operate in urban settings, especially as more people protest their presence. 
He suggested Border Patrol agents under Bovino are undisciplined and unprofessional, and that Bovino encourages excessive force against protesters.
“The Border Patrol agents under his leadership come out in a ragtag ambling fashion,” Kerlikowske told a WBEZ reporter in Chicago, referring to Bovino’s leadership. “The direction to the agents at one point was, ‘Light them up,’ meaning they could strike people with pepper balls. I also saw agents picking people up, body slamming them to the concrete and walking away.”
A new study found Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector under Bovino had a higher ratio of use of force incidents to assaults on agents than any other Border Patrol Sector, from fiscal 2022 to 2025, according to the Project on Government Oversight and American University’s Investigative Reporting Workshop.
With more than $170 billion dollars designated for immigration and border projects in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill signed in July, including $45 billion for detention and nearly $30 billion to augment ICE activities, we can expect an expansion of egregious abuses —  and a lack of accountability, opaqueness, and zero oversight.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/060524-Mexico-California-Border-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-18 08:56:23.028229

(Photo from Kevin Steele for CFO website)Pasco County Republican House member Kevin Steele announced Tuesday that he is running for Florida chief financial officer (CFO), setting up a contested Republican primary election against incumbent Blaise Ingoglia next year.
In a press release, Steele said he hopes to address the affordability crisis afflicting Floridians and “the pressing need to reign in spending and reduce waste across all levels of government.”
“Florida families deserve a CFO who will run our state like a winning business — smart, tough, and with zero tolerance for waste and corruption,” he said.
“As CFO, I will fight to safeguard every hard-earned tax dollar, protect consumers, and hold state government accountable to the people. I’ve spent my career building companies from the ground up, fixing broken systems, and getting results. I’ll bring that same America First, results-driven mindset to protect taxpayers and make Florida more affordable and stronger than ever.”
Florida U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is endorsing Steele.
“Kevin Steele is a proven leader and a true conservative who knows how to get results,” Scott said in the same press release announcing Steele’s candidacy.
Steele is the wealthiest man in the Florida Legislature. First elected in 2022 and re-elected last year, he reported his net worth at more than $307 million in his 2024 financial disclosure forms. Steele founded the Tampa software company DataLink Software in 2001 and retired from the company in 2022.
Among the bills he has filed for this legislative session is a measure (HB 113) that would require all state university and Florida College System institution board of trustees to rename specific roads or portions of roads after Charlie Kirk. If those institutions decline to do so, Steele’s bill calls for state funds to be withheld.
He’s also filed a resolution for a constitutional amendment (HJR 201) that would eliminate property taxes on homesteaded property.
Divided party?
In taking on Ingoglia, appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis to succeed Jimmy Patronis as CFO in July, Steele’s candidacy has the potential of dividing the Republican Party of Florida. When Ingoglia was appointed in the summer, he was expected to run against Florida Republican state Sen. Joe Gruters, who had already been endorsed by President Donald Trump. Early polls showed Gruters crushing Ingoglia in a one-on-one contest.
However, Gruters dropped out in August after he was selected to lead the Republican National Committee.
Ingoglia, meanwhile, has received media attention as he travels around the state accusing local governments of engaging in “wasteful and excessive spending,” in a low-level campaign for a proposed constitutional amendment on property taxes in 2026 that has yet to be written.
There has been speculation that Trump will endorse Steele, but that remains to be seen.
No Democrat has filed to run in the contest, according to the Florida Division of Elections website.

For the 2024-25 school year, overall English Language Arts (ELA) proficiency was 56.18%, up from 52.8% in 2023-24. Overall math proficiency for last school year was 33.37%, up over  the 31.15% in 2023-24.
Black and Hispanic students saw increases in these subjects as well.
In ELA, the percentage of Hispanic students graded proficient increased from 40.56% in the 2023-24 year to 44.18% for the 2024-25 academic year. Black students saw their proficiency increase from 36.59% to 40.17% in the same time frame.
In math, 16.34% of Black students were proficient in the 2024-25 year, up from 14.47% in 2023-24. Hispanic students’ proficiency improved from 20.67% to 23.75%
Orr credited the gains to the Literacy Act, passed in 2019, and the Numeracy Act, passed in 2022. Both laws create additional resources for reading and math instruction in elementary school grades. 
“We put in hard stops with the fifth grade for math and third grade for literacy, which brought a whole lot of attention on the early grades in elementary school to help support these students and get them where they need to be in making the additional investments we’ve concentrated on pull-out sessions after school hours,” he said.
Science proficiency saw a slight decrease in the 2024-25 school year sitting at 38.91%. In the 2023-24 academic year, the overall proficiency was 39.04%.
Black students’ proficiency in science increased slightly in the subject going from 20.11% in the 2023-24 school year to 20.34% in the 2024-25 school year. Hispanic students saw a larger increase in proficiency, going from 26.13% to 27.12%.
Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, called the decrease “flat” in a phone interview Monday and said there was improvement in other areas.
“So certainly there’ll be an area of focus going forward, but we’re pleased with the continuous progress we’re seeing in the federal scores,” he said.
Proficiency is measured by taking data from the Alabama Comprehensive Assessment Program (ACAP). Students are placed into four levels, level one being the lowest and level four being the highest. In order to be considered proficient, students have to rank in level three or four.
On ELA, the state saw 120,173 students in level three (32%) and 90,791 students in level four (24.18%). In level three, 34,057 were Black students and 12,783 were Hispanic. In level four, 13,885 students were Black and 6,609 were Hispanic.
Math and science saw fewer  students ranking as proficient. Only 90,921 of students (23.98%) placed in level three for math and 50,246 students (31.20%) placed in that same level for science. 153,403 (40.46%) students ranked in level two for math and 65,360 (40.59%) ranked in level two for science.
Garrett said legislation including the RAISE Act, which gives additional funding to public K-12 schools to students’ address educational needs; TEAMS Act, which offers eligible math and science teachers up to $20,000 for teaching math and science if eligible.
“We should see continued improvement in those areas of student need, but the goal is, you know, to get everybody proficient. But there’s four levels of proficiency, and rarely do you go from level four to level one, but you work your way up. And that’s what we’re seeing,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9549-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 08:56:23.028229

(Photo: Nevada Immigrant Coalition)Federal immigration enforcement in Nevada wasn’t an issue listed on Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s formal proclamation announcing a special session last week. But the issue made its way to one legislative chamber anyway, in the form of an initiative from Democratic Assembly leaders that was unequivocally rejected by their Democratic colleagues in the Latino Legislative Caucus.
Assembly Concurrent Resolution 5 would order a legislative study on immigration enforcement operations in the state. It is not expected to be heard or passed, and behind the scenes became a flashpoint for advocates and lawmakers who wanted to see more done to safeguard immigrant families in the wake of large-scale immigration sweeps.
Resolutions are non-binding and do not require the governor’s signature for approval.
Members of the Nevada Latino Legislative Caucus said the resolution was proposed by Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas) and Majority Leader Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas) as a compromise solution without input from the caucus.
“We let them know that we’re not going to be supporting it if it makes it to the floor,” said Assemblymember Selena Torres-Fossett (D-Las Vegas). “The Latino Legislative Caucus is not supportive of any policy that’s gonna do nothing.”
The Latino Legislative Caucus introduced several bills during the 2025 regular session that could provide immigrant communities some sense of security, including Assembly Bill 217 which would have limited the access of immigration officials to school grounds and records without a court order or warrant. That bill was vetoed by Lombardo.
“The Latino Legislative Caucus has consistently been saying that we need to do something that impacts immigrant families, especially with what’s going on in our state and across the country,” Torres-Fossett said.
Advocates echoed those concerns. Noé Orosco with the Nevada Immigrant Coalition argued a study “would not produce anything that is not already known now, which is that our families are being terrorized.”
Orosco said the coalition reached out to Yeager and Jauregui to emphasize their top priorities, which did not include a study. 
The coalition urged lawmakers to instead ban U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from wearing face coverings, limit ICE enforcement in sensitive locations such as schools, and prohibit state and local agencies from sharing personal data with ICE.
On Sunday, Yeager said the Assembly no longer planned to hold a hearing for the resolution, which was referred to the Assembly Committee on Health and Wellness on the first day of the special session.
“Advocates didn’t want it,” Yeager said.
“It’s a slap in the face of the immigrant community, ” said Assemblymember Cinthia Zermeño Moore (D-Las Vegas) of the resolution. “We do not need to study immigration issues. We need to act.”
Dissatisfaction over the lack of safeguards in Nevada for immigrant communities carried over to Lombardo’s signature crime bill. The crime bill passed the Assembly Sunday on a 31-11 vote – six fewer votes than when it was first considered during the 2025 regular session. 
Several Democrats who peeled away cited the lack of safeguards for immigrants in the bill as a major factor for the switch. Reuben D’Silva (D-Las Vegas), who voted for the previous version of the bill, said he was concerned punitive measures in the bill could put a bigger target on immigrants in the state.
“Just seeing the aggressive nature of the federal government going after immigrants, I think this could have opened up an avenue for folks to get caught up in the system and get deported,” D’Silva said. “I’m a formally undocumented person. I represent a district that is heavily immigrant and I just could not morally come to a yes vote again.”
Lawmakers and advocates repeatedly called for the inclusion of two amendments submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada to the crime bill. The amendments would have required the investigation of individuals acting as law enforcement who detain, remove, or restrain people without identifying themselves and prevented the construction of immigration detention centers without legislative approval.
“It’s not just an immigration issue, it’s a public safety issue,” said Moore, who supported the amendments on the Assembly floor.
“I don’t think it’s too much to ask. They were reasonable, and I just feel like it was a missed opportunity to provide more guardrails for our community as a whole,” Moore said. 
Independent of that, Torres-Fossett spearheaded an amendment that would require the consulate to be notified of an arrest. The amendment was adopted but later withdrawn.
Torres-Fossett said she pulled it because she needed more time to work on the language and plans on bringing back the issue during the next regular session.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC04179-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-11-18 08:56:23.028229

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Despite recent predictions that lawmakers could be facing a $1.5 billion budget deficit when they convene Jan. 14 for the 2026 General Assembly, a new report says Maryland must invest in reading instruction.
The report, released Tuesday by the nonprofit organization Maryland READS, expands on an April report by the same group that called on state lawmakers, business and community leaders to come together to improve literacy.
Despite the state’s ongoing budget difficulties, funding literacy programs is worth the investment, said Trish Brennan-Gac, executive director of Maryland READS, or Reading Education Aligned to Data and Science.
“In a budget deficit, we’ve got to look really hard look at investing in things that work [and] that are going to get us results,” Brennan-Gac said in an interview Monday. “The more that our high school graduates can leave high school with the ability to read proficiently, it’s a better educated workforce that’s available to businesses in our state. Reading impacts a lot of other things.”
The new report, “What are the Stories Behind the Scores?” includes data from test results students took this spring from the Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program. While that program saw a third straight year of language arts increases, test results showed that significant gaps remain between demographic groups.
The report highlights one major stat, that more than 94,000 students in fourth, eighth and 10th grades were not reading at a proficient level in the latest round of testing.
“Clearly, maintaining the status quo is not an option,” the report said.
Maryland schools make slight gains on annual report card, but rating system could be changed

The report does highlight three school districts – Charles, Dorchester and Howard counties – that saw some of the biggest improvements in MCAP literacy scores in the state. Summaries are noted on what they did to boost student achievement.
A more detailed explanation of how they did it will be provided by officials from each of those three districts at the Maryland READS third annual convening at Maple Springs Baptist Church in Prince George’s County on Dec. 8. The state’s two top school officials – State Superintendent Carey Wright and state Board of Education President Joshua Michael – are scheduled to attend that meeting, along with Del. Jared Solomon (D-Montgomery), a legislative leader on early childhood education.
The Maryland READS report recommends three strategies to improve literacy: greater transparency; funding for a “coaching program” that was approved as part of the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act this year; and ensuring universities properly train future teachers to be “prepared to deliver effective reading instruction from day one.”
The report also notes improvements in average daily attendance and chronic absenteeism at community schools — those schools with high numbers of students who receive free and reduced-price meals, among various other services. State Department of Education data show 617 schools received that designation in the 2024-25 school year, compared to 453 schools two years ago.
The report said average daily attendance in community schools improved from 91% in the 2020-21 school year to about 96% in the 2023-24 school year. At other schools in the state during that same time period, daily attendance fell from 95% to 93%.
Chronic absenteeism in community schools fell, the report said, from about 30% in 2020-21 to around 25% in 2023-24. During that same timeframe in the other schools, absenteeism rose from about 15% to 25%. The state defines chronic absenteeism as when a student misses at least 10%, or about 18 days during a school year.
The state wants to decrease chronic absenteeism in all schools to 15% during this school year.
Community schools are part of the 10-year Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan. On the last day of this year’s session, the legislature approved a trim to the Blueprint plan that preserved funding for community schools.
“It shows that the community schools, with this Blueprint investment, have made progress in the area of attendance,” Brennan-Gac said. “The idea is that the more kids are in school, they’re going to learn. If they’re not in school, they’re not going to learn.”

“I was on the prevention and treatment subcommittee that gave a very high score to the Department of Health project,” Taggart told the council members. The agency asked for about $5 million to expand addiction treatment in rural areas. 
Taggart and his subcommittee colleagues scored the application one tier below the proposals most highly recommended to be funded. He seemed surprised to learn it wasn’t in the highest category.
“Maybe it is Tier 2,” Taggart said. “I gave you a high score, Dr. Edney.” 
“Thank you,” Edney responded as other council members burst into laughter – the type of jesting common among people who work closely together. Knowing that the tiers and project recommendations were yet to be finalized, Taggart continued. 
“My question is, can you help us better understand it?” he asked Edney. “I was impressed, because I knew the heart of what was intended. But I don’t know the mechanics of what was intended.”
Edney obliged, and went into further details about the project. 
The opportunity to explain his application demonstrates one of the advantages of being an opioid settlement council member who represents an organization requesting part of the settlement money. 
Just one floor below where the state’s most difficult legal questions are argued in front of state Supreme Court justices, multiple council members who represent opioid settlement applicants used time to further explain why proposals they closely work with deserved funding.

Those opportunities weren’t extended to applicants who didn’t have council representation, at least at the Nov. 3 meeting. 
“That’s problematic,” Greg Spore, a state public defender and opioid settlement council member, said after the meeting. “Who’s lobbying for them?” 
Of the roughly $142 million requested from applications scored in the top two tiers, over $94 million was sought by organizations with representatives who serve on the council. 
When asked after the meeting about his back-and-forth with Taggart, Edney said he was not and will not be involved in scoring his department’s opioid settlement applications. 
“I was answering questions that were posed to me,” he told Mississippi Today. 
Taggart, who has for decades been involved in state Republican politics, said he deferred all public comments related to the council to its chair and vice-chairs — Attorney General Lynn Fitch, Department of Mental Health Executive Director Wendy Bailey, and Edney. Fitch’s office declined to speak on behalf of Taggart, and Edney and Bailey didn’t respond to Taggart’s email. 

Each year since 2022, Mississippi has been paid tens of millions of opioid settlement dollars, money that is supposed to help respond to the overdose public health crisis. But 15% of those dollars — the money controlled by the state’s towns, cities and counties — is unrestricted and being spent with almost no public knowledge. Mississippi Today spent the summer finding out how almost every local government receiving money has been managing the money over the past three years.Read The Series

The council, only a few months old, adopted a rule over the summer that prevents its members from voting on applications they’re closely associated with. But Matthew Steffey, a Mississippi College School of Law professor, said members have other avenues to lobby for projects they consider important. 
Adopting rules that prohibit applicants from voting on their own applications is the absolute minimum ethical standard, Steffey said. It would be stronger, he said, to require applicants to leave the room whenever their applications are being discussed by the council.
“Most of the persuasion happens before the vote,” Steffey said. 
Michelle Williams, Fitch’s chief of staff, said in an email to Mississippi Today that the council is made up of leaders from a variety of backgrounds related to addressing substance use disorder. 
“These are also the people who may be best able to use the funds to continue their work responding to the opioid crisis for Mississippi and it would disadvantage the State’s response to prohibit them from applying,” Williams wrote.

She added that many council members sought clarification from applicants throughout the review process, but she did not provide examples. Neither Fitch nor Williams answered Mississippi Today’s question asking whether the attorney general believes the council needs stronger rules on ethics. 
Edney said he can’t speak to whether the process has been fair to applicants who don’t have council representation. Bailey echoed Williams’ sentiment in an email, saying it was always likely that council members would also be applicants. 
Two of the Department of Mental Health’s three opioid settlement applications received the highest grades of the 126 proposals. Bailey said she is always open to reviewing and strengthening procedures to improve the council’s fairness and public confidence.
“We all share the same commitment to accountability and integrity in how these funds are allocated,” she said.

The council is set to meet again on Dec. 2, and members are expected to further discuss the applications ranked in the top two tiers and other applications the council flagged at the last meeting. The group is required by state law to finalize recommendations for the Legislature by Dec. 7 — 30 days before the start of 2026 regular legislative session. 
Spore, the public defender, said he wishes many applicants ranked in lower tiers could further explain their proposals to the council so they could share why their aims are important and unique. 
One of them was Grace House in Jackson, which offers affordable sober living as women recover from addictions. Spore said when he worked for the Hinds County Public Defender’s Office, one of his clients entered the program as a condition of receiving probation. 
“She completed the program there, and she was thriving,” he said. 
Grace House applied for $600,000 to create more treatment options for women who’ve recently finished intensive addiction rehabilitation. Stacey Howard, its executive director, said many Jackson-area programs that provided these services have shuttered in recent years because of funding challenges.
The council scored Grace House’s application in the third tier, and the proposal is unlikely to be discussed at the next meeting. Howard said she has received no information about why her organization received the grade it did. 
Because the secondary program was aimed at people without health insurance, she thinks a rejected grant proposal would be a loss for the most financially vulnerable Mississippians.
“If you’ve got money, then you can afford to go places, even out of state if you need to, to get treatment,” Howard said.
Brittany Denson, the sober living home’s operations coordinator and former Grace House participant, said on-the-ground organizations like hers have important knowledge on the prevention, treatment and recovery needs — information the Department of Mental Health has said the state doesn’t have a comprehensive handle on. The settlement money could be an opportunity to further act on that knowledge.

But she hasn’t seen Mississippi fund these types of efforts in the past, which makes her skeptical of the council’s aims. 
“Of course, it’s unfair,” she said. “But that’s expected.”
‘We all have to have well-established practice’
Last spring, the Legislature instructed the settlement council to establish its members, solicit and review grant proposals and recommend to lawmakers which applications should be funded – all in the span of eight months. After multiple delays this summer, ranging from missing application materials to a cybersecurity hack, the committee released its application in August. 
Groups had six weeks to read grant materials, develop an idea and fill out the application. Stacey Riley, chief executive officer for the Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence, said the timeline felt rushed. 
The center has a vending machine for naloxone, the opioid overdose-reversing medication, and works to address addiction among survivors of domestic violence. The application Riley submitted proposed a partnership between her organization and four others that serve South Mississippi communities — one that would expand trauma-informed addiction treatment, address other basic needs of those struggling with substance use disorder and work to address community stigma about drug use. 
The application had a typo that resulted in final miscalculations of annual costs and total requests. But the two lines above the final calculation show the correct cost amount, according to a Mississippi Today review. 
When the council released application grades a few hours before the Nov. 3 meeting, Riley found her proposal listed under “Incomplete Proposals.” The council’s document said the application had “facial deficiencies in the project budget.”
In a recent email to the council members, Fitch’s office said the application’s miscalculated budget figures is the reason why the Gulf Coast Center’s is listed as incomplete. 
Riley said that if she had the opportunity to ask the committee questions about the review of her application, she would have. But the center doesn’t have a representative on the council. 
The Administrative Office of Courts, however, did have a representative who could clarify its request for roughly $61 million to provide more financial assistance for its drug courts — the most money any applicant asked for. Fitch, Bailey and Edney reviewed that application and scored it in the second-highest tier, recommending only partial funding.
Early in the first November meeting, Mississippi Supreme Court Chief Justice and council member Michael Randolph said he and the other judges didn’t score the Administrative Office of Courts’ application.

But he told the other members he was concerned about that application being scored below other applicants. He said he thought nearly no other applicants had as much hands-on time addressing substance use disorder as drug court employees.
“And yet they’re in Tier 2,” he said.
Minutes later, Taggart said he would like to see the courts’ application moved to the highest tier. Shortly after, Randolph called on the courts office’s director of intervention and treatment courts, Pam Holmes, from the audience to clarify council members’ questions. 
“That’s not how funding decisions are supposed to be made,” Riley said when asked about the interaction. “We all have to have well-established practices that we do not engage in anything that even looks like a conflict of interest.”
After the meeting, Randolph told Mississippi Today that making sure these funds are spent appropriately is important to him, and it’s hard to know whether that will happen years down the line if private nonprofits get money. He said that won’t happen with the drug court application because of strict judicial oversight. 
He also cited a pamphlet produced by the state judiciary office that says such courts have saved Mississippi taxpayers nearly $1.8 billion over 20 years, mostly by diverting people from prisons and jails. 
“Any money that runs through the drug court is accounted for because we control it,” Randolph said. 
Randolph also said not every council member pitched their proposal. Hattiesburg recovery advocate James Moore, whose son Jeffery died of an overdose, worked on a roughly $86,000 application to help fund and improve the weekly bike rides he hosts for those in addiction recovery. It scored in the second-lowest tier. 
After the meeting, Moore said his application was so far down the list that he didn’t know whether bringing it up would have made a difference. But he also said it didn’t feel right to make an argument for his project when other organizations in similar situations didn’t have that opportunity.

That decision could be costly. Moore said the account that funds his recovery rides and other efforts to prevent overdoses in the Pine Belt region, named in Jeffery’s honor, doesn’t have enough money to do much in the immediate future. 
“I was asking for such a very small percentage of what’s available compared to what some of the other grants were seeking,” he said. “That was a little bit disheartening.”
Because Fitch allowed 30% of Mississippi opioid settlement funds to be spent on any public purpose, all of the national opioid settlement money the council oversees must be spent on one of the strategies the lawsuits list as addressing addiction. But unlike the applications from Moore, Grace House and Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence, some proposals that will be further considered may not qualify. 
Two proposals in the top two tiers seek funds for automated electronic defibrillators, purchases that aren’t very effective at responding to opioid overdoses because overdoses impact the respiratory system rather than the cardiovascular system. California’s state government has said AED purchases aren’t allowed by the settlements, and Pennsylvania’s says AEDs are not considered opioid remediation except in particular circumstances.
The Yazoo County Sheriff’s Department requested around $225,000 for license plate readers, tasers and two tablets. While the settlements’ lists mention some permitted uses for law enforcement, they’re focused on officer education and connecting people to treatment. 
Fitch did not answer a question about whether she worried about Mississippi violating terms of the opioid settlement agreements. Williams reiterated that money the Legislature controls that isn’t overseen by the council can be spent on any public purpose.
In a recent email, Fitch’s office told council members that some projects that don’t qualify as addressing addiction “may be funded by the Legislature through a portion of the Fund.” But state law says money the Legislature oversees that doesn’t have to be used for addiction will be spent without recommendations from the council. 
‘Once in a multi-generation opportunity’
Nabarun Dasgupta, a University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health senior scientist and recent MacArthur “Genius Grant” fellow, has used some of his state’s opioid settlement dollars to continue his lab’s work of determining what drugs are on the street and quickly getting that information to those most at risk of overdoses.

While that work is crucial, Dasgupta said it’s just as important to make sure the communities most impacted by the opioid epidemic — many of whom staff some of the small nonprofit organizations applying for dollars — get an opportunity to use this money. Those groups of people scarred by the epidemic will often be better positioned to make strides in ending the overdose crisis than the people in suits on Mississippi’s council, Dasgupta said.
“We sitting in offices and labs aren’t going to be the ones who do the last-mile outreach to get services where they need to go,” he said.
Without hearing from and investing in these last-mile providers, Dasgupta said he worries the money will be wasted — a disservice to those who’ve been suffering.
“This is a once in a multi-generation opportunity to address a longstanding social problem,” he said.
Denson, the Grace House operations coordinator, said the accountability she learned as a resident of the sober living home was crucial for her long-term recovery. She learned to cook for herself, got a job and felt like she became a productive member of society.

Organizations like Grace House have operated without opioid settlement funding for years, and Denson said she hopes that will continue even if the Legislature doesn’t invest in them. But she thinks discounting them for politically connected groups is a missed opportunity to end the public health crisis that has permanently taken many of her friends away.

,California,2025-11-18 13:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Dana Williamson’s indictment reveals a hidden world of political operatives,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/dana-williamsons-indictment-political-operatives/,"Newsom's former chief of staff is accused of misusing campaign money, lying to get a COVID loan and calling personal purchases, like designer goods and a luxurious vacation, business expenses.","Most Californians probably see the Capitol as a place where governors, legislators and other state officials gather to do the public’s business. That’s true, at least superficially. 
Elected officeholders come and go, but the Capitol has a permanent substructure of men and women who do the real, if often hidden, business of retail politics. Those in the “community,” as some dub it, constantly circulate among its three pillars — staff on the public payroll, lobbyists for interest groups, and managers of political campaigns.
It’s not uncommon for someone to have portfolios in all three. And as the revolving door opens and closes, it’s difficult to discern when and where one role ends and another begins, or even whether there is, in fact, a difference.
Dana Williamson typifies the species. And her arrest last week on federal criminal charges opens a window into the secretive world of California’s professional political operatives.
The 23-count indictment alleges Williamson — who had been Gov. Gavin Newsom’s chief of staff until her abrupt resignation a year ago — conspired with two other figures to siphon money from a dormant political campaign fund maintained by Xavier Becerra, a former congressman, state attorney general and Biden administration cabinet member.
Williamson is also charged with falsifying documents to justify a COVID-era federal business loan, lying to FBI agents and falsely claiming income tax deductions as business expenses — for a lavish vacation and purchases of expensive designer goods.
The two men who were charged with Williamson, Sean McCluskie, Becerra’s former chief deputy in the California Department of Justice, and lobbyist Greg Campbell, have pleaded guilty. But Williamson insists that she is innocent.
It’s the juiciest scandal to hit the Capitol since the FBI’s undercover bribery investigation, dubbed “Shrimpgate,” erupted 37 years ago and sent some legislators and lobbyists to prison.
Among the Capitol’s power players, Williamson has stood near the top, working for three governors, lobbying for various interest groups and running ballot measure campaigns. She is known for a profanity-laced, take-no-prisoners style.
After Williamson was arrested, the question for many Capitol denizens was whether the case would adversely affect Becerra, who is running for governor, and Newsom, who is obviously, if not officially, running for president.
Becerra is a victim but may face questions about his judgment, since he was apparently being fleeced by those he hired.
Newsom’s office says Williamson resigned a year ago after telling him she was under investigation. At the time, he praised her as a dedicated public servant.
If there is something in the case that could harm Newsom, or at least give political rivals some ammunition, it is what happened shortly after Williamson became the governor’s top aide in 2023. According to the indictment, she used the position to intercede in a pending state discrimination suit against one of her lobbying clients, Activision Blizzard, a Santa Monica video game company, and then lied to FBI agents about the case.
In 2022 Janette Wipper, chief counsel of the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which brought the case against Activision, was fired. Her assistant, Melanie Proctor, resigned in protest, citing pressure from the governor’s office to settle the case.
Proctor wrote in a public memo that the governor’s office “repeatedly demanded advance notice of litigation strategy and next steps in the litigation” in the case, and the interference “mimicked the interests of Activision’s counsel.”
The Williamson scandal could be a one-and-done incident if her attorney negotiates a plea agreement. Or it could drag out if she insists on a trial and the dirty linen is displayed for all to see, perhaps revealing even more politically embarrassing episodes of backroom maneuvers.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/091225_End-Of-Session_FG_CM_36.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-18 08:56:23.028229

(Photo: Dana Gentry/Nevada Current)The mostly Black and Latino residents of Windsor Park may be getting closer to relocation into a geologically sound neighborhood, following the final passage of legislation Monday.
Windsor Park was among the “unfinished business” included by Gov. Joe Lombardo in the proclamation for the Nevada State Legislature’s 36th Special Session, which began Thursday.
Senate Bill 6 largely resurrects language from a bill sponsored by state Sen. Dina Neal (D-North Las Vegas) during this year’s regular legislative session.
The regular session bill fell victim to 11th hour theatrics over unrelated proposals. It had passed both chambers, but the Senate was unable to concur on an amendment before it was forced to adjourn because of the state’s 120-day limit to legislative sessions.
SB6 passed the Legislature Monday with overwhelming bipartisan support, receiving a unanimous 38-0 vote of all members present in the Assembly and 19-2 in the Senate. It now heads to Lombardo’s desk for final approval.
State senator lambastes North Las Vegas over sinking homes, personal attacks

Neal described the bill in hearings as legislation that clarifies the intent of the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act, which lawmakers passed in 2023. The changes include clarifying the boundaries of the neighborhood and revising the eligibility criteria for residents in order to capture all of the 93 homes originally identified for relocation assistance.
The bill also appropriates to the project an additional $25 million on top of the $37 million appropriated in 2023.
Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus (R-Wellington) and state Sen. Jeff Stone (R-Henderson) cast the lone votes in opposition of the bill.
Titus called it a “fiscal boondoggle.” She said she had sympathy for the families of Windsor Park but also thought about the people who lost their homes in the Great Recession.
“Sometimes we make tough decisions, and I represent all Nevadans,” she said. “I have to stand up for all families.”
Neal responded to those comments with an impassioned speech about the history of Windsor Park and the state’s responsibility to correct it, saying she refused to have the story of the neighborhood and its residents “diminished, denigrated or told in a way that is revisionist to the truth and facts.”
Black families were redlined into Windsor Park in the 1960s. Their homes began sinking in the late 1980s after the City of North Las Vegas siphoned water out of the ground underneath them, creating subsidence. The city later passed an ordinance saying they were not allowed to repair their homes. Those were circumstances beyond their control.
“The streets cracked, the walls separated from their properties, the sidewalks broke. And they remained in the property,” she said.
Some residents accepted relocation assistance in the 1990s and were moved into homes that turned out to be substandard, said Neal. That neighborhood of homes is referred to as “Baby Windsor.”
Neal contrasted the Windsor Park bill to the Summerlin Studios bill, which is still snaking its way through the Legislature. The Windsor Park bill passed the Senate the same day the Assembly passed the film bill, which is expected to be the state’s largest ever public subsidy, benefitting Howard Hughes Holdings, Sony Entertainment, Warner Bros Discovery and whatever corporations buy the transferable tax credits made available through the bill.
“We’re arguing over whether or not we gonna help some Black families who couldn’t help themselves, and Latino families who didn’t even know the story” of the homes they’d purchased, said Neal. “We just watched a $1.5 billion deal leave the Assembly for special interests, and you have the audacity to tell me who is deserving? My special interest happens to reside in my district.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/windsor-park-with-strip-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-18 08:56:23.028229

(Photo via Rep. Jared Golden)After months of delay by GOP leadership, a bipartisan bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine to nullify President Donald Trump’s executive order stripping union rights from about two-thirds of the federal workforce is expected to come up for a vote in the House. 
In July, Golden, a Democrat, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York introduced a discharge petition, a mechanism that would force a vote on the bill if enough representatives sign on. Before the petition to release the Epstein files, such maneuvers have  rarely been successful. 
But on Monday the 218 signature threshold was reached, with Republican Reps. Nick LaLota and Mike Lawler of New York putting it over the finish line. 
“America never voted to eliminate workers’ union rights,” Golden said in a statement Monday night, “and the strong bipartisan support for my bill shows that Congress will not stand idly by while President Trump nullifies federal workers’ collective bargaining agreements and rolls back generations of labor law.” 
Trump’s executive order on March 27 banned collective bargaining agreements at government agencies with “national security interests.” These include the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Environmental Protection Agency, among numerous others, overall impacting more than 1 million workers. 
The White House said in a fact sheet that accompanied the order that “certain federal unions have declared war on President Trump’s agenda” and that the order was necessary to safeguard American interests. 
The Protect America’s Workforce Act, introduced by Golden and Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania in April, is co-sponsored by 222 members of Congress, including seven Republicans. Five of the seven signed the discharge petition. 
But, that doesn’t mean the bill will pass. 
“I’m calling on Speaker Mike Johnson to schedule a clean, up-or-down vote on this bill,” Golden said.
As House and then Senate action awaits, a wide range of unions are voicing their support for the legislation, including the Maine American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. 
“It is unconscionable that the Trump administration has illegally stripped thousands of federal employees of their right to bargain for fair wages and safe working conditions,” Cynthia Phinney, president of the Maine AFL-CIO, said in a statement. “The President’s executive order is a lawless attack on federal public servants providing crucial services to our nation, from servicing Navy submarines and caring for our veterans to providing Social Security benefits to older Mainers, surviving families and people with disabilities.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Golden-Jeffries-Protect-Americas-Workforce-Act-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 08:56:23.028229

(Photo by Adam Gray/Getty Images)They say sunshine makes a great disinfectant. President Donald Trump told us so back in 2020.
While we know women didn’t ruin the workplace, a la that much mocked New York Times opinion piece, it might just turn out that some women are ruining POTUS’s workplace. Of course by “ruin” I mean shining a giant spotlight on Trump’s name in the more than 20,000 pages of documents, including emails mentioning him by name, turned over by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.
Honestly, women were doing a lot last Wednesday.
Arizona Rep. Adelita Grijalva, finally sworn in after waiting 50 days, kicked things off by signing the discharge petition to force a vote to compel the Department of Justice to release the Epstein files. Incidentally, did you know that women who fought in the Mexican Revolution were often called “adelitas?” Grijalva represents 800,000 constituents and is the state’s first Chicana representative in Congress.
Meanwhile, Trump called Rep. Lauren Boebart, R-Colorado, to the White House to convince her to break with Democrats voting to release files on Jeffrey Epstein. Boebart wasn’t the only Republican woman getting attention from POTUS’s camp today. Reportedly, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Nancy Mace were contacted as well.
Nevada’s three Democratic representatives, Dina Titus, Stephen Horsford, and Susie Lee, were among the 218 signatures required on the discharge petition which will compel a vote. (What a relief after getting sold out by Democrat Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen on the government shutdown.)
Trump has wilted under pressure, announcing over the weekend that he would release the Epstein files. This is a potent reminder that bullies hate to be mocked. No doubt the escalating tension with not just Democrats in Congress but an increasing pack of Republicans defecting from his camp played a part. Or maybe it was the Bubba memes.
It‘s important to not lose sight of the real winners in all this. With the release of Epstein’s emails, this is a big moment for survivors of sexual violence, too.
As a rape survivor, I know firsthand how difficult it is to get justice. Most of us will never get our day in court, whether it’s the court of law or the court of public opinion. But all of us carry not only the trauma of our experiences but the societal weight of being disbelieved and shamed. This is why every time the light of truth shines on what perpetrators want to hide, it feels like a bell rings for justice. This time they can’t scurry away like roaches in the dark.
Today I am reminded of Gisèle Pelicot, the 72-year-old French woman who won her court case last year against the more than 50 men who raped her, including her husband. She stood on the court steps and said, “When you’re raped there is shame, and it’s not for us to have shame, it’s for them.”
I am reminded of E. Jean Carroll, who won her case against Trump in 2023 in which the court found him liable for sexual abuse when he defamed her while talking about her allegation that he assaulted her in a dressing room. This ruling, and judgement for Trump to pay Carroll $5 million, was upheld in appeals court. Last week, he asked the Supreme Court to take up the case. Much like his relentless fight against paying SNAP benefits, Trump won’t stop trying to get out of paying Carroll what she’s due.
Most of all, I’m reminded of the press conferences and numerous interviews with Jeffrey Epstein’s victims. The great machine that has conspired for decades to cover up Epstein’s villainy is unraveling now. Trump can’t surreptitiously schedule another military flyover of these 20,000 pages of documents. He can’t stop the memes on social media quoting Epstein agreeing with Kathy Ruemmler saying Trump is “so gross” and Epstein responding “worse in real life and upclose [sic].”
I think it’s hilarious that these historic villains so often make fun of Trump in these emails. The best jokes punch up, not down. To paraphrase Pelicot, these emails are powerful evidence that Trump deserves the shame, not Epstein’s victims.
The thing about being a survivor of sexual assault is that we are often not present in the stories about the crimes that happened to us. Partly, this is because victims get anonymity in court and in the media. This is important for the safety and welfare of victims, of course. Unfortunately, it does have the unintended consequence that we become invisible in our own narrative. The thing that rightly protects us, also alienates us from people’s empathy. People respond to people, not “Victim Number One.” However inconvenient this truth, we have to remember that the reason these emails and files and votes matter is people. The victims are very real people.
Epstein’s victims deserve justice. It is because of their incredible bravery that this whole house of cards may finally topple. I, for one, can’t wait for these victims — many of them women — to ruin this particular workplace.
I love the idea that after everything Trump and his clown car of grifters has done it’s not the 34 convictions, the payouts to porn stars, the insurrection, the plague deaths, the full-bodied fight against feeding children or anything else that gets him — it’s the women, stupid! Even better, it’s the survivors.
Like I used to say for years on my old blog, The Sin City Siren, survivors are warriors. Someone(s) tried to annihilate us — and we survived. We are still here. And there are so many of us that you are almost never in a room without (at least) one of us. If we were to stand up all at once, the ground would quake beneath our feet. Survivors are legion.
If Trump is ever to be ruined, I hope like hell it’s by one of us.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2246588156-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 07:57:12.993203

The Middlebury Chapel has played an important role in helping me become the person I am. I write in support of the name change from Mead Memorial Chapel to Middlebury Chapel.
The issue of naming and naming rights can be a complex one, but it is not so here as this case makes its way to the Vermont Supreme Court. 
The name change is a reaction to Gov. John A. Mead’s support of the eugenics movement. While his descendants can avail themselves of distinguished counsel, the very nature of the eugenics movement means there could never have been any descendants of the movement’s victims. The fight is thus an unequal one. It also in the present demonstrates the harm the movement did and continues to do.

I am pleased the Supreme Court is hearing the case.
I know that some of the support for the college’s position relates to the far broader issue of naming rights, but the specific reasons for this name change are in support of righting a horrible wrong. We must never forget that Hitler took strength from the eugenics movement in his endeavors.

Voters narrowed their choice to Garrett Dixon and Kristin Nelson in the October primary. Both are first-time candidates. In the primary, Nelson got 1,226 (46.7%) votes and Dixon got 874 (33.3%) votes, according to unofficial results. Micah Messer, a third candidate received 526 (20%) votes. Messer ran for the seat in 2022 against former Rep. Debbie Wood, R-Valley.
The district covers parts of Chambers and Lee counties.
When do polls open?
Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Tuesday. 
Where do I find my polling place?
The Alabama Secretary of State’s website allows you to check voter registration and the location of your polling place. You can find it here.
What do I need to vote?
Voters must present a valid photo ID before voting. Valid forms of ID include: 

Alabama driver’s license (not expired or expired less than 60 days)
Alabama Law Enforcement Agency digital driver’s license
Alabama Non-Driver ID (not expired or expired less than 60 days)
Alabama Photo Voter ID card
State-issued ID (Alabama or any other state)
Federal-issued ID
U.S. Passport
Employee ID from the federal government; state of Alabama; county; municipality, board or other entity of Alabama
Student or employee ID from a public or private post-secondary educational institution in Alabama or other states (including colleges, universities, postgraduate technical and professional schools)

Military ID
Tribal ID

Where is the district located?
The district covers parts of Chambers and Lee counties, including Valley, Lanett and Smiths Station.
How did the seat become vacant?
The seat became vacant after Wood resigned this summer to move near the Florida panhandle, where her husband works. 
What issues dominate the race?
Nelson said she wants income tax reform. The current state tax rates and income threshold are locked via a 1933 constitutional amendment, though deductions may be changed by statute.
Dixon wants to recruit “good paying” jobs to the district, improve infrastructure and support public schools. 
Campaign fundraising
According to campaign finance records, Dixon has raised more than $93,000 and spent about $92,600. About two-thirds of Dixon’s donations came from Political Action Committees (PACs). He had almost $7,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began. Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth donated $10,000 to Dixon’s campaign, according to records. 
Nelson has raised over $60,000 and spent almost $51,000 since the beginning of the special election in August. She had about $11,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began. Most of her cash donations came from individuals and businesses. 
Does the seat have a partisan lean?
District 38 is solidly Republican. Wood won in 2022 with almost 90% of votes against Libertarian Charles Temm Jr. She won with about 70% of votes in 2018 against Democrat Brian McGee.
What happens after Tuesday?
The Republican nominee will face Democratic nominee Hazel Floyd, 21, in a general election on Feb. 3. Floyd is campaigning on boosting business development beyond Valley city limits, strengthening public education funding and supporting farmers.
Will the results alter control of the Legislature?
No. Republicans currently hold 72 of the 105 seats in the Alabama House, after three resignations after the end of the 2025 session in May, including Wood. Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, was appointed president of the Public Service Commission in June. Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, was elected to the State Senate on June 24.

Costs have outpaced what most families can manage, especially during pregnancy and a baby’s first year, when financial stress hits hardest. Many new parents are forced to return to work within weeks and go without essentials simply to stay afloat.
Despite our state’s prosperity, there are disparities in birth outcomes and mental health among low-income, Indigenous, and Black families. Washington now has the second-lowest fertility rate in the country and is seeing its lowest birth rates in decades, underscoring the financial and caregiving barriers families weigh when considering having a child.
A statewide direct cash-transfer pilot for pregnant people and new parents will help ensure that those who do choose to grow their families can do so with stability, dignity, and support. The earliest months of life shape everything that follows.
Michigan just showed the country what’s possible. In Flint, the Rx Kids program delivered unconditional cash during pregnancy and babies’ first year and saw an 18% drop in preterm births, a 27% reduction in low birthweights, and roughly a 29% decline in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admissions. That reduction alone prevented nearly 60 costly hospitalizations a year and generated an estimated $6.2 million in healthcare savings. Families also reported dramatic financial and mental-health gains, including a 91% reduction in evictions and fewer positive screens for postpartum depression.
We’ve also tested guaranteed income locally.
In Tacoma, the Growing Resilience in Tacoma, or GRIT, pilot provided $500 a month for 13 months to 110 single parents in the city’s highest-need ZIP codes. Funded in part by Mayors for a Guaranteed Income in partnership with the city of Tacoma, the pilot showed families became more financially resilient and improved their employment opportunities. 
Building on that success, a second phase launched with $1.9 million in state funding, expanding support to additional Tacoma neighborhoods and nearby Parkland and Spanaway. Betty Ann, a Tacoma mother, used her payments to repair her car and keep her job and family on track.
Another privately funded program is supporting a cohort of families starting in pregnancy. The Nest, run by Hummingbird Indigenous Family Services, pairs no-strings cash with Indigenous-centered care such as doulas, home visits, and cultural programming.
One hundred fifty Native and Pacific Islander parents in King and Pierce Counties and on the Tulalip Reservation receive $1,250 a month through their child’s third birthday, up to $45,000 total. Nest funding helped Hj-lynn Hiteuo in Federal Way stay home with her newborn for several months instead of rushing back to work.
We write this as community partners who didn’t wait for someone else to act. When we first learned about Flint’s approach, our immediate reaction was: this is exactly the kind of support Washington’s families deserve. A predictable check brings down the temperature at home: enough gas to get to prenatal appointments, a repair so mom can keep her job, a few weeks of breathing room.
Washington needs a statewide direct-cash pilot now for new parents and families expecting children. Philanthropy has a critical role to play, and more partners must step up. Perigee Fund has already contributed $50,000 to the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services to develop a proposal and bring agencies, community partners, and parents together to scale this proven model. Lawmakers could match that leadership by committing resources in the upcoming session to a statewide pilot.
Some argue we can’t afford it. But Washington’s future depends on investing in families at the very beginning of life. Supporting parents in the earliest months is not only the right thing to do, it is the foundation for healthier children and stronger communities.
We’ve seen how direct cash gives parents breathing room and saves millions in avoidable costs. The choice is clear: invest now or pay more later for preventable crises. Let’s choose families and a stronger future for Washington.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1253306537-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-11-18 08:56:23.028229

(Getty Images)Indiana has a transparency and misinformation “problem” when it comes to data centers, Hoosier energy leaders heard Wednesday.
“This stuff is generating astronomical amounts of money for localities,” data center developer Tom Dakich said. “We do a bad job of bringing the transparency of those numbers, and the numbers are staggering.”
Dakich, who was involved in the Digital Crossroads data center in Hammond, spoke to the Strategic Energy Growth Task Force during an afternoon meeting at the Indiana State Museum.
The industry is also doing a “bad job” talking about the “de minimus” amount of water needed for cooling the massive facilities, he said.
The Strategic Energy Growth Task Force met for the second time on Nov. 17, 2025. (Screenshot of livestream)
He blamed opaque processes and bad information for fostering massive backlash among residents — prompting local officials to pull their support and tank projects years into development.
That’s putting some off Indiana, said Dakich, who added, “We’ve got to figure out a way to make those public officials insulated.”
Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, said lawmakers have already attempted.
Legislation to take control over large-scale utility infrastructure projects decisions has failed repeatedly.
“We said, ‘Let us take responsibility, and we’ll set the standards.’ And they didn’t want that. They wanted complete control,” he said.
Soliday, who chairs the Indiana House’s energy committee, said no clapping, booing or signage is allowed during his meetings — and critiqued chaotic local gatherings.
“What we’ve got to do is, (if) somebody goes after an elected official’s wife at the beauty parlor, put them in jail,” he said. “Because we are becoming, quickly devolving into, mob rule.”
Suzanne Jaworowski, Indiana’s secretary of energy and natural resources, said data centers and other big energy users could help pay for needed electricity infrastructure.

“Why would we not have them build that?” Jaworowski asked. “Because we need that generation in the state and having a third party pay for it, rather than having our ratepayers pay for it, is just a great opportunity.”
The task force also heard from representatives of other big users, like Steel Dynamics, a member of Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers.
 Indiana Manufacturers Association also presented, maintaining that its members are “ready to invest, hire and build” — but only with guaranteed access to reliable and affordable power.
Soliday rebuffed energy supply fears throughout the meeting, calling such comments “disingenuous” and himself “really weary of this.”
State leaders for energy and resource management agencies also discussed environmental regulations and their impacts on prices.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)As a pediatrician and researcher, I’ve had the privilege of providing care for thousands of young patients at Hennepin Healthcare for more than three decades. I’ve also had a front-row seat to study and observe how policy decisions affect child and caregiver health.
Very soon, the enhanced premium tax credits of the Affordable Care Act — which lower health care premiums, in turn helping families to afford health insurance — will be taken away from families. I am alarmed by this development, because I know it puts the health of children and families across Minnesota at risk.
Last month, more than 90,000 Minnesotans who use MNsure for their insurance, including patients I serve, started to receive letters notifying them that their premiums for next year will increase dramatically. For example, premiums for a family of four making $66,000 per year will rise from $1,452 to an estimated $4,477. That’s a 300% increase in one year. No family can afford that.
With high costs of living and stagnating wages, these premium hikes will put health care out of reach for many families. My research with Children’s HealthWatch has shown that forgoing preventive care leads to more expensive emergency room care down the road. 
The persistent, large-scale strain on the health care system from millions of people suddenly losing coverage will, in turn, increase health care costs for everyone, not just those with MinnesotaCare or Medicaid.
These price shocks are paired with uncertainty surrounding many programs my patients rely on to meet their basic needs, including nutritional assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, as well as programs that help cover the costs of utilities, like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Losing access to these vital supports strains household budgets, forcing families into toxic choices between going to the doctor, paying for prescriptions, skipping meals or forgoing other basic needs like rent, utilities or car payments.
In our clinics and emergency departments, we see how health care is so tightly related to other needs. I am already hearing from my patients, who are anxious about how they will buy groceries with the impending cuts to SNAP benefits passed by Congress this summer, which will cause some families to lose access to the program entirely. When SNAP is disrupted — even in the short term — families are significantly more likely to face food insecurity, and parents and children are more likely to be in poor health.
There is no “pause” button for health care access in the lives of infants and toddlers. The costs of the expiring tax credits will not wait, and they will not be abstract. They will be borne by the bodies and futures of my patients — our youngest Minnesotans.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_5806-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 07:57:12.993203

Made available in advance of a formal announcement planned for Thursday, the one-minute, 42-second video on opens with a 10-second parody of a syrupy, platitude-laden campaign commercial that Stewart interrupts.
“Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second. We are not doing that this way. No political BS, just real talk,” Stewart says. “I’m Erin Stewart. I’m running for governor because the clowns in Hartford have run our state into the ground.”
Stewart, 38, who left office last week after 12 years as mayor of New Britain, is competing with state Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich for the GOP nomination to oppose the likely Democratic nominee, Gov. Ned Lamont.
She begins with money in the bank and a head start towards qualifying for public financing: As of last month, Stewart had raised nearly $360,000 through an exploratory committee opened in January and had about $290,000 cash on hand. 
Lamont is expected to self-fund his reelection and opt out of the state’s voluntary Citizens’ Election Program, which imposes spending limits in return for public financing: $3.2 million for a primary and $15.4 million for the general election. Lamont spent $15.1 million on his 2018 campaign and $25.7 million on his 2022 reelection.
Unless a new deep-pocketed contender jumps into the race, Republicans are assured of a nominee with experience in elective office for the first first time since Gov. M. Jodi Rell led the ticket 20 years ago. Both Stewart and Fazio will be seeking public financing.
Two wealthy businessmen, Thomas Foley and Bob Stefanowski, were the GOP nominees for open seats in 2010 and 2018, and again in rematches four years later with the Democrats who beat them: Foley facing Dannel P. Malloy; Stefanowski challenging Lamont.
“Connecticut’s been run by the same insiders for decades. It’s the same wealthy, out-of-touch politicians who just manage our decline. It’s not good enough,” Stewart says in the video. “I’m Erin Stewart. I’m a working mom who grew up working class. My neighbors made me their Republican mayor in a Democrat city, and I delivered results in New Britain.”
The video features pictures of Stewart visiting and shaking hands with President Donald Trump in the White House, reflecting the efforts by both Stewart and Fazio to get past their recent histories as Republicans who kept their distance from Trump.
Anticipating her announcement, an independent expenditure group supportive of Fazio sent a mailing last week to selected Republican activists that attacked Stewart’s record as a mayor and member of the Board of Regents for Higher Education and described her as “anti-Trump.”
It used a portion of a quote from Stewart during Trump’s first term, when she was dismissing the ability of Democrats using the president against her: “I have no ties to them, and I’ve been pretty outspoken about not supporting Trump and about not supporting or being in favor of a lot of what he’s done and his approach.”
The mailer was sent by Hands Off Our Schools, a political action committee that spent more than $75,000 last year, most of it on advertising criticizing Fazio’s opponent in his campaign for reelection, Democrat Nick Simmons. The expenditure on the anti-Stewart mailing was modest, said Darren Bruno, chair of the group.
He said he was uncertain of how big a role it would play in 2026. One of its recent donors was Sean Fieler, a wealthy finance executive and conservative Catholic philanthropist who spent about $900,000 on independent expenditures opposing Lamont’s reelection in 2022. Fieler declined comment on his contribution plans for 2026.
Stewart is opening her formal campaign with a rebuttal of the narrative Lamont used last week in beginning his campaign for a third term: On his watch, Connecticut has stabilized its finances, cutting income taxes and using budget surpluses to fill a rainy day fund and pay down an unfunded pension liability.
“When I started as mayor of New Britain, the state and the city were struggling, and now New Britain is back on its feet. Our state is not,” Stewart says. “Connecticut is third in the nation for high taxes. Highest energy prices in New England. Jobs are hard to come by. But U-Hauls and moving companies? They’re in high demand.”
After a burst of in-migration during the COVID-19 pandemic, U-Haul reported that people leaving Connecticut made up about 52% of one-way trips in 2024, compared to 48% moving in. Stewart is correct in describing the high cost of living in Connecticut, though it preceded Lamont’s time in office.
Connecticut’s economic growth of 2.6% in 2024 ranked it 23rd among all states. Its growth of 4.6% in the second quarter of 2025 was 10th-best in the country. The state’s jobless rate is lower than the national average.
“We revived New Britain. We can revive Connecticut. This is not as good as it gets. We can demand better,” she says in the video. “Let’s try something different, and that starts with a different kind of government.”
Her description of New Britain’s revival is certain to be debated during the 2026 campaign. After an initial increase, she largely has held the line on property taxes and presided over a cut in the tax rate after revaluation. The city carries significant debt, though the outlook of bond rating agencies for New Britain has been either stable or positive. 
Like other cities, New Britain is the beneficiary of considerable state aid: $151 million over the two years of the state’s current fiscal biennium. The city’s annual budget is about $273 million.
Stewart proved unbeatable in New Britain, winning every two years despite a Democratic advantage in voter registration. She did not seek reelection this month. Stewart was succeeded by a Democrat, Bobby Sanchez.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/erinstewart-1024x727.jpg,,,2025-11-18 07:57:12.993203

Specifically, the fight has centered on a Nazi sympathizer who keeps finding his way into the orbit of influential conservatives: Nick Fuentes.
Fuentes, a far-right activist and Holocaust denier, has summed up his political worldview as “hating women, being racist, being antisemitic.” He once proclaimed that Jews “are responsible for every war in the world. It’s not even debatable at this point.”
Yet that repugnant belief system hasn’t blocked his access to a who’s who of the conservative movement — including Donald Trump, who dined with Fuentes and fellow anti-semite Kanye West at Mar-a-Lago in 2022.
More recently, Fuentes appeared on Tucker Carlson’s show for a two-hour softball interview that featured a call for a “pro-white” movement to oppose the “organized Jewry” Fuentes believes is undermining American cohesion. Carlson’s interview elevated Fuentes’ profile, giving his extremist views an audience far beyond his usual following.
The interview also roiled the American right, setting off an ugly debate about who should be allowed inside the tent of the conservative movement. Among those warning against the mainstreaming of Fuentes was Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley.
“Listen, this is America. He can have whatever views he wants,” Hawley told Jewish Insider. “But the question for us as conservatives is: Are those views going to define who we are? And I think we need to say, ‘No, they’re not. No. Just no, no, no.’”
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz went even further, saying: “If you sit there with someone who says Adolf Hitler was very, very cool and that their mission is to combat and defeat global Jewry, and you say nothing, then you are a coward and you are complicit in that evil.”
The public condemnation of Fuentes and his beliefs from Hawley and other high-profile Republicans stands in stark contrast to Missouri’s other U.S. senator, Eric Schmitt.
Schmitt has yet to make any public comments about Fuentes, and his office did not respond to requests for comment.
There’s certainly no obligation for elected officials to speak out on every controversy, but Schmitt’s silence in particular is raising eyebrows.
First, he has never hesitated to attack antisemitism when it emanates from the left. Why the sudden reticence when it comes from the right?
Second, Schmitt is only a few weeks removed from a speech at the National Conservatism Conference where he argued the United States is not a nation built on ideas but on the legacy of “settlers and their descendants.” Critics heard echoes in Schmitt’s speech of the old “blood and soil” nationalism that underpinned European fascist movements.
And third, over the summer Schmitt hired a staffer who was previously fired from Ron DeSantis’ presidential campaign for circulating a video featuring Nazi imagery. That same staffer previously praised Fuentes’ influence on young men, though he later apologized.
Silence doesn’t equal agreement, and Schmitt’s defenders might argue he shouldn’t dignify Fuentes with attention. Why give an extremist more oxygen?
That might be a persuasive if Schmitt had not already brushed shoulders with the ideological world Fuentes inhabits. Once those lines blur, clarity becomes a duty, not an option. Avoiding the issue allows extremists to imagine their views are tolerated within mainstream conservatism.
When the loudest message a leader sends is silence, it can be heard as permission.
Or maybe it’s just cowardice.

This Sept. 10 protest against the plan has grown into a campaign to put it before voters on a statewide ballot (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Voters across Missouri late last week received a text message urging them to take their names off petitions they may have “accidentally signed.”
The message, labeled as the work of the Republican National Committee, dropped the name of Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, saying he had “declared TENS OF THOUSANDS of petition signatures IMPROPERLY COLLECTED.” The text, from a number in southwest Virginia, gave a number to call in southwest Missouri to withdraw a signature.
The number, when called, goes straight to a voice mail system and promises people who leave a number that they will be called.
The mass text was the latest maneuver in the fight over Missouri’s gerrymandered redistricting map, which is drawing millions in donations from dark money groups on the right and left — including $2 million over the weekend from a pair of Republican nonprofits. The deadline is approaching for opponents of the map to submit signatures to force a referendum while the question of which signatures to count and whether a referendum is even possible remains mired in state and federal courtrooms.
This text message was sent to Missourians during the second week of November (photo submitted). 
The text messages refer to a statement Hoskins made Oct. 15 that signatures gathered before he approved the form of a referendum petition would not count and gathering them before the approval “constitutes a misdemeanor election offense.”
“We did not coordinate with the RNC with this and it was a surprise to us,” Rachael Dunn, spokeswoman for Hoskins, said in an email to The Independent.
Dunn said she was one of the Missourians who received the text. The number listed is not an official number, she said, and referred other questions to the Republican National Committee.
The Republican National Committee did not respond to a message seeking comment.
 7-1 map

In September, Republicans in the General Assembly muscled through a new congressional redistricting plan intended to give the GOP an edge in seven of Missouri’s eight districts. Republicans currently hold six of the seats and want to flip the 5th District, held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City since 2005.
President Donald Trump made it a test of loyalty for Missouri to follow Texas in the effort to shore up the GOP’s thin majority in the U.S. House. After a call from Trump, state Senate Republicans changed the rules to limit Democratic efforts to stall the debate.
A PAC called People Not Politicians announced soon after the map was passed by the legislature that it would seek a referendum, which needs about 110,000 signatures distributed across six congressional districts by Dec. 11 to force the plan to a statewide vote.If the petitions are submitted, the map would be prevented from taking effect until the vote.
In federal court, Hoskins is suing People Not Politicians and arguing that a redistricting plan is off-limits to a state referendum because the federal Constitution precludes it.
That legal position has not been heard in a trial and Dunn said petitions will be processed like any other initiative if they are received in time.
It is possible to remove a name from a petition, Dunn said. A voter wishing to do so should contact the secretary of state’s elections office directly, she said, and use an affidavit form provided by the office.
Missouri Republican Party Chairman Peter Kinder, who is also a member of the national committee, said he didn’t know anything about the text campaign when contacted Monday.
“The RNC is very interested in the events going on here,” Kinder said. “They have been following this very closely in Missouri and are interested in it. Whatever they want to do along these lines is fine with me.”
 Money flowing

Almost $7 million has been raised by the two campaign committees preparing for a referendum, almost all of it from outside the state. 
People Not Politicians has raised almost $5 million, including $3.1 million since Sept. 30, with several large checks coming from national groups that also donated to the 2024 campaign to legalize abortion.
The largest donors are American Opportunity Action, which gave $1.4 million and was incorporated and staffed last year by longtime Democratic operatives; the Health Forward Foundation of Kansas City, which gave $750,000; the Global Impact Social Welfare Fund, which provided $500,000; and the George Soros-financed Open Society Action Fund, which gave $450,000.
Put Missouri First, formed on the last day of October, has taken in $2.1 million, with $1 million on Friday from each of two donors, the American Action Network, which aired ads blaming Democrats and Soros for the government shutdown; and Securing American Greatness, formed last year by long-time Trump advisor Taylor Budowich, who recently resigned as White House deputy chief of staff.
 In court

The next two important court dates come next week on Monday and Tuesday.
On Monday, a Jackson County judge will consider consolidating — and perhaps dismissing — two lawsuits challenging the redistricting plan, including one that argues the bill establishing the map is flawed because it places the same Kansas City precinct in two districts.
And on Tuesday, a federal judge in St. Louis will hear arguments over whether the federal Constitution’s directive that legislatures establish congressional districts means no referendum can be held on the plan.
A decision that could come as early as Friday may help decide if a referendum is even needed. Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh heard arguments Wednesday on the constitutionality of the redistricting plan.
Limbaugh also now has the case raising the question of when a referendum campaign can begin. He was assigned the case after two previous trial dates were canceled — once because the original judge was sick that day and again last week after Put Missouri First intervened and asked for a delay.
Chuck Hatfield, attorney for People Not Politicians, said he intends to be in court Tuesday morning to ask Limbaugh to set the trial date as soon as possible. He and attorney Marc Ellinger, who represents Put Missouri First, clashed over the need for a delay when the second trial date was canceled.
Ellinger could not be reached for comment on what he will ask Limbaugh to do. Hecould oppose the motion, saying he needs more time to prepare. In election cases with looming deadlines, Hatfield said, parties are often eager to get a decision.
That may not be the case, he noted.
“I don’t know,” Hatfield said, “if we’re in an agreeable mood with everybody right now.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_rally1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-11-18 07:57:12.993203

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A state law enforcement board on Monday took its next step toward deciding whether Dubois County Sheriff Tom Kleinhelter should lose his police certification.
After a brief procedural meeting at the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy in Plainfield the pending case against Kleinhelter is tentatively on track for lengthy evidentiary hearings in April.
The Indiana Law Enforcement Training Board’s decertification subcommittee will weigh the charges, and the full board will ultimately decide whether Kleinhelter should be stripped of his law enforcement credentials.
Kleinhelter appeared Monday alongside his lawyer, Jim Voyles; general counsel Raquel Ramirez represented the train board. Subcommittee chairman David Wantz led the four-minute meeting.
The parties agreed to exchange initial discovery by Dec. 30, with additional discovery due by the end of January and a two-day evidentiary hearing tentatively scheduled sometime between April 25–28.
Indiana law enforcement training board to weigh request to decertify Dubois County sheriff

Following the hearing, neither Kleinhelter nor Voyles responded to media questions.
The decertification request was initiated by  the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy and its executive director, Tim Horty, following a monthslong Indiana State Police investigation into allegations of misconduct by Kleinhelter. Although a special prosecutor ultimately decided not to file criminal charges against Kleinhelter, the training board voted in August to move forward with administrative charges of fraud, perjury, false informing and criminal misconduct.
The board pointed to two separate allegations of fraud in the charging documents.
In one instance, Kleinhelter was accused of purchasing employee gifts and directing the jail matron to falsely list the expenses as “training” in commissary records. The sheriff is also alleged to have reimbursed the jail commissary with more than $16,000 following a state audit, but then sought to recoup the money by filing a reimbursement request with the county auditor that falsely listed a State Board of Accounts employee’s name to suggest its approval.
The board also accused Kleinhelter of perjury, alleging that the sheriff signed a nepotism compliance form months after he approved his wife as a special deputy. The training board claimed that could be a violation of the county’s policy around “hiring and supervising relatives.”
Kleinhelter is further accused of false informing for telling state police investigators he received an airline “e-credit” for a canceled work trip — although the airline confirmed he was actually issued a direct refund.
ILEA’s training board noted in the charging document that Kleinhelter’s alleged actions occurred while he was serving in his official capacity as sheriff and could qualify as official misconduct.
Although decertification would bar Kleinhelter from serving as a certified law-enforcement officer, it would not prevent him from holding the elected office of sheriff under the state constitution.

Sara Rodriguez speaks during a Wisconsin Technology Council forum featuring Democratic and Republican hopefuls in the 2026 governor's race Nov. 6, 2025. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The longest ever federal government shutdown that ended last week revolved around a top issue for Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez as she campaigns to be Wisconsin’s next governor: health and health care.
A registered nurse by training and former official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rodriguez has been deeply involved in health care policy, first in her single term as a member of the Wisconsin Assembly and then, since 2023, as the No. 2 official in the state’s executive branch.
And, she says, it motivated her to declare her intention to succeed Gov. Tony Evers after Evers decided to stand down from the 2026 election.
“One of the reasons why I wanted to run is to make sure that we have somebody in a leadership position that, No. 1, understands health care, and No. 2, really gets how unaffordable and broken it is,” Rodriguez told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview Monday.
She also sees a shift in the federal government away from established public health principles, forcing states to take the lead on setting public health standards. In the governor’s office, she said, her professional background would equip her to tackle  those issues.
As  a state representative, Rodriguez proposed a bill in the 2021-22 legislative term to accept the expansion of Medicaid — BadgerCare in Wisconsin — through the Affordable Care Act. Expansion would allow the state to enroll people with incomes between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty guidelines in Medicaid, with the federal government paying 90% of the additional cost.
When the ACA took effect, Gov. Scott Walker was in office and refused throughout his two terms as governor to accept the federal support and expand the program.
Evers defeated Walker in 2018 and promised to accept the federal expansion, but in the lame-duck session before he was sworn in, the Republican majority in the Legislature passed a bill that Walker signed, requiring the Legislature’s approval for expansion.
Since then, repeated attempts by Democrats to expand Medicaid, including the bill Rodriguez authored four years ago, have failed with Republican majorities in both houses of the Legislature.
Another form of Medicaid expansion — covering mothers for a year after they give birth — has the support of bipartisan majorities in the Senate and the Assembly, but Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) has opposed bringing it to the floor. 
“We are one of two states that have not done that — us and Arkansas,” Rodriguez said. “And I think Arkansas may be working on it. So we may be the only one left at the end of the day.”
Rodriguez’s political career started with her Assembly race in 2020, flipping a Republican seat in the Milwaukee suburbs. She followed that with her race for lieutenant governor in 2022 and now her  campaign for the Democratic nomination to run for governor in 2026.
Throughout her political life, she said, she has been supported by 314 Action, a political organizing group seeking to elect more scientists and people in science-related professions, including health care.
During the recent federal government shutdown, Democrats in the U.S. Senate insisted that any resolution to fund the government also extend federal subsidies for health insurance under the ACA. The expiration of those subsidies at the end of this year will cause health insurance premiums to double, on average, participants in the ACA marketplace. 
Ultimately, a handful of Democratic senators voted with the Republicans to advance a GOP-authored spending bill that ended the shutdown without addressing the looming health insurance cost spike.
But the issue won’t go away, Rodriguez said.
“We’re looking at a doubling of premiums,” she said. “A 60-year-old couple are looking $1,500 to $2,000 more a month to be able to pay for their health insurance. That is absolutely unaffordable for most Wisconsinites.”
The problem extends beyond just people who buy their insurance through the federal marketplace, she warned.
“The larger amount of people who are uninsured in the state, the higher our health care costs are going to get, because they’re going to wait, they’re going to delay care, they’re going to be sicker when they get into care, and it’s going to cost hospital systems more in terms of uncompensated care,” Rodriguez said.
“If people will go uninsured, it’s going to raise costs,” she added. “And continuing to talk about it, continuing to let people know how that works, is something that I’m uniquely equipped to do as a nurse, as somebody who’s worked within the health care system. And it’s one of the reasons why I’m running for governor.”
Rodriguez said she has seen the benefits that the ACA has brought in the last decade and a half.
Before it was in place, “people delayed care,” she said. “They came in sicker to my emergency department and it cost a whole lot more dollars to be able to treat them and they were out of work because they had to be treated within a hospital system as opposed to going to their regular doctor and being able to get the care that they needed and be able to take care of their diabetes, to take care of their hypertension. Those are the kind of things that the Affordable Care Act has allowed us to do.”
She said she’s heard from small business owners who were able to start a business because they could get health insurance thanks to the ACA.
“Do we need to fix it? Absolutely. Do we need to get it better? Absolutely,” Rodriguez said. “But to get rid of it is going to have devastating effects on health care in Wisconsin.”
Rodriguez said she also brings the perspective of health and health care to other policy topics.
“The medicine we give you, the procedures that we do — it’s such a tiny fraction of how healthy we are,” she said.
Food, housing and “a good-paying job to put a roof over our heads and to pay for the food we eat and to pay for the medications we’re prescribed” are health issues, too, Rodriguez said. That’s why housing affordability, for example, is part of her platform, she said. 
“Tom Tiffany in the governor’s seat [is] not going to put a priority on lowering costs for Wisconsinites,” she said.
She also predicted that, if elected, Tiffany would sign laws restricting abortion in Wisconsin — “and that is going to be extraordinarily dangerous for people.”
Rodriguez views her science background as a strong selling point. “I think we want somebody who’s going to use data and science to make decisions,” she said.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump’s secretary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, has been “using conspiracy theories as his underlying belief system, and that hurts real people,” Rodriguez said.
She cited surging measles cases in Wisconsin and nationally and the deaths of children in some states after the federal government weakened its support for vaccination.
“That hasn’t happened in a decade, and they’re continuing to feed this anti-science rhetoric that is going to harm our kids here in Wisconsin,” Rodriguez said. “I’ve been clear, I think RFK Jr. should resign. I don’t think he’s qualified for the job that he has and he’s actually a danger to public health across the country.”

Uinta County sheriff said his jail would be used to hold criminals caught by ICE. But relatives and attorney say man’s detention has shattered a family, not removed a threat.
The post Wyoming jails hold father detained in controversial Idaho ICE operation, now suing for his freedom appeared first on WyoFile .","When the raid began, she was tending to her baby in the parking lot of a local horse track.
She looked out her car window and saw that people who’d been watching the race were now fleeing into nearby fields.
Then she heard the helicopters. 
She stepped out of her car. She saw patrol vehicles, SUVs and armed officers descending on the track outside Wilder, Idaho. The horse race was popular with the local Hispanic community, and she was witnessing the beginning of an Oct. 19 operation conducted by more than 200 federal and local officers.
She and her four siblings are U.S. citizens. But as the agents descended on the track, her thoughts went immediately to their father, an immigrant who was present elsewhere in the facility. The woman agreed to share her story with WyoFile on the condition of anonymity for her and her family members, because she feared retaliation or harassment from both federal authorities and people with anti-immigrant sentiments. 
“Oh my God, my dad,” she said, recounting the raid. “He is not coming home with us today.”
She was right. Her father was one of more than 100 people detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the track, according to Idaho news accounts. 
Her father today sits in the Sweetwater County Detention Center in Rock Springs, after a weeks-long stay in the Uinta County jail in Evanston. He is challenging his imprisonment as unconstitutional in federal court. Last week, his lawyer asked U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl to order the man’s release or conduct a bond hearing, saying he should be allowed to return home to his family, which depends on his financial support, while his immigration case is adjudicated. 
The case, held at the federal courthouse in Casper, is one example of how the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement plays out in Wyoming, even for cases that might originate hundreds of miles away.
No allegations of local crimes
The man has no criminal record in the United States and has not returned to his native Mexico in two decades, his attorney Jacob Rourk said at the Nov. 12 court hearing. The government is advocating for the man’s indefinite detention “without care or attention paid to whether he is a flight risk or a danger to the community,” Rourk said. “He is neither of those things.”
Rourk’s assertion, which was not challenged by the government in open court, would mean Uinta and now Sweetwater counties are holding a man whose only crime is entering the country illegally. 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials have said they are targeting “the worst of the worst” for deportation, and also seeking to remove people who entered the country during a surge of illegal immigration under the administration of then-President Joe Biden. This man appears to fall into neither category. 
ICE arrest data also indicates that nationally, more than 70% of people detained under the Trump administration did not have criminal convictions, according to immigration researchers. 
In June, when Uinta County Sheriff Andy Kopp announced he’d be lending his jail space to ICE, he said he was doing so to raise revenue to cover salary raises to retain his underpaid deputies, as property tax reductions passed by the Wyoming Legislature cut into county budgets. 
The detainees Kopp’s jail would hold for the federal government “are all ICE inmates with criminal records that are picked up elsewhere… they’re dropped off here and they go on from here, no more than 72 hours later,” Kopp said, according to a transcript of the June 25 meeting of the Uinta County Commission, which was compiled by the Uinta County Herald.

But the Idaho detainee’s family and attorney say that in this case, the jail has been holding a father of five detained amid mass arrests, scooped up in a dragnet — someone who came to the United States and worked, without running afoul of local law enforcement, for two decades to provide a better life for his children.
“He has always said he works his butt off for us, and we can pay him back by becoming who we want to be in life,” his daughter told WyoFile. 
Kopp declined to speak to WyoFile about the case, other than to note the man had been transferred to Sweetwater County on Monday.
Kopp is a defendant in the man’s petition for release and the sheriff appeared in court, where he was represented by an Uinta County attorney. But Kopp is named purely because in a habeas corpus petition, as the motion is called, the person petitioning for his or her freedom names as a defendant the supervisor of the facility in which they are held. Kopp and his attorney did not contribute to the hearing, which featured arguments between Rourk and Levi Martin, an attorney for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Wyoming who argued the federal government’s case. 
Skavdahl has, for now, blocked ICE from moving the detainee out of Wyoming while he considers whether to grant the request for release or a bond hearing. Rourk asked for that order out of concern that ICE may otherwise ship his client between detention facilities around the country, as the agency has reportedly been doing with many detainees, making it more difficult for his lawyer and family to stay in contact with him. It’s unclear why authorities moved the man between the two county jails in Wyoming this week. 
Rourk also asked Skavdahl to keep the case in his court, and if he chooses to order a bond hearing, that he adjudicate the matter himself and not move the case into immigration court. Those courts and judges are not part of the independent federal judiciary branch — immigration judges work under the authority of the executive branch.

Amid the Trump administration’s sprawling and aggressive deportation drive, immigration judges are ignoring rules that allow some people to return to their homes and communities, instead leaving them in detention for months, Rourk argued.
Skavdahl appeared taken aback by the request. “So I should presume that (immigration judges) won’t follow the law?” he asked. Rourk pointed to a case out of Washington state, where immigration attorneys in the Seattle area have accused immigration judges of ignoring a U.S. District Court order that they provide opportunities for bonds.  
Martin, the government lawyer, disagreed. An immigration judge, not a U.S. District Court judge like Skavdahl, should decide whether the man receives bond, Martin argued, if such a hearing is held at all. Martin did not dispute Rourk’s claims that his client had no criminal record, but he questioned the father’s character — accusing him of taking “minors to an illegal gambling operation where he was detained.” 
But the daughter described it as a social event, centered around a horse race. 
Controversial operation
Federal officials have said ICE accompanied the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the horse track operation, which officials described as an illegal betting ring. The track owner and four others face felony gambling charges, according to reports in the Idaho Statesman.
The horse race itself appears to have been a licensed event, and ICE descended on the track on the last day of the 2025 racing season, according to the Statesman.
Federal agents initially detained more than 400 people during the operation and made 105 arrests on immigration grounds. 
The raid sparked controversy in Idaho, where officers have been criticized for aggressive tactics against minors and families and for targeting an event they knew they would find plenty of candidates for deportation. Some attendees are considering a lawsuit against the government for injuries and trauma suffered during the raid. 
Like many of the hundreds of attendees at the event, the woman interviewed by WyoFile said her sisters and two younger brothers, ages 15 and 11, were handcuffed with tight plastic zip ties and spent hours waiting for a chance to prove their lawful presence in the country. In initial statements, the Federal Bureau of Investigation denied using zip ties on children. Federal officials moderated that statement, however, after being confronted with photographs of a handcuffed minor. 
The family of the man now jailed in Wyoming were handcuffed for close to four hours, minus the daughter, who said officers left her hands free so she could care for her baby, she told WyoFile. During the initial roundup of attendees, she and her siblings were not with their father. When they caught sight of him again, it was through the plastic windows of a tent they were being held in. 
Once federal authorities established someone was a citizen or lawfully present, they put a green band on the person’s wrist, the woman said. When she saw her father through the window, he wore a red wristband marking him for immigration detention, she said. 
She and her siblings pleaded with officers to allow them to say goodbye to their father and were allowed to, despite some resistance, she said. 
As their lawyer argues for her father’s release, the family is struggling, she said. The raid traumatized her young brothers. 
“They’re still in shock and they haven’t fully understood what happened,” she said. The other day, she caught the 11-year-old hiding his head under a pillow as he cried. 
“He didn’t want anyone to see it,” she said.

UW will honor its most gifted athlete Saturday when it retires the jersey number worn by the Buffalo Bills’ quarterback, columnist Kerry Drake writes.
The post Josh Allen may be a Californian, but Wyoming has adopted him appeared first on WyoFile .","Josh Allen was born in California, but the Golden State holds no claim over the superstar Buffalo Bills quarterback. He honed his skills at the University of Wyoming, the only NCAA Division 1 school that offered him a football scholarship after a season playing for a junior college.
Fans at UW’s Saturday game will get to see Allen in person again when he makes his first appearance at War Memorial Stadium since graduating in 2017. He’ll be in Laramie to be honored as the first UW player to ever have his jersey number retired by the football program. But he continues to wear No. 17 for the Bills.

Opinion

Did his birth state pay $2 million for a 30-second Super Bowl commercial this year to celebrate Allen being named the NFL’s 2024 most valuable player? 
It did not. UW used its special projects reserve fund to air the spot in 25 markets around the country, where it was seen by an estimated 10 million people.
That’s a lot of exposure to UW’s underlying message: “This is where underdogs come to shine, and where real MVPs are made.”
Allen has become Wyoming’s most well-known export. He’s an unofficial ambassador for the Cowboy State who often cites his appreciation for the university giving him a chance to show what he can do.
Allen turned in a masterful performance Sunday in a 44-32 win over Tampa Bay, despite awkwardly heaving the ball right into the arms of a Buccaneers’ defender during the team’s first possession. He more than made up for it by throwing for three touchdowns and running for three more touchdowns, only the second time in NFL history anyone has accomplished that feat.
Who was responsible for the other monster performance by a quarterback? Allen, of course, last December against the Los Angeles Rams.
I tried to interview Allen for this column, but breaking through the wall of defense put up by the Bills’ communications department proved much tougher than I imagined. I’d probably have a better chance of talking to President Donald Trump.
So I switched to Plan B and tried to find the biggest Josh Allen fan in Wyoming. That’s how I learned about Trent Weitzel, a Laramie entrepreneur who drives his Weitzel Wings food truck — aka Double Dub’s Wings — thousands of miles from Laramie to many Bills games, in Buffalo and when the team is on the road.


Weitzel made such treks eight times last year and will do it again later this season. He met Allen after a UW game when the quarterback visited his food truck outside the stadium. Soon, Allen was a regular customer who declared Double Dub’s fried wings the best he’s ever eaten. His favorite? The spicy bleu wings.
Allen’s presence attracted much attention, including from the owner’s grandmother, Audra Weitzel. “She’d always conveniently appear whenever Josh showed up, and talk his ears off,” her grandson said, laughing.
Weitzel tried to enter the annual National Buffalo Wings Festival, but was turned down because he had a food truck, not a brick-and-mortar restaurant. His friend Allen helped him become an official contestant, and Double Dub’s sauces have won the “Festival Favorite” trophy four years in a row. It’s like the Super Bowl of chicken wings.
Weitzel said fans in Buffalo, known as the “Bills Mafia,” treat everyone from Wyoming who travels to the games like long-lost friends. “We’re looking at buying a second house there,” he said. “It just feels like home.”
Weitzel said Allen’s fame prevents him from showing up and helping his crew serve wings, like he did in 2019. “But we always get an order to him on game day, whenever and wherever he wants,” he said.
Why have so many Wyomingites fallen in love with Allen? It might be because he remains a down-to-earth, pretty humble guy they can relate to. Allen grew up on his family’s cotton farm near Firebaugh, California, so he understands what it’s like to live in a rural area.
I also think it’s the way Allen dedicates himself to being the best player he can be and motivating his team by example. Spectacular touchdown passes and runs are what draw us to him, but even his failures show his character. 
Two weeks ago, when Miami upset the Bills, Allen tried to mount a furious comeback with a play that defined for me what a competitor he is. He burst up the middle for a first down, and fought for every inch of ground he could before the ball was ripped from his hands. His face was anguished, but he didn’t give up.
Wyoming fans know no one on the field wants to win more than Allen. They saw it first in Laramie.
As a die-hard Denver Broncos fan since 1969, I never rooted for any other team before the Bills made Allen their first-round draft pick in 2018. Now I watch every Buffalo game I can. If my two teams are playing at the same time, I flip between channels. Whenever they go head-to-head, I root for Denver. Though, as an Allen fan, I hate myself for it.
Talking to people outside of Wyoming, I’ve discovered there are three things they associate with our state: Yellowstone National Park, the murder of gay UW student Matthew Shepard, and former Vice President Dick Cheney. It’s an odd trio that needs a fourth member.
The majestic first national park naturally tops the list. Extensive media coverage about the remaining pair accounts for their presence. Shepard’s brutal death helped galvanize the LGBTQ+ community’s fight for equal rights. Cheney’s recent death showed the incongruities of his career as a respected Wyoming congressman and the most polarizing politician ever to hold the nation’s second-highest office.
Allen is a welcome addition to this list. UW has many gifted athletes in its Hall of Fame, including football’s Jim Kiick and basketball’s Kenny Sailors. But it’s never retired an athlete’s number before.
Allen will set more records on his way to the NFL’s Hall of Fame. A solid high school football, baseball and basketball player, he dreamed of making the nearby Fresno State football team, but — like the rest of Division 1 colleges — it never recruited him.
UW wasn’t interested until it went to Reedley, a California junior college, to recruit another potential transfer player. Former Fresno State assistant coach Dave Brown, who was familiar with Allen, had just joined UW’s staff and urged that he be recruited.
So even though the Fresno State Bulldogs snubbed him, this connection paved the way for Allen’s success at UW, which turned into his shot at NFL fame.
Thanks, Coach Brown! If it wasn’t for you and the best recommendation you ever made, the man who has united so many Wyomingites in an almost magical way wouldn’t be a part of our lives.

(Anteia McCollum/Idaho Capital Sun)A North Idaho hospital and a major Idaho health insurer are struggling to renegotiate a contract to keep the hospital in network. 
Kootenai Health and Regence BlueShield of Idaho are “at an impasse” to renegotiate the provider care contract, state officials recently said. 
If a deal isn’t struck by Jan. 1, the Coeur d’Alene hospital could become out-of-network for Regence, which runs the health insurance plan for state government employees and several other plans. The contract ending could raise health care costs at the hospital for around 11,000 Idahoans. 
Regence and Kootenai Health say the struggle to strike a deal has revolved around setting fair rates for the hospital.
Regence Blue Shield of Idaho’s vice president of network management, Ryan Pharis, said negotiations are still underway.
“Many of these negotiations go unnoticed by the public because the two parties are able to reach that mutually agreeable, common ground at the end,” he told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview Friday. “… Negotiations are tending to get more complex as we see health care seemingly becoming more and more complex all the time.”
Kootenai Health’s communications and marketing director, Kim Anderson, said the hospital and insurer hope to reach a deal soon.
“Kootenai Health is working closely with Regence BlueShield to renew our contract and ensure continued in-network access for Regence members,” she said in a statement. “Our shared goal is to reach a favorable agreement before the end of the year — one that supports both organizations and protects access to high-quality, local care for our community.”

 Who would be affected if the contract ends?

The negotiation “affects all of Regence’s book of business with Kootenai Health,” officials with the Idaho Office of Group Insurance told North Idaho enrollees in the state employee’s insurance plan in a letter Nov. 10.  
About 11,000 Idahoans across commercial plans and less than 200 people on Medicare Advantage plans could be affected, Pharis said. About 1,000 members of the state’s insurance plan, which insures state employees and their family members, could be affected, said Idaho Department of Administration spokesperson Kim Rau.
State officials said Regence will on Nov. 24 start notifying enrollees who received care from the Coeur d’Alene Hospital via letters. People with questions should call Regence’s customer service at 1-800-854-5585.
 What services would be affected?

Coverage for non-emergency services at the hospital — including inpatient and outpatient surgeries and services — would be affected by the contract’s end, Kootenai Health says.

Some people could continue seeing their providers at in-network rates for 90-days after the contract’s potential end date, if they qualify for continuity of care under federal law, the Idaho Office of Group Insurance explained. That applies for pregnant women, people who are already getting treatment or have some severe health issues, and people who have scheduled surgeries or procedures that aren’t elective. 
Emergency care will continue to be covered at in-network rates, because of the federal law called the No Surprises Act, state officials say.
Regence updated its records about which providers are in network and out of network, Rau said. 
“We encourage Regence members to log into their Regence portal, visit the provider search tool at Regence.com, or call customer service on the back of their ID card, to determine which providers and facilities might be a good option,” she said. “Options for care will likely include options in the Spokane area, which may be in-network.”
 Why the health insurance contract negotiations are struggling

In a blog post dated Nov. 6, Regence said that “Kootenai Health’s leadership issued a termination notice” unless Regence “agree(s) to a double-digit increase that would raise the annual cost of health care in the state by an estimated $15 million.”
While the insurer said it was negotiating in good faith, it was also bracing to be removed from the hospital’s network.
“Over the course of two months, we have made multiple attempts to reach a fair and sustainable agreement with Kootenai Health’s leadership. They have declined all offers and continue to insist on unsustainable increases in what we pay them to care for our members,” Regence said.
Pharis, with Regence, wouldn’t offer specifics on the rates under negotiation. 
“The ask on the table from Kootenai Health right now is larger than what they have agreed to in past years,” he said in an interview. “… We have provided data, much of which is from their own transparency data sources that are available to the public, that supports our position and the offers that we have put forth to Kootenai Health.”
On the hospital’s website, Kootenai Health said it was hopeful negotiations would resolve. But in another, also undated, post, the hospital portrayed the contract negotiations as having already failed, saying “Kootenai will no longer be part of the Regence network of hospitals.”
Pharis said the hospital’s statements that said the contract was ending came first, before the hospital softened messaging to say negotiations are still underway. 
Kootenai Health’s website notice portraying negotiations as failed says parties couldn’t agree on rates “that are sustainable” for the hospital. “Despite the hospital’s good faith efforts, Kootenai and Regence BlueShield were unable to agree upon mutually acceptable contract terms and rates that are sustainable for Kootenai Health,” the hospital’s website says.
On that frequently asked question page, Kootenai Health said: “We worked hard to reach an agreement with Regence, but their requirements were outside what we could accept in good conscience. In the end, we determined that accepting contract terms with rates below market value is risky, unsustainable for Kootenai Health, and would not be a responsible choice for our hospital.”

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo joined a bi-partisan group of U.S. senators to ask for additional seasonal worker visas. 
More than 30 senators signed the Nov. 13 letter to heads of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Department of Labor to ask that they release the additional H-2B visas, which allow qualifying employers to hire temporary, non-agricultural workers from other countries. There is a separate program for seasonal agriculture workers, under H-2A. 
“We write on behalf of the seasonal businesses in our states who lack sufficient employees to
support their operations and sustain their businesses,” senators wrote to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer. 
Congress has set a cap of 66,000 per year, split evenly between the first and second halves of the fiscal year. The federal lawmakers asked that the agencies use authority provided to release additional supplemental visas, which are largely reserved for returning workers, according to the letter. 
“These visas will allow employers to supplement their U.S. workforce to keep their businesses open, as well as provide additional certainty regarding their workforce planning decisions in the coming months,” the letter said. 
Under the H-2B program, employers must first make a concerted effort to hire American workers and can use guest workers when the local workforce is insufficient. The letter cited a 2020 Government Accountability Office report that found “counties with H-2B employers generally had lower unemployment rates and higher average weekly wages than counties that do not have any H-2B employers.”
In Idaho, many applications for these types of guest workers were for forestry workers, as well as construction laborers, landscaping and packers, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor. 
As of the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, there were more than 3,500 H-2B workers certified in the state. The most workers were employed by Idaho forestry companies. More than 4,000 visas were requested in Idaho. 
U.S. Sens. Angus King, I-Maine, and Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, spearheaded the letter, according to King’s office. The letter was also signed by Democrats from Oregon and Washington and Republicans from Montana and Wyoming.

Josh Stein's State of the State address on March 12, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)It’s been a hallmark of most of the noteworthy political movements that have emerged and risen to power in modern times that their leaders aspired to use government power to improve society. Plenty of these movements were deeply flawed or downright fraudulent, but virtually all – even some of the worst authoritarian parties and leaders –have at least professed to have a plan for using the levers of power in an intentional way to make life better for average people.
Here in the U.S., until recently, even archconservatives who opposed many social welfare programs were still committed to strengthening the national defense in order to help defend the nation and its allies against foreign adversaries, and to boosting basic components of societal infrastructure that they saw as aiding in that effort — like public education, transportation and public health.
Weirdly and disturbingly, however, this is not the case with the MAGA movement. While it’s true that Donald Trump regularly dispenses absurd and delusional promises to magically solve every societal ill – promises that not even his most ardent supporters take seriously – when it comes to fashioning a real agenda for getting things done, the modern right is consistently and harmfully silent.
Indeed, save for their efforts to: a) enhance state police power vis a vis immigrant communities and women seeking to control their own reproduction, and b) strengthen their own capacity to remain in power through gerrymandering and election-rigging tactics, it’s clear that the main objective of MAGA conservatives when it comes to public structures is tearing things down.
Nowhere is this better exemplified than in North Carolina where, after a decade and a half of conservative Republican dominance in state government, it’s virtually impossible to identify any public system or structure – public and higher education, public health, environmental protection, transportation, courts and corrections — in which things are demonstrably better than they were at the start of GOP rule.
And nowhere is this sad pattern better exemplified today in North Carolina than in the current destructive budget stalemate between conservative leaders at the General Assembly.
North Carolina is now almost five months into the 2025-26 fiscal year, and it continues to operate without a new state budget. As a result, numerous core public structures and systems – perhaps most notably, its already fragile and dramatically under-resourced Medicaid health insurance program – are operating under old law and old, inadequate appropriations.
Mind you, this is not – as an outsider might superficially surmise – the result of a conflict between the state’s Republican-controlled legislature and its Democratic governor.  
No, in this case, GOP legislative leaders never even passed a comprehensive budget bill for Democratic Gov. Josh Stein to consider. Instead, the state is being held hostage to their internal disputes over how drastically and rapidly to further eviscerate the state’s regressive and inadequate income tax structure, as well as a series of other mostly petty matters – like Senate Leader Phil Berger’s need to appear sufficiently reactionary as he tries to fend off a far-right Republican primary challenger in 2026.
Gov. Stein has done his best to break the logjam and direct public attention to the destructive impact the stalemate is having – particularly on the Medicaid program, where the lack of funding certainty has forced his Health and Human Services department to slash reimbursements to providers to maintain program solvency. Earlier this month, he took the extraordinary step of calling lawmakers to Raleigh for a special legislative session to address the rapidly metastasizing problem that is likely to soon lead to preventable deaths of people no longer able to access health care. 
It was precisely the kind of strong and common-sense leadership that North Carolinians undoubtedly expected when they elected Stein by a wide margin last November. The session was supposed to have commenced on Monday.
Unfortunately, legislative leaders were unmoved. Much like the Republicans in Washington who, despite their control of both Congress and the White House, allowed their own internal conflicts to translate into a record-breaking federal government shutdown and huge new health insurance rate hikes for millions of Americans, state Senate and House leaders have simply ignored Stein’s directive and, in true Trumpian fashion, tried to disavow blame for the Medicaid crisis that their own failure to act has created.
And so, it appears that, absent a hard-to-imagine political 180, Republican leaders will stick to their plan to hold no further votes during the on-again, off-again 2025 legislative session, thereby allowing the Medicaid program – and dozens of other vitally important public structures and services — to wither on the vine while thousands of North Carolinians needlessly suffer. 
And once again, instead of coming together to intentionally use the levers of government power to make life better for the many, Republican leaders will, in true MAGA fashion, remain committed to a do-nothing agenda for which the only discernible unifying principles are dysfunction and cruelty.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0870-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 08:56:23.028229

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Congressman Riley Moore said he’d introduce legislation Monday with the goal of growing a training center for border patrol agents in Harpers Ferry.
The bill would authorize a land transfer between U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the National Park Service to expand Customs and Border Protection’s Advanced Training Center. It would transfer 25 acres of National Park Service land to U.S. Customs in exchange for 72 acres of Custom’s land.
A news release Monday from Moore’s office said it was “the final barrier” to expanding the training center to accommodate increased border patrol training needs under President Donald Trump’s immigration and border policies. 
“With more than 18,000 new border patrol agents authorized under the One Big Beautiful Bill, this expansion to the Advanced Training Center in Harpers Ferry is essential,” said Moore, R-W.Va.
He continued, “This land swap solution strengthens our border, bolsters national security, and brings additional opportunity to West Virginia. Harpers Ferry plays a vital role in preparing the brave men and women who safeguard our nation every day. I am proud to introduce legislation that finally allows this important expansion to move forward.”
The bill was not available on Congress’ website as of Monday afternoon.
Moore’s office said that both the Biden and Trump administrations supported expanding the Harpers Ferry Advanced Training Center, but existing land boundaries prevented such progress. 
“The new influx of federal agents has made the need even more urgent,” the release said. “ … The newly authorized expansion will accommodate increased personnel, enhance operational readiness and training requirements and support the Trump Administration’s expanded border security mandates.”
Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va., said the legislation authorizing the expansion was “critical to ensuring our agents [were] equipped with the training and tools necessary to perform their duties effectively.”
“This land transfer will enable CBP to enhance and modernize its training operations so they can continue meeting the demands of their mission,” she said in a statement. 
Rep. Mike Simpson, R-ID, serves as Chairman of the House Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee.
“Authorizing this land transfer will provide the brave Border Patrol agents with the necessary training resources to keep our homeland safe,” Simpson wrote. “I am also pleased that this bill will help preserve a section of the historic Battle of Harpers Ferry battlefield, ensuring that future generations can enjoy the land and history of the site.”
Gov. Patrick Morrisey has partnered with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement to support Trump’s immigration crackdown. The state is participating in ICE’s 287(g) program that allows specially-trained local and state police and National Guard members to perform specific enforcement duties of ICE agents. The governor announced last month that the partnership resulted in the arrests of 60 undocumented immigrants. 
ICE is also paying some West Virginia jails $90 for each day it holds immigrant detainees. Three of the jails working with ICE were over capacity, according to the latest data shared with state lawmakers.

The state is the custodian of roughly $140 million to $150 millions of dollars in abandoned funds, by Unclaimed Property Division Director Susan Sommerfeld’s estimate.
Money can become unclaimed properly if it sits untouched for a certain period of time — like if someone fails to cash a check or forgets about a bank account, for example. If the business holding the money cannot get in touch with the owner, it must turn the funds over to the state.
The state hangs onto the unclaimed property in hopes that it can eventually return it to its rightful owner. So far the state has returned more than $128 million in unclaimed property, according to the division. 
Usually, the owner has to file a claim to get their money back and provide enough information to prove it’s theirs.
But under a recent amendment to state law, the Department of Trust Lands’ Unclaimed Property Division now has more authority to waive that requirement. 
This has enabled the division to test out a new program to return some money by mailing checks to owners.
“It used to be too doggone hard for people to get their money back,” Sommerfeld said. “But it’s not anymore.”
This simplified approach is only available in certain circumstances, Sommerfeld said.
For one, the division has to make 100% sure it’s certain it’s sending the money to the right person and the right address, she said. The agency uses databases to verify this information.
At this time, the state is also only mailing checks for unclaimed property valued between $50 and $1,000.
“We wanted to make it enough so that people would want to cash that check, but not so much that it looks fake,” she said.
The division has already sent out letters to its first set of owners notifying them that they have unclaimed property and to be on the look out for money coming via check in early December.
Even for those ineligible to receive a check in the mail, these days it’s generally fairly easy to get money back, Sommerfeld said. 
“When I started in this unclaimed property world, every single claim that we had had to be on paper, and it had to be notarized,” she said.
North Dakotans can check if they have unclaimed property and file claims at unclaimedproperty.nd.gov.
In instances where a claim is required, owners may need to provide additional information. Depending on the situation, that could include ID, proof of their address, a Social Security number and potentially proof that they did business with the company that previously held their money, Sommerfeld said.
While in the hands of the state, the money is invested in the Common Schools Trust Fund, which funds K-12 schools.

(Photo by Jacob Wackerhausen/Getty Images)When we found out we were expecting, we did what so many parents do. We thought about names, we dreamed about who our baby might become, and we started preparing our home for the little boy we were so eager to meet.
At 20 weeks, we walked into a routine exam and our lives changed forever. We discovered that my body had begun moving toward labor far too early. It wasn’t anyone’s fault; it was simply my body’s way of protecting itself from something that was going wrong.
Idaho is losing OB-GYNs. Doctors who remain are trying to shoulder the extra burdens.

Our doctors compassionately explained that the recommended course of action to preserve my future fertility, and perhaps my life, was to deliver early. It was a terrible diagnosis knowing that Remy — the name we’d chosen for our son — would not be able to survive.
In most places, and even in Idaho just a few years ago, that heartbreaking decision would have stayed between us, our family, and our doctors. The anxiety of making life-changing decisions would have been eased slightly by grieving quietly in our room or even going home to process together.
But in Idaho, a new abortion ban criminalizes doctors for providing care in situations like mine. Instead of being able to deliver the treatment they recommended, they worked rapidly to organize a way for me to fly to a hospital out of state.
I was thunder jacketed into a gurney and rolled onto a plane — terrified of what could happen along the journey or before my husband arrived to meet me in Salt Lake. The compassion from the medical team is something I’ll never forget. Staff lined the hallway, holding out their hands and whispering encouragement as I passed, knowing it was likely one of the scariest and most emotional days of my life.
The worst day of our lives was made even harder because politicians inserted themselves into what should have been a private moment of grief and personal decision-making for our family. No family should ever have to choose between waiting until it’s almost too late.
After losing Remy, we tried to make sense of what happened. We met with lawmakers, hoping to explain the real, unintended repercussions of Idaho’s abortion ban. Instead, we were told our experiences weren’t real. To have lived through such trauma and then be dismissed by those in power — by those who are here to serve the people of Idaho — it was devastating. But it also made one thing clear: Our politicians aren’t listening to Idaho families.
Before this experience, we had no idea the degree to which Idaho’s current abortion ban prevents doctors from providing the care their patients need. But our current law clearly criminalizes care. That moment of crisis can affect anyone at any time. And I hope no one else is caught unaware.
To honor Remy’s memory, we took our grief and turned it to action. Since lawmakers refused to listen, we got involved with Idahoans United for Women and Families. They are using the citizen-led ballot initiative process to write our own law, restoring us to the standard of reproductive healthcare access Idahoans had for nearly 50 years.
We, and Idahoans United for Women and Families, believe that personal, private medical decisions should be left between a woman, her family, and her doctor. That’s why the organization is working to collect signatures to place the Reproductive Freedom and Privacy Act on the ballot.
Thanks to the rapid response of the St. Luke’s team, my fertility was preserved. Because of that, we recently welcomed a baby girl to our family. We dream of her future and all that she’ll become. We dream of an Idaho that considers her — that values her health and her life. We want her to grow up in a state where she can build a family on her own terms, with safety and dignity. That’s the Idaho we’re fighting for.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer-Focht/Tennessee Lookout) The federal government has entered into contracts worth millions of dollars to purchase food and lodging for the Tennessee National Guard in Memphis, new court filings say. 
Hotel contracts to house the troops have a current balance of $5,178,816, while contracts for meals have a $1,123,875 balance, according to a declaration by Lieut. Col. Dallas Clements, deputy director of military support for the Tennessee National Guard.
The declaration did not detail the length of the contracts or describe what payments to vendors, if any, the federal government has already made.
Clements’ declaration was filed Friday as part of the state’s defense in an ongoing legal challenge to the presence of the Tennessee National Guard in Memphis. Late Monday, Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal issued a temporary injunction blocking the deployment of the Guard to Memphis. The injunction was sought by a group of Democratic lawmakers, including Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, who allege that Gov. Bill Lee lacks the legal authority to do so under state law and the Tennessee Constitution.
Hundreds more National Guard headed to Memphis even as judge weighs request for temporary injunction

Lawyers defending the state submitted Clements’ declaration in support of their request that the elected officials post an $8 million bond in the case. Bonds are typically sought as a form of insurance to reimburse a party who incurs economic losses during a case but ultimately prevails. On Monday, Moskal ordered a $50,000 bond.
Lee, who commands the Guard, agreed to send troops to Memphis as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force convened by an executive order from President Donald Trump.
As of Friday, there were 719 National Guard supporting the work of the task force, according to Clements. 
That number is significantly higher than Guard personnel reported by the Memphis Police Department last week. A police department spokesperson said Thursday she estimated the total presence stood at 140-180 and would soon increase to 350.
The Guard is among hundreds of state and federal law enforcement officers currently in the city, issuing traffic tickets, serving warrants and making immigration arrests. 
The total cost for pay, allowances and benefits for activating up to 1,000 members of Tennessee National Guard in Memphis through Sept. 30, 2026 is estimated at $226 million, according to a Sept. 18 memo issued by Elbridge Colby, Under Secretary of War for Policy included in the request for bond.
“I don’t feel safe”: Black Memphis residents report harassment by Trump’s police task force

Clements also noted there are 1653 National Guard assigned to Memphis-area duties that predate the task force, requesting that, if the court issues a temporary injunction, it is tailored so it does not interfere with these Guard members ongoing duties.  They have ongoing assignments with the 164th Airlift Wing that supports “global air mobility” on an ongoing basis. The nearby Millington Armory has long been home to a military police academy. And the Tennessee National Guard has had a storefront recruitment center in nearby Cordova.
The judge’s order on Monday specifically enjoins only the Guard members activated in accordance with the president’s memorandum establishing the Memphis Safe Task Force.
“It is vital that any orders connected to this lawsuit be tailored to address only National Guard support to the Memphis Safe task force,” he wrote.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS –Nurse practitioner Kelly Baquet says she is tired of diagnosing patients with HIV.
“We have so many tools to prevent HIV now,” she said. “I want to be a part of ending the epidemic.”
Baquet, a former nurse practitioner at the New Orleans Planned Parenthood health center, started The Clinic NOLA earlier this month with two other former colleagues, Pat Thomas and Dominique Berryhill, in order to help fill the gap in the region’s sexual and reproductive health care left by the recent closure of Planned Parenthood following federal funding cuts in President Trump’s massive tax-and-spending bill passed this year.
The South accounts for the biggest share of HIV diagnoses in the country — in 2023, Louisiana ranked fourth in HIV diagnoses, according to the CDC — but lags other regions in use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drugs for HIV prevention. Louisiana also recently ranked number one in the country for chlamydia cases, followed by number two for gonorrhea, according to the CDC.
The state also has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country. One third of parishes lack a single OB/GYN, according to a 2022 March of Dimes analysis.

The Clinic NOLA, which opened on Nov. 1, offers STI testing and treatment, birth control, breast exams, PrEP and well-woman exams. Baquet said she is open to discussing a variety of family planning options. In the future, Baquet said she hopes to expand the clinic’s services to include prenatal care, such as ultrasound testing, miscarriage management and care for other pregnancy complications up to 12 weeks.
“The main goal of The Clinic NOLA is to break down the barrier to access to care,” she said. “We want to provide same day or next day services to the people of New Orleans or the Gulf Coast.”
Baquet said the space is intentionally designed to be warm and inviting, with wood paneling and comfy chairs, unlike a typical doctor’s office. For Gulf Coast patients who miss the short appointment wait times and wide range of services that were available at Planned Parenthood — which closed down its two Louisiana health centers on Sept. 30 — The Clinic NOLA aims to offer a comparable experience.
“The services that we provide are very similar,” Baquet said. “My motto is ‘this is a place of choice.’”

To address the issue of women feeling forced to cancel long-awaited doctor’s appointments because they could not find childcare, Baquet said she encourages patients to bring their children to the clinic, where there is a coloring table set up in the hallway.
“We don’t want it to feel like you’re coming to a doctor’s office. We want it to feel like you’re coming into our home,” she said.
The clinic accepts patients ages 10 and older for reproductive healthcare and patients ages 18 and older for hormone replacement therapy. Baquet said she currently has the capacity to see 20 to 30 patients a day and expects to hire more staff as the clinic’s patient base grows.
Baquet said the clinic has already seen a patient from out of state and a patient who drove from three hours away across Louisiana. The clinic offers telehealth services and is open on Saturdays from 8 a.m. to noon to help serve patients who work full-time during the week.
The Clinic NOLA is located Uptown at 1534 Aline Street near Touro Hospital in an unmarked building. Baquet said she gave the clinic a discreet name to help patients feel more comfortable and safe.
“When I hear people talk about going to the doctor’s office, they don’t often like to say the name of the place,” she said. “They’ll say ‘I’m going to the clinic,’ and so that’s where that came from.”
Pat Thomas worked as a medical assistant at Planned Parenthood in New Orleans for 20 years, up until its closure in September. She said she was more than happy to get on board when Baquet asked her if she wanted to help launch The Clinic NOLA.
Thomas said she predicts an influx of new patients ahead of the holiday season.
“At family gatherings you get to talking about medical care,” she said. “‘You know, ‘it’s time for my mammogram, it’s time for my pap smear. Oh, I haven’t had an STI screening. I need treatment.’”
The clinic accepts all major health insurance plans including Medicaid. For patients without insurance or those who choose not to use their insurance, the clinic also offers a self-pay scale to inform patients of the total cost of services before they receive care.
The Clinic NOLA is not a federally qualified health center, meaning it does not receive federal funding or offer a sliding scale payment system, which would allow patients to pay for services based on their income.
The Clinic NOLA plans not to turn away any patients, regardless of insurance status. Thomas said after a long career in providing reproductive healthcare, she looks forward to continuing work alongside Baquet, whose treatment of patients she calls “wonderful.”
“I think it’s awesome to be able to offer the care that so many need,” Thomas said. “I have a love for people and I just love to see people happy.”

“I don’t think we’re approving too many charters,” Bruce Friend, chair of the board, told NC Newsline Thursday. “Our goal is to make sure we’re approving the right charter applicants. When you’re sitting in that chair and acting as the authorizer, you want to be sure you’re doing your due diligence — that the schools that are ready get approved and the ones that aren’t ready don’t.”
Friend’s comments come after Triad International Studies Academy, a Guilford County charter school that opened in August, shut down just two months later. The school enrolled just 45 students, far below its projection of 144 and short of the state’s minimum requirement of 80.
The closure left families scrambling for alternatives and prompted board members and state officials to reexamine how new charters are evaluated before opening.
“Those parents are very upset, as they should be,” Friend said at the board’s recent meeting. “But they should be upset at the board members of that school. They’re the ones who put your child in that situation, not us.”
The closure was the second in two years for a new North Carolina charter school that failed to make it through its first school year. State data show that only about 26% of new charter schools in the past five years met or exceeded their enrollment projections, and more than half of those that missed the mark are now closed or never opened.
Even so, the review board and its predecessor have granted final authorization to 28 of 34 schools that made it through the review process over the last five years. Final authorization comes after a yearlong “Ready to Open” period in which applicants must demonstrate financial stability, governance capacity and sufficient demand.
Friend pushed back on concerns that the high approval rate reflects a lax process. “It’s hard to put a percentage on how many should get approved every year. I don’t look at it through that lens. I look at it through making sure the schools with strong boards and solid plans are the ones that move forward.”
In 2023, the Republican-led General Assembly passed House Bill 618, shifting charter oversight away from the former Charter School Advisory Board, which had been in existence since 2013 under the Democratic-led State Board of Education, to a newly created Charter Schools Review Board, appointed by Republican lawmakers, that had far greater authority than its predecessor.
The CSRB was granted final power to approve, deny, renew, and revoke charter applications, a role that previously belonged ultimately to the State Board of Education. Under the 2023 law, the State Board of Education retained some key functions, including rulemaking, charter funding, and hearing appeals from CSRB denials, but it no longer made the final decision on most charter applications.
At the time, critics of the change argued the new structure would reduce accountability and could lead to the approval of too many charter schools that were not fully prepared to open.
NC Newsline reached out to both the chair and vice chair of the state board of education but has not heard back.
In the most recent application cycle, 14 new charter school applications were submitted statewide. Of those, one applicant withdrew, six were approved, and six were denied. Another is awaiting approval.
“We do all of our homework and due diligence to hopefully make that happen whenever we’re approving the schools that come before us, the applicants that come before us,” Friend said.
The review board is now weighing changes to the Ready to Open process, following recommendations from the Office of Charter Schools. Proposed revisions would require two appearances before the board — one in May and another in June — and could impose automatic one-year delays for schools that miss new enrollment or budget benchmarks.
“This is about sustainability,” said Ashley Logue, the office’s executive director. “If it’s not grounded in data and being realistic about how hard it is to open a school, it can lead to a lot of problems.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bRUCEfRIEND.jpg,,,2025-11-18 08:56:23.028229

(Courtesy of CPW)With the third winter “release season” in Colorado’s gray wolf reintroduction plan just weeks away, state wildlife officials are scrambling to find a source for additional relocated wolves.
A deal to source up to 15 animals from British Columbia is in doubt after the federal government, under pressure from livestock groups and conservative activists, ordered Colorado Parks and Wildlife not to import Canadian wolves. Officials in the Republican-controlled states of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, home to large and well-established wolf populations, have made it clear that they won’t help Colorado’s restoration efforts.
And one of CPW’s few remaining options was taken off the table Saturday when its request to capture and relocate wolves from Washington was rejected by wildlife commissioners there.
“I certainly heard loud and clear from Washingtonians this morning, (on) all different sides of the aisle, saying it’s just not the time for us to support this,” said Lorna Smith, a conservation advocate and member of the Washington Fish and Wildlife Commission.

Colorado’s restoration plan calls for annual releases of 10 to 15 relocated wolves for the program’s first three to five years, with an initial target population of 50 individuals. CPW captured and relocated 10 wolves from Oregon in December 2023 and another 15 from Canada in January 2025.
In an Oct. 28 letter to Washington wildlife officials, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis wrote that while the state’s goal is to secure up to 15 wolves again this winter, “even 5-7 would be extremely helpful towards successful species recovery.” CPW Director Jeff Davis, speaking to the commission in Washington on Saturday, reiterated that Colorado would cover the costs of capture and relocation operations, which could take place at any point through the end of February.
Washington’s reported wolf population declined in 2024 for the first time since confirmed wolf packs were reestablished in the state in 2008. Kelly Susewind, director of the state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, told commissioners that the decision was up to them.
“We’ve assessed this with our staff — we feel that biologically, we can accommodate the request, should you choose to go that way, without interfering with our recovery effort,” said Susewind.
But on a motion from Smith, who cited the “cautionary message” of Washington’s declining 2024 wolf count, the commission voted 8-1 to deny Colorado’s request.
“I myself am really torn on this issue, because of course I’d love to see wolves recovered across the Rocky Mountain range, including Colorado,” Smith said. “But Washington’s wolves, I don’t believe are in a position to assist with that at this point in time.”
Federal intervention
After two years of winter releases, Colorado currently has a population of around 20 adult or yearling gray wolves, with an unknown number of new pups born to four confirmed breeding packs in 2025. Survival rates for relocated wolves have been lower in Colorado than in previous reintroduction efforts in the northern Rockies, but CPW officials say their efforts are on the right track.
Livestock groups — who opposed the 2020 voter-approved ballot measure requiring wolf restoration and have sought to delay or pause its implementation ever since — scored their biggest victory to date in the fight against the program last month, when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ordered CPW to halt any efforts to source wolves from outside a specified area in the northern Rockies, including Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and eastern portions of Washington and Oregon.
The USFWS letter claims that sourcing wolves from outside the northern Rockies is “violative” of the permit the agency issued for Colorado’s experimental wolf population under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act. But while the state’s 10(j) permit, issued in 2023, identifies northern Rockies wolves as a “preferred donor population,” it does not contain any such requirement or limitation on relocation operations.
“The 10(j) rule does not mandate that Colorado’s wolves come from specific states, period,” Thomas Delehanty, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, said in a statement at the time.
While Polis wrote in his letter to Washington officials that the state “disagree(s) with the legal basis for (the USFWS) analysis,” Davis said at last week’s meeting of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission that CPW is “working very diligently to be consistent with the letter.”
As it has for every year of the reintroduction program’s operation, a coalition of livestock groups and rural county commissioners has submitted a petition to pause additional wolf releases until at least November 2026.
In a brief statement Monday, CPW spokesperson Luke Perkins said the agency “continues to evaluate all options to support this year’s gray wolf releases in alignment with the approved Colorado Wolf Restoration and Management Plan and the 10(j) Rule.”

Vaden said Monday.
President Donald Trump’s administration previously hinted that it might devote up to $12 billion to aid payments for farmers who were hurt by tariff policies this year, Politico reported in late October.
“This department only woke back up on Thursday of last week,” Vaden said, referencing the Nov. 12 conclusion of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. “Lots of things changed during (the government shutdown),” including trade agreements with China, Southeast Asia, Pakistan and Japan, he added.
“Those have resulted in major commitments to buy American commodities and USDA now needs to take into account the effect that those commodity purchases will have on the market … going into 2026,” Vaden said.
TN Soybean farmers face ‘desperate situation’ amid inflation, weather extremes and tariffs

China is a top consumer of U.S. soybean exports, the largest agricultural export in the U.S. China froze purchases of U.S. soybeans this year while battling with Trump over tariffs, leaving U.S. soybean farmers without orders from their largest customer for months.
The White House announced a trade agreement with China in October in which China agreed to purchase at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of 2025, and at least 25 million metric tons each year through 2028.
But USDA data logging sales activity from Oct. 2 through Nov. 12 shows China made only two soybean purchases from the U.S. totaling 232,000 metric tons. Just 45 days remain until Jan. 1, 2026.
Asked what would happen if China does not meet the 12 million metric ton agreement by the Jan. 1 deadline, a USDA spokesperson wrote that the “farm economy is in a difficult situation” and Trump is “utilizing all the tools available to ensure farmers have what they need to continue their farming operations.”
The USDA will “continue to assess the farm economy and explore the need for further assistance, however, there is nothing new to share at this time,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to the Lookout.
Vaden’s remarks came during a Monday news conference announcing the second round of  federal disaster assistance for farmers through the USDA’s Supplemental Disaster Relief Program.
The department is “busy crunching those (trade agreement) numbers now and we’ll let you know when we have an announcement, but we would have had an announcement much earlier if we’d been open over the past 45 days, and unfortunately now, thanks to the minority in Congress, we’re playing catch-up,” he said.

Defend The Vote, which focuses on supporting candidates who will stand up to corruption and protect the right to vote, on Tuesday endorsed Matt Maasdam and state Sen. Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo), who are seeking the party’s nominations in Michigan’s 7th Congressional District and 4th Congressional District races, respectively.
In an announcement published Tuesday, Defend The Vote said the pair will take on the cost of corruption in Washington, D.C. to make life more affordable for working people.
“Mchigan families are fed up with rising costs and a broken government that ignores them,” said Brian Lemke, executive director of Defend The Vote. “Matt Maasdam and Sean McCann know that building an economy that lowers prices and creates real opportunity requires bold changes to crack down on corruption and hold politicians accountable. We’re excited to endorse them and look forward to helping them win next year.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The organization said both candidates are running on platforms committed to cracking down on corruption so Americans can live with lower costs, have greater access to health care, and ensure democracy works for the people – not just corporate lobbyists and billionaire donors. 
Defend The Vote also believes voters should choose Maasdam and McCann in their respective races because they will also protect the right to vote, and oppose any attempt to block eligible American citizens from the ballot box.
“It has never been more important to clean up the corruption that’s driving up costs for families   and to stand up for our voting rights so everyone’s voice is heard,” McCann said in a statement.
Maasdam, a retired Navy SEAL, said in a statement that defending the Constitution was his duty, both in and out of uniform.
“I’m running for Congress to continue the mission of protecting our democracy from the kind of corruption that throws working Michiganders under the bus so billionaire donors and corporate special interests can come out ahead,” Maasdam added.
Both said they were grateful for Defend The Vote’s endorsements, which could also bring in some monetary and logistical support down the stretch of their respective campaigns.
Defend The Vote and its action fund launched a $14 million campaign cycle plan earlier this year to support electing pro-democracy candidates. Meanwhile, the action fund is focusing on pro-democracy issue advocacy.
The support will come in the form of direct donations, fundraising, support from the Defend The Vote donor network, independent expenditures, issue briefings, messaging guidance and research. That includes on the ground and in-state support.
Josh Cowen drops out of Michigan 7th Congressional District race, endorses Bridget Brink

At least 108 candidates were assisted by Defend The Vote in the last campaign cycle, or about 75% of the candidates the organization endorsed.
With Maasdam and McCann now in their rotation, both candidates could see interesting boosts to their primary campaigns in the coming year.
Aside from Maasdam, the Michigan 7th Congressional District race includes former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, Elyon Badger, William Lawrence, Alexandra Prieditis and Muhammad Salman Rais. Michigan State University professor Josh Cowen was in the race before dropping out to endorse Brink.
The winner there will move on to face incumbent U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte).

On his social media platform he recently wrote: “2025 Thanksgiving dinner under Trump is 25% lower than 2024 Thanksgiving dinner under Biden, according to Walmart. My cost (sic) are lower than the Democrats on everything, especially oil and gas! So the Democrats’ ‘affordability’ issue is DEAD! STOP LYING!!!”
At a White House event the next day, Trump doubled down: “They came out and they said Trump’s Thanksgiving dinner — same things — is 25% less than Biden’s. … We are the ones that have done a great job on affordability, not the Democrats,” he said, calling Democrats’ focus on living costs a “con job.”
Here’s the problem: Trump’s claim isn’t based on federal data, independent analysis or even a consistent measure of prices. It’s based on a Walmart holiday promotion that changes every year. And because the lists aren’t remotely comparable, the claim doesn’t tell us much about affordability. So, in the name of “science” (and more than a little bit of curiosity), I decided to conduct a little experiment at the Walmart Supercenter off West New Circle Road in Lexington to see what was going on in the real world.
Talking turkey about prices
To be fair to the president, Walmart did announce that its 2025 Thanksgiving basket is “25% cheaper” than last year’s. As many outlets have pointed out, however, the two lists are nowhere near the same. This year’s basket includes 15 products, six fewer than the 21 in 2024. Count each item individually, and it’s 22 this year versus 29 last year. The pecan pie? Gone. Sweet potatoes? Gone. Two cans of cream of mushroom soup were cut to one. Fresh onions, celery and corn muffin mix? Also gone. In their place, there were sometimes substitutes, and three boxes of macaroni appear on the 2025 list but not the 2024 list.
Both the 2024 and 2025 Walmart Thanksgiving lists have been scrutinized and critiqued by journalists, who noted that their contents shift from year to year, making direct comparisons unreliable. Yet no one I could find has conducted an apples-to-apples comparison using the same 2024 basket of goods and pricing those identical items for 2025 — a method more aligned with how economists measure inflation. In fact, that’s exactly how the Consumer Price Index (CPI) works: It tracks the cost of the same fixed basket of goods over time to determine how prices have truly changed.

So that’s exactly what I did. Armed with last year’s Walmart Thanksgiving list, I went to the New Circle Road Walmart to find every item: same size turkey, same bag of potatoes, same cans of green beans and same cream of mushroom soup. Think of me as part bargain hunter, part social scientist. I prowled the aisles with the tenacity of someone who’s seen one too many “rollback” signs, even prompting a couple of Walmart employees to ask what I was up to.
What I found told a very different story than the one being shared by the president. Pricing last year’s exact basket in 2025 came to $59.37 or roughly $7.42 per person, about 6% higher than the cost of the same meal in 2024. (All food items were priced on Nov. 11.) 
The turkey alone rose from 88 cents per pound to 97 cents per pound (around a 10% increase), and staples like onions, potatoes and gravy mix may have ticked up as well. Some canned goods may have held steady, but nothing meaningfully dropped. The exact per-unit prices in 2024 are unknown, though Walmart stated the meal “… serves eight people for less than $7 per person.” For anyone shopping with a list and a calculator rather than a campaign slogan, the verdict is clear: Thanksgiving isn’t getting cheaper, no matter how many exclamation points you put after a sentence.
Facts over fanfare
Recreating last year’s full Walmart Thanksgiving basket in 2025 showed the truth: The same meal is about 6% more expensive — not 25% cheaper as claimed. Prices are still rising, even if the pace is a bit slower than the peak of inflation during the Biden administration.
I’ll admit this wasn’t a formal experiment conducted with all the rigor of a trained economist. I didn’t control for every variable or run multiple trials at multiple Walmart locations. But even a simple apples-to-apples comparison is far better than making bold statements without any data. Late night “truths” might grab headlines, but they are a poor gauge of affordability. 
A sale on turkey or taters doesn’t capture the costs Kentucky families and families across the nation face every day like rent, gas, health care, child care and other essentials. Using a limited, ever-changing basket of groceries to claim that “Thanksgiving is cheaper” misrepresents what affordability looks like for real households.
If we care about honest debates on the economy and what affordability looks like, we need reliable, consistent data, not marketing gimmicks or “truths” based on a retail promotion. Tools like the Consumer Price Index, produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, exist for a reason: They track real changes in prices over time so policymakers, the Federal Reserve, and citizens alike can make informed decisions about the economy. 
Plus, Kentucky families, who know the difference between a real deal and a “bless your heart” kind of deal, deserve an honest assessment of what’s getting more affordable and what’s not. And Kentucky families, who can stretch a dollar further than a Frankfort politician can stretch a mile of the Mountain Parkway, understand that true affordability isn’t determined by a catchy retail promotion; it’s measured with facts, not fanfare. When it comes to an honest assessment of affordability, leave the stuffing in the turkey, not in your economic analysis.

(Photo by Evan Houk/Maine Morning Star)Utility regulators are expected to decide Tuesday whether to throw out a plan from one of Maine’s major power companies that would increase rates over the next five years. 
The Maine Public Utilities Commission is slated to make its final decision on whether to move forward with a five-year plan from Central Maine Power to raise electricity rates that it argues are needed to make reliability and resiliency improvements, as well as enhance the customer experience. Since the plan was officially submitted in mid-September, the state energy office and public advocate have asked the commission to dismiss the case. 
On Nov. 7, commission staff recommended rejecting the state’s request to dismiss the proposal  so it can continue to move through the process before a final decision is made. However, the recommendation is not the final decision. That is slated to come from the meeting Tuesday.
Expanded customer service operations, tree-trimming and changes to storm cost recovery were named by CMP as the main drivers of the requested cost increase. 
If ultimately approved, the plan could increase rates for the average customer by $35 per month or $420 per year by 2030. About half of that increase, or $17, would be felt as soon as October 2026. The proposal has drawn pushback from ratepayers and advocates who say Mainers, especially seniors and low-income households, can’t afford another increase when the cost of living is already so high.
“Maine’s grid needs investment, but CMP’s rate hike is too much, too fast, without accountability, and giving too much profit to shareholders at a time when Maine ratepayers can least afford it,” said Rebecca Schultz, climate and clean energy senior advocate for the Natural Resources Council of Maine. 
The average CMP residential customer paid roughly $155 in August, up from $140 this time last year. Customers in Versant’s Bangor Hydro District saw their bills go up just over $20 this past year, from $148 to $169, while the average Versant Maine Public District consumer saw their bill increase from about $144 to $162.
In her request to dismiss the case, Public Advocate Heather Sanborn specifically asked the commission to reject the proposed rate increases beyond 2026 because they rely on long-term forecasts based on speculation. Rather, she suggests they seek a more typical one-year rate increase using data from 2024.
The Department of Energy Resources objects to the proposal because it argues CMP can’t prove the proposed rates are “just and reasonable” without first seeing the 10-year integrated grid plan the power company is supposed to file with the commission in January. 
In comments submitted to the commission, Central Maine Power said nothing in the statute mandating the integrated grid plan prevents it from trying to increase rates before completing that process. Rather, it argued that allowing the rate plan to be “litigated on the merits is the best path to achieve a multi-year rate plan that will provide just and reasonable rates for customers and the company.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_6166-scaled-e1696447794861-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-18 05:56:34.885059

Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia MercuryEnergy policy will be a major focus for Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger, as the state wrestles with growing demand, rising costs and questions about infrastructure needs. She is kicking off her transition into the governor’s mansion with three appointments to co-chair the energy policy team: Josephus Allmond, Will Cleveland and Angela Navarro.
With Democrats in charge, Spanberger targets lower energy bills — and higher costs for data centers

Josephus Allmond is a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, where he has worked for five years. Allmond is currently part of the Commission Electric Utility Regulation and is on the Utility Planning subcommittee. There have been recent discussions about the methodology of Integrated Resource Plans, which utilities have to file with the State Corporation Commission.
Allmond has also represented the advocacy group Appalachian Voices in some rate cases, namely the proposed rate increase by Appalachian Power Company in 2024. He has weighed in on the Dominion Energy shared solar SCC case for the same group. He is a staunch opponent of gas plants such as the forthcoming Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center and the proposed gas plant in Fluvanna.
Will Cleveland is an energy and environmental lawyer through Lighthouse Policy & Law and was registered as a lobbyist for Google. He previously worked as a staff attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, and is a board member of the Virginia Conservation Network. 
Cleveland also has been a member of the Clean Energy Advisory Board that worked on a pilot program to dole out loans for solar panels for low-income households, a program that has now gone defunct due to federal changes in funding. He has commented on energy efficiency and demand response playing major roles in achieving the goals of the Virginia Clean Economy Act.
Notably, Cleveland is involved in Dominion’s rate case that would create a new class for high load customers, such as data centers. His testimony for the case stated that Google isn’t opposed to a special rate class proposal, but a different plan created by a group of data center companies would be more “balanced” than Dominion’s. The SCC has not yet ruled on that case or determined if they would accept the data center companies’ plan.
Angela Navarro is no stranger to the executive branch of the commonwealth. She was a SCC commissioner for one year and managed the regulation of the state utilities. She also served as a deputy secretary of natural resources and commerce and trade under two separate democratic governors, Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam. Her focus in those roles was on the impacts of climate change, environmental protections and energy policy. 
Like her co-chairs, Navarro also served as a staff attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center earlier in her career.
For the last two years she has been the president of Energy Align Advisors that gives guidance to energy and tech companies about state regulations and policies. Her deep knowledge of Virginia energy regulations will help Spanberger navigate any potential reforms.
These selections point towards serious regulatory reform concerning renewable energy projects. The state has seen some challenges when it comes to local boards of supervisors considering such projects, like solar farms and battery storage.
With the continued expansion of data centers and the energy infrastructure needed to power them, having past regulators and a member deeply involved with the data center industry sends a message that Spanberger is bringing industry to the table when it comes to potential changes.
On the record: Abigail Spanberger

Before she was elected Virginia’s first female governor, Spanberger signaled that she has fresh plans for the state’s energy landscape that start with an accounting of what works, what doesn’t and what needs tweaking.
“I think (we need) an evaluation of where we have had successes, but also, importantly in some places, where have technologies changed? Battery storage technology has improved significantly and has a much greater utility than it even did five years ago,” Spanberger said in August. “And so I think, certainly with the same goals, (we should be) determining … where we should perhaps recalibrate or some places where we can look towards more aggressive forward leaning.”
She also laid out a comprehensive energy plan this summer. 
With a dominant Democratic hold on the House, Senate, and executive branch of state government, it’s likely that bills to expand or assist the VCEA will be a priority. House Democrats have already filed bills for the January legislative session that focus on energy efficiency, especially in low-income households. The General Assembly will convene on Jan. 14.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)The Trump administration has made deep cuts to the main federal agency focused on fighting opioid addiction, potentially jeopardizing the nation’s recent progress on reducing overdose deaths, some public health officials and providers say.
Created in 1992, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, known as SAMHSA, hands out billions in grants for mental health and addiction services. The agency, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, had a budget of about $7.5 billion last year.
Since January, the Trump administration has reduced the agency’s staff by more than half, scrapped $1.7 billion in block grants for state health departments and eliminated roughly $350 million in addiction and overdose prevention funding, according to a recent analysis by STAT, a health news website. The agency is currently without an administrator and is missing 12 of its 17 senior leaders.
Dr. Yngvild Olsen, the former director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment at SAMHSA, said almost all of SAMHSA’s substance misuse funding flows to state and local health departments, nonprofits and behavioral health providers on the front lines of the fight against addiction. She noted that the agency has worked with state and local partners to make sure naloxone, the overdose-reversal medication, is “in the hands of every person who needs it.”
“I’m not sure that a very reduced SAMHSA is going to really be able to continue that focus,” said Olsen, now an adviser to the consulting firm Manatt.
The ‘hard, slow work’ of reducing overdose deaths is having an effect

But Andrew Nixon, communications director for the Health and Human Services Department, said the Trump administration is “committed to tackling addiction with compassion and accountability, ensuring taxpayer dollars fund programs that lead to real recovery.”
“SAMHSA is prioritizing treatment, prevention and long-term recovery while ensuring all federally funded programs comply with the law,” Nixon said in an email.
In March, the administration announced that as part of a major restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services, it planned to fold SAMHSA and four other agencies into a new Administration for a Healthy America. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said the reorganization would reduce “bureaucratic sprawl.”
“We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy said in a statement.
In July, a federal judge in Rhode Island issued a preliminary injunction temporarily blocking the planned reorganization.
The cuts come at a time of steady progress in the fight against opioid addiction.
Overdose deaths have fallen consistently since 2023. As of April, the latest figures available, there were 76,500 deaths over the previous 12 months — the lowest year-over-year tally since March 2020. The pandemic drove the number as high as nearly 113,000 in the summer of 2023, according to federal statistics.
A more timely indicator of overdoses — nonfatal suspected overdose patients in hospital emergency departments — was down 7% this year through August compared with 2024, according to a recent Stateline analysis of statistics from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Only a few states and the District of Columbia saw a rise in nonfatal overdoses for the year. The largest increases were 17% in the district, 16% in Rhode Island, 15% in Delaware, 11% in Connecticut and 10% in New Mexico, with smaller increases in Colorado, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, South Dakota, Utah, New Jersey and Minnesota.
Sara Goldsby, director of the South Carolina Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities, said the SAMHSA cuts come at a time when her state is making “good progress, like other states are, to get a handle on the drug crisis.” But Goldsby cautioned that “constant surveillance of the trends” is essential.
Many Black, Latino people can’t get opioid addiction med. Medicaid cuts may make it harder.

In New York, the staff cuts at SAMHSA have created uncertainty, according to Jihoon Kim, president and CEO of the Albany-based InUnity Alliance, which advocates for mental health and substance use organizations across the state. Federal grants account for about half of his members’ funding, he said.
“As the Trump administration has been dismantling SAMHSA and other agencies, the points of contact for a lot of my members have just vanished,” Kim said in an interview.
“We have a lot of providers who have no information — they just do not know what’s happening with their contract renewals. They continue to deliver services, and at some point they will be delivering services without the resources to do so from the federal government.”
COVID-era grants
Some of the SAMHSA grants the administration terminated earlier this year were COVID-era expenditures scheduled to expire in September. Since the pandemic is over, HHS argued, there was no need for money to continue to flow.
Some state health officials Stateline contacted, including in California, Idaho, Maryland, Missouri and West Virginia, said the early cutoff hadn’t had much of an impact, either because they had already spent the money they were promised or resisted spending it on ongoing services.
But health officials and providers in other states told a different story.
Texas was counting on SAMHSA to provide about 77% of the agency’s annual budget for substance use programs, Thomas Vazquez, assistant press officer at the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, wrote in an email. The early cancellation of the COVID-era money deprived the state of more than $24.7 million it planned to use to combat substance misuse.
Telemedicine patients with opioid use disorder struggle to fill prescriptions

In South Carolina, Wendy Hughes, president and CEO of the Lexington/Richland Alcohol and Drug Abuse Council, said her organization didn’t have enough money before the pandemic. So the loss of the extra money, combined with inflation, “feels like a major cut.”
“The cuts had a very significant impact on my organization in particular, as well as the others throughout the state,” Hughes said. “What it meant was a fairly significant cut to a lot of our outpatient services. We also got a cut to our inpatient services, or detox. And for us, what that meant was we ended up eliminating some of our positions.”
Hughes said her organization secured some additional state funding to mitigate some of the losses and has tried to preserve what it views as the most essential services, such as drug treatment for pregnant women and new mothers.
Uncertain future
Some public health officials and providers of addiction services worry this year’s SAMHSA grant cuts are only the beginning.
The Biden administration strongly supported efforts to make drug use less dangerous, such as increasing the availability of naloxone kits and training on how to use them. But President Donald Trump in July signed an executive order stating that SAMHSA grants will no longer “fund programs that fail to achieve adequate outcomes, including so-called ‘harm reduction’ or ‘safe consumption’ efforts that only facilitate drug use and its attendant harm.”











States have now become very anxious and nervous about the use of any federal funds for any part of their harm reduction organization.


– Dr. Yngvild Olsen, former director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment at SAMHSA



In addition to making naloxone more widely available, harm reduction measures include needle exchanges, overdose prevention sites, fentanyl tests and wound care. Olsen, the former director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment at SAMHSA, said Trump’s order has created widespread confusion.
“States have now become very anxious and nervous about the use of any federal funds for any part of their harm reduction organization, including staff that may have been involved in handing out naloxone,” Olsen said. “Because of the wording of some of the messages and some of the guidance from SAMHSA, it’s just very unclear as to what it is that they’re really allowed to do versus not allowed to do, with respect to harm reduction.”
Meanwhile, the Medicaid changes included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed in July, including new work requirements and more than $900 billion in spending cuts over the next decade, will result in many people with substance use disorder losing their health care coverage and, potentially, their access to treatment.
The Medicaid changes in the law will decrease the number of people with health insurance by about 7.5 million people by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Medicaid, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states, pays for a significant portion of mental health and substance use care in the United States.
“States were already struggling to meet the demand for treatment,” said Hanna Sharif-Kazemi, a policy manager at the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance, which advocates for health care instead of punishment for drug users.
“While the Trump administration says that they are trying to do these federal funding cuts as a way to get rid of duplicate funding streams, what they’re actually doing is removing … tools in our tool belt. And this is not the time for us to be getting rid of tools. We actually needed more tools and more funding in our tool belt to begin with. So it is really disappointing.”

(Photo courtesy of the Department of Corrections, graphic by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Department of Corrections has made little discernible progress in fixing an aging wastewater plant that regularly violates its federal water permit, public records show.
The department missed a 2024 deadline for completing repairs to the Cummins-Varner Wastewater Treatment Plant and returning the facility to compliance with its wastewater permit. Despite an extension of the deadline to 2027, the corrections department has yet to move beyond the early planning stages on an expansion of the plant’s capacity.
The wastewater plant serves two of the state’s largest prisons and has been under a consent administrative order from the state’s environmental agency since 2022. Consent administrative orders (CAOs) are legally binding, voluntary agreements between the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality and those who have violated or are believed to have violated state or federal environmental regulations. The orders outline steps to return to compliance and monetary penalties, and violators do not have to admit fault by signing one.
While DEQ technically levied an $8,400 penalty against DOC for the violations in 2021, the corrections department will only have to pay it if DEQ determines it isn’t in compliance with the consent order.
The plant treats waste from the Cummins and Varner Units in Lincoln County and is at least 50 years old, according to a report filed with DEQ in 2021. It hasn’t had any significant upgrades since 2001, the corrections department said last year.
The plant is designed to treat 800,000 gallons of wastewater per day, but public records show that for over a decade it’s been exceeding that amount. In 2021, amid 12 months of pollution violations, an analysis by DOC contractor McClellan Engineering Consultants concluded the plant had “significantly exceeded” its treatment capacity, with an average of 1.2 million gallons of waste passing through the plant every day.
The excess flow contributed to the plant discharging wastewater that hadn’t been fully treated and exceeded permit limits.
Despite the 2024 compliance deadline, the corrections department spent years deciding whether to build a new, larger plant or expand the existing one. It asked the Division of Environmental Quality for a deadline extension, citing a search for funding, even as it hadn’t settled on a course of action.
It’s unclear if the delay has harmed the environment.
“Permit limits are developed to be protective of aquatic life, water quality, and human health,” DEQ spokesperson Melony Martinez said in an email. “Violations of the permitted limits over a period of time may contribute to an impairment of the receiving waterbody or downstream waterbody.”
The Advocate’s analysis of the plant’s permit violations is based on a review of public records and discharge data reported to the Division of Environmental Quality.
Despite multiple requests, a Department of Corrections spokesperson did not provide answers to questions about the agency’s plans to address the permit violations at the plant or when the fixes would be funded. Instead, the spokesperson provided a written statement from Corrections Secretary Lindsay Wallace.
“The Cummins/Varner Wastewater Treatment Plan expansion continues to be a priority for the Board of Corrections and the Department of Corrections as it strives to ensure both compliance and production from the facility,” Wallace said in the statement. “The complexity of the project and changes in [construction] contingencies have required re-evaluation from different administrations, Corrections Secretaries and Maintenance Directors to ensure the scope of the project and the solutions are adequate for the changing needs of the units.”
The Cummins and Varner Units hold just over 4,000 incarcerated people.



Timeline

Pre-2013: Cummins WWTP begins receiving more waste than it was designed to treat, according to McClellan engineers
2017-2019: The Cummins WWTP begins seeing more limit exceedances during this period.
2019: DOC tells DEQ that multiple components of the Cummin WWTP’s treatment process had failed “within a four month period,” but that the plant was undergoing rehabilitation.
2021: The Cummins WWTP breaches its permit limits 106 times. DOC submits compliance plan to DEQ saying it plans to construct a new, 3.25 MGD treatment plant to replace the existing plant.
2022: DEQ and DOC enter into the original consent order.
2023: The number of permit limit exceedances drop to the lowest point since 2018. DOC asks for an extension of the consent order’s compliance deadline.
2024: It receives a deadline extension from DEQ to 2027. Meanwhile, the plant’s condition continues to deteriorate.
2025: DOC pivots to building an expansion of the existing WWTP, a cheaper option. Meanwhile, the plant breached its permit limits more times between January and August than it did the entirety of 2024.




 Blown deadlines 
Tim LaPara, a professor of civil, environmental and geo-engineering at the University of Minnesota who researches wastewater treatment, said wastewater plants have a lifespan of 10 to 25 years before they need to be replaced or upgraded.
In 2021, the Cummins plant exceeded permit limits 106 times — though the severity ranged wildly — mostly due to equipment breakdowns. In April 2021, it discharged partially-treated waste containing average fecal coliform concentrations (an indicator for potentially harmful E. coli bacteria) over 20 times higher than permitted.
A visit by McClellan’s engineers in August 2021 found much of the plant deteriorated or nonfunctional.
“They had a whole bunch of problems in 2021,” said Ellen Carpenter, a former DEQ water division chief and environmental lawyer who reviewed the plant’s discharge data and other documentation at the Advocate’s request.


In 2021, the DOC’s engineering consultant initially said the department would construct a 3.25 MGD replacement plant to permanently fix the issues by the 2024 deadline. But the deadline grew closer, then passed, with little reported progress as the department explored other options for remedying the plant violations. In August last year, DEQ extended the compliance deadline to the end of 2027.
But the corrections department’s most recent progress report indicated it won’t be in compliance until 2028. Other documents obtained from the DOC put the projected compliance date as late as mid-2030 — three years after the revised compliance deadline and six past the original.
Meanwhile, the department is already missing milestones outlined in a revised compliance plan created after the deadline extension. The design should have been finished in May, but it still hasn’t been completed, based on quarterly progress reports the DOC provides the environmental agency.
The corrections department said last year it could not obtain funds for the project until its design was complete, and DOC documents indicate it must begin obtaining money for the project by May 2026 to be in compliance by 2030.
The Legislature’s fiscal session, where budget decisions for state agencies are made, begins in April.
With the design deadline missed, the department probably won’t meet the 2027 deadline, said Carpenter, the former DEQ water quality supervisor.
“They’re already putting the [division] on notice that they aren’t going to meet that deadline” through the progress reports, Carpenter said.
DEQ’s Martinez told the Advocate that extending the consent order again may be necessary if the revised deadline can’t be met, but did not say whether that was likely.



Options considered by DOC
Based on the records it was provided, the Advocate identified five options that the Department of Corrections considered to address the Cummins plant’s permit violations. It is not known if other alternatives not listed here were considered.

New, 3.25 MGD treatment plant. Cost: $26 million.
New, 2 MGD plant plus upgrading existing 0.8 plant. Cost: $31.8 million.
Upgrade and expand the existing plant to 2 MGD. Quoted costs have varied from $9.5 million to $20.6 million.
Reduce the amount of wastewater entering the plant through a water conservation project at the Cummins and Varner Units. Cost: $10.6 million.
Do nothing and pay for whatever fines or legal actions DEQ or the EPA levies.




 Fast flow, slow solutions 
Despite delays to the permanent fix for Cummins’ treatment troubles, the corrections department has taken some action. Equipment repairs in 2022 coincided with fewer pollution limit violations. DOC’s plans for a secondary waste disinfection method will likely help prevent violations as well, Carpenter said.
But the plant struggled to comply with its permit in 2024 and 2025 as the half-century-old facility continued to deteriorate despite the improvements, department documents and discharge data show.
The plant’s capacity is a major contributor to its ongoing treatment problems.

When the plant is overburdened, waste can move too quickly through the system to be fully treated, LaPara said. This is especially true if the flow of waste remains significantly above capacity for long periods, which is known to happen at Cummins.
Three years after submitting its initial compliance plan to environmental regulators, the corrections department changed its mind about building a new, larger plant, opting instead to expand the existing plant’s capacity to 2 million gallons per day (MGD) — much less than either of the new plant options the agency considered.
McClellan engineers said the expansion would be more than adequate, writing last year that the it “is the preferred alternative that will meet the overall goals that include increased treatment capacity, reliable permit compliance, and cost effectiveness.”
But a corrections department employee expressed concern in written notes dated Sept. 12, 2024, weeks after the consent order deadline was extended.
The plant “needs to handle more than 2 MGD,” Jim Flannery, the DOC’s water and wastewater coordinator wrote in the notes, which were emailed to other department officials after he reviewed a preliminary engineering report McClellan sent earlier that month.
“What worries me about this is I only see an increase in flow design to 2.0 MGD when we are not positive that the plant flow only reaches 2.0 MGD,” Flannery wrote.
The meter that measures how much waste runs through the Cummins plant maxes out at 2 MGD, according to Flannery’s notes, leaving it unclear how much waste passes through the plant when the flow exceeds that volume.

Other records show the plant’s flow meter has maxed out for 12 to 18 hours at a time, causing “lots of problems” for plant treatment equipment.
Having an accurate picture of how much waste goes through a plant is necessary to inform decisions about capacity expansion, said LaPara, the Minnesota engineering professor. Given the flow meter’s limitations, LaPara said the expansion’s lower capacity was “troubling,” barring “some rationale” to explain the decision.
“If they’re designing for a certain capacity and they actually need more than that, the new facility won’t work,” LaPara said.
He stressed, however, that other factors of the plant’s design would also influence treatment performance, and that he could not predict what the exact consequences of the lower capacity would be.
 Increasing costs 
Cost estimates have gone up since the Department of Corrections settled on expanding the current plant.
Drafts and final versions of the 2024 preliminary engineering report indicate the plant expansion would cost either $9.5 million or $12.3 million. But documents from 2025 indicate costs now range from $16.8 million to $20.6 million — not accounting for tariffs.
The Advocate requested clarification from the department regarding which estimate for the expansion was the most accurate, but did not receive an answer.
In an April 2, 2025, email to McClelland staff, DOC’s Flannery said he was “quite sure” the price tag for the upgrades “will have to be revisited.”
Adam Triche, a professional engineer with McClellan, asked if Flannery wanted to adjust short-term cost projections contained in the department’s 20-year wastewater spending plan, then pegged at $16.8 million. Flannery responded that planning ahead would be “smart thinking.” Explanations would be demanded if they had to increase the price later down the line, he said.
“I expect RPGs to be launched (questions) from every direction on why,” Flannery wrote.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design1-1024x683.png,,,2025-11-18 05:56:34.885059

(Photo by Kaitlyn Hills/For the New Hampshire Bulletin)The idea started with a question, posed by the Alton and Barnstead school boards to a candidate for superintendent. The two Lakes Region towns had seen a steady drop in student enrollment in recent years. What would he, as superintendent, do to address that?
Sitting across the table for that 2019 interview, Timothy Broadrick considered the usual menu of responses a district might choose. The district could consolidate with other school districts, and pool resources. It could pursue tuition agreements to get students and money from surrounding districts.
It took years to arrive at the answer. Alton and Barnstead would take advantage of an obscure 2009 law and make its high school, Prospect Mountain, an open enrollment school, allowing parents across the state to send their children there. Those families’ resident districts would pay Alton and Barnstead tuition. And Prospect Mountain would completely redesign its student programming to make itself attractive. 
“The cost of doing nothing looked much greater than the cost of failure,” Broadrick said in an interview.  
Three years after Prospect Mountain High School adopted that program, the school has brought in about 30 kids from outside the district, a boost to its ranks and its budget. And its decision has kicked off a series of high-profile legal battles with “sending” school districts, who argue they should not have to pay. 
But now that the state Supreme Court has upheld Prospect Mountain’s right to collect tuition from other school districts, the significance — and seriousness — of the open enrollment approach is clear. 
And observers are wondering which school district might be next.
New Hampshire schools have had the ability to designate their schools as open enrollment schools since 2009, when Gov. John Lynch signed the law allowing school boards to opt in to the designation. But only two districts have adopted the policy, Prospect Mountain and Franklin, and only Prospect Mountain has fully put it to use. 
Now, following the court decision, at least one district, Concord, is expressing interest in the approach. The Franklin School Board voted to update its existing policy Monday and allow up to five out-of-district students per grade from grades 5-12. And the idea has percolated to school boards across the state this year, said Barrett Christina, executive director of the New Hampshire School Boards Association.
Still, the discussion is hardly a groundswell. Republican lawmakers are pushing to pass a bill to make open enrollment universal for all school districts. But absent such a mandate, few boards are rushing to do so voluntarily.
“I’m not at all surprised that there’s just a general inertia here,” said Drew Cline, chairman of the State Board of Education and a supporter of the open enrollment law. “I think these things take just a long time to change — these sort of institutional culture changes.” 
Fighting the spiral
To Broadrick, the draw of open enrollment should be obvious. Districts everywhere are losing enrollment due to entrenched demographic changes: Younger adults are having fewer children and New Hampshire births are lagging behind deaths. Without action taken, districts might be faced with budget cuts, school closures, and consolidation plans.
“I’ve referred to it in the past as a spiral of decline,” Broadrick said. “Because as you lose students, you have to eliminate staff, you lose funding. That results in losing public confidence in the quality of the school. More people leave, pull their kids out to seek other options, which then reinforces the original problem, and then you have more budget cuts.” 
The open enrollment law gives those districts a chance to fight back, Broadrick says. 
“We know what it looks like when you slip into that smaller, more at-risk category of schools,” he said. “So we’re trying to maintain what we have. That’s why we did this.” 
Back in 2021, the approach was almost unheard of. “I called our school lawyer and said, ‘I understand there’s a school choice law in New Hampshire,” Broadrick said. “And he said, ‘No there isn’t.’ And I said ‘Well hold on, it’s called (RSA) 194-D.’” 
The plan soon took root. “I rolled (it) out to the school board and said, ‘Look, there’s this law, this open enrollment law. Nobody knows exactly what it means, because nobody’s ever done it right, and if you want to try it, here’s what we have to do.’” 
At Prospect Mountain, to set itself apart, the school crafted a “pathways” program. Teachers  work with freshman students to craft a course plan for their four years that aligns with that student’s career or college goals. The district used a recent “innovation schools” law that allows school districts to request exemptions from state regulations to the State Board of Education 
After that overhaul, 11 students left the Pittsfield School District to attend classes at Prospect Mountain. Soon, a dispute emerged when Pittsfield argued it should not need to pay tuition because it had not approved sending those students to Prospect Mountain. On Oct. 18, the state Supreme Court ruled that the 2009 law is unequivocal: The resident districts of students attending open enrollment public schools must pay tuition, whether they agreed to it or not.
Pittsfield is not the only school district to challenge Prospect Mountain’s tuition demands. Epsom is also disputing that it should pay for its resident students who attend Prospect Mountain. At a State Board of Education hearing Thursday, an attorney from the school district argued that Epsom voters already chose to enter an authorized regional enrollment area (AREA) agreement  to send students to Pembroke, which they said should negate Prospect Mountain’s tuition request. The State Board, led by Cline, appeared skeptical, citing the Supreme Court decision. 
In an interview, Cline said the court ruling allows a straightforward reading of the law and demonstrates the real financial benefit for districts that choose to participate. 
“It’s now clear that this is what the statute says,” he said. “There’s no gray area.” 
That, Cline added, could entice districts. “It could be that local districts have been waiting to go forward with open enrollment, pending the decision here,” he said. 
But Cline acknowledged there are perceived logistical barriers. Districts might feel they need to create a new learning model that they can use to draw in students, as Prospect Mountain did. They may want to determine how much their own classrooms can expand before opening them to doing so. And they may want to develop a plan to market their schools to out-of-district families. 
“It’s a lot of work to start running one of these programs,” Cline said. 
A difficult decision
At least one district is wrestling with the question. Concord School District is considering following Prospect Mountain, according to School Board Chairwoman Pamela Walsh. The school board has consulted with its attorney and will likely explore the option at length when it crafts its next budget in February, Walsh said in an interview. 
But the idea is not certain and Walsh herself says she has not made up her mind about it.
“I think people recognize the value,” Walsh said. “But there’s a lot of unanswered questions that we’re still looking at and grappling with and trying to understand.” 
On the one hand, Concord could benefit from additional students, particularly as it looks to fill a fiscal hole driven in part by an increase in premium prices for its health care. 
“Because of our diverse course offerings and the size of our district, we may do well, right?” Walsh said. “And it may allow us to support additional, higher-level classes and things like that.” 
On the other hand, Walsh is unsure about the effects the move could have on other districts. If Concord embraced open enrollment, could it be hurting less-resourced schools by siphoning away students and forcing them to pay? 
“I think there are a lot of districts that are sort of struggling with trying to understand how it could impact (their) finances,” she said.
In Franklin, the Prospect Mountain decision pushed the board to revisit its policy Monday.
The district technically already used the 2009 law to become an open enrollment district in 2015. But that move was intended to help fix a specific local problem, and not to allow the district to recruit from around the state. 
Residents in the Hill School District had voted to break away from the Franklin school administrative unit and join the Newfound school administrative unit; the open enrollment designation was designed to allow students from Hill attending Franklin High School to finish their high school years there despite the split.
On Monday, the board tweaked its policy to allow five students in each grade from grade 5-12 to enroll in the district. It also moved to keep its policy preventing any of its own students from leaving to other open enrollment districts — a privilege available under the law only to schools that adopt open enrollment themselves. 
To many Franklin school board members, the decision was a defensive move. Given the Supreme Court decision, keeping its open enrollment policy allows Franklin to keep its own resident students in the district, and avoids the costly tuition battles waged by Pittsfield and Epsom.
“I will say that you are going to find other school districts that are going to be declaring open enrollment and setting their limits according to the law because of the most recent interpretation of the law,” said board member Jack Finley during the meeting. 
But Superintendent Dan LeGallo has expressed concerns with the potential effects of expanding open enrollment, particularly on students who can’t afford the transportation costs to go to a wealthier district, or on districts that lose money. 
“I think Franklin’s a district that could potentially lose more kids than it would gain just based on economics, you know, and what we’re able to offer based on our socioeconomic situation,” LeGallo said.
To Broadrick, those qualms ignore a bigger prospect: If school districts do not voluntarily choose to adopt an open enrollment policy now, state lawmakers may vote to force them to later.
“This is not a matter of if,” Broadrick said. “It’s a matter of when, and what does it look like.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/prospectmt-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-18 05:56:34.885059

The new law creates post-tenure reviews, puts diversity scholarships at risk, sets rules around classroom discussion, and creates a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, among other things. The law affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges. 
“The best way to describe it is everything, quite honestly, just seems a little bit more bleak … just the general repression of speech and student expression, whether it’s inside the classroom, outside of the classroom, on campus and the dorms,” said Sabrina Estevez, an Ohio State University senior.
Ohio State banned chalking on campus over the summer and now all dorm decor in the common areas must be Ohio State-specific. 
“Given changes to federal and state policy, the university has been reviewing practices, rules and policies,” Ohio State University spokesperson Ben Johnson said in an email. 
“We revised the university signage standards in light of continued complaints regarding chalking on campus and the significant amount of administrative time spent evaluating chalking.”
No other public Ohio university has taken those measures though. 
“It feels like the university is over-complying,” said Estevez, who is president of Ohio State’s Ohio Student Association chapter. “It just feels so antithetical to what I believe a learning space should look like.” 
Students said the new law is affecting the quality of education they are receiving. 
Even though Estevez said she never hears her professors use the words “Senate Bill 1” in the classroom, she said “it still kind of lingers over everybody’s head … we don’t know what we can say to each other.”
“I think you need to be able to express things freely and challenge thought, but there’s just not much of that anymore,” she said. 
As a political science major, Miami University sophomore Kali Barcroft said she has noticed her professors change what they are comfortable talking about in the classroom, referring to the controversial issues portion of the new law. 
“It just says ‘controversial’ issues and that’s very up in the air for a lot of people as to what that means,” Barcroft said. “And so in my classes, it’s been a very different environment overall.”
For classroom discussion, the law set rules around topics involving “controversial beliefs” such as climate policies, electoral politics, foreign policy, diversity and inclusion programs, immigration policy, marriage, or abortion. 
“Not having (those topics) talked about in the classroom is damaging, people aren’t expanding upon what they already know,” Barcroft, who is president of Miami’s Ohio Student Association chapter. 
“People aren’t embracing a new perspective from what they’ve already known and grown up with.” 
She said she has noticed professors being hesitant to talk about certain topics in the classroom, such as abortion or COVID-19 pandemic policies. 
John O’Keefe, an associate history professor at Ohio University’s Chillicothe campus, said there’s a possibility of a chilling effect among faculty because of the new law.
“Our big concerns really are that portions of this bill will affect our ability to teach honestly and effectively in the classroom, and also restrict our competitiveness, so that this will lower the university’s ability to recruit top faculty, both in teaching and in research,” he said. 
O’Keefe said some of the provisions have added more work for faculty. 
“It means that more time is being taken away from the things we really care about — having really strong discussions in the classroom (and) creating environments where students are comfortable,” he said. 
Diversity centers across Ohio’s public universities  — including LGBTQ+ centers, women’s centers, and multicultural centers — have closed because of the new higher education law.
“It was genuinely upsetting to arrive on campus that first day and see what they’ve done to the African American Cultural Resource Center,” said Christian Caffey, a University of Cincinnati senior.
“Even though it’s just changing the words on the building … they wiped me off the building.”
The University of Cincinnati’s African American Cultural Resource Center was renamed the Cultural Center as a result of new law.
“I think students are really bearing the brunt of having to replace the community that’s been lost with the loss of those identity centers,” Estevez said.  
Barcroft said there’s been efforts to try and replace the sense of community from the diversity centers on campus, but said “it just doesn’t have that same feeling.”
Kent State University and the University of Akron are the latest universities to announce eliminating degree programs. 
The University of Toledo announced earlier this year it is suspending nine undergraduate programs and Ohio University is suspending 11 degree programs. 
Kent State is eliminating 24 undergraduate degrees including a bachelor of arts in Earth science, a bachelor of arts in physics, a bachelor of arts in Africana Studies, and a bachelor of arts in chemistry, among others. 
The University of Akron is getting rid of three programs.

(Ohio Capital journal file photo.)Workers from one of the biggest library systems in Ohio are establishing a labor union focused on improvements they say need to happen in areas such as wages and paid time off.
Employees with the Columbus Metropolitan Library have been working to form a union for the better part of a year, according to members participating in the effort, and planning to unionize with the Ohio Federation of Teachers.
For Jude Virostko, an adult services librarian at the library system’s South High branch, growing up in Coshocton meant being a “library kid,” something that fed into her thirst for knowledge and desire to be a librarian.
“I was at my library every chance I got,” Virostko said. “It was a place where I felt safe when that wasn’t necessarily the case in other places.”
She “wanted to be that safe space” after she moved to Columbus and has been in libraries every since.
“Libraries are an essential part of a functioning democracy,” Virostko said, as they face funding challenges on the state and federal level.
But being a librarian has “become a little bit more dangerous,” according to Megan Sheeran, a librarian at the Columbus library’s main location in downtown Columbus.
She has watched as the library has become a place for all people to come and feel welcomed, but also a place where staff are asked to do more than ever before.
“Some have been threatened and assaulted,” Sheehan said. “People are honestly having a really tough time and we’re on the frontlines being asked to help with that.”
About 630 workers are a part of the union’s bargaining unit, and the organizing committee has talked with more than half of union-eligible Columbus Metropolitan Library employees, with about 80% supportive of the efforts.
From left, Luke Avnaim, Megan Sheeran, Jude Virostko and Rahaf Fares stand in front of a union sign. The four are all employees of Columbus Metropolitan Library, and members of an effort to unionize workers at the library. (Photo provided by the Ohio Federation of Teachers.)
Management within the library system have been made aware of the unionizing effort, according to Ohio Federation of Teachers president Melissa Cropper.
The union would include Columbus Metropolitan Library workers with the exception of management, security staff, and certain administrative staff, as dictated by Ohio union laws.
The process to officially file with the State Employment Relations Board hasn’t happened yet, because the Ohio Federation of Teachers wants to make every effort to get to eligible employees.
“We are very adamant that we want conversations to be worker to worker,” Cropper told the Capital Journal. “We have enough support to file, but it’s that wanting to talk to every worker on the ground.”
Both Sheeran and Virostko embrace their work in helping connect Ohioans with the resources they need, but think the labor union is needed to demand their employer not ask too much of them, pushing employees to be the resources themselves.
“Frontline staff are being pushed to act as untrained social workers,” Virostko said. “The social safety net is diminishing, and we’re being pushed on that.”

In an official statement from the union organizers, the group says their “direct, daily experience” with library patrons means they “deserve a voice in the policies that affect us.”
“We’re forming our union to make sure every (Columbus Metropolitan Library) worker, part-time and full-time, is paid fairly and receives vital benefits, like affordable health care and paid time off,” the statement reads.
At the center of the effort is the passion the workers have for their libraries, their profession and their patrons, the statement continues.
“Core values that our library depends on, like intellectual freedom, diversity, equity and inclusion are facing dire threats,” according to the organizers.
“We need to use our collective voice to defend the freedom to read, the freedom to think and the freedom to be yourself.”
For Rahaf Fares, a customer service specialist at the Martin Luther King Jr. branch, the power of the library and the importance it serves for the community is why fighting for a union is vital.
“I feel like library communities are a reflection of statewide issues that the greater community is experiencing,” Fares said.
“If Columbus is experiencing issues with housing and people struggling to find jobs and access to food, they need help connecting to things that might help, and we’re needed even more.”
Luke Avnaim, who sorts and delivers books from the Columbus library system’s operations center in Gahanna, has watched the workload get heavier for him as well, with new drivers being trained and a new route already instituted since he started working there.
With the growing need the workers see at the library, planning a more supportive system for employees with wage, health care and paid time off improvements can only help, and having a union to help see it through is important, Avnaim said.
“We could plan a little bit more for our future,” Avnaim said. “We need all we can get.”
A spokesperson for Columbus Metropolitan Library told the Capital Journal it has not heard from staff members about any efforts to unionize.
He offered no further comment.
The Columbus Metropolitan Library unionization would add it to a list of library workers who have started labor unions.
This includes workers from Worthington, Grandview Heights, Pickerington, Upper Arlington, Athens County and Delaware County.
Worthington and Grandview Heights workers ratified their first union contracts in 2023.
Pickerington’s union contract was ratified in March of this year.
Upper Arlington, Athens County, and Delaware County are all still in contract negotiations, according to the Ohio Federation of Teachers.

(Photo by Natalie Behring/Getty Images)Despite Ohioans overwhelmingly protecting access to abortion, Republican lawmakers are moving to restrict the procedure by ending telehealth prescriptions and mail-order pills.
The sponsors say they aren’t specifically targeting abortion, but the increase in drugs available through the mail.
Ohio Issue 1 passed in November 2023 with 57% of the vote, enshrining reproductive rights into the state constitution.
It says Ohioans have the right to make their own decisions about abortion, contraception, fertility treatment, miscarriage care, and continuing pregnancy. The state is prohibited from interfering with or penalizing someone for exercising this right.
Since 2024, the state’s 13 abortion clinics have been able to prescribe the abortion pill during video visits with patients, and even mail it directly to homes.
At the Northeast Ohio Women’s Center, Dr. David Burkons says two-thirds of his patients have a medication abortion, versus a surgical one.
“People don’t have to say, ‘Well, I have to take off work to go to the clinic. I can get it by mail. I can do this when I want to,’” Burkons said. “It’s on their schedule rather than ours, which obviously has a lot of appeal to people.”
But that form of access could be restricted soon.
“Mail-order medications have become much more commonplace, and this is a good, common-sense, generally applicable bill,” state Rep. Adam Mathews, R-Lebanon, said.
Matthews and state Rep. Meredith Craig, R-Smithville, introduced Ohio House Bill 324, which would prevent mail-order prescriptions and telehealth appointments for medications that cause “severe adverse effects” in more than 5% of users.
Anti-abortion groups that testified in support of the bill cite a study done by a right-wing think tank that lists Mifepristone, the most common abortion medication, as having severe impacts on 10% of patients.
“If these medications are sending any patients to the hospital with sepsis, organ failure at a rate of 1 out of 20 patients, then I think that should be the cause of concern, whatever the medication may be used for,” Mathews said.
Burkons points to plenty of studies, including data from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, that state the meds are safe.
The legislation is unconstitutional, he added.
“They’re letting politics get in the way of health care, and abortion is health care,” Burkons said.
When we questioned, Mathews claimed that this wasn’t meant to target abortion, as it applies to various classes of drugs like antidepressants and opioids.
The Ohio Department of Health would decide which drugs meet that 5% threshold.
“Looking at the Department of Health, insurance claims, and the self-reported studies that a drug manufacturer puts out,” Mathews explained.
This would require in-person appointments at one of the 13 clinics to get the abortion pill, which Burkons said will reinstate barriers to care.
“They’re trying to say, ‘We know more than the women do, we’re going to make it more difficult or impossible for them to access this very, very efficient method of health care,'” the doctor said.
It’s still early in the hearing process, but progressive advocates say they are prepared to sue if this bill goes through.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)The turbulent 1960s prepared a generation of K-State students for journalism. The Collegian, where I learned reporting and which I edited, was embroiled in a crusade against using student fees for a new football stadium.
I was a nervous kid with a notebook interviewing an important athletic official after a particularly rough Student Senate meeting. “About your comment —” I began.
“I did not say that,” the official said.
“But we have you recorded on tape,” I said.
He replied: “The tape is wrong,”
It was an early welcome to today’s post-truth world.
Carl Bernstein, of Watergate reporting fame, defined journalism as finding the most accurate version of truth available at the moment. That was always a challenging task.
Finding truth in today’s facts-are-wrong political environment may be impossible unless journalism finds a new way forward.
These are extraordinary times. Corporate broadcast entities relinquish their right to free speech just to gain approval for big business deals. Shari Redstone’s sell-out of CBS to seal a Skydance deal is a prime example, as is NBC’s corporate owner Comcast’s donation to President Trump’s ballroom project.
Corporate-owned news organizations settle frivolous lawsuits instead of defending our vital free press. On the print side, corporate newspaper owners put their balance sheet first, readers second. When nearly seven million people participated in the No Kings protests, it barely made the front page of The New York Times.
The concentration of media and a hodgepodge of regulation have made it much easier for government to blackmail media outlets into airing and printing only what the government wants. New York Times v. Sullivan, the Supreme Court case that has been the primary protection for media holding public officials accountable, likely would not have been handed down today.
Journalism educators and journalists have not adapted to this new environment. Speaking truth to power and casting light into darkness has been the motto of the press.
Today, that is no longer enough.
I once heard the publisher of a storied national newspaper claim the press has no stake in elections, no stake in governmental or political debates. He also said reporters should be so neutral as to not vote.
The free press exists only because the First Amendment grants it as a right in a constitutional democracy. When democracy and freedom are attacked, press neutrality equals surrender, threatening the media’s right to exist. Surrender damages every citizen.
Today’s press must fiercely advocate for all freedoms and for democracy itself. This is not a new idea. Early in the 20th Century, an advocacy press pushed cleanup of labor abuses and gave standing to the suffrage movement.
Let’s abandon outdated and unworkable rules. Giving equal time to both sides doesn’t work in our post-truth era. Don’t ask if it’s raining. Look out the window and say so.
Corporate press is fond of the line, “President Trump said, without evidence.” Call a lie what it is — a lie. All positions are not equal. Political reporting fails when politics is treated as a game for the press to total up winners and losers.
Relying on official sources does not work when those official sources don’t tell the truth. Many reporters knew former President Biden’s frail condition and did not report it, resulting in the infamous debate, Biden’s withdrawal from the race and the unusual 2024 election. Today, editors avoid nonsensical elements of President Trump’s speeches and treat them as normal.
Above all, the obligation of fairness should be to news readers and viewers first, sources second.
Democracy is not a partisan issue. It should not be treated as partisan by the news media.
When an administration or any public figure attacks free speech and tries to destroy the government and cultural entities that serve as America’s foundation, the press must speak, act and lead — in aggressive news coverage as well as in editorials. There are not two sides in this.
Marty Baron, former editor of The Washington Post, put it this way: “I think it’s very important that the press explains just how extraordinary this is and how out of the norm it is, and how unconstitutional it is, and how undemocratic it all is.”
Trump and his allies have filed frivolous lawsuits against The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and will continue to do so. The goal is to intimidate the press and to make editors fearful of being sued.
Editors and publishers must push back, as The New York Times did when sued in September: “This lawsuit has no merit. It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting. The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics. We will continue to pursue the facts without fear or favor and stand up for journalists’ First Amendment right to ask questions on behalf of the American people.”
Kansas journalists aggressively pushed back against attacks on free press rights in Marion, winning important victories. The same energy is sorely needed nationally to preserve all our rights.
We need to pay more attention to nonprofit media, free of government and corporate profit constraints. We already have models for that in ProPublica, which revealed ethics lapses of the Supreme Court. Here at home, the Kansas Reflector and its national group of state reporting affiliates have done a great job as statehouse reporting staffs have been hollowed out.
There are new and promising independent sources of news, as established reporters and news influencers flock to Substack, podcasts and video, and find new uses for social media. Legacy media, facing its ongoing legitimacy crisis, would do well to pay attention. The rest of us should encourage the innovation.
These issues affect us all, and the ramifications are local as well as national, with democracy in the balance. Ordinary people in Kansas have been fired from their jobs because of organized intimidation against their speech. Others have been threatened — not just entertainers like Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert.
It falls to every generation to defend our freedoms, and a free press is citizens’ sword in that fight. As Susan Edgerley, member of the Kansas Hall of Fame and formerly of The New York Times, wrote: “For generations we let ourselves off the hook with false equivalency, and what we called balance. Today calls for deeper, harder thinking.”
Our freedom depends on it.

Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.), on her way to vote at the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 17, 2025. (Francis Chung/POLITICO via AP Images)Washington’s most endangered congressional Democrat in next year’s midterms sparred openly with her own party for an hour on the floor of the U.S. House on Monday night.
U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez is pushing a resolution to disapprove of actions by outgoing U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia, D-Illinois, that resulted in his chief of staff as the only Democrat running to succeed him in 2026. A vote on the resolution is anticipated Tuesday morning.
Gluesenkamp Perez’s Democratic colleagues lined up to oppose her resolution and stand up for Garcia. The Illinois congressman, at one point, spoke in his own defense.
Republicans exited the chamber as the debate unfolded. And no Democrats spoke in support of Gluesenkamp Perez’s move. The southwest Washington congresswoman, now halfway through her second term, was left on her own to defend the resolution.
“If you’re not going to run, you don’t get to choose your successor, no matter how noble the work you have done beforehand,” she said. “That’s what this is about, accountability.”
Garcia said he “wasn’t expecting to stand here to debate my retirement. We should not be distracted by political ploys when our constituents want us to stay focused and deliver for them.”
The 69-year-old congressman was sworn into office in 2019. He lost his daughter in 2023 and said his wife, who has multiple sclerosis, has been the chief caregiver for their daughter’s four children. He said he filed to run then made the “tough decision” to step aside.
“When a colleague chooses his family, that shouldn’t be a moment for division, it should be a moment for understanding and unity,” he said. “One day, you might be the one making that choice, and you shouldn’t have to debate it on the House floor.”
Some Democrats questioned the motives of Gluesenkamp Perez, a centrist known for going her own way in her three years of service. 
“This resolution is nothing more than a cheap political stunt that pulls from the playbook of some of my Republican colleagues,” said Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Illinois.
Democrats tried to block the resolution. But House Republicans united behind Gluesenkamp Perez to repel the attempt before heading off the floor.
Gluesenkamp Perez stood alone at the podium, a large chart with the timeline of the congressman’s actions at her side.
The congresswoman said Garcia filed a re-election petition with the necessary signatures. Three days before the filing deadline, she said the congressman signed and helped gather signatures on a petition for his chief of staff to become a candidate. 
Hours before the deadline, the top aide filed to run, Gluesenkamp Perez said during her floor remarks. A day later, when it was clear they were the only two Democratic candidates, Congressman Garcia announced he would be retiring.
Democrats heaped praise on Garcia as they unleashed a torrent of criticism at Gluesenkamp Perez, a centrist known for going her own way.
“I am appalled at the hubris behind all of this,” said Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, D-Calif. “He is a legend to his district, he is a legend in Congress. This is character assassination. This Democratic intra-party fighting is not what any of us want. And it’s not what the American people deserve.”
Gluesenkamp Perez repeatedly stressed that the resolution she filed Thursday wasn’t personal.
“Nothing validates subverting an election,” she said. “The question is, do you have the right to choose your successor?”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/marie-gluesenkamp-perez-2-1024x593.jpg,,,2025-11-18 00:56:26.406509
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-18 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Keeping teaching a worthy profession,Christopher E. Trombly,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/18/keeping-teaching-a-profession-worthy/,The “teacher shortage” is fueled not by  lower numbers of individuals entering the field but by rapidly growing numbers of educators leaving it.,"Much has been written since even before the COVID-19 pandemic about a “teacher shortage” in Connecticut and across the United States. 
From the perspectives of the superintendents and principals responsible for staffing schools, and of the families whose children are assigned to classes with unreasonably high numbers of students, or are taught either by educators working under emergency credentials or by successions of substitute teachers, the growing number of teaching vacancies certainly feels like a shortage. 
What has too often gone overlooked in media accounts and policy discussions, however, is that in Connecticut alone there exist over 10,000 women and men who choose not to work under the active certifications that they hold.
The “teacher shortage” is far more akin to a famine than to a drought, as it stems largely (though unintentionally) from policy and budgetary choices that have been made over the decades by elected officials. While this distinction no doubt feels academic to administrators, teachers, students, and families, it is nevertheless crucial for all of us to recognize if we are to work toward the enactment of policies and crafting of budgets that not only fill existing teaching vacancies in schools but genuinely improve long-term outcomes for all children and adolescents in our state and nation. Equally crucial is that we reject policy solutions that, by attending to short-term staffing needs (e.g., lowering standards for entry into the profession), actually worsen circumstances for young people, families, and educators.


A pair of researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and Cornell University recently released a study of Texas’ quarter-century of relaxing teacher training requirements. They found, “On the one hand, the policy changes increased the supply of certified teachers, which reduced schools’ reliance on uncertified teachers. On the other hand, the new policy led to the growth of a large for-profit sector, which produced teachers with lower value-added than those from standard and other alternative programs.” . Such lowering of the standards for entry into teaching is not an option that should be considered for a moment in Connecticut – particularly as our state ranks so low (by some measures, 49th) in racial educational equality.
The research literature makes plain that the “teacher shortage” is fueled not by significantly lower numbers of individuals entering the field but by rapidly growing numbers of educators electing to leave it. Such turnover and attrition are particularly acute in districts serving high numbers of students from families earning low incomes and/or from minoritized backgrounds. Inadequately resourced districts cannot compensate their teachers at the same rates as well-resourced districts can. Consequently, they face persistent turnover that compromises their ability to improve outcomes for students or to sustain the improvements that they do achieve.
Nationwide, according to Farahmandpour and Voelkel (2025), “Teacher attrition is higher than in other careers including pharmacists, engineers, nurses, architects and police officers.”  This is no doubt in part because the “pay gap” between teaching and other professions requiring college degrees has never been higher in the United States. Sylvia Allegretto  explains, “On average, teachers earned 73.1 cents for every dollar relative to the earnings of other similar professionals in 2024 – much less than the 93.9 cents earned in 1996.” The average teacher pay penalty in Connecticut in 2024 was -24.3%. Factoring in the more generous fringe benefits that teachers typically enjoy relative to those in other professions does not cancel out the wage penalty; it only lessens it from a wage gap of -26.9% to an overall compensation gap of -17.1%.
Data from the Connecticut State Department of Education reveal that 3,031 new educator certificates were issued in our state in 2022/2023, with another 3,011 issued in 2023/2024 – figures that exceed the annual average of 2,835 for the last eight years overall. Of those newly certified educators, only 2,359 were subsequently employed in 2022/2023, and 2,110 in 2023/2024 – figures on par with the annual average of 2,117 for the last eight years. 
Why have only three-fourths of newly certified educators sought and gained employment under their hard-earned credentials? To answer this question, we must look to the conditions under which – and the compensation at which – educators in Connecticut work, particularly in districts serving large concentrations of students with significant needs. Appreciating these circumstances will also help us better understand the still more pressing problem of attrition among educators in Connecticut.
Thirty-six of Connecticut’s 169 public school districts are considered “Alliance Districts.” Despite serving 44.4% of the state’s public school students, disproportionately large concentrations of whom present with high needs (e.g., family financial insecurity, food insecurity, housing insecurity, social-emotional concerns, learning challenges – all of which require significant resources to address), Alliance Districts account for only 41.7% of per pupil expenditures and 41.3% of the state’s currently practicing public school educators.
The average per pupil expenditure in Connecticut is $22,054. The average in Alliance Districts is $20,714; the average in non-Alliance districts, $23,122. In New Haven, where I live, just making up the $683 difference between the state average and the district’s current expenditure for each of its 18,817 pupils would amount to $12,852,011 in additional resources to materially improve what the district’s educators could do with and for the students and families whom they serve. (In Bridgeport, that figure would be $62,708,904; in Danbury, $59,230,024; in New Britain, $21,611,814; in Waterbury, $33,571,488.)
Gov. Ned Lamont and the Connecticut General Assembly should take two actions to keep teaching a profession worthy of those who choose to enter it and remain in it – and of the students and families whom those educators serve:
1. In the immediate term, these officials should amend the statute under which the Connecticut Educator Preparation and Certification Board was created, extending by at least one year the date on which many of the regulations governing educator preparation and certification will be repealed; expanding the membership of that body to include appropriate representation from the entities  most familiar with and impacted by the existing regulations (i.e., educator preparation providers and school administrators); and codifying a formal role for expert staff members from the Connecticut State Department of Education to play in the work of the CEPCB. 
The writing or revising of regulations pertaining to the schooling of our state’s children and adolescents, and to the preparation and certification of those who engage in that work, is far too important to be rushed; it requires careful thought and extensive consideration.
2. In the medium term, these officials should do all that they can to ensure that school districts’ funding is commensurate with the needs of the children and adolescents whom the educators in those districts serve, so that those professionals have the resources and support that they need to help students thrive academically, socially, and emotionally, and are compensated at rates reflective of the appropriately high standards that they must meet in order to be certified as teachers. 
This will require that the governor and legislators work to increase revenues, and that they revisit the fiscal guardrails that have so often prevented them from doing so, but Connecticut’s children deserve nothing less than elected officials’ full commitment to their success.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-18 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,A consumer voice at PURA as an energy reckoning sweeps the nation,Elin Swanson Katz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/18/a-consumer-voice-at-pura-as-an-energy-reckoning-sweeps-the-nation/,"In Connecticut, it’s no secret that the state’s utilities and their regulator have been at loggerheads for years, leaving consumers caught in the middle.","“What’s going on at PURA?”
The Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority has been in the news almost daily over the past year. I’m often asked what’s happening at an agency that, until recently, most people had never heard of.


Much of today’s dialogue around energy policy in our country has become disturbingly adversarial. At the federal level, the Trump administration reversed course on nearly every renewable energy initiative, instead doubling down on fossil fuels and even expressing interest in reviving coal as a major energy source.  President Trump has taken particular umbrage with windmills, calling them  “a con job.”
In Connecticut, it’s no secret that the state’s utilities and their regulator have been at loggerheads for years, leaving consumers caught in the middle. Some see the utilities as self-serving and unaccountable, while others argue they can still help build a fairer, more affordable energy future. Without casting aspersions on any of the parties – I generally assume good intent on the part of the people involved – the constant conflict has distracted from what really matters: delivering reliable, affordable service to the people who pay the bills.
You can’t both bully and persuade. Yes, utilities deserve tough scrutiny when they seek rate hikes or cost recovery. But regulation works best when it protects the public interest and encourages cooperation toward shared goals. If we’re serious about confronting the challenges we face, we need a process that puts consumers first and invites every party to the table.
PURA is entering a period of transition just as a national crisis in energy affordability reaches a tipping point.  In New Jersey, for example, Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill just won what has been dubbed the “Electricity Election,” pledging to declare a “state of emergency” on day one to curb utility costs.  Gov. Ned Lamont has appointed a strong slate of commissioners who bring renewed attention to consumers and costs, especially PURA’s new chair, Tom Wiehl.
Wiehl’s experience as Legal and Regulatory Director at the Office of Consumer Counsel ensures that compassion for everyday ratepayers will be central to PURA’s decision-making. His appointment reflects a broader regional shift toward consumer-focused leadership at state utility commissions. In Massachusetts, new Department of Public Utilities Commissioner Liz Anderson previously led ratepayer advocacy at the Attorney General’s Office. In New Hampshire, Commissioner Pradip Chattopadhyay also came from the Office of the Consumer Advocate.  And California Commissioner Matthew Baker previously led the Public Advocates Office.  It’s a worthy and growing trend.
Other appointments will expand the agency’s depth.  PURA Vice Chair David Arconti, appointed in August 2024, brings years of legislative experience as co-chair of the Energy & Technology Committee. New Commissioner Janice Beecher, longtime director of Michigan State University’s Institute of Public Utilities and editor of the Utilities Policy journal, literally wrote the book on regulation. New Commissioner Holly Cheeseman, another Energy & Technology alum, and incoming Commissioner Everett Smith, with expertise in finance, renewables, and telecom infrastructure, round out an impressive and diverse bench. It will be worth watching how they apply their individual strengths in shaping PURA’s future.
Meanwhile, consumers are struggling. According to the federal Energy Information Administration, electricity prices have risen faster than inflation since 2022, a trend that is expected to continue through 2026. However, Connecticut residents and businesses don’t need a federal agency to confirm what they already know: energy bills are straining household budgets.

Consumer ire over energy costs feels like it has easy villains.  There is the monopoly company with the poles and wires and the pipelines to deliver energy to your house, and there is the regulator who oversees rates.  In contrast, when the price of bread goes up, who do you blame?  The farmer who grows the wheat, the baker who makes the loaf, the trucker  that drives the product to market, or the grocer that sells the bread?
However, energy costs are just as much a mash-up of costs and inputs as loaves of bread.  Solutions won’t be easy to craft.  There are too many competing demands, particularly on our electric grid, including  overdue investments for upgrading aging infrastructure like ancient utility poles and wires; costs associated with restoring power and “hardening” the grid against increasingly frequent storms and wildfires; clean energy investments needed to ensure cleaner air and water and address climate change;  cybersecurity measures to protect against cyberattacks by foreign agents; low-income rates to assist those least able to pay their bills; and the impact of competition for electricity and water from the growing proliferation of AI data centers, just to name a few.  The list of critical issues is long, but unfortunately, a “let’s do it all” approach is simply unaffordable.
We are facing tough, sometimes painful, decisions about what we must do, should do, and can’t afford not to do. To navigate these choices, regulators must prioritize transparency, explaining how rates are set, why decisions are made, and what tradeoffs are involved. Consumers deserve to understand what’s on their bills and how their dollars are spent. That also means ongoing public education and engagement.
With an experienced consumer advocate like Chairman Wiehl leading the way, I’m hopeful that future PURA actions will be guided by cost-consciousness, candor, and respect for all stakeholders.  If the new PURA commission can rebuild trust and keep ratepayers at the center of every proceeding, it will not only restore confidence in the regulatory process but also set a new standard for integrating the public’s voice and wallet into its decisions.

Workers are currently removing the steel that once carried Interstate 695 over the bridge, and have begun driving test piles that could support a new longer and higher span. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)The cost to replace the Francis Scott Key Bridge has ballooned to between $4.3 billion and $5.2 billion, more than double original estimates of just under $2 billion, the Maryland Transportation Authority announced Monday evening.
The agency also said the bridge is not likely to open to traffic before late 2030, two years after the original goal of 2028.
The original estimates were made in the weeks after the March 2024 crash of the container ship Dali into the bridge sent it tumbling into the Patapsco River, killing six workers who were on the bridge at the time.
From the beginning, officials planned for a new bridge that was higher, with a wider shipping channel to accommodate new, larger ships in and out of the Port of Baltimore. The MdTA said the new numbers are based on significantly higher material costs and on federal demands for upgraded protection of the piers that will carry the new span across the Patapsco River, to prevent another accident like the one that destroyed the bridge.
As design work on the bridge progressed, “it became clear that material costs for all aspects of the project have increased drastically since the preliminary estimates were prepared less than two weeks after the initial tragedy,” Acting Transportation Secretary Samantha J. Biddle said in the MdTA statement.
Key Bridge rebuild progresses with first piles driven into the Patapsco riverbed

“The updated cost range and schedule are directly correlated to increased material costs and to a robust pier protection system designed to protect the new Key Bridge and reduce the likelihood of a future ship strike to the bridge’s foundational piers,” said Biddle, who also serves as chair of the MdTA.
Within hours of the bridge’s collapse, then-President Joe Biden promised that the federal government would cover 100% of the cost of replacement. That pledge was later codified into law by Congress.
But President Donald Trump (R) has repeatedly hinted that he does not feel bound by that agreement. In an online spat with Gov. Wes Moore (D) in August, whcn Moore slammed Trump’s suggestion that he might send National Guard troops into Baltimore, the president ended a lengthy social media post by saying he “gave Wes Moore a lot of money to fix his demolished bridge. I will now have to rethink that decision???”
And U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, while pledging that the federal government is committed to working with the state to deliver a new Key Bridge, has pressed the state for updates on costs and the timeline for the reconstruction.
“Congress granted the Secretary of Transportation important authorities to conduct critical oversight to ensure that Federal highway funds are properly managed, and I take this authority seriously,” Duffy said in a September letter to state officials. “It is my role to guarantee that federally funded projects benefit the entire Nation through every dollar spent.”
In that letter, Duffy also warned that the state’s “reliance on race- or sex-conscious factors in contracting decisions” could threaten the project. It was a reference to the state Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, which aims to use state contracts to bolster minority- and women-owned businesses.
Kiewit, the contractor overseeing the bridge project, has committed to a goal of using 26% “disadvantaged business enterprises,” including campanies that are at least 51% owned and controlled by one or more minority individuals.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In a statement Monday night, Moore said the state will “continue to work with the Trump Administration to find ways to reduce costs and rebuild faster.” The higher costs and longer timeline are the result of outside factors, “not discretionary state choices,” he said.
“Just as families across the country are dealing with the reality of increased costs, so is Maryland,” Moore’s statement said. “Trade policies out of Washington, D.C., have raised prices on everything — including essential materials we need in order to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge.”
Moore and Biddle stressed that the state continues to seek legal damages from the owners of the Dali, and that any awards will be used to offset the costs of construction. The state will be “advancing upfront construction costs and contributing hundreds of millions of dollars in insurance proceeds toward the rebuilding effort,” the MdTA statement said.
When the Key Bridge collapsed, it shut down the shipping channel to the Port of Baltimore for weeks. It also severed a major roadway used by commuters and by long-haul truckers skirting downtown Baltimore. The bridge, which carried Interstate 695 over the Patapsco, linked Dundalk and Baltimore and served more than 30,000 vehicles a day, generating $56 million in tolls a year.
The new bridge will still follow the same route as the old one, and will still carry two lanes in each direction, although the shoulders are expected to be wider.

But the bridge itself will be much higher – 230 feet above the river at its highest point, compared to 185 feet before. The main span of the bridge will be 1,665 feet, compared to the previous piers that were 1,200 feet apart. The higher and wider span is designed to allow for larger cargo ships now serving the port.
MdTA said its latest estimates show that the “towers needed to accommodate both the length and 230-foot height of the bridge deck add a significantly higher cost than initial assumptions.”
In addition to accommodating “today’s larger marine traffic,” the larger size of the replacement bridge is needed “to comply with current guidelines from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials for new bridges.”
Another increased cost are the protective “fenders” that will be build around the towers to prevent a future crash like the one the brought the bridge down last year.

It also moved to cap payments on the first two drugs on the list, Jardiance and Farxiga.","Medication vials marked for calibration await counting at the Exchange Pharmacy at Joint Base Andrews in Clinton, in this July 2023 file photo. (Photo by Staff Sgt. Jared Duhon/U.S. Air Force)The Prescription Drug Affordability Board determined Monday that name-brand drugs Trulicity and Ozempic are likely unaffordable for Marylanders, adding them to two other drugs being considered for price caps by the state.
The board Monday also took steps toward finally approving caps on what the state would pay for those first two prescription drugs, Jardiance and Farxiga. The price caps have been years in the making, and may not be finalized for months yet, but advocates hailed Monday’s actions.
“It’s a major step forward in making high-cost drugs more affordable for state and local governments,” said Vinny DeMarco, a longtime supporter of the board’s effort and president of the Maryland Health Care for All Coalition. “It’s very important that this happens as soon as possible to start the clock ticking on when they can make high-cost drugs more affordable for everybody.”
The board ordered staff to draw up language to set a limit on how much state and local governments are willing to pay for Farxiga, a brand name for the drug dapagliflozin, and Jardiance, a brand name for empagliflozin, both of which are used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and other conditions.
It’s not a done deal yet, and the board would need to officially approve the upper payment limit in a future board meeting. But the decision signals strong interest in implementing upper payment limits, which would be the board’s first official action to bring down drug costs since it was formed by 2019 legislation.
State board determines two Type 2 diabetes drugs may be unaffordable

The PDAB determined in July that Jardiance and Farxiga were too expensive for Marylanders and could be subject to payment limits.
The board’s work comes as health costs are increasing in Maryland and nationally, with state and federal officials looking for ways to rein in rising prescription drug costs.
Under the Biden administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services negotiated with drug makers to lower the costs of expensive prescription drugs for those on Medicare. Those “maximum fair price” negotiations included Farxiga and Jardiance.
The Maryland board will take a cue from those negotiations to help set an upper payment limit for the two drugs purchased on the state’s health insurance plan.
In setting upper payment limits, the board has several metrics that could help set the ceiling on how much the state is willing to spend on the drugs. The board’s staff determined that modeling the upper payment limit on the maximum fair price negotiations will yield the most savings for Maryland.
For Farxiga, the maximum fair price per unit is $5.95, or $178.50 for a 30-day supply. For Jardiance, it’s $6.57 per unit, or $197 for a 30-day supply.
PDAB staff estimates that setting an upper payment limit based on the maximum fair price for Farxiga would save state and local governments an estimated $4.9 million. That estimate does not reflect any rebates or discounts that the state receives for Farxiga, so true savings are not yet clear.
For Jardiance, staff estimates savings could reach $8 million if the state sets an upper payment limit based on maximum fair price. That number, also, does not consider rebates or discounts that the state receives.
But some health advocates fear that upper payment limits will lead to adverse and unintended consequences. Pharmaceutical industry representatioves are also largely against upper payment limits and PDABs in general, arguing that neither is likely to result in lower out-of-pocket costs for everyday Marylanders.


Targeted drugs
Six drugs were selected for “cost review” by the Prescription Drug Affordability Board address several conditions, including Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, eczema, Crohn’s disease and more.

Dupixent
Farxiga
Jardiance
Ozempic
Skyrizi
Trulicity



George Huntley, CEO of Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition, asked the board to look at other options in its effort to bring down drug costs.
“Our concern is that UPLs [upper payment limits] will not actually lower the cost for a patient at the pharmacy counter. And our position is we need to lower the cost for the patient at the pharmacy counter and make sure the pharmacy actually stocks the drugs,” he said.
But supporters of the board want swift action, as a new law would allow the board’s authority to expand out to set upper payment limits on the commercial market, not just for state and local purchases. The board will only gain that authority a year after it has successfully implemented upper payment limits on two drugs.
Created by the General Assembly in 2019, the PDAB was slow to launch due in part to a veto from then-Gov. Larry Hogan (R) amid pandemic-induced economic uncertainty in 2020 that delayed the board’s formation.
After Gov. Wes Moore (D) allocated funding for the board’s operation in 2023, the entity went through lengthy rule-making to create the “cost review” process for targeted drugs.
The board finally picked its first six drugs for cost review in May 2024, starting first with Jardiance and Farxiga. On Monday, it added Ozempic and Trulicity for future cost-saving efforts.
Trulicity, the brand name for dulaglutide, is largely used to treat Type 2 diabetes. Ozempic, the brand name for semaglutide, was also developed for Type 2 diabetes, but has recently gained popularity as a weight-loss drug.
Maryland was the first state to create a board for prescription drug cost reduction, with its 2019 legislation, but other states have gotten ahead in the time Maryland’s board was trying to get off the ground.
In October, Colorado’s Prescription Drug Affordability Review Board set the nation’s first upper payment limit on a drug called Enbrel to treat various autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht/Tennessee Lookout)A Davidson County chancellor on Monday temporarily blocked Gov. Bill Lee from continuing to deploy the Tennessee National Guard in Memphis.
Members of the Guard have been patrolling the streets of Memphis since October under a directive from Lee, as part of a task force convened by the Trump administration in September. How many Guard personnel are currently stationed in Memphis is unclear: Memphis Police said last week there were fewer than 200, but that number would soon double. Recent court filings indicated more than 700 are currently in Memphis.
The Memphis Safe Task Force is composed of hundreds of state and federal law enforcement officers working in conjunction with local law enforcement. 
The order issued by Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal states that the plaintiffs “have shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims that the Governor’s actions in calling the National Guard into the active service of the state to support the Memphis Safe Task Force violate the terms and conditions of Tennessee’s Military Code.”
“The power committed to the Governor as commander-in-chief of the Army and the Militia is not unfettered,” Moskal wrote. “The Tennessee Constitution and the Military Code establish conditions for calling the National Guard into active service and limit the Governor’s power and authority.”
The order comes as Moskal considers a lawsuit seeking to permanently remove the Guard from Memphis. The lawsuit was filed Oct. 17 by Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, Reps. G.A. Hardaway and Gabby Salinas, state Sen. Jeff Yarbro, Shelby County Commissioners Erika Sugarmon and Henri E. Brooks, and Memphis Councilmember J.B. Smiley, Jr.
The injunction blocking the Guard’s deployment will go into effect five days after the plaintiffs post a $50,000 bond, if the defendants, including Lee, do not file an application for permission to appeal within that period. Lawyers representing the state had requested an $8 million bond.
The lawsuit argues that the Tennessee Constitution allows the Guard to be deployed only in “circumstances amounting to a rebellion or invasion,” and “even then, the legislature must declare, by law, that the public safety requires it.”
Attorneys representing Lee and the state contend that deploying the Guard falls within the governor’s authority and that the judiciary has no oversight on the executive decision.
Moskal pointed out in her ruling that the governor did not make an official order but issued a press release about the deployment after President Donald Trump signed a memo. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth sent Lee a letter saying Guard members would be funded to stay in Memphis through September 2026.
Yet the Tennessee legislature never voted to send Guard personnel to Memphis, as required by law, and Shelby County leaders didn’t request the deployment.
“This ruling is a powerful affirmation that no one — not a president, not a governor — is above the law,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward, a nonprofit law firm representing the plaintiffs. “When leaders use military force to intimidate rather than to protect, they threaten both our safety and our democracy. (Monday’s) decision restores the rule of law in Tennessee and sends a clear message that our service members will not be used as political props.”
The Lookout is seeking comment from the Tennessee Attorney General, who represents the state.

Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery), in a February photo, said Monday that the decisions made by PJM Interconnection on how it will handle the expected surge in data centers one of the “most consequential decisions of this decade.” (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)A coalition of state lawmakers from around the 13-state PJM Interconnection grid presented their plan Monday for handling the explosion of data center requests in the region and the tremendous demand for power that comes with them.
The lawmakers’ proposal built on a plan put forward by a number of state governors in the region that would provide incentives for data centers to bring their own power generation to the grid, and would extend a cap on a key PJM auction that partially drives consumer prices, among other attempts at reform.
But the legislators’ plan also says that data centers that don’t bring their own power should be the first to have their power cut off in an emergency, not other power customers, if power demand reaches a point where the system is stressed.
The proposals are in response to a call from grid operator PJM for ways that it can “address the reliability and affordability challenges associated with rapid load growth from large new data center development.” Maryland Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery), one of the lawmakers on hand Monday, called PJM’s data center decision one of the “most consequential decisions of this decade.”
PJM predicts that peak load on the electric grid will increase by 32 gigawatts from 2024 to 2030, with data centers accounting for all but 2 gigawatts of that growth. The resulting electric grid expansion would cost billions, further straining consumer’s pocketbooks as they face already high bills.
Exelon wants to build a power plant in Maryland, reversing decades of deregulation policy

In their proposal, the governors of Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia were joined by the Data Center Coalition, which represents data center companies, and by the Exelon and PPL companies, utilities that serve millions of customers across several states in the PJM region. They called for data centers that bring their own power to be given expedited entry into the electric grid.
The legislators’ proposal said those data centers that don’t bring their own power to the grid should be the first ones cut off when the system is overwhelmed.
“When there’s not enough power to go around, it affects data centers and households alike,” said Claire Lang-Ree, a clean-energy advocate at the National Resources Defense Council, which joined the legislators’ filing. “We really need a proposal that grapples with this reality — even though it’s difficult.”
Lang-Ree said cut-offs would be rare, and would likely only occur when the grid is most overburdened, such as during extremely hot or cold weather. But for ratepayers, the protection could be significant.
“In practice, this may only occur less than one-tenth of 1% of the time, but this action will shield the public from blackout risk and save hundreds of billions of dollars,” Lang-Ree said.
The various plans will be presented Wednesday during a meeting of the PJM Special Members Committee, which will rank the options. The final decision rests with PJM’s 10-member Board of Managers, which has pledged to issue a ruling before the end of this year. The board doesn’t have to select any one proposal, but rather could combine elements from several.
Ultimately, any changes to PJM’s procedures will require approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
In a statement Monday, PJM spokesman Jeff Shields called the data center projections a “generational challenge,” adding that the grid operator has received a dozen different proposals for how to deal with the matter.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Data center proliferation is driving the need to further build out our power grid, while also creating a supply/demand imbalance leading to higher market pricing,” Shields wrote. “As grid operator, PJM is acutely aware of the challenges that these costs pose to people and businesses.”
But legislators said PJM can’t ignore that it is partly to blame for the supply and demand problems with its grid.
“We also need to look back clear-eyed, understanding that a big part of how we ended up here is the past failure of the PJM queue, with its six-plus year wait-time, to connect renewable energy to the grid,”said Delaware General Assembly Sen. Stephanie Hansen (D-10th District).
PJM argues that it has worked to diminish the backlog in its queue, and reform approval procedures that come from a time when a smaller number of large power plants needed to connect to the grid, unlike today’s far higher number of smaller projects, including wind, solar and battery storage facilities scattered around the region. PJM has also created a fast-track for dozens of shovel-ready energy projects.
The idea of interrupting power to data centers was also backed by a group of 60 climate and ratepayer advocacy groups from around PJM territory, in a letter to PJM’s voting members. In Maryland, that includes the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, the Maryland League of Conservation Voters and Third Act Maryland.
Those groups said that incentives that encourage data centers to bring power are not enough.
“You must vote for a solution that — at minimum — does not allow large-load users like data centers to have access to the grid during hours of peak demand until they have brought new generation onto the grid to match their energy usage,” the letter said.

The Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, which represents Maryland ratepayers, also backed the idea of interruptible, rather than firm, energy service for data centers that do not bring their own power resources to the grid. It called on PJM to “initiate a process to require data centers to pay the regional and local transmission costs that they cause,” costs that are currently paid by the overall customer base through their monthly electric bills.
The People’s Counsel also identified ways to improve forecasting to ensure data center demand isn’t artificially inflated by proposals that aren’t going to break ground, an idea backed by the legislators’ coalition.
PJM’s Independent Market Monitor called on the regional grid operator to be even more strict, and bar data centers from connecting to the grid if they cannot be served reliably by the system. To do that, PJM would have to create a queue for data centers to apply, and evaluate each proposal to ensure the electric grid can handle it.
“It should not be assumed that PJM is required to allow the interconnection of large loads that cannot be served reliably,” read the market monitor filing. “The result of such a path would be an unreliable system that imposes costs on all the other PJM customers.”
Hester on Monday called the legislators’ plan something of a “logical hybrid between the two” proposals — the governors’, which would merely provide incentives, and that of the independent market monitor.
“They [data centers] can join, if they bring their own supply,” Hester said. “And if not, then they agree to the non-firm capacity market.”
The lawmakers highlighted the fact that their coalition includes lawmakers from seven PJM states and Washington, D.C., mostly Democrats but with a small number of GOP representatives, too.
“It’s just not very often the leaders from a broad number of states like this, in a bipartisan manner, come together in a shared fight,” said D.C. Councilmember Charles Allen. “But it really highlights what’s at stake in the millions and millions of people and businesses that will be harmed if things just keep going as they have been.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DSC_0145-newsletter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-17 21:56:32.329199

(Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)News that TAC Data Centers released its option to lease land in Great Falls drew some support from conservation advocates, but progress on other data centers in the state elicited recent praise as well — for different reasons.
Data center projects are popping up in Montana. Supporters see them as a tool for economic development, but detractors fear they’ll increase bills for residential power customers and will be a drain on water resources.
In an announcement on Friday, Upper Missouri Waterkeeper said TAC Data Centers had pulled out of its option to lease 569 acres in Great Falls, citing the Great Falls Development Alliance.
In a statement, Guy Alsentzer, executive director of the Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, said many of Montana’s river basins are already facing shortages and can’t afford water demands from data centers.
“Montana’s future depends on protecting our water from being drained for external markets,” Alsentzer said in the announcement.
TAC Data Centers could not be reached Monday by phone.
However, representatives with a couple of other data center projects in Montana gave updates during the most recent legislative Energy and Technology Interim Committee meeting, specifically about water use, and one project was met with enthusiasm by at least one legislator.
Beowulf Electricity and Data has the Big Horn Data Hub expansion planned in Hardin, and Sabey Data Centers has a proposed project in Butte.
The Beowulf website and its representative describe the Big Horn Data Hub as adjacent to and supplied by the Hardin Generating Station coal plant and operating for bitcoin mining since 2020, although not currently running. It intends to expand.
The Beowulf representative said the company is awaiting information about how the Public Service Commission will handle data center rates with NorthWestern Energy.
He also told legislators the data center is not currently running because some equipment is being decommissioned.
Sabey has an option to buy land for a controversial data center in a business park in Butte, and it has until Feb. 11 to close the deal, although local commissioners would still need to approve it, according to reporting from the Montana Standard and Nonstop Local.
Data centers can use a substantial amount of water for cooling, but at the meeting, company representatives discussed their use of “closed loop” systems — which one said require a one-time fill but then only minimal water.
In a phone call Monday, Sen. Gayle Lammers, R-Hardin, said the Beowulf data operation planned for Big Horn County holds economic development potential for the area.
“It’s just neat to see some hustle and bustle in little Hardin get going,” Lammers said.
Lammers said Big Horn County is among the poorest in Montana, and the data center will have direct benefits with tax revenue and jobs.
But he also said he hopes it will create a ripple effect and spark interest in other industrial lots.
He said it’s important to see economic development in rural communities, and data centers bring the need for materials and places to eat, among other things.
“I just think it could be a real boon to the economy as long as it’s done right,” Lammers said.
At the meeting, in response to a question from Rep. Bob Carter, D-Missoula, Rob Corbin of Sabey said operations typically bring several thousand employees during the construction phase and 400 or 500 people later.
Corbin said other lease holders in the building typically can bring an additional 60% to 80% more employees as well.
The data centers are also controversial because details about them, including deals for energy supply, have not been available to the public.
NorthWestern Energy has announced plans to provide electricity for data centers, but it has not provided information about them, including letters of interest, requested by the Public Service Commission.
The Public Service Commission regulates monopoly utilities in Montana.
NorthWestern has argued it should be able to provide the information under a protective order — viewable to commissioners but not the public — because some of the data is proprietary.
In a recent filing with the Public Service Commission, NorthWestern also said it won’t serve data center customers before “a specific contract for electric service” with that customer is approved by the commission.
In another filing, Sabey also argues it should be able to keep its letter of intent protected in part because it contains “trade secrets” and it would hurt its ability to compete.
But in letters to the Public Service Commission, a group of energy watchdogs have alleged NorthWestern Energy is moving forward with electricity contracts for data centers in violation of the law — a charge NorthWestern disputes.

(Alaska National Guard photo by Staff Sgt. Joseph Moon)Alaska legislators with the state Joint Armed Services Committee are raising concerns that a federal directive to prepare the Alaska National Guard to deploy domestically for civil unrest could divert service members from disaster relief efforts. 
In October, the Pentagon ordered all states to prepare the National Guard to be trained for “civil disturbance operations,” according to an internal directive first reported by the Guardian.
A spokesperson said the Alaska National Guard has received the directive to prepare a 350 member “rapid reaction force” by Jan. 1, but said the state’s National Guard has not begun any specific training outside typical readiness training. 
“This mission requirement does not impact our support to ongoing Typhoon Halong response operations, and we continue to meet all state and federal mission requirements,” said Dana Rosso, a public affairs officer for the Alaska National Guard, via email.
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, is co-chair of the Alaska Joint Armed Services Committee, and a veteran of the Alaska National Guard. He said he’s concerned about the possibility of a quick response force being used to quell “civil unrest” in Alaska and across the country.  
“The fear is, of course, that when you have a tool, an expensive tool, at your disposal, that you’re going to find a reason to use it. And so I think the fear about having this quick response force locked and loaded is that they could be used when it’s inappropriate to use them,” he said. “Peaceful protest would be the perfect example.”
The federal directive said National Guard members should be training in crowd management and riot control, including the use of batons, body shields, Tasers and pepper spray. 
Lawsuits, protests and federal courts have repeatedly challenged and barred the Trump administration deploying National Guard troops to American cities to assist police and immigration enforcement, asserting it is illegal and an abuse of executive powers. 
Additionally, an estimated 200 Alaska service members are now deployed to assist with disaster relief efforts one month after the devastation of Typhoon Halong, officials said. It’s deemed the largest off-the-road system response by the National Guard in the state’s history.

Gray and committee co-chair Sen. Scott Kawasaki, D-Fairbanks, sent a letter expressing concerns to Maj. Gen. Torrence Saxe, Adjutant General of the Alaska National Guard, who is also Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. 
“The broad and vague nature of this mandate raises serious questions about its intent and implications, particularly regarding the potential use of these forces in domestic law enforcement situations,” the letter said, in part. 
Gray published an op-ed in the Anchorage Daily News on Monday saying the committee has yet to receive a response from Maj. Gen. Saxe about the Alaska National Guard’s plans.
Gray served for nine years in the Alaska Army National Guard as a medical provider, and deployed to Kosovo in 2019. He commended the agency’s work and unprecedented disaster relief effort. 
“I don’t want to disregard the enormous amount of stress and pressure on them right now for this particular disaster response,” Gray said. “That may very well be a valid reason why they haven’t been able to meet to discuss this issue. But that would be really good and reassuring information for the public.”
Gray said he’s requested a meeting with the leadership of Alaska National Guard for an update, but so far his questions have not been answered. 
“Most importantly,” he said, “under what circumstances does our leadership in Alaska expect to be utilizing this force?”
Leaders with the Alaska National Guard declined repeated interview requests. Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s office also did not respond to questions about what circumstances would trigger the deployment of the quick response force, whether in Alaska or nationally, or the concerns raised in the legislators’ letter to Commissioner Saxe. 
In an email, Rosso said that preparing a reaction force is not a new mission for the National Guard. “It has existed for two decades as a rapid-response capability designed to assist civil authorities when requested by a governor. Each state’s NGRF (National Guard Reaction Force) is organized as a temporary task force under state control and can respond quickly to protect lives, property, and critical infrastructure,” he wrote.
Rosso said the Alaska National Guard has not begun any specific training, but that some readiness tasks “such as security operations and initial protective equipment training,” are already part of the National Guard’s ongoing training. He said they are conducting an inventory on equipment and weapons listed in the memo, like Tasers, batons and pepper spray.

“Many units already use authorized protective equipment and training devices as part of their annual readiness training. Before making any new equipment purchases, we are assessing what capabilities already exist,” he wrote. 
Rosso said the Alaska National Guard had no further communication from the Pentagon on the mission of the National Guard response force. “We have not received any official taskings for NGRF support or deployment,” he said. 
The Oct. 8 memo signed by Maj. Gen. Ronald Burkett, the director of operations for the Pentagon’s National Guard Bureau, orders all states to prepare National Guard forces, totaling 23,500 troops nationwide, to be ready within a 24 hour notice. The memo cites Trump’s executive order to address the “crime emergency” in Washington D.C., which has come under intense criticism and legal challenges, which has continued as more troops were mobilized to Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland and Chicago. 
Retired Lt. Colonel Daniel Maurer, a veteran active-duty Army officer and former Judge Advocate General, testified on the topic to the Alaska Joint Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. He is now an associate professor of law at Northern Ohio University. 
But Maurer said none of the Trump administration’s justifications for the order are legally accurate, because he says they’re not based on credible, factual evidence. 
The Trump administration has claimed illegal immigration is a national security threat, and troops are needed in U.S. cities for illegal immigration enforcement, as well as to combat protesters accused of being part of “Antifa” or a “domestic terrorist threat.”  
“As a result, the military is being ordered in situations where they lack sufficient training and sensitivity to the constitutional rights and protections of those civilian protesters,” he said. “It puts soldiers in terribly awkward positions where they must act like police, and police fellow Americans on American civil streets.” 
The remarks were part of a broader discussion at the committee hearing on constitutional concerns and politicization of the U.S. Department of Defense policies and actions in 2025. 
The military is prohibited from enforcing civilian law under the Posse Comitatus Act, unless authorized by Congress or by the U.S. Constitution. Only under the Insurrection Act can the president deploy the military to suppress an insurrection. 
Maurer said there is no evidence of such a need. “It is extreme, especially what is predicated on flat out lies. The triggers that these laws are based on aren’t being triggered. They’re just not happening on the ground. Court after court after court have said it’s not,” he said, adding that troops are being used to intimidate protesters.
“There was no problem to fix with the military,” Maurer said. “It is simply an effort to show force — muscular, robust camouflage, armed force — to show protests, because this president does not like protests.”
Gray said he’s also worried about the National Guard intimidating voters around the 2026 midterm elections, including in Alaska. He pointed to Trump’s criticism of recent elections won by Democrats, and a social media post falsely calling California’s elections approving redistricting by mail-in voting “rigged.”  There’s no evidence the National Guard was involved or used to intimidate voters in recent elections this month, and the memo does not call for such use.

Gray said he’s also concerned that the National Guard would assist in immigration enforcement operations in Alaska like it already has in other parts of the country, especially as the Trump administration has revoked protections and legal status for refugees, like Ukrainians fleeing from war. 
“People are afraid to leave their homes. We’ve heard these stories about folks who have to have food brought to them. You know, they won’t even go to the grocery store because they see things happen, like what happened in Fairbanks with the woman literally going to the grocery store and being picked up off the street by ICE,” he said, referring to a Fairbanks woman and mother of six detained by ICE for two months over her immigration status, and recently released. 
Gray said based on his own National Guard experience, he also questions whether 350 Alaska service members will be available for rapid deployment. He said in 2019 Alaska was not able to coordinate the 220 service members called on to deploy to Kosovo, so he said others were recruited from Wyoming. “So I’m curious about how easy it would be to do 350 at a moment’s notice,” he said. “Without having it have an impact on folks, families, jobs, etc.”
But his main concern is for transparency about where, when and why Alaska service members could be called to respond to civil unrest. 
“Again, we need to be able to ask those questions,” Gray said. “We need to find out what our leaders in Alaska’s interpretation of the use of that quick reaction force is. How will it be used here? How will it not be used here?”

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina Supreme Court Justice John Few defended his vote to strike down the state’s 2021 abortion law as he tries to keep his job on the state’s highest court.
Few and his three challengers appeared Monday before the Legislature’s judicial screening panel. The public hearing took an unexpected turn when it was House Speaker Jay Lucas’ turn to be questioned by his former colleagues. The 68-year-old former GOP speaker said he wouldn’t have to retire at age 72 — a surprise interpretation of state law that prompted a 15-minute exchange with Senate Judiciary Chairman Luke Rankin, the panel’s vice chairman.
Two other judges are vying to replace Few as he seeks re-election to another 10-year term: Administrative Law Court Chief Judge Ralph King “Tripp” Anderson, who has been on the bench for more than three decades, and S.C. Court of Appeals Judge Blake Hewitt, who was elected to the state’s second-highest court in 2019.
3 challengers to SC Supreme Court justice include former House speaker

It’s the first time in more than 20 years that a sitting South Carolina Supreme Court justice has faced competition to hold onto a seat. The unusual and crowded challenge comes nearly three years after Few joined two other justices in tossing out South Carolina’s 2021 law to ban abortions once an ultrasound detects cardiac activity, considered a six-week ban.
In the 3-2 ruling on Jan. 5, 2023, each of the five justices wrote separate opinions, but Few joined the majority’s conclusion. GOP leaders blasted the ruling, accusing justices of overstepping their authority.
When Statehouse Republicans successfully sought a re-do, they tailored the rewrite specifically to Few’s concerns. When the new version of the law came back before an all-male court later in 2023, it picked up Few’s vote in the 4-1 ruling.
“Without a doubt, the most recent decisions that you have been a majority vote in have created some political consternation for you,” Rankin said.
The Myrtle Beach Republican used a comment submitted anonymously to the screening panel to bring up the ruling. After reading the lawyer’s opinion that Few got it right the first time, before he flipped, Rankin asked Few to respond.
Few noted how unusual it was for him to rule against the Legislature. Since his 2016 election to the state Supreme Court, justices have issued just eight split decisions on a state law’s constitutionality. The 2021 abortion law was the only one he voted to overturn that wasn’t part of a unanimous ruling.
“That actually shows, I think, a great deal of restraint,” Few said.
In his January 2023 opinion, Few cited conflicting language on women’s right to an “informed choice.” He also indicated he might have upheld a ban “despite a complete invasion of a pregnant woman’s right to privacy” if state law had specifically declared that life begins at conception.
“What the Legislature says about its goals and why it’s trying to achieve this goal is important,” Few told the panel Monday.
To flip Few’s vote, Republicans deleted all references to “informed choice” and inserted a finding that “the State of South Carolina has a compelling interest from the outset of a woman’s pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the unborn child.”
Few’s term expires July 31, 2026. His election a decade earlier filled the vacancy left when then-Chief Justice Jean Toal retired from full-time work.
Before joining the Supreme Court, Few was chief judge of the state Court of Appeals and a circuit court judge, giving him a total of 25 years on the bench.
Under state law, the 62-year-old justice is eligible to work for another decade, before he reaches the mandatory retirement age for judges. State law requires judges to retire from full-time work by Dec. 31 after turning 72.
Age limits debated

At least, that’s how the law has been widely interpreted.
Lucas, however, presented a different take.
Rankin began his questioning of the former speaker by saying his candidacy “screams politics,” suggesting the age limit could lessen that, since Lucas could be on the bench for only 3 ½ years.
But Lucas said his reading of the law is that the age limit applies only if he chooses to accept a judicial retirement package — and he doesn’t plan to do that.
“I will suggest to you that you are making news irrespective of your candidacy with what you’ve just said,” Rankin responded.
But Lucas doubled-down on his belief that, if elected, he could stay on the Supreme Court for a full 10-year term, despite his being nearly 80 years old by that time.
Staff members for the judicial screening panel previously informed Lucas they disagreed with that opinion. And Rep. Micah Caskey, who chairs the screening panel, cited a 2022 opinion from the attorney general’s office to the contrary.
If the Legislature ended up electing Lucas to the high court, and he insisted on staying, it could be up to the state Supreme Court to ultimately settle the question.
“If I’m wrong, I’m wrong,” Lucas said.
“I think you’re wrong,” Ranking countered.
Of the five vying for the seat, Lucas is the only candidate who’s previously held elected office and has no judicial experience.
The Republican, who works as an attorney in Hartsville, spent 24 years in the state House and nearly eight years as speaker before leaving office in 2022. He then went on to head government relations for the state’s largest hospital system, Prisma Health.
“If your candidacy is successful, it will mean that a sitting justice has not been re-elected, and that you have been elected to the bench without ever having had served as a judge before,” said Caskey, R-West Columbia, inviting his chamber’s former leader to respond.
Lucas said he believes his position as a practicing lawyer, along with his Statehouse experience, actually give him an advantage.
The election by the Legislature is tentatively set for March 4.
This will mark the first election since a law tweaking how legislators pick judges went into effect July 1.
Among the changes are an increase in the number of candidates forwarded to the General Assembly for an election. Instead of limiting the pool to three, the screening panel can send up to six for a vote.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_0879-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-17 20:57:08.031817

Cowell told NC Newsline she had spoken with the governor’s office, Raleigh police and the city manager, and it was “our understanding through other law enforcement partners that the Border Patrol is already in Raleigh.”
“They may be active tomorrow,” Cowell said.
Cowell said city officials “don’t have a lot of information” about the scale of the Raleigh operation or how long the agency plans to be there. She has not had any direct contact with Border Patrol as of Monday evening, she said.
“If there’s something that happens where you feel unsafe or you see something that you think is unlawful, you can call the police,” Cowell said. “We’ll be monitoring the situation and trying to keep everybody informed and safe as best we can.”
Border Patrol says it has arrested more than 130 people in recent days after arriving in Charlotte, the latest large-scale operation after a month-long campaign in Chicago.
The Trump administration has described its city-focused operations as aimed at organized crime, gang activity and repeat offenders who are undocumented. But in Chicago, hundreds of those arrested did not have serious criminal records, and those arrested included U.S. citizens.
It is not immediately clear how many of those arrested in Charlotte over recent days have criminal records or are undocumented.

The utility warned it ""will take time"" and didn't disclose what would be available to the public or when.
The post Rocky Mountain Power announces ‘internal investigation’ of massive power outage appeared first on WyoFile .","The massive, multi-utility power outage that left more than 100,000 customers in Wyoming, South Dakota and Montana without electricity Thursday resulted from a failure in Rocky Mountain Power’s system in Wyoming, the company says. But the utility, so far, isn’t offering specific details.
“The cause is still unknown and is currently under investigation,” Rocky Mountain Power Senior Communications Specialist Jona Whitesides said Friday afternoon. “Given the complexity of this event, the investigation to determine the root cause and precise order of events on the system will take time.”
The company is investigating the incident internally, Whitesides added. It’s unclear how much detail it will offer to the public or when.
“The exact duration [to determine the cause] is not known at this time,” Whitesides said.
The Western Area Power Administration, which manages hydroelectric power and transmission lines across several western states and was impacted by the interruption, initially described the cause as “triggered by two tripped 500-kilovolt lines near Medicine Bow, Wyoming.”

The term “tripped,” in the industry, typically refers to an automatic shutoff in response to a power disruption.
The event resulted in “abnormal voltage,” the power administration added on Friday, which shut down power transmission lines in the region, where multiple utilities and rural electric co-ops share an interconnected grid. 
“What we do know,” Rocky Mountain Power’s Whitesides said, “is that it impacted PacifiCorp [Rocky Mountain Power’s parent company], WAPA and Black Hills Energy, which include customers in Wyoming, South Dakota and Montana.”
The “bulk power system” outage darkened homes and businesses throughout central and northeast Wyoming for varying lengths of time, including coal mines in the Powder River Basin, oil and natural gas refineries, and led to a fire at Rocky Mountain Power’s Dave Johnston coal-fired power plant near Glenrock.
The fire “was quickly extinguished,” Whitesides said. “Safety systems operated as designed, protecting employees and equipment. No injuries occurred and some equipment damage was reported.”
The unusual, far-reaching scale of the outage is a significant grid reliability issue, according to one industry official who spoke with WyoFile. The event could spur a federal investigation, perhaps by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which develops and enforces grid reliability standards.

Inquiries to those agencies were not returned by press time.
“Certainly, it isn’t just going to be a blip on the radar,” Powder River Energy Corporation Vice President of Member Service Joe Roth told WyoFile. “There’s definitely going to be accountability held at one of those federal levels.”
The Wyoming Public Service Commission also requires reliability standards, according to the agency. But it’s unclear what it might require of Rocky Mountain Power, the state’s largest regulated electric utility, in terms of a report or accountability. “It appears that there may be a federal investigation into the matter,” Commission Chief Counsel John Burbridge told WyoFile.
“While state and federal agencies may choose to conduct their own reviews, at this time we have not been notified of any [outside] investigations,” Rocky Mountain Power’s Whitesides said. “PacifiCorp has submitted reports about the event to the U.S. Department of Energy, the Wyoming Public Service Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.”
At least one local emergency management coordinator expressed frustration with Rocky Mountain Power for not being responsive to questions during and immediately following the power outage and the resulting fire at the Dave Johnston power plant, which is owned and operated by the utility.
“I wish I could tell you exactly what happened there, and I honestly cannot,” Converse County Emergency Management Coordinator Russ Dalgarn told WyoFile on Friday regarding the Dave Johnston fire. “They haven’t told us anything.”
The lack of communication from Rocky Mountain Power to local responders is nothing new, Dalgarn added. The utility is “notorious” for not sharing information with local emergency responders, Dalgarn said.
Asked to respond, Whitesides said, “I am surprised by that because our relationships with state and local first responders and emergency managers have been very collaborative, and we value those relationships very much.”
Utilities affected by the Rocky Mountain Power disruption reported that their systems automatically shut down — a built-in safety response. 
“Although the sudden loss of electricity across an entire region came as a jolt to residents and businesses who operate here, the [Powder River Energy Corporation] systems that protect infrastructure and consumers performed as designed as it responded to the high and low voltage scenarios,” the company said.
The power outage began around 12:45 p.m. Thursday. Some regions saw power restored that afternoon, and electricity was restored to most of the region later that night, according to reports.

Greene, until recently known as a die-hard Trump supporter, has been on the outs with the president after publicly disagreeing with him over funding for Israel's military and, most recently, the release of the Epstein files. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderWhat’s going on with Marjorie?
That’s the question President Donald Trump had reportedly been asking senior Republicans about Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene last month as she publicly disagreed with him over policies like Affordable Care Act subsidies and the genocide in Gaza, as she put it.
More and more people are asking about the state of Greene’s goings-on as her feud with the president has erupted into what appears to be a messy breakup.
Trump publicly withdrew his support for Greene Friday in a social media post in which he called Greene “wacky” and “a ranting Lunatic” and pondered supporting a primary challenge against her.
“I understand that wonderful, Conservative people are thinking about primarying Marjorie in her District of Georgia, that they too are fed up with her and her antics and, if the right person runs, they will have my Complete and Unyielding Support,” Trump posted.
Greene responded with her own social media post the same day saying that the disagreement that caused Trump to withdraw his endorsement was her support for the release of files related to convicted sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, which Trump had opposed as a “Democrat Hoax.”
“It’s astonishing really how hard he’s fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,” Greene wrote. “But really most Americans wish he would fight this hard to help the forgotten men and women of America who are fed up with foreign wars and foreign causes, are going broke trying to feed their families, and are losing hope of ever achieving the American dream.”
Trump has since reversed course and called for House Republicans to support the release of the files. Since Trump announced his support for releasing the files, Republican U.S. Reps. Mike Collins and Buddy Carter, both of whom are running for U.S. Senate in Georgia, said they back the push to release the files, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
Greene – who has characterized Democrats as pedophiles trying to destroy America from within – also raised eyebrows in a Sunday interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, in which she apologized for “taking part in toxic politics” and pledged to tone down her rhetoric, citing the assassination of conservative pundit Charlie Kirk as helping to change her mind.
The district
In a statement Monday, the Georgia GOP chairman for Greene’s district, Jim Tully, expressed support and gratitude for Greene.
“While the President of the United States represents the nation as a whole, Congresswoman Greene represents the people of Northwest Georgia, and she has done so with clarity, resolve, and integrity,” Tully said. “Her willingness to speak candidly on behalf of her constituents, even in the face of political pressure, underscores her courage and her fidelity to her oath.”
State Rep. Kasey Carpenter, a Republican from Dalton who lives in and represents part of Greene’s district, said he doesn’t see Greene losing rank-and-file voters either.
“She’s going to lose some people that are drinking 100% of the Kool-Aid,” Carpenter said. “But I think at the end of the day, it gives her a broader appeal than before, because at the end of the day, I think the things that she’s saying and supporting are really things that our district supports, so she’s representing her people.”
Carpenter, whose district includes a large Latino population, has broken with his party on immigration issues and has faced kickback from his party for it, but he said voters ultimately value authenticity.
“I literally just think you do the best you can to represent your people, and sometimes you make ‘em mad, sometimes you don’t, you know?” he said. “But if they know your heart’s in the right place, they kind of work with you, and I think that’s what you’re seeing.”
Three Republicans have filed paperwork to challenge Greene in next year’s GOP primary: Uloma Ekpete, business owner Jefferson Edward Criswell and Federal Emergency Management Agency employee and entrepreneur Star Black, according to Federal Election Commission filings.
The three will likely have their work cut out for them. FEC data shows Black as the best-funded challenger with just over $78,000 cash on hand, compared with $809,000 in Greene’s campaign fund as of the end of September.
Greene’s ambitions
Greene is also a politician, and one who appears to have ambition beyond her district. She skipped the 2026 races for Georgia governor and U.S. senator after Trump urged her not to run.
“It seemed to all begin when I sent her a Poll stating that she should not run for Senator, or Governor, she was at 12%, and didn’t have a chance (unless, of course, she had my Endorsement — which she wasn’t about to get!),” Trump wrote in an online post.
Greene’s confrontational nature has made her a darling in her conservative district, but also a punchline in vote-rich areas with more moderate politics like the Atlanta suburbs, which could make it a challenge for her to win a statewide race.
Carpenter said he doesn’t have any insight into Greene’s plans, but that the desire to run for statewide office one day may be contributing to her actions.
“She realizes that, yes, she can win fine in the 14th because it’s grown up that way, but statewide, it’d be impossible,” he said. “So I do think that caused her to take a longer look – and I think Charlie Kirk had something to do with it – and let’s face it. Trump’s going to be gone in three years. So if you’re going to do this for longer than three years, you’d better find yourself, better find your own voice. So I think that’s what she’s doing.”
The politics
Division in the GOP makes for happy Democrats, and left-leaning politicos are giddy at the thought of a Trump-Greene brawl.
In an email to journalists, Kevin Donohoe of the Democratic Governors Association pondered the potential effects on Georgia’s governor’s race.
“Georgia GOP gubernatorial candidates Burt Jones, Brad Raffensperger, and Chris Carr have some major questions to answer as the Greene-Trump feud makes national news: Do they agree with Trump that Marjorie Taylor Greene is “wacky” and a ‘traitor?’ Are they concerned with Trump’s ‘unwarranted and vicious attacks’ that ‘divides our country even more,’ as Greene pointed out? Are they seeking Marjorie Taylor Greene’s endorsement?”
In a phone call, conservative radio host Martha Zoller said Democrats cheering on what they see as fractures in the conservative coalition are being overly optimistic. She characterized Greene’s actions as jockeying for influence.
“Obviously, once you’re (in power), then people start thinking about what’s next, whether it’s her, whether it’s JD Vance, whether it’s Marco Rubio, whether it’s anybody that’s involved in this orbit, people are probably starting to think about what’s next,” Zoller said.
Zoller said she has no indication of what Greene may be planning, but she’s taking a wait-and-see approach, including whether Greene’s actions match her words in the months ahead.
“One thing I like about what she’s doing is she’s admitted she made a mistake, and I think we need to do more of that as a people,” Zoller said. “We created this world where our leaders cannot admit they made a mistake, and we don’t give them the room to be able to do that. Maybe she’s going to start a trend.”

Roughly 77,000 Montanans are eligible for the food assistance, and the average household in Montana receives $332 a month, according to data from DPHHS.
But families received their benefits late this month.
Politicians used SNAP benefits as a negotiating tool in the recent federal shutdown, according to Western Native Voice, a Montana nonprofit with a government relations director in Washington, D.C.
Last month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture directed states to withhold SNAP payments, sparking concern in Montana among families and at food banks preparing for a surge of customers.
In Montana, 63% of SNAP participants are families with children, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
The loss of payments for food led the City-County of Butte-Silver Bow to declare a local emergency and its commissioners to pass a resolution to use $183,974 to alleviate food insecurity in the community.
After multiple directives to states, the USDA called Thursday for full benefits to be paid following the end of the federal shutdown.
The bill to end the shutdown funds the government through Jan. 30, but SNAP benefits are funded until the end of September 2026, according to National Public Radio.

Pictured here is Little Walnut Creek in Waukee, Iowa on May 5, 2025. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed Monday new rules to define the waters of the United States, or WOTUS, protected under the Clean Water Act. 
The move was celebrated by farm groups that oppose a broad interpretation of the law, while environmental groups said the rule change would end protections for millions of acres of wetlands and small streams. 
Waters of the United States defines the scope of the Clean Water Act and which waters can be regulated with federal water quality standards. The WOTUS definition, which is not laid out in the Clean Water Act, has been the source of several U.S. Supreme Court cases in recent decades, most recently in Sackett v. EPA.

The high court ruled in May 2023 that wetlands without a “continuous surface connection” to navigable waters did not qualify for Clean Water Act protections. This was upheld by EPA final rules issued in August 2023, that not only applied to wetlands, but also removed the requirement that waters have a “significant nexus” to a navigable water. 
Some conservative groups and lawmakers argued the 2023 EPA interpretation did not go far enough to adhere to the court’s decision in the Sackett case. 
EPA’s new rules, made in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, would “fully implement”  the Sackett decision, “accelerate economic prosperity” and support the role of states and tribes in regulating their land, according to the agency’s news release. 
“When finalized, the rule will cut red tape and provide predictability, consistency, and clarity for American industry, energy producers, the technology sector, farmers, ranchers, developers, businesses, and landowners for permitting under the Clean Water Act,” the EPA release said.
The proposed rules would further define terms like: relatively permanent, continuous surface connection and tributary. The rules also establish that tributaries must connect to navigable waters via features that have “consistent” and “predictable flow.” 
The rules say wetlands must be “indistinguishable” from jurisdictional waters, with a “continuous surface connection.” The rules will also limit permafrost wetlands from the scope of the definition, include guidance on “wet season” water bodies, and offer exclusions on ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the proposed rules will protect navigable waters, advance cooperative federalism and result in economic growth. 
“Democrat Administrations have weaponized the definition of navigable waters to seize more power from American farmers, landowners, entrepreneurs, and families,” Zeldin said in a statement. “We heard from Americans across the country who want clean water and a clear rule. No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether a Water of the United States is on their property.” 
According to the release, the proposed rules were formed around feedback from states, tribal nations, local governments and listening sessions. 
American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall said, in the release with EPA, the farm organization was “pleased” with the new rules. 
“The Supreme Court clearly ruled several years ago that the government overreached in its interpretation of what fell under federal guidelines,” Duvall said. “We are still reviewing the entire rule, but we are pleased that it finally addresses those concerns and takes steps to provide much-needed clarity.” 
The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association similarly celebrated the draft rules Monday. The association’s president and Nebraska cattleman Buck Wehrbein said the previous interpretations of the rule have meant things like “prairie potholes or dry ditches” fall under federal regulation. 
“Waters of the U.S. has been a longstanding and frustrating issue for family farmers and ranchers,” he said in a statement. “Every few years, the definition of a ‘water of the U.S.’ has changed … We appreciate the EPA finally fixing previous WOTUS rules and supporting America’s family farmers and ranchers.”
Environmental groups said the newly proposed rules put habitat, drinking water and structures at greater risk. 
Environmental Defense Fund’s Vice President Will McDow said EPA’s proposed rules were “not based in science, difficult to implement in practice and will create a dangerous lack of clarity.”
“This rule brings tremendous uncertainty and risk to our nation’s drinking water, flood protections and critical habitats,” McDow said in a statement. 
The environmental group Food & Water Watch said the draft rules eliminate “bedrock” protections for rivers, streams, and wetlands. The group said in a news release the rules would “compound the damage” of the Sackett decision that “eliminated protections for tens of millions of acres of sensitive wetlands and small streams.” 
Food & Water Watch Legal Director Tarah Heinzen said the rule “flies in the face of science and commonsense” and will lead to more pollution downstream. Wetlands, Heinzen said, offer “critical functions” in providing habitat, protecting clean water and reducing flooding. 
“Clean water is under attack in America, as polluting profiteers plunder our waters — Trump’s EPA is openly aiding and abetting this destruction,” Heinzen said. “This proposed rule weakens the bedrock Clean Water Act, making it easier to fill, drain, and pollute sensitive waterways from coast to coast.” 
The proposed rules will be published in the Federal Register and open for public comment for 45 days. EPA and the Army will hold two public meetings before developing final rules.

(Photo courtesy of Westinghouse)As the nation responds to soaring demands for power and sharp spikes in electricity costs, a new generation of nuclear reactors could provide a solution to the need for clean, sustainable energy sources, the state House Energy Committee heard Monday.
The panel is set to vote on legislation that would give state regulators the ability to set appropriate fees for operators of small modular reactors (SMR) and micro reactors that, according to experts who testified, require less space, are easier to build and are inherently safer than plants built decades ago.
House Bill 2017 would amend Pennsylvania’s Radiation Safety Act to include definitions of small modular reactors and micro reactors and provides the state Department of Environmental Protection discretion to lower fees for the smaller power plants. The committee is expected to vote on the bill Tuesday.
Allison Krager Hahn, technical advisor for the Nuclear Energy Institute, said that while the technology used in SMRs has been proven for decades to be safe and reliable, the biggest challenges are on the business side of operations.
“Right now, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is going through a complete overhaul of its processes to understand where they can be more efficient — not less safe, to be clear — to be able to move these licenses through much quicker,” Hahn said.

Most states are also preparing for the future of nuclear power by establishing feasibility studies and incentives for the development of SMRs and the supply chain and workforce building them will require. The Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association representing members in the commercial nuclear industry, is tracking more than 350 pieces of legislation in 46 states, she said.
In Indiana, for example, Gov. Mike Braun signed three pieces of legislation this year that create a 20% tax credit for manufacturing SMRs and let public utilities ask for permission from utility regulators to spend money on SMRs and recover their costs before getting certificates of public convenience and necessity.
In written testimony, Hahn said one of the aspects states must consider is how to separate SMRs and micro reactors from large-scale nuclear reactors for regulatory purposes. 
Under current Pennsylvania law, entities with NRC approval to build a nuclear reactor must pay the commonwealth $650,000 and operators are required to pay $100,000 a year per reactor unit.
Companies must also pay a $250,000 fee to produce nuclear fuel and $500 to $1,000 per shipment of fuel or nuclear waste.
Allowing the DEP to establish separate fees for SMRs and micro reactors “is a great first step,” Hahn said.
SMRs are smaller than large-scale reactors such as those at Three Mile Island (which is reopening as the Crane Clean Energy Center) in Dauphin County and Limerick in Montgomery County.
Federal regulators hear from the community about planned Three Mile Island restart

Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse Electric Co. has developed an SMR design based on its successful AP1000 reactor, which is the latest design produced in the United States. It employs a cooling system that uses the natural circulation of water via convection and gravity to keep the reactor core at a safe temperature in the event of a power failure.
Most existing reactors rely on outside electrical supplies or diesel generators to ensure that the plant’s cooling system continues to operate in the event of an emergency.
Westinghouse’s AP300 is a scaled down version that can be produced in modules in a factory setting, significantly improving quality assurance.  That also reduces the risk of construction delays and cost overruns that have negatively impacted recent nuclear power plant projects, according to Sola Talabi, president of Pittsburgh Technical, an engineering consulting firm that has evaluated SMR designs.
The new generation of SMRs and advanced reactors are designed to be safer than the designs involved in historical failures, such as Three Mile Island, Fukushima and Chernobyl. Those  accidents were caused by the loss of cooling water that caused the melt-down or partial melt-down of the reactors’ radioactive cores, Talabi said.
SMRs and microreactors eliminate the need for an active cooling system in an emergency, Mary Kurash, who oversees the SMR development program for Westinghouse. 
“The systems rely on gravity, natural circulation and convection to bring the plant to a safe shutdown condition and keep that plant in a safe shutdown condition without any external or human intervention or external power,” Kurash said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/westinghouse-AP300-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-11-17 19:56:55.359581

South Carolina will stop covering the weight loss medication Jan. 1, 2026. (Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Starting in January, South Carolina’s Medicaid program will no longer cover weight loss drugs for obesity, reversing a year-old policy.
The change, which comes as states face high costs for covering the popular drugs, will not affect Medicaid patients prescribed the drugs to manage Type 2 diabetes, said Jeff Leieritz, spokesman for the state Department of Health and Human Services. Coverage to treat obesity will end Jan. 1, he said.
The class of medications called GLP-1 drugs mimic a hormone in the body’s intestinal track to balance blood sugar levels and send the brain a signal that reduces hunger, which an increasing number of people have used to lose weight.
As demand for weight-loss drugs rises, states grapple with Medicaid coverage

On Nov. 1, 2024, South Carolina became the 14th state to cover the drugs for weight loss as well as diabetes, as long as patients met prior authorization requirements.
Ozempic is arguably the most well-known GLP-1 drug and often used off-label for weight loss. But the drug never received federal approval for that use. So, while the state’s Medicaid plan pays for Ozempic to treat diabetes, it never covered it for weight loss.
Instead, Medicaid covered Wegovy, Saxenda, or its generic version if patients’ body mass index qualified them as obese and they had related health problems. They also had to participate in dietary counseling, and their doctor needed to attest they were increasing their physical activity.
The change was part of a larger anti-obesity initiative in a state where 36% of all adults were considered obese in 2023, a higher rate than all but a dozen other states, according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Medicaid officials expected the medications and dietary counseling to cost the state $3.3 million annually, Leieritz said previously.
But reimbursements for the drugs alone cost $2.3 million in state taxes, plus $5.5 million in federal taxes, for weight loss prescriptions in the last fiscal year, Leieritz said. And the policy change occurred four months into the year.
Leieritz did not immediately have available the price of the dietary counseling portion, which is billed separately.
The agency also did not provide an estimated cost of continuing to cover the drugs for weight loss.
The decision to stop covering weight loss drugs also followed a reversal in federal policy. The Trump administration earlier this year rejected a policy the Biden administration was considering that would have required every state to cover the cost of the drugs for obese patients.
The cost and federal policy change, along with the looming possibilities of an economic downturn and cuts in federal funding for state programs, likely led state leaders to make hard decisions about what they should cover, said Brad Wright, chair of health services policy and management at the University of South Carolina’s Arnold School of Public Health.
“You’re seeing states having to make these choices where they have to balance their budget,” Wright said. “It could be a real stressor on the budget for sure.”
As of Monday, the list price for Wegovy was $349 per month, a reduction from the previous list price of $1,350 per month. That followed President Donald Trump’s announcement he would negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower the prices of the drugs. States often receive rebates to further reduce prices.
The state Medicaid agency will consider those lower costs when deciding whether to add the medications back onto the state’s list of covered drugs in the future, Leieritz said.
North Carolina made a similar switch in coverage policy last month, citing the high cost of covering the medications for obesity. The drugs remain on the state’s list of approved prescriptions to treat heart disease and sleep apnea, according to the state’s Medicaid agency.
But the drugs aren’t without dangers of their own.
Common side effects of GLP-1 drugs include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and dizziness. In more serious cases, the medication can cause low blood sugar, pancreatitis, kidney failure and thyroid tumors, according to websites for Wegovy and Ozempic.
In South Carolina, which is among 10 states that have not expanded Medicaid to all adults making 138% of the federal poverty level, the program covers low-income children and their parents, along with elderly and disabled people. Income requirements vary depending on the category a person falls into, but regardless, people who qualify for Medicaid generally can’t afford hundreds of dollars each month for weight loss drugs, said Ada Stewart, a Columbia-based family physician.
Low-income people are also often those who need the drugs most, she said. Healthy foods are typically pricier than less-nutritional-but-more-filling alternatives, and people struggling for money likely can’t afford a gym membership or don’t have the time or know-how to exercise, she said.
“It’s sad that we have medications that could work or could save lives and the individuals who could benefit the most can’t have access to this because of barriers that exist,” Stewart said. “If we could remove those barriers, we could have a healthier, more sustainable society.”
For patients who struggle to lose weight in other ways, the drugs can be a literal lifesaver, Stewart said. After losing significant amounts of weight, her patients who take the medications become less likely to have heart attacks or develop diabetes than they were before, she said.
Although removing the drugs from the coverage list will save the state money in the short-term, Stewart said she worried it will cost more in the long run as more people develop other health conditions related to obesity.
“I think that’s something we really need to think about more,” Stewart said. “It’s going to be a larger overall cost, a cost to the system.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wegovy.jpg,,,2025-11-17 19:56:55.359581

Clay Schexnayder’s booking photo at East Baton Rouge Parish Jail
Clay Schexnayder, 56, was charged with felony theft and malfeasance in office. Online records from the East Baton Rouge Parish Jail show he was released after posting $10,000 bail.
The historically significant cypress board, measuring 20 feet by 6 feet, was last seen at Schexnayder’s legislative office in Gonzales. It’s believed to date back to the 8th century A.D. and was harvested from the Maurepas Swamp.
The wood was left behind when Schexnayder moved out of the office last year, having reached his term limit in the legislature. 
“I left the board and computer stuff there for the state to pick up,” Schexnayder told WAFB-TV last week after his indictment was announced. “I left it there like any representative does. What happened to it, I don’t know.” 
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill sought charges against Schexnayder, who said he had only heard from her office once before his indictment was made public. The former speaker said he was willing to assist authorities in finding the missing relic.
Schexnayder’s felony charge stems from the valuation of the cypress board exceeding $25,000. Felony theft in Louisiana is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a fine reaching $50,000 or both though sentences are typically much lower for first-time offenders.
The maximum penalties for malfeasance in office are 10 years imprisonment and a $5,000 fine.

(Photo courtesy of John Loughlin's Facebook page)Rhode Island’s 2026 lieutenant governor’s race now has its first Republican candidate.
John Loughlin, a former state representative and House minority whip who made an unsuccessful run for Congress, announced his campaign Saturday on the WPRO-AM radio show he’s hosted since 2012 and will now end in order to run for the office. The Tiverton resident had posted on his Facebook page last month that he was running.
On Tara Granahan’s show Monday morning, Loughlin said he was “very excited to be bringing a completely different perspective than we’ve had for 90 years in the State House.” He filed papers early Monday afternoon to reactivate his campaign finance account.
An Iraq war veteran, Loughlin served 26 years in the Army and Air National Guard and runs Media-Rite, a television, radio and film production company. He was first elected to the Rhode Island House representing District 71 (Tiverton, Little Compton and Portsmouth) in 2004 and served three terms until his 2010 run for the First Congressional District seat that opened after the retirement of Patrick J. Kennedy. Loughlin lost to David Cicilline, receiving 44.6% of the vote to Cicilline’s 50.6%.
At least two Democrats so far are challenging Democratic Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos, who has indicated she will be seeking a second term.
Last week, Providence City Councilor Sue AnderBois formally kicked off her campaign to unseat Matos. Last June, Cindy Coyne, a former Democratic state senator from Barrington announced her campaign.
The lieutenant governor fulfills the executive responsibilities of the governor upon his or her death, resignation, impeachment, or inability to serve. They also make appointments to boards and commissions established by the General Assembly and can draft but not introduce legislation. The lieutenant governor also chairs and serves on various commissions and advisory boards. These duties leave a lot of time for assuming advocacy roles in areas of the officeholder’s choosing.
In announcing his campaign, Loughlin called for building more affordable homes, especially to help Rhode Islanders in their 20s and 30s to stay in the state and start families here. He supports the creation of an office of inspector general and says the state’s policies to combat climate change are unrealistic and too costly for residents and businesses. 
Matos has focused her advocacy work on the fight to lower the cost of groceries, protect small businesses and build affordable housing.
The lieutenant governor’s annual salary is $137,510.

Much of the debate over the Ambler road and the associated mine development concern impacts to the herd, one of the largest in North America. (Photo by Matt Cameron/National Park Service)I suppose it was inevitable that I would someday write a commentary in opposition to the proposed Ambler Road. Both the Arctic region through which the road would pass, and the reason it’s a developer’s dream, are deeply connected to the path my own life has taken.
Along its 211-mile length, the road would skirt the southern foothills of the Central Brooks Range, a place that altered the course of my life.
Back in the mid-1970s, fresh out of grad school, I was part of a geology crew that searched those mountains for sulfide-mineral deposits rich enough to someday become a mine—or at least add value to already known deposits, thus increasing the region’s economic potential. Among my colleagues and bosses were geologists who in the early 1960s found a high-grade copper lode associated with what’s known as the Bornite Deposit, one of the major reasons the Ambler Road is being pushed.
While working in the Brooks Range—and especially its Ambler River Valley—in 1975, a series of events prompted me to question my life’s direction.
 By the end of my second summer in the Brooks Range, it had become clear that I loved wild, undeveloped landscapes much more than the promise of rich mineral deposits that might be developed into mines—even more than geology itself, as recounted in my book “Changing Paths: Travels and Meditations in Alaska’s Arctic Wilderness.” 
I left that profession and found a new calling, as a writer. I started in journalism as a sports writer, then became an outdoors and nature writer and eventually an essayist and author. Along the way I also became an advocate for Alaska’s wildlands and wildlife.
Since leaving the field of geology nearly a half-century ago, I have visited the Brooks Range several times. Though I love that entire mountain chain, I am most passionate about its central region, which so dramatically reshaped my life, especially that part protected by the 8.5 million acre Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. Hence my interest in—and opposition to—the Ambler Road.
Though it would pass through only a small portion of Gates—and wouldn’t come near the park’s 7.2 million acre wilderness core—I’m convinced the proposed road would transform much of the adjacent region into an industrial zone. Many reports, articles and commentaries have identified the road’s likely harmful impacts to the landscape and its streams, fish and wildlife—most notably salmon and caribou—as well as indigenous subsistence lifestyles.
The overwhelming abundance of evidence presented by others is one reason I’ve chosen, until now, to largely stay on the sidelines during this battle, though I have presented my perspectives to the Bureau of Land Management during public comment periods.
I was among many Alaskans—and Americans—to celebrate when the Biden administration rejected the Ambler Road, formally known as the Ambler Access Project, in 2024. 
Now President Donald Trump has re-approved the project, as he did initially during his first term. 
Still, as reported by the Northern Journal and other media, the road’s construction is not a done deal, a reason for wilderness advocates and road opponents to be hopeful. 
The Trump administration’s push to resurrect the Ambler Road is not my only concern.
Though not directly affected, I’m greatly disturbed by Congress’s decision—pushed by Alaska’s congressional delegation—to overturn another Biden-era decision, this time to approve what’s called the Central Yukon Resource Management Plan.
That plan was more than a decade in the making, with considerable input—and support—from Native residents of Alaska’s Interior. I’ve found Athabaskan elder Mickey Stickman’s explanation of the plan, and its importance to local residents, to be particularly compelling. 
Unfortunately for Stickman and others who worked so long and hard on this plan, Alaska’s congressional delegation has sided with mine developers, Ambler Road proponents and corporations, while choosing to ignore the efforts of so many Alaskans, including tribal groups.
So for multiple reasons, I speak up now on behalf of wilderness, wildlife and Alaskans who will be harmed by not only the Trump administration’s actions, but those of our congressional delegation, who have chosen corporate interests over those who live closest to the land and depend on caribou, salmon, berries and other wild riches that have nothing to do with mining and other industrial development of our land.

(Getty Images)Some state funding for infrastructure in the KentuckyWired broadband network would be suspended under a recommendation made last week by a legislative committee.
Citing court battles that have embroiled the agency, the Information Technology Oversight Committee recommended “deauthorizing” money for bonds that have not yet been issued by the Kentucky Communications Network Authority (KCNA) for “infrastructure upgrades and network refreshes.” 
The committee called for “deauthorizing” funding for bonds that have not yet been issued for “infrastructure upgrades and network refreshes” by the network authority.  
 The report to leaders of the GOP-controlled legislature also recommends no future appropriations be made to the authority for infrastructure upgrades and network refreshes. The legislature allocated $25,359,000 in bonds for the authority in the current two-year state budget for “critical” infrastructure upgrades and purchases. 
Sen. Gex WIlliams, R-Verona, a co-chair of the committee, told the Lantern that the recommendations would be a “pause” in funding until ongoing lawsuits between the Kentucky Communications Network Authority and Accelecom — a private telecom provider that partnered with the authority to manage the network — are resolved. 
“We don’t want to limit whoever’s going to deal with this in the future” by making investments into the network today, Williams told the Lantern. 
He also said the recommended “pause” is to allow time for Republican State Auditor Allison Ball to finish an audit of the authority’s finances, an investigation the state legislature previously approved and allocated money toward. 
Sen. Gex Williams. (LRC Public Information)
The authority manages hundreds of miles of fiber optic cable built across the state to provide high-speed internet connection to every county seat, serving as a “middle mile” of internet connection. Private companies can then build a “last mile” of internet connection directly to homes and businesses. 
The network construction — originally launched in 2013 under former Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear — has faced criticism in the past from state lawmakers for overspending by at least $100 million and years-long delays in getting the network live for businesses, households, school districts and other public entities to use.
The Kentucky Communications Network Authority over the past two years has been entangled in litigation with the private company Accelecom, or Open Fiber Kentucky Company LLC, which it partnered with to manage the broadband network. The ongoing contract disputes before Franklin Circuit Court Judge Phillip Shepherd include Accelecom seeking permission to connect certain customers to the middle mile network. 
WDRB in Louisville reported earlier this year that the authority had terminated its contract with Accelecom earlier this year because the private company had allegedly violated the terms of its agreement. Accelcom had sent a letter to customers using the network that internet connections could be shut off at the end of the month. 
Williams said he had lost confidence in the executive director of the authority, Doug Hendrix, to make “reasonable decisions” on infrastructure upgrades for the network because he’s not confident the authority has proper technical expertise. Williams said he plans to file a bill during the legislative session that begins in January to remake the board overseeing the authority. 
Hendrix and Greg Maddox, the general counsel for the authority, did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment about the committee’s recommendations and Williams’ comments.

The new Journey’s End Wilderness Preserve permanently protects 342 acres adjacent to the Long Trail corridor and Jay State Forest in Vermont.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Land trust expands Long Trail corridor protection, creates ‘forever wild’ preserve.","About 20 years ago, Susan Shea and Ted Vogt went for a hike on a remote and wild piece of land off Journey’s End Road in Jay. 
Over the years, the two Brookfield residents have hiked, camped, spotted bears  and bought up parcels of it in hopes of preserving it for posterity.  
The Journey’s End Wilderness Preserve now permanently protects more than 340 acres adjacent to the Long Trail corridor and Jay State Forest, the Northeast Wilderness Trust announced in a press release Monday. 
The land was ripe for protection and connectivity, said Shea, a retired conservationist who was formerly director of land conservation for the Green Mountain Club.
The duo enjoyed many joys on that undeveloped land, from spotting bears and moose tracks to discovering the “very pretty Mountain Brook” with cascades of clear, cold, pure water, according to Vogt, a retired lawyer.
“You just see all kinds of beauty — and in every season. I got up there in the springtime when the snow is melting, and water is running everywhere, and the flowers are emerging, and it’s just glorious. So we are lucky to have that and we need to appreciate it,” he said.
Which is why they were eager to conserve it beyond their lifetimes and make it “forever wild.”

A few years ago, they reached out to the regional land trust based in Montpelier that specializes in re-wilding conservation land. And they sold all 342 acres to the trust for $100,000, according to Jon Leibowitz, president and CEO of the Northeast Wilderness Trust. 
Forever wild areas — which may also be called wilderness areas, natural areas or ecological reserves — are legally protected tracks of land left to nature to evolve over time. Logging, extraction, development and other forms of active management are prohibited. They boost Vermont’s wilderness acreage with well-established benefits to wildlife, humans and the climate, Leibowitz said.
They also meet Vermont’s goal to conserve at least 30% of the state’s land by 2030 and 50% by 2050.
Although about 25% of the state’s land base is conserved, according to the Vermont Agency of Natural Resource’s database, only about 3.5% of it is protected as forever wild, Leibowitz said.

That means a majority of the state’s preserved land allows logging and active management. While forever wild areas may still be open to recreational use by the public, “every time that a place is protected as forever wild today, it means that it’s an old forest of the future,” he said.
Northeast Wilderness Trust is a 23-year-old private land trust that also owns the 350-acre Bram Hall Wilderness Preserve south of the Long Trail in Bridgewater. The trust has protected more than 19,000 acres across Vermont as “forever wild” land and more than 103,000 acres across the Northeast, according to the trust’s Monday press release.
For Vogt and Shea, the permanent protection is a dream come true. 
“Because what happens is, over time, the land heals itself,” said Vogt, who has hiked the entire Long Trail and was a volunteer for the Green Mountain Club. “All of the trees grow back, things return to a kind of more natural state. And 100 years from now, if that forest is left alone, that will almost be like an old growth forest in certain respects.”
Shea said conserving the land was particularly important for wildlife as the climate changed.
“Besides being great for a back country hiking trail, it’s very important for wildlife to be able to to to move to travel, especially with climate change, as some of them need to move north. This land is adjacent to already conserved land so that made it particularly important to conserve,” Shea said.
Journey’s End is also a great example of how the land trust model works, Leibowitz said. 
“In this case, the landowners who have owned this property for many years and have a personal connection to the Long Trail itself, called us,” he said.
The 272-mile Long Trail follows the main ridge of the Green Mountains from the Massachusetts-Vermont line to the Canadian border. The 8,242-acre state forest includes conserved land in the towns of Jay, Montgomery, Richford and Westfield.

(Photo by Brycia James/Getty Images)Brigham City, a 20,000-people municipality an hour north of Salt Lake City, may become a pioneer in Utah’s efforts to become a nuclear force. And, if everything goes according to plan, the state’s first small modular reactor may start operations in the area in a little more than a decade.
That’s what executive director of the Utah Department of Natural Resources Joel Ferry hopes and plans for the city now that Hi Tech Solutions, a nuclear power and energy services company, and Holtec International, an energy equipment supplier, are setting up shop in town.
“My goal,” Ferry said, “is to have power flowing within 12 years from a nuclear power generation facility here in Box Elder County.”

To reach the partnership’s energy goals, the companies need to build multiple small modular reactors, said Chris Hayter, co-founder of Hi Tech Solutions — about four in northern Utah, plus others in different sites across the state and the West.
For a nuclear power plan project, that’s a tight timeline. The newest reactor in the country, Vogtle’s Unit 4 located in Waynesboro, Georgia, started commercial operations in 2024 after starting construction in 2009 with an initial 2017 deadline pushed back for seven years. Utah officials, however, say that times have changed, especially with the Trump administration’s efforts to streamline nuclear permitting. 
“Just because a permit to do a nuclear power plant takes 15 years doesn’t mean it’s any safer than one that other countries are doing in five,” Ferry said. But also, he added the state is committed to ensuring the process is done well to ensure safety.

But the vision officials from the city, state and the companies have for Brigham City extends beyond the potential of small modular reactors. It’s what Gov. Spencer Cox described as “a full-scale energy ecosystem” during an event announcing the partnership in Brigham City.
“This project aims to build a fleet of small modular reactors, but it will do so much more than that,” Cox said. “It creates a nuclear hub that manufactures the parts needed to operate and run advanced nuclear technologies like (small modular reactors), not just here, but all over the world, and a workforce training center that will bring stable, high-paying jobs to Brigham City.”

Not only would this project advance Cox’s ambitions to double the state’s energy production, but it would also help Utah secure a role as leader in nuclear power generation, he said
“This project’s manufacturing effort will unlock economies of scale that lower cost and make civil nuclear energy more affordable for communities across Utah and wherever this model is going to be adopted,” Cox said.
The Brigham City project will start with advanced manufacturing to build small modular reactors, which will be used in Utah and also deployed throughout the West, Ferry said. 
Hayter said he also hopes the plant manufacturing operations in the city will attract other industries, including defense manufacturing.

There will also be an effort to train people to work in the nuclear energy space, with a big emphasis on veteran recruiting, and a boost through the “catalyst center” expansion that the Utah Legislature approved this year to enhance technical education offers in the state.
The third phase of the project will be siting and development of the nuclear power generators in Box Elder County. 
Brigham City Mayor DJ Bott was enthusiastic about the city’s nuclear energy prospects during the announcement. 
“Why Brigham City? Heck, why not? Innovation is part of who Brigham City is,” he said on Monday.
Bott highlighted that the project will create high-paying jobs, and for some families, it could be transformative since “we won’t have to export our children and grandchildren to find good careers,” he said.
More details and project milestones will be announced in the coming months, and the process will be transparent to the public, the mayor said.

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)Charles Canady, the longest serving justice on the Florida Supreme Court, announced Monday that he’s resigning his position to take a job at the University of Florida.
The resignation ensures that six of the seven justices will have been appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has longed touted his remake of the state’s highest court. 
The resignation comes before Canady, 71, is forced to step down due to age restrictions and before his wife, Rep. Jennifer Canady, is expected to become Speaker of the House following the 2028 elections.

It also comes before DeSantis is term limited out of office and a new governor is elected.
Canady took office Sept. 8, 2008, after being appointed to the Supreme Court by Gov. Charlie Crist.
He remains on the court for now. “He has not submitted his resignation. He is still a member of the Court,” court spokesman Paul Flemming said by email.
Canady was one of two justices not appointed by DeSantis. The other is Jorge Labarga, who took office on Jan. 6, 2009, also after being appointed by Crist.
In a statement released Monday, Canady said he will always “deeply value” his time on the bench.
“But the time has come to move on to another position of public service. I am looking forward to beginning 2026 as the Director and a tenured professor at the Hamilton School for Classical and Civic Education at the University of Florida,” Canady said in a statement. 
“I’m very grateful to UF Board of Trustees Chairman Mori Hosseini and Interim President Don Landry for this opportunity. And I am eager to begin my work with the outstanding students and faculty at the Hamilton School.”

In addition to serving on the Supreme Court, Canady served in the Florida Legislature for six years, from November 1984 through November 1990. He served in Congress from 1993 through January 2001. Canady was one of the House managers appointed to prosecute the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton.
Canady is considered conservative but in a 2024 opinion agreed to green-light proposed Constitutional Amendment 4 to enshrine abortion access in the state. In a razor-thin 4-3 decision, Canady joined the majority finding that the proposed amendment would not in any way mislead voters, break the single-subject rule for initiatives, or violate the U.S. Constitution. “Accordingly, we approve the proposed amendment for placement on the ballot,” the opinion reads.
Likewise, Canady joined the majority in another 4-3 decision to allow proposed Constitutional Amendment 3 on the ballot, which would have authorized recreational use of cannabis for adults.
Canady’s resignation gives DeSantis another opportunity to name a Florida Supreme Court justice and to nail down the conservative leaning of the court.
DeSantis has appointed five of the seven Supreme Court justices: Chief Justice Carlos G. Muñiz, John Couriel, Jamie Grosshans, Renatha Francis, and Meredith Sasso.
He also appointed Supreme Court justice Robert Luck and Barbara Lagoa to the court in 2019 but they served on the bench for a handful of months before President Donald Trump appointed them to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

(Courtesy FWP)Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks is seeking information on four separate poaching cases across the state where game animals were shot and left to waste in the past weeks.
On Monday, agency officials reported a mule deer doe was shot and left to waste on state land southwest of Augusta.
Hunters found the doe during the weekend near Elk Creek Road and reported it to the local FWP warden, who determined it had been shot and killed where it was found.
“It’s clear that this deer was not shot by a legal hunter trying to lawfully fill their freezer,”FWP warden Per Wolfisberg said. “Instead, this is an intentional act of killing and wasting a game animal, and the person who committed this crime needs to be caught and held accountable.”
Last week, FWP officials in Region 1 announced a bighorn sheep ram was shot and left to waste near Highway 200 east of Thompson Falls.
The ram was party of a small, highly visible herd that residents and visitors to Thompson Falls have been watching throughout the season, FWP officials said in a press release. The ram was discovered on Nov. 10, and no meat or horns were taken from the animal.
Earlier this month, FWP put out additional press releases related to suspected poaching cases east of the Continental Divide.
On Nov. 11, a hunter spotted a dead elk on the Sun River Wildlife Management Area near Augusta. Wardens with FWP found a cow elk and two elk calves that had been shot and left to waste.
A special license is required to hunt antlerless elk on the Sun River WMA.
“These Sun River elk represent a unique and historical migratory elk herd in Montana,” FWP game warden Wolfisberg said. “Shooting and deliberately wasting three of them is disrespectful to not only the animals, but also to the citizens and hunters of Montana. We are asking anyone who may have seen or heard anything unusual in that area to contact us and help us catch the people who committed this crime.”
FWP wardens are also seeking information on a mule deer buck that was shot and left to waste in Black Eagle Park in Great Falls on Nov. 9. The investigation by wildlife officials determined the animal was likely shot in the upper part of the park near the pavilion, and ided on the lower level near the baseball fields.
“This incident is especially concerning because it occurred in a public park where families frequently gather,” said FWP game warden Mike Tucker. “We take these crimes seriously and are asking anyone who may have seen or heard anything unusual that evening to contact us.”
Poaching cases are most often resolved following tips from the public. Anyone with information about any poaching cases is encouraged to visit tipmont.mt.gov, or call their local game warden. Informants may remain anonymous and may be eligible for a reward of up to $1,000.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-10.jpg,,,2025-11-17 18:58:09.642628

(Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star) The commonwealth’s school districts might soon need to consider policies related to silent alarms and cell phone use in their buildings. 
The state House committees for education and health held a joint, two-hour hearing Monday for informational purposes, without considering any specific legislation. Lawmakers, however, didn’t appear to come to a consensus on either issue, instead stressing the need for parental involvement and parental rights. 
Nearly a dozen parents from around the state urged lawmakers to support a “bell to bell” cellphone prohibition, part of a 3,000-member coalition dubbed “PA Unplugged.” The group seeks to implement phone-free policies statewide.

“Bell to bell,” as used in the committee meeting, indicated a policy ban from the day’s first morning bell to the last one in the afternoon — without any exceptions for study halls or lunch.
“If kids are so worried about contacting their parents, they’re not necessarily focused on the adult in the room who’s been trained to give information about what’s coming next and what kids should do to stay safe,” Katie Talarico, a mom from Allegheny County, told the Capital-Star. “We definitely think, even in the most extreme emergency, it’s best not to have a cellphone.”
Talarico said having dozens or even hundreds of children calling their parents can tie up phone lines, impeding the work of law enforcement. Additionally, she said, “it’s not good for emotional development either.” 
“Kids need the opportunity to practice the skills of independence,” she said. “Sometimes I wish I could have contact with my kids and find out, ‘How did that test go?’ But at some point, we have to let kids learn to figure these things out on their own.”
House members who are parents, both Republican and Democratic, had a different take — with some evoking memories of the September 11th attacks and the relief a quick phone call from their children granted them. 
“Unfortunately, as a person who experienced 9/11 as a young person and also as a parent who’s watched numerous school shootings unfold across this country, the idea that I may never be able to hear my child’s voice for the last time in a situation like that is something that weighs heavily upon me,” said Rep. Danielle Friel Otten, D-Chester.
 On-the-ground impacts

Some of the teachers, administrators, researchers and security staff testifying before the committees detailed the negative consequences of cell phones in the classroom, including cyberbullying and orchestrating school fights for virality.
Beth Sanborn, the president of the Pennsylvania Association of School Resources Offices and a school safety coordinator in Montgomery County, said students even ordered food and allowed delivery drivers through secured doors with cellphones.

“Phone-free policies aren’t about punishment. They’re about protection,” said Sanborn. 
As for parental safety concerns, Sanborn emphasized that “there is not an emergency plan anywhere that includes student use of a cell phone” to notify parents and said a lack of contact doesn’t indicate that a child is unsafe.

Mitch Prinstein, the chief of psychology with the American Psychological Association, said data suggest high school students spend one-third of each hour on their devices which “likely” obstructed learning. 
“Not surprisingly, a child’s device in school leads to their poor academic achievement. But perhaps more surprisingly is that the child’s device use is also associated with poor academic achievement for the students sitting behind them,” said Prinstein. 
He also spoke about concerns with AI misuse by young adults, specifically applications geared toward wellness or therapy. He said that some parents had given their child a smartwatch or simply used their school email for contact throughout the day — though such communications could be subject to disclosure laws.










About 45% of youth report they experience so much digital stress that they’re unable to carry out their normal daily roles and routines.


– Dr. Mitch Prinstein, the chief of psychology with the American Psychological Association


Lisa Graham, a school counselor with the Seneca Valley School District in Butler County, said incidents of cyberbullying at her school had decreased following the implementation of a “bell to bell” cellphone ban at her school. 
“Because students aren’t filling their downtime with their phones, they’re developing social and communication skills,” said Graham. “They’re making new friends and this increased connection fosters a better sense of belonging at school and is benefiting their mental health.”
 Silent alarms and emergency responses

Another group of House members also considered a bill Monday that would compel districts to “consider” whether or not to invest in a silent alarm system that can notify l law enforcement in an emergency. 
Dubbed “Alyssa’s law,” House Bill 634 was inspired, in part, by the death of Alyssa Alhadeff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida in 2018. 
Silent alarms — including wearable versions or mobile apps — can be customized for different purposes, such as one push for behavioral assistance or multiple hits for an active shooter. 
“When seconds matter, immediate notification can and will save lives,” said David Lash, the president of the Pennsylvania Chiefs Association and Chief of Police for the Northern York County Regional Police Department. 
Alyssa’s Law, named for Parkland shooting victim, would push for panic alarms in school buildings

Two of the seven districts in his coverage area have such systems, but the “most sophisticated” was probably in Delaware County, Lash said. There, the Delaware County Panic Alarm School System (DelPASS) is incorporated throughout the county and integrates law enforcement agencies. 
Such systems aren’t replacements, Lash added, and he still encouraged calls to 911 to share more details. But “pushing a button in a classroom going directly to a 911 center is going to get officers rolling toward that scene.” 
An unknown number of districts have funded such alarms using school safety grants from the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency, said Heather Masshardt, the group’s deputy director of school safety and security. 
Masshardt said she couldn’t share specifics, “because of safety precautions and data safety requirements under Pennsylvania public school code.” Up to $127 million was available to public, charter and non-public schools, which can also be used for cybersecurity and other purchases. The latest budget increased those dollars by an additional $120 million. 
The grant’s current funding structure allows schools to fund silent alarms after meeting other security requirements, such as keeping exterior doors unpropped and closed or having a buzzer at public entrances.

A once-blighted area in the middle of West Rutland village center has been transformed into 24 permanently affordable housing units. 
A ribbon cutting for the new Marble Village Apartments on Monday brought out a cast of organizational partners, state and local political leaders and community members to celebrate.
Mary Cohen, executive director of Cornerstone Housing Partners, said the idea had been in the works for more than four years, but was time consuming because of funding requirements and an environmental cleanup through the state’s Brownfield Revitalization Fund. The remnants of burned down buildings on the site had been long buried under ground, contaminating the soil, Cohen said.

The dual housing developers — Cornerstone Housing Partners and Evernorth — broke ground on Marble Village in November 2024, Cohen said, and finalized the project a year later with the help of over $13 million worth of public and private investment.
Cornerstone Housing Partners and Evernorth have joined forces as co-owners and developers on a growing number of affordable housing projects in Rutland County. The developers broke ground on a similar 30-unit affordable housing project near Rutland City’s downtown in May.
Kathy Beyer, senior vice president of real estate development for Evernorth, said she recognized the environmental cleanup and location posed challenges but that the project’s completion is a testament to the work of housing nonprofit developments, private investment and state and local support. 
Cohen pointed to a “success” involving one of the apartments which will house a family previously living in the Bridge House — transitional housing in Rutland City for individuals experiencing homelessness. 
Seniors plan to move into the affordable apartment complex so that their housing situation is more “manageable and affordable,” Cohen said. That also “frees up” real estate, which helps mitigate the varied housing needs in the state. 
The Marble Village apartments are close to the West Rutland School, the post office, library, public transportation and other community resources in West Rutland. 
The housing project — with an electric heating and cooling system and solar panels on the roof — is projected to decrease its carbon impact by 71 tons per year, according to Beyer. The energy efficiency of the Marble Village apartments demonstrates the developers’ aim to mitigate both the state’s housing crisis and the impacts of climate change, she said. 
“This is a forever asset for the West Rutland community,” Beyer said.

Achieva Enterprises, the company that was hired by the state several years ago to operate and revitalize Honey Creek Resort, is suing the Iowa  Department of Administrative Services and Iowa Department of Natural Resources in Polk County District Court. The company is seeking unspecified damages for the “abrupt and unlawful termination” of its concessionaire agreement with the state.
According to the lawsuit, DAS recently terminated its contract with Achieva without notice and in direct violation of the contract’s terms. “DAS then took extreme and disruptive actions, including shutting down the resort, firing over 50 employees, evicting guests, confiscating personal property, and making public statements that damaged Achieva’s reputation and business relationships,” Achieva alleges in its lawsuit.

The DNR, as the legal owner of Honey Creek Resort, “actively participated in the termination and transition process,” the lawsuit claims, adding that the two state agencies’ actions have “caused irreparable damage to Achieva’s business, reputation, and property interests” and now “threatens the continued viability of Honey Creek Resort as a public asset.”
The Iowa attorney general’s office declined to comment on the allegations.
Delaware North bails out of project
The origins of Honey Creek Resort date back to the 1950s, when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers acquired extensive land holdings in Appanoose, Lucas, Wayne, and Monroe counties and began construction of a dam that created Rathbun Lake, a flood-control reservoir that was designed in part for recreational use.
In 2000, the Iowa Legislature and then-Gov. Tom Vilsack launched an initiative called “Destination State Parks,” which proposed the creation of a new resort at Honey Creek State Park on the shores of Rathbun Lake.
After an investment of $60 million that resulted in the creation of a 106-room lodge, 28 cabins, an indoor waterpark, an 18-hole golf course, and a marina, Honey Creek Resort opened to the public in 2008.
From the beginning, the resort struggled financially, and in 2013, the Iowa Legislature authorized a $33 million bailout to pay off the resort’s outstanding bonds.
In 2016, the DNR entered into a management contract with Delaware North Companies, a private hospitality firm. Under that agreement, Delaware North was to pay the state a portion of profits generated by the resort once annual revenue exceeded $7 million.
Over the next five years, annual revenues never reached the $7 million threshold, and in early 2022, Delaware North exercised an option in its contract to end its involvement in Honey Creek Resort.
Because the project sits on land leased from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, shutting down the resort was not considered an option since that move could force the state to dismantle the resort at additional public expense and then restore the land to its previous, natural condition.
Achieva takes over management
According to the lawsuit, Achieva’s owners, Beth and Terry Henderson, first became interested in Honey Creek Resort and its perceived untapped potential in 2019. The couple allegedly shared their ideas for revitalizing the resort at a meeting of PACT, or Promoting Appanoose & Centerville Together, that was attended by Gov. Kim Reynolds.
“The governor responded positively,” the lawsuit claims, “expressing that Achieva’s vision was exactly what the resort needed and aligned with her goals for revitalization. She asked the Hendersons if they would be interested in helping run the resort with plans to move toward privatization. She also expressed that the state did not belong in the resort business.”
Achieva was then selected by the state to run the resort. The lawsuit alleges that after Achieva “inherited a resort in disrepair — physically, financially, and reputationally,” it quickly began renovating cabins and the lodge, and adding attractions such as a miniature train and horse-drawn carriage rides.
According to the lawsuit, the resort generated significant sales tax revenue for Iowa and created 50 to 150 new jobs. “Profit margins were razor-thin — near zero — but Achieva believed in its business plan to transform Honey Creek,” the lawsuit alleges.
In late 2024, Achieva and DAS entered into a contractual amendment to provide the company with some temporary financial relief as the company worked to improve its operating margins. That amendment temporarily waived Achieva’s obligation to deposit 5% of its gross monthly receipts into a state-created fund, enabling Achieva to use that money for operating expenses such as audits and insurance premiums.
“DAS knew Achieva was successfully stabilizing and revitalizing Honey Creek Resort, because Achieva consistently submitted monthly and annual reports to DAS,” the lawsuit alleges. Despite this, DAS allegedly “micromanaged Achieva’s operations down to trivial details — such as paint color selections — while failing to provide meaningful support.”
The lawsuit also claims DAS repeatedly changed the state personnel who were assigned to the resort, and placed in key roles certain individuals who lacked the authority to act on proposals. “For example, DAS appointed Ryan West as project manager, yet he consistently informed Achieva that he had no authority to approve decisions, rendering meetings with him ineffective,” the lawsuit states.
Lawsuit alleges state-run smear campaign
In April 2025, following DAS’ failed attempt to give the resort to Appanoose County, DAS “abruptly ceased communication with Achieva,” the lawsuit alleges.
On Oct. 29, 2025, without warning, DAS sent a contract-termination letter to Achieva and then “took extreme and punitive actions” — shutting down the resort, barricading its entrances, and sending home “over 50 employees without notice, destroying livelihoods,” all while falsely claiming Achieva had abandoned the property, the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit claims that DAS then launched “a coordinated publicity and outreach campaign to smear Achieva,” issuing press releases and social media posts falsely portraying “Achieva as negligent and unfit” to run the resort.
“Contrary to DAS’ claims, Achieva never abandoned operations,” the lawsuit claims. “In fact, it had reservations booked and food purchased for an upcoming banquet on Halloween weekend as well as a Thanksgiving banquet. It never sent staff home, never closed the resort, nor took any other steps to suspend, terminate, or abandon its business.”
According to the lawsuit, it was state officials who evicted guests mid-stay, “causing humiliation and chaos,” and who handed out Terry and Beth Henderson’s personal cell phone numbers to angry guests.
On Nov. 3, 2025, DAS allegedly issued a notice to Achieva demanding that within seven days the company transfer 5% of its gross monthly receipts for the period from November 2023 through December 2024 to the state.
The lawsuit alleges breach of contract and seeks a judgment declaring that various items Achieva purchased with its own funds — buildings, equipment, vehicles, and taxidermy — should remain with Achieva.
On Monday, a Polk County judge approved portions of Achieva’s request for an immediate temporary injunction in the case. The injunction bars the state and its agents from either reopening the Honey Creek Resort to the public or hiring a new third-party operator to manage the resort while the lawsuit moves forward in court.
The injunction also blocks the state from making any further improvements or alterations to the site beyond routine maintenance, sanitation and security, while the case is pending.

Several business owners have sworn off Montpelier in recent months. Others are doubling down.

MONTPELIER — The former home of Bent Nails Bistro was a riot of color, with eclectic sculptures of metal people and animals tucked into every corner. What visitors to the bar and restaurant may not have noticed was a silver line running through the counter. 
That’s where floodwaters crested during the July 2023 floods in Montpelier, said co-owner and the creator of the sculptures, Aaron Ingham. 
“That’s going to happen again,” he said. Two years later, little has changed to mitigate the flood risk for the building. 
But Bent Nails Bistro is getting out of town. In October, the bar announced it would be moving from its location on Langdon Street to a new location across from Camp Meade in Middlesex. Ingham said they planned to change its name to Bent Nails Roadhouse.
Flooding was not the only factor in the decision. Ingham said their business was stymied by what they say is bureaucratic red tape and a surprising lack of foot traffic for Vermont’s capital. 
“There are great people, but they’re not making the decisions,” he said. “It’s a precarious place to be a business.”
Ingham is not the only business owner that has left Montpelier in recent months. Two others have announced plans to leave the city — one bound for Middlesex near the new Bent Nails Roadhouse location. Yet at the same time, other businesses have doubled down on their presence, joining the city for the first time or expanding their operation.  
So why do business owners have such different impressions of how Montpelier is faring? The ones VTDigger spoke with described making personalized calculations based on a variety of factors: customer base, flood risk, foot traffic, tariff impacts, real estate and the expected back-to-office mandate for state employees. 
Penzo Pizza, once located at the Inn at Montpelier on Main Street, recently announced its plans to move to Maple Street in Essex Junction. Woodbelly Pizza on Barre Street has moved most of its operation to Camp Meade in Middlesex. It arrives just as Red Hen Baking, also at Camp Meade, plans for a move to a larger space just down the road from its current location. 
There has also been a loss in nearby Barre: Foxy’s, a bar and cafe that catered to the LGBTQ+ community, closed for good in September. The owners’ other business, Fox Market and Bar, remains open in East Montpelier. 
On the other hand, Woodbury Mountain Toys is not just sticking around Montpelier — it’s opening a second location. Karen Williams said the toy store is going to be open in two different spots this holiday season: The spot at the post-flooding location next to Capitol Grounds on State Street, and the recently reopened pre-flooding location just across the street.

There are newcomers to Montpelier, too. The Black Kitty, a clothing boutique, opened on State Street two months ago. Chico’s Tacos has also moved to State Street from its former spot in Middlesex — the same building that Bent Nails Roadhouse is now moving into.
For Andrew Lay, owner of Chico’s Tacos, the decision to come to Montpelier was obvious. Since the move to the former Filibuster’s location, sales have gone up 65% while his rent has gone down. 
He said he heard concerns the place would be “just another Mexican restaurant” in Montpelier, like Julio’s or Mad Taco. But his offerings are more inspired, he said, thanks to his upbringing in California. “We’re each doing our own style,” he said.
The Black Kitty had very different reasons to choose Montpelier. Co-owner Anaya Soliman has been selling fashion finds through social media for years, drawing on her talent for finding rare, vintage and designer deals. But after moving to Vermont to be closer to family, she and her husband longed to make their online business into a space to grow an in-person community.

The duo hopes to find a balance between their online sales and their brick-and-mortar shop. Soliman noted that foot traffic could be a challenge in such a small city. 
“Other cool shops have struggled in town,” she said. “There are a lot of empty spaces.”
Her shop is also in one of the buildings hit by flooding in 2023. Soliman is banking on the small size of the space to lighten the load of evacuating their products. 
“We have plans for our family to drop everything and help us move the clothes to pre-set bins if need be,” she said. 
Williams is well aware that the former, and now soon-to-be, home of the toy store is still a flood risk. But she owns the space outright, and she’s invested so much into it already that she’s willing to take that risk. She’s seen a lot of ups and down in her 25 years as a business. 

“The last time it affected us before 2023 was 1992,” she said. “Hopefully it won’t happen as bad next time.” 
Right now, her biggest concerns are tariffs and health insurance costs eating away at her margins. She said she hopes Vermonters will be more open to shopping locally this holiday season. 
“I enjoy what I do and what I sell,” she said. “I try to bring people joy with my store.”
She also is planning for the potential return of state workers due to Gov. Phil Scott’s return-to-office mandate. She’s adamant that she believes state workers should not have to come to Montpelier, but when they did work in the city, she said she used to see a lot more people walking around. 
“We haven’t had a problem with parking in years — and that’s great for everyone but me,” she joked. 
Ingham, the co-owner of Bent Nails Roadhouse, said the problem with finding customers went well beyond state employees. The former location offered lots of live music and entertainment, but not many people are going out to see live music anymore, he said. In fact, he feels that Vermonters are not seeing each other in person enough overall. 
The roadhouse is set to have an indoor and outdoor stage, but Ingham said the bar plans to offer fewer music events and focus more on good dining options and attracting skiers with “firepit Fridays.” He said he is also working on creating even more art for their larger outdoor space. 
Still, he sees the potential for a comeback of people craving more human interaction and live experiences. 
“I hope there’ll be some social, communal shift and people will come out and see live music again on a regular basis,” he said. “We’ll just wait until it comes back again to add it to the calendar.”

(Photo via Palmyra Fire Rescue Facebook page)The Village of Palmyra in southeastern Wisconsin announced Friday that the village board and police department have decided not to move forward with a controversial agreement with U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE). 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“We deeply value the feedback we have received from our community — on all sides of the discussion,” Village Board President Tim Gorsegner and Interim Police Chief Paul Blount said in a statement on the village’s website. 
“After careful consideration of those voices, along with additional research and review, we believe that at this time, the best course forward for Palmyra is to take no further action on the proposed agreement,” the village officials said. 
Blount previously said that the department’s application to ICE’s task force model was pending review by the village board. 
ICE’s task force model allows officers to “enforce limited immigration authority while performing routine police duties, such as identifying an alien at a DUI checkpoint and sharing information directly with ICE,” and it lays out when officers can make immigration arrests. Officers may also exercise limited authority on ICE-led task forces.  
In September, Blount said Palmyra police would work with ICE when someone was involved in criminal activity, wanted on a warrant or facing criminal charges. He said they would not go door to door to check peoples’ documentation or profile people who they think may lack documentation.
The immigrant rights organization Voces de la Frontera celebrated Palmyra’s decision not to work with ICE. Executive Director Christine Neumann-Ortiz said in a statement, “when we push back together, we stop policies that harm immigrant families and undermine public safety.” 
The village’s statement said the original intent in exploring the agreement was to collaborate with federal law enforcement partners in ways that could strengthen their ability to reduce crime and keep Palmyra safe. The village said it also sought to prevent human trafficking and narcotics trafficking. 
Blount said in September that the program would allow for access to databases and resources that enhance investigations and help combat serious crimes such as narcotics trafficking and human trafficking. He also said the program would come with significant financial incentives from the federal government. 
On Monday afternoon, ICE removed Palmyra from a list of departments with which it cooperates on its website.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-11-17 23:02:38+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,NJ lawmakers hear pleas to save public broadcasting,Dana DiFilippo,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/17/nj-lawmakers-hear-pleas-to-save-public-broadcasting/,"With NJ PBS set to close, media and business leaders urged lawmakers to find funding and protect NJ's only public broadcast station.","Journalists walk out of the New Jersey Statehouse on Nov. 5, 2025, after Gov. Phil Murphy held a post-election news conference. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)With NJ PBS set to end operations in July after it lost state and federal funding, media and business leaders met in Trenton Monday to urge legislators to quickly find funding and ensure New Jersey does not lose its only public broadcast station.
The Senate’s legislative oversight committee heard 90 minutes of pleas from people who warned that losing public news and arts programming would lead to a less-informed citizenry and hurt families who can’t afford to pay for cable TV or streaming services. Corruption, political polarization, and misinformation threaten to flourish as the shrinking media industry loses another trusted outlet, they said.
“This is not an option for you to debate. It’s an obligation that you need to fulfill,” said Tom Bracken, president and CEO of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce and a former NJ PBS board member.
Mike Rispoli is the senior director of journalism and civic information at Free Press Action, a national, nonpartisan nonprofit that advocates for press freedom, civic engagement, and expanded funding for public funding. Funding cuts and the decades-long decline of newspapers have created a media environment “where good information is hard to find and people’s news feeds are increasingly filled with hate, clickbait and misinformation,” he told lawmakers.
“The end result is not just the thousands of journalism jobs that have been lost or the dozens of newsrooms that have been closed. It is the countless communities that are left in the dark and don’t know what’s going on in their schools, whether their water is safe to drink, where their tax dollars are going, which local businesses are opening or closing, and how to coordinate with their neighbors to solve problems,” Rispoli said.
Monday’s hearing came nearly five months after legislators passed a $58.8 billion budget that cut NJ PBS’ state allocation from $1 million to $250,000. NJ PBS also lost more than $1.5 million in funding last summer from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting after Republicans in Congress rescinded more than $1 billion in funding federal lawmakers already had approved for the current and next fiscal years.
NJ PBS announced in September it would close by the end of June 2026 because its parent company, the New Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority, and WNET, the New York-based public TV station that operates NJ PBS, couldn’t agree on a contract.
The state’s funding cuts were the elephant in the room during Monday’s hearing, with most speakers tap-dancing to avoid casting too much blame at state legislators for NJ PBS’ plight. The committee’s five members and two more legislators who showed up to testify all voiced support for saving public broadcasting, but five — all Democrat — had voted for the NJ PBS cut (by voting for the budget broadly).
Bracken reminded legislators that the state had squandered past opportunities to protect public broadcasting in New Jersey, including in 2017 when the state sold the licenses of two public broadcasting stations for $332 million — but then used most of the money to cover budget deficits rather than rebuild local news.
“If you’d treated it like a foundation and used 5% a year, we would have been having some $16.5 million all these years to fund public media,” Bracken said.
“Hindsight is always great,” Sen. John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester) responded. “They were hard times. I mean, we had no money. So the fact that that got absorbed — now, should it have been replenished as you rebuilt the surplus? That’s a discussion for another day.”
Media leaders from Montclair State University and Rowan University offered their facilities, staff and students to ensure public broadcasting continues past June. Advocates and lawmakers alike agreed a new model of public broadcasting should have both a permanent source of funding and opportunities for philanthropy. Bracken told lawmakers he also would press the state’s big businesses to step up financially, and that several major corporations already have pledged to support the effort.
In 2018, the state did act to protect local news by creating the New Jersey Civic Information Consortium, a nonprofit that has gotten $16 million in state funding since 2019 to erase news deserts statewide and fund news outlets, according to Chris Daggett, a consortium consultant.
Assemblyman Louis Greenwald (D-Camden), a key supporter in 2017 for the consortium’s creation, testified Monday that public media is a needed antidote to the non-traditional news sources that “reward outrage and echo chambers.”
“The health of our democracy depends on the strength of our local news,” he told his legislative colleagues.
He added: “We cannot rely on New York and Philadelphia media markets to tell New Jersey’s story.”
Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex), the committee’s chair, said lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are committed to figuring out the finances and a governance structure to save public broadcasting.
“We all know we have a difficult budget in front of us,” Zwicker said.
Greenwald responded: “Budgets are always difficult. Budgets are a reflection of our priorities.”

A pile of sandbags sits on a sidewalk in Ruidoso after post-fire flooding wreaked havoc in 2025.

Some lawmakers believe the way the governor is paying for emergency response is illegal. (Photo courtesy DHSEM)Wildfires, floods and National Guard deployments over the last several years have depleted a key disaster fund in New Mexico. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has, nonetheless, used emergency declarations and state funds to cover emergency costs in a way that some lawmakers say violates the separation of powers between the branches of government.
The governor can spend at her discretion out of a fund called the Appropriation Contingency Fund, into which the Legislature allocates money each year for disasters.
That fund, however, has repeatedly run out of money, including as recently as Oct. 1, when Lujan Grisham ordered the immediate allocation of $30 million for 10 days’ worth of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funding that the federal government refused to provide during the federal government shutdown.
New Mexico will supply $30M in emergency funding for food assistance

In total, the governor has spent roughly $380 million via emergency orders since July 1, 2024, even though the Legislature put just $150 million into the fund in that period, according to lawmakers and records the Legislative Finance Committee provided recently to Source New Mexico.
She did that by pulling money from the state’s Operating Reserve, which her office and lawmakers likened to the state’s “savings account.” She also did so without specific approval from the Legislature, New Mexico senators said during the special legislative session held Nov. 10.
The topic arose because in addition to approving  $162.5 million in SNAP funding for the remainder of the year, lawmakers also replenished the Appropriation Contingency Fund with an additional $30 million that the state spent on SNAP for early November. That sparked a conversation during a Senate Finance Committee hearing about whether the governor was overstepping. 
“Where did the governor…get the authority to transfer money around in the budget?” Sen. Craig Brandt (R-Rio Rancho) asked Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup), the chair of the Senate Finance Committee. 
“She was not given the authority,” Muñoz responded. “We don’t think it’s legal, but we don’t know. We’d have to test that in court.”
Charles Sallee, director of the Legislative Finance Committee, also weighed in to agree the governor has no legal basis to spend funds outside of the Appropriation Contingency Fund. He said the Legislature needs to update its decades-old disaster spending laws, including to make the separation of powers clearer. 
A September report from the LFC said an unexpected increase of disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic, wildfires and flooding, “exposed a system with unclear language” based on statutes that largely haven’t been updated in 70 years. As a result, the executive branch has “interpreted authority very broadly” and used executive orders to pay operating costs of state agencies, for future spending, or in cases where only the “potential for an emergency disaster exists,” according to the LFC.
National Guard to be deployed to Española, second NM city to see military presence

Source reviewed more than 1,000 emergency orders Lujan Grisham has issued since 2018. Under state law, the governor can only approve up to $750,000 at a time, meaning she often issues batches of several dozen emergency orders at once. To pay for early November SNAP benefits, for example, she issued 40 orders. 
The vast majority of the emergency orders Source reviewed deal with fire, floods or both. But the list also contained orders addressing crime, broken water wells, substance abuse, gun violence and more. The governor has also paid for National Guard deployments to Albuquerque and Española—a controversial measure aimed at addressing crime and drug crises in those areas—via nine emergency orders totaling $6.75 million. 
Michael Coleman, the governor’s communications director, told Source that the governor is “operating under the laws that define executive order powers” and noted that her predecessors funded disaster responses in similar ways. 
“She’s determined to help New Mexico communities get back on their feet when disaster strikes, even if it means spending state money set aside for emergencies,” he said.
Coleman also noted that the state believes the federal government will reimburse the state for a “sizable amount” of recent spending. For federally declared disasters, the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Public Assistance program reimburses most or all of the spending the state and other agencies take on to respond quickly. 
“The governor understands lawmakers’ concerns about emergency spending and she is doing everything possible to secure FEMA reimbursement that will reduce the burden on the state,” he said. 
Still, Republicans said they intend to introduce legislation on the issue at the upcoming legislative session. Sen. Steve Lanier (R-Farmington), who is also running for governor, told Source in a phone interview that they are still evaluating proposals that retain the Legislature’s oversight on spending without getting in the governor’s way when she responds.
“We don’t want to handcuff the governor,” he said. “We just want a little bit of oversight.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Sandbags-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-17 17:57:10.290193

(Zoom recording screenshot)Only 38% of pre-applicants for a cannabis retail license reserved for those adversely affected by the war on drugs have qualified to submit a formal application, the Cannabis Control Commission announced Friday afternoon.
Of 94 requests to be considered for a social equity license, 36 met eligibility criteria after being screened. They were certified by the commission in a 2-0 vote Friday and now have until Dec 29 to submit their applications to go into a lottery. The commission will award six social equity licenses through that lottery.
The vote was the first taken since the departure of Chairperson Kimberly Ahern, who stepped down from her $204,069-a-year post on Oct. 21 to make a run for state attorney general in 2026.
Ahern’s usual seat between commissioners Layi Oduyingbo and Robert Jacquard sat empty as the two remaining members conducted business. In addition to voting to certify social equity applicants who passed the eligibility screening, the board formally adopted hemp regulations previously handled by another agency.
Oduyingbo and Jacquard both thanked Ahern for doing the yeoman’s work in getting them through the past two-and-a-half years worth of meetings, which included the establishment of the rules governing Rhode Island’s recreational pot industry.
Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for Gov. McKee’s office, on Monday said the governor’s team is still working on identifying a nominee to replace Ahern. That nominee would require Senate approval and is expected to be presented early in the next legislative session, DaRocha said.
“In the meantime, the commission continues its work,” DaRocha wrote in an email to Rhode Island Current.
Social equity pre-applicant screenings were conducted by Massachusetts-based Creative Services, Inc.
To be certified and continue in the application process, social equity applicants must meet one of five criteria:

51% ownership and control by one or more people who have resided for at least five of the preceding 10 years in a disproportionately impacted area.
51% ownership and control by one or more individuals who either have been arrested/incarcerated for drug offenses that have since been decriminalized or have had a family member impacted by the war on drugs. 
A minimum of 10 full-time employees with at least 51% of current employees residing in a disproportionately impacted area or were arrested/convicted for marijuana charges.
The ability to demonstrate significant past experience in, or business practices that promote, economic empowerment in disproportionally impacted areas.
Income not exceeding 400% of the median income, as defined by the commission, in a disproportionally impacted area for at least five of the past 10 years.

Disproportionately impacted areas were determined under state regulations by federal poverty level, unemployment rate, the number of students in a free school lunch program, and historic arrest rates by census tract. This applied to tracts in five Rhode Island municipalities: Central Falls, Newport, Pawtucket, Providence, and Woonsocket.
Those who didn’t meet the criteria can still apply for a standard license. Applications for all license types are due by Dec. 29.
Under the 2022 act that legalized recreational cannabis, the commission can offer 24 new licenses to retailers, with six reserved for social equity applicants and another six reserved for worker-owned cooperatives. All recreational licenses will be spread throughout six geographic zones, with a maximum of four stores per zone.
Starting Jan. 1, 2026, the state’s Cannabis Office will have 90 days to review applications and verify that each meets eligibility qualifications before being placed in a lottery. The timeline established during the commission’s Oct. 20 meeting builds in at least 60 days to allow applicants to secure approvals at the local level in order to qualify for random selection.
Regulators expect to start awarding licenses as soon as May 2026.

What’s going on with hemp?
Commissioners also voted to formally adopt regulations for hemp products manufactured and sold in Rhode Island. The rules had been accepted under an emergency order in July, after the commission assumed hemp oversight from the Department of Business Regulation ahead of its transfer to the new Cannabis Office.
Carla Aveledo, policy liaison for the commission, told the panel that rules were mostly unchanged. Regulations still require product testing, labeling in a way that does not appeal to minors, and restricting sales to people age 21 or older.
All products can contain up to 1 milligrams of total THC — the psychoactive component of the cannabis plant — per serving, or 5 milligrams of total THC per package. That’s somewhat at odds with the new rules passed by the federal government meant to tighten loopholes that have allowed for the proliferation of psychoactive hemp products such as beverages and edibles.
“Staff is going to continue to monitor federal legislation and any changes to ensure that the Rhode Island hemp laws are in line with any federal requirements,” Aveledo said.
Rhode Island has allowed intoxicating hemp drinks since August 2024. The policy has split the cannabis industry, which mostly opposes the products, and the liquor industry, which backs them but wants exclusive control over where they’re sold.
The divide caused the General Assembly to request that the Cannabis Control Commission conduct a study of dosage limits, packaging standards, labeling requirements, licensing conditions, and other ways to ensure children don’t accidentally consume the intoxicating drinks.
The commission’s recommendations are due to state lawmakers by March 1, 2026. The commission plans to hold listening sessions early next year as it shapes its study, Charon Rose, spokesperson for the commission, said Monday.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota is conducting its seventh investigation into a state prison inmate death since February.
Timothy Tyree, 46, was found unresponsive Monday in his bed at the Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield, according to the state Department of Corrections. He was transported to a hospital, where he died.
The department said its inspector general and the state Division of Criminal Investigation are investigating.
State Attorney General Marty Jackley, who oversees the DCI, described the death as a suspected drug overdose and said an autopsy has been ordered. Among the seven prison death investigations since February, two cases have so far resulted in criminal charges for people who allegedly supplied drugs. Those cases are scheduled for trial in January.
“These suspected drug overdose deaths are becoming too common within our prison system,” Jackley said in a news release. “The DCI and Department of Corrections Office of the Inspector General will do a thorough investigation of this death. If criminal charges are warranted, we will announce them at the proper time.”

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA —The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is expected to cut $145 million from Kansas’ coffers beginning next year, state officials said.
That’s on top of an impending state budget hole that has shrunk since the Kansas Legislature passed its budget this spring, but still threatens to put the state in the red.
Budget analysts released Friday consensus revenue estimates, predicting state general fund revenues, which can be used to inform the budget-crafting process.
All told, the estimates included modest forecast changes in the economy and state revenues, said Shirley Morrow, director of the Kansas Legislative Research Department, at a press conference in the Statehouse in Topeka.
Revenue in fiscal year 2025, which ended in June, exceeded analysts’ estimates by $130 million, and revenue in the first four months of fiscal year 2026 has exceeded previous predictions by about $100 million, she said.
“The most noteworthy change is the full incorporation of the impacts of the federal tax legislation that was passed over the summer,” Morrow said.
However, she added, most of the legislation’s provisions were continuations of previous policies and will result in small changes to state receipts.
As the state incorporates federal tax law, Kansans will not automatically see deductions for tips and overtime, said Adam Proffitt, state budget director and secretary of the Kansas Department of Administration.
Of the roughly $145 million effect in fiscal year 2027, which begins in July, Proffitt listed the largest costs: $85 million for full expensing of certain business property, $32 million for full expensing of domestic research and development, $7 million for increased limitations on property depreciations and about $6.5 million for enhanced child care tax credits for individuals.
The state also has to account for its own tax changes, including cuts to corporate income taxes and property taxes as a result of 2025 legislation. One law eliminated the statewide levy of 1.5 mills for the state education building fund and the state institution building fund. The state now has to cover that missing property tax revenue.
Beyond 2027, the state’s ending balance is projected to tank.
The state ended fiscal year 2025 with $2.9 billion. By 2030, it will drop below $1.2 billion.
“The ending balance is going down because the receipts are below expenditures to the tune of $367 million in fiscal ‘27, $302 million in fiscal ‘28, so on and so forth,” said Proffitt.
Before the Legislature’s most recent budget, the numbers were closer to $700 million of overspending, he said. The decrease is largely because of a roughly $160 million drop in education costs, stemming from 10,000 fewer students in Kansas’ public school system than the previous headcount. Over five years, that drop means sizable savings, Proffitt said.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, said in a news release that cutting waste, fraud and abuse from state spending will be a top priority in 2026, as affordability is top of mind. He vowed to manage tax dollars with discipline.
“When the state spends like a drunken sailor, rubber-stamping everything on the governor’s pricey big-government wish list, there’s no way to stay on a responsible fiscal path,” he said. “And in the end, Kansas taxpayers are the ones left holding the bill.”
The Legislature crafted the provisions of the most recent budget, declining to use Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s proposals as a starting point.
“To the extent anyone reads the speaker’s press releases, I doubt they believe he is focused on how to budget responsibly,” said Will Lawrence, the governor’s chief of staff.
In the upcoming election year, he said the Legislature should “resist their natural instinct to fund pet projects for their special interest friends.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Proffitt-Kelly-1-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-17 17:57:10.290193
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-17 22:40:47+00:00,CT Mirror,DMV commissioner proposes simplifying sale process of towed cars,Dave Altimari and Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/17/ct-dmv-towing-sales-process/,"Tony Guerrera called his proposal a compromise between tow companies and advocates, but they say it wouldn’t protect vehicle owners enough.","The head of the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles on Monday proposed the state simplify its system for allowing towing companies to sell vehicles, a move consumer advocates say ultimately wouldn’t do enough to protect vehicle owners.
Commissioner Tony Guerrera opened the third meeting of a towing reform working group by proposing what he called a compromise between towing companies and consumer advocates. Under his new system, companies wouldn’t assign values to the vehicles they tow and sell like they do now. Further, the sales process would begin for all vehicles after 30 days and private auctions would be prohibited. 
Under current law, towing companies can begin the sales process for vehicles worth $1,500 or less after 15 days, then sell them in private auctions. For more valuable vehicles, the process begins after 45 days and the vehicles must be sold at public auction.
The 10-member working group, which Guerrera leads, was formed under a 2025 law that overhauled much of the state’s towing regulations and went into effect Oct. 1.  Guerrera’s proposal would make significant changes to that law. 
“I know everybody’s in a predicament,” Guerrera said. “The towers are there to provide a service, and they get compensated for that service. But at the same time, we need to be fair to the consumers and offer them every chance to get their car back.”
Guerrera said that if the vehicle isn’t purchased at public auction, the towing company should offer owners one more chance to get their cars back before selling them to a junkyard.
Attorney Raphael Podolsky, a consumer advocate on the committee, argued Guerrera’s proposal is “codifying aspects of the system that produced the problem that we’re trying to fix.”
The legislature overhauled the state’s century-old towing laws during the 2025 session following reporting from The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica that found Connecticut allows tow truck companies to start the sales process in 15 days on cars valued under $1,500 — one of the shortest windows in the country. The stories showed how this and other laws favored towing companies at the expense of low-income residents.
At the October meeting of the working group, tow company owners clashed with consumer advocates. Owners argued they need to recoup the costs of towing and storing vehicles, while consumer advocates want to maximize the chances that people who want their vehicles back can retrieve them. 
Guerrera’s compromise proposal aligns more closely with what tow companies have previously proposed, including the elimination of vehicle valuation. 
Reporters with CT Mirror and ProPublica analyzed two years worth of forms submitted by tow companies and found that about 60 percent of the forms were submitted after the shorter, 15-day period. The news outlets also revealed that tow companies routinely undervalue vehicles compared to Kelley Blue Book values and that DMV’s oversight of the process is lacking.
Towers worried the proposal would  add administrative fees to process cars that they say aren’t worth much. Consumer advocates questioned how people would learn about auctions if they are already having a hard time finding out who towed their cars.   
“The cost and expenses now that we’re adding on to accommodate people that don’t pick up their car, is what the issue is,” said Sal Sena, owner of Sena Brothers and Cross Country Towing. Sena’s companies  towed more vehicles than other company in 2022-2023, records show.
Sena said there are more than $250 worth of expenses, such as sending out certified letters, associated with each car worth $400 to $500. 
 “We’re jumping through hoops because, again, we’re taking the liability of everybody else, because they’re not taking any of their own liability,” Sena said.
Committee member Attorney Eric Foster, who handles repossession and bankruptcy cases, called the public auctions “a bit of a charade because no one shows up.”
“We’re trying to come up with a mechanism that is efficient for the scrap cars, but is fair for those cars that are above that,” Foster said.
Podoksky also called out the auction process, which he said rarely produces bids and doesn’t generate fair value for some vehicles. 
Under the current law, once a vehicle is sold, the towing company is supposed to subtract their fees and then hold the extra funds in escrow for a year. If the owner of the car doesn’t claim it, the money is supposed to revert to the state.
CT Mirror and ProPublica reporters found that the DMV has failed to monitor whether that was happening. Lawmakers charged the working group with studying this process but so far it hasn’t been discussed much. 
“One of the issues that led to the bill was that there shouldn’t always be a zero surplus, but we’re now proposing to set up a system where there will almost be guaranteed to be a zero surplus,” Podolsky said.
State law mandates that the working group present recommendations to lawmakers by Feb. 1. Guerrera cautioned that the group might not like what happens if they don’t present a united report.
“If we’re not coming up with anything and then going back to the legislature, it just seems like we’re just throwing it back to them to come up with a decision that you guys might not like,” Guerrera said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1027_SR_TaskForceMeeting2_079-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-17 17:57:10.290193

(Photo by Tyler Kaufman/Getty Images)LSU has paid more than $43 million to buy out the contracts of its coaches and athletics department leaders over the past decade and soon might be on the hook for more than $53 million more. 
Former football coach Brian Kelly is suing LSU to get his full buyout of nearly $54 million, which would be among the largest ever given to any college coach. Kelly’s 10-year, $100 million contract guaranteed him 90% of his remaining salary if LSU fired him without cause, which they did just four years into the deal. 
That price tag was a big factor in former LSU Athletics Director Scott Woodward subsequently losing his job. Gov. Jeff Landry, who also played a role in Kelly’s firing, publicly blasted Woodward for the coach’s contract. 
Significant concern has been voiced recently at LSU over growing buyouts for college coaches. 
At a September meeting of the LSU Board of Supervisors, Vice Chairman Lee Mallett, a Landry appointee and major campaign donor, brought up the financial impact to the university of buying out poorly performing coaches. It cost $17 million for the university to part ways with Ed Orgeron in the middle of the 2021 season. Mallet argued LSU should be the first to break the mold and drop the buyouts. 
Kelly’s buyout is a significant escalation in buyout spending. 
The Louisiana Illuminator and Tiger Rag filed a public records request with LSU for information on how much the university has spent on athletics buyout payments. The documents provided show LSU paid more than $43 million to sever ties with two head football coaches, one athletics director, one head swimming and diving coach and 32 assistant coaches from various sports from fiscal year 2015-16 to present. That sum is more than $10 million less than what the university owes Kelly. See the full buyout data below. 
It’s a common misconception among fans that buyouts are paid by the Tiger Athletic Foundation, a private organization that raises money for LSU athletics. The university’s athletics department made all of the buyout payments, spokesman Zach Greenwell said. 
Greenwell was unable to provide specific details about the extent private funds, if any, were used in the buyouts. 
“There’s no direct line between private donations and the buyouts,” Greenwell said in an emailed statement. “They are all paid directly by LSU Athletics, and obviously self-generated funds and associated private funds are encompassed in athletics’ budget.” 
While not tax dollars, the athletics department’s budget, primarily fueled with self-generated revenue, is still considered public money. All public universities in Louisiana are primarily funded with self-generated funds, such as tuition and fee revenue. The spending of that revenue requires legislative approval. Of the LSU System’s $1.2 billion budget for the current fiscal year, more than $800 million comes from self-generated revenue.  

Annual spending on athletics buyouts ranged from just over $28,000 in 2015-16 to more than $10 million in 2021-22, when LSU paid the bulk of former head football coach Ed Orgeron’s exit incentive after he was fired midway through the 2021 season for poor performance. 
Too many losses on the field are typically not considered a valid reason for a school to waive the buyout clause of a coach’s contract. 
Another $4.47 million was paid to former head football coach Les Miles, who was fired in 2016. LSU previously announced the coach had agreed to settle for a lump sum of $1.5 million instead of the full $6.5 million he was owed.  
While the bulk of LSU’s buyouts went to football coaches, just under $1.5 million went to coaches or assistants in other sports and former athletics director Joe Alleva. 
Alleva received payments totalling $840,000 spread over four years following his departure, after which he was appointed to a position advising then LSU President F. King Alexander. Though his departure was framed as a resignation, his contract did not guarantee any form of buyout unless he was fired without cause. 
Former men’s basketball assistants Randy Livingston, Robert Kirby and Lauren Green collectively received buyout payments totalling more than $401,000 during the ten-year period. Former women’s basketball assistant Anthony Perotti received around $28,000. 
Former swimming and diving head coach Dave Geyer received payments from 2021-23 totalling $203,500.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Brian-Kelly-Texas-AM-loss.jpg,,,2025-11-17 17:57:10.290193

State Chamber officials on Monday unveiled their latest education-focused campaign, called “Oklahoma Competes,” during a State of Business Forum. Along with supporting retention of struggling students, chamber leaders said they will urge Oklahoma lawmakers to dedicate more funding to reading coaches and other literacy initiatives.
“We’ve got to resource it right,” Rick Nagel, who leads the chamber’s executive committee, told news reporters Monday. “We’re going to have to invest some money. We can’t save our way out of this one. We’re going to have to invest in fixing this problem and be committed to it.”

The chamber, a major voice in the state’s public policy pursuits, joins a growing chorus calling for improvements to early literacy in Oklahoma, where only 27% of third graders scored proficient or advanced on the state reading test last school year.
Better reading outcomes are foundational for Oklahoma’s future workforce and the state’s ability to compete for business investment, chamber leaders said.
Third grade is widely considered a milestone year in literacy education because from fourth grade onward, a child must have mastery of basic reading skills to succeed in other school subjects, a concept known as “reading to learn.”
Oklahoma law previously required children to repeat third grade if they scored poorly on the state reading test starting in the 2013-14 school year. The state Legislature, though, added exemptions to the rule in subsequent years and ultimately did away with the requirement altogether with the Strong Readers Act in 2024.
State Chamber President and CEO Chad Warmington pointed to 2016 as a pivotal year in which Oklahoma started to shift away from tough reading regulations while Mississippi, now in the top 10 in the country for fourth-grade reading performance, continued them.
“I think the key is we were there in 2013 and 2016,” Warmington said after the chamber forum. “They stayed the course, and we didn’t. So if we go back to the structure that we had with all the new advances we have from digital learning, distance learning, broadband, AI, we can get our students to accelerate really quickly.”
Rewriting of reading laws weren’t Oklahoma’s only major changes for education in that window of time, though. Oklahoma eliminated Common Core education standards in 2014 and started developing its own academic standards, which dictate what public schools must teach in each subject.
In 2016, the state experienced a general revenue failure that resulted in cuts to school funding. The state Legislature has increased public school funding by $1.5 billion since then, with a significant amount added in the past three years, but Oklahoma still falls behind all of its bordering states in per-student spending.
Meanwhile, emergency certified teachers, once considered a stop-gap measure, are hired by the thousands every year in Oklahoma schools as an educator shortage continues.

Mississippi has spent about $15 million a year on reading reforms, including hiring literacy coaches who work with teachers to improve instruction. The state also placed greater emphasis on the phonics-based science of reading, added early childhood literacy screenings and, controversially, held back third graders who fell below a minimum standardized test score.
Oklahoma should follow Mississippi’s playbook, Warmington said. 
Colleges must ensure future teachers are trained in the science of reading, he said, and the state should grow the number of literacy coaches supporting educators in the classroom. Use of AI-based literacy tools should be in use statewide to give teachers more up-to-date data on students’ progress, he said.
“And then at the end of the day, you have to have some accountability,” Warmington said. “It’s a safety net. If a student’s not reading, we can’t advance them. So, now you’ve got to go in with some more advanced tutoring to get those students to grade level and help them move on.”
Improving early childhood education and lowering class sizes must be part of the conversation, said Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City. 
Kirt was one of more than three dozen state lawmakers scheduled to attend the chamber’s forum.
“Third-grade retention without nuance is problematic, and that’s why it went away because we can’t overly rely on standardized tests,” Kirt said afterward. “And, we don’t want the students to turn around and get sent back to 30-kid classrooms, oversized classrooms with teachers who are emergency certified.”

Law enforcement officials arrested Antonio Artez Wade, 36, in Gulfport on Thursday for what Clay Joyner, U.S. attorney for the Northern District, described as a “shakedown.”
Federal officials said in a news release that on Sept. 17, Wade stopped a vehicle in the small Delta city in northern Sunflower County. The car’s occupant, an immigrant, admitted to lacking identification. Then Wade allegedly offered to “help” in exchange for $2,500, and the immigrant paid him.
“Corruption of the kind alleged here undermines public safety and trust in law enforcement, and it will simply not be tolerated,” Joyner said in a statement.
Wade remains in federal custody until his bond hearing. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. He is being formally charged with blackmail, extortion and “deprivation of rights under color of law.” Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch announced plans to file state charges as well.
The criminal investigation was a joint operation between federal prosecutors, the Department of Homeland Security, the Mississippi Department of Public Safety and the attorney general’s office. This marks the second joint investigation into corruption in Mississippi Delta law enforcement agencies in the last month.
On Oct. 30, 19 people, including officers from nine Delta law enforcement agencies, were indicted for illegally carrying a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime. Those charged ranged from patrol officers to sheriffs and police chiefs. The U.S. Department of Justice had previously investigated law enforcement agencies in Rankin County, Noxubee County and Holmes County for torture, bribery and illegal searches respectively.
“We learned of the community’s distrust of select law enforcement officers due to concerns of corruption,” FBI Special Agent In-Charge Robert Eikhoff said at an Oct. 30 press conference. “Mississippians deserve and rightfully expect officers to obey their oath.”
“I’m glad that state and federal officials are speaking out against this because what is wrong is wrong, and what is right is right regardless of what your status is,” Ridgeland-based immigration attorney Assma Ali said. “In the United States, individuals are entitled to Fourth Amendment protections even if undocumented.”
“I do firmly believe that if extorted, the vast majority would pay the money because they fear arrest,” she added.

(Photo by John Gardner of the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff's Office)Louisiana and the federal government are pushing for more than $1 billion in fines and penalties against Smitty’s Supply Inc. for years of environmental violations and more recent damages from an explosion and petrochemical spill at its Tangipahoa Parish plant.
That dollar figure is eye-catching but also leads one to question: Why did it take an environmental disaster for officials to finally act against a business with an established track record of wiping its feet on regulations meant to curb pollution?
The answer: It’s in line with regulators’ kid-glove approach to environmental enforcement in Louisiana, where state and federal agencies go out of their way to provide a welcome mat for industry while placing the welfare of its residents on the backburner.  
Examples of this practice are actually detailed in a lawsuit the state Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have filed against Smitty’s Supply. It accuses the company of violating the federal Clean Water Act, the Louisiana Water Control Law and Louisiana Water Pollution Control regulations, among other regulations. 
Their complaint cites hundreds of infractions going back nearly five years, culminating with the Aug. 22 disaster at its Roseland facility. Millions of gallons of oil, lubricants and automotive fluids made their way into the nearby Tangipahoa River and flowed several miles downstream. A fire that took two weeks to fully extinguish created an oily soot that covered nearby homes, farms and businesses.
Before that, the company was cited for illegal wastewater discharges, failing to report pollution and seven separate chemical spills since 2021 that went beyond the facility’s property and contaminated public areas. 
Between May 2022 and August 2025, Smitty’s Supply reported that it exceeded limits 230 times for the amount of organic material, fecal coliform, carbon and other pollutants it’s allowed to discharge in its wastewater.    
These are incidents that Smitty’s Supply has reported to regulators. What’s gone unreported?
According to the lawsuit, the company failed to conduct “daily visual observations” of five outfall canals to check for possible pollutants on weekends and holidays from May 2022 through at least April 2025. A bit of quick math indicates that equals about 350 days without required surveillance. And because these inspections weren’t performed, they couldn’t be logged, which led to additional violations.
Then there are the infractions found when LDEQ inspectors made site visits. In January and February 2023, there were “hydrocarbon materials” and an orange “emulsified petroleum product” flowing from Smitty’s Supply outfall canals into a public roadside ditch. 
After the August explosion, regulators determined the company failed to develop a required Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plan and didn’t adequately maintain a Facility Response Plan that lays out how it handles such incidents. 
All this is to say there is an extensive history of the company failing to take significant steps to address its pattern of violations and minimal evidence of regulators taking meaningful enforcement action to bring about improvements. 
The EPA’s website shows it has issued $161,522 in fines against Smitty’s Supply over the past five years, WVUE-TV Fox 8 reported in August. The company paid $250,000 to settle a state complaint over an oil spill in 2021, and the EPA collected $194,772 in 2019 for infractions, WWL-TV reported.  
It’s hard to determine what kind of dent these penalties have made in the private company’s bottom line; it doesn’t have to make its revenue and net income public.

Like Charles Dickens wrote (and Elvis Costello later sang), accidents will happen. But they’re more probable — and maybe less likely to be considered accidents — in a state where officials aren’t willing to take meaningful punitive action to prevent them.

Su Shannon, a longtime Vermont potter, was drawn to a new career in healthcare. With guidance and support, she enrolled in a radiologic sciences program. Today, she balances her studies and family life while training for an impactful new career.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Shaping a new path: How one Vermont artist found her calling in radiology.","Su Shannon has lived in the welcoming community of Pittsford for 16 years with her husband and their son. Her husband grew up nearby in Proctor, and the couple loved the area enough to stay. Over time, Su built a successful pottery business from her home studio, creating handmade dinnerware that she sells online and at art shows across New England.
One-on-one contact with her customers feeds Su’s soul, and the creativity that goes into ceramics comes very naturally to her. “Meeting people, talking with them, sharing something I’ve made with my hands is just wonderful,” she says.
Recently, after more than a decade in ceramics, Sue began to feel a pull in a different direction. “It became clear that I might want to do something new,” Su shares. “I sat with that feeling for a while, and explored a lot of different options as to where I could go and what I could do next.”
A fascination with how things work
In addition to creative work, Su has always been interested in people and the human body. Years ago, she worked as a massage therapist and the experience of working hands-on with people stayed with her. “I’ve always loved working with people,” she says. “And I’ve always been fascinated by how the body works and how it is put together.”
That curiosity was rekindled each time she or a family member found themselves needing X-ray imaging. “I was fascinated by the technology,” she says. “I wanted to understand how it worked, and I was amazed by the impact diagnostic imaging could have. Radiology became more and more interesting.”
Still, after spending years running her own business, she wasn’t quite sure how to get started. “The question was how to even go into healthcare, especially at this point in my life,” she noted. “I was just asking myself over and over ‘where do I start?’”
Support from VSAC helped her find her path
As Su researched how she might pursue radiology, she discovered that she was out-of-sequence with the annual admissions cycle for the radiology program at Vermont State University (VTSU), where she was looking to study. The team there suggested she start by taking a few classes at Community College of Vermont (CCV) to get some prerequisites and general education requirements under her belt.
So Su did. She signed up for three classes at CCV, which led her to connect with VSAC for the financial aid support and counseling she needed as an adult student. She was assigned to Martha McCaughin, a counselor with VSAC’s Educational Opportunity Center who specializes in supporting adult learners like Su.
“Martha helped me understand what it would be like to go back to school as an adult,” Su says. “She answered every question and helped make the financial path clear. We set up my FAFSA account together, and she even recommended me for scholarships.”
Martha also offered Su some much-needed encouragement. “She inspired me to keep going and to keep pursuing each step,” Su says. “It’s hard to go back as an adult! Martha was so easy to talk to and made me feel very comfortable. We had Zoom calls, phone calls, and exchanged so many emails. She has so much experience helping adult learners that she really was a wealth of information.”
Pursuing her degree, one step at a time
After her CCV classes were finished, Su was able to apply to VTSU’s radiologic sciences program. She’s now in her first year of the program and takes classes on VTSU’s Williston campus. 
“It’s exciting,” she shares. “It was intimidating at first, but it’s challenging me in a good way. I work extra hard and extra long.”
Su’s Tuesdays and Thursdays are spent in clinical practice, where she works alongside experienced technologists. “They’re hugely helpful and show us how to integrate what we’re learning in class into real-life situations,” she notes. With her draw to human connection, it’s no surprise that’s her favorite part of the program so far.
The classes and coursework itself have challenged her in a multitude of ways. “I’m doing physics and math I’ve never done before,” she laughs. “I’m in study groups, I work closely with professors, and it’s actually all coming together nicely. Plus, I’m building my confidence as I go.”
Juggling family life and school
At 52, Su balances her studies with family life and a much smaller pottery practice. “I’m doing a small amount of pottery work, but my focus right now is on school and raising our son,” she notes. 
As Su makes her way through studying, clinicals, and class, she hopes her efforts serve as a model for their son to eventually pursue his own trained technical career in Vermont. In her rare but treasured down time, Su skis and mountain bikes with her family.
Deeply practical, with a desire to make meaningful contributions
Su describes herself as deeply practical by nature. Her decision to study radiology was guided by both genuine interest in the field and a realistic attitude toward college after 50. “At one point, I thought about mental health counseling, but I don’t have 10 years to spend in school. I wanted something I could train for and be working in within a few years.”  
Before applying to VTSU, she took advantage of several job-shadow opportunities in a few hospital departments, including ultrasound and mammography, and found the work both inspiring and something she could picture herself doing. “The people I met were so dedicated. It gave me a clear picture of what I was aiming for,” she shares.
There are two hospitals within easy commuting distance of her home in Pittsford, and Su sees strong job opportunities for herself at either one after graduation. “I want to stay in Vermont and work locally,” she says. “There are many modalities within radiology you can train in, like CT or mammography, and the chance to cross-train later on is exciting.”
“Education after 50 is possible!” 
It’s been two years since Su started down her new path. As she looks back to those early days, when pursuing radiology was an idea, then to the courses she took at CCV, and finally to her experience now in VTSU’s program, Su is clear about one thing: “Adult education is very possible and achievable.” She has a lot of gratitude for how everything has come together for her, and credits VSAC with helping her see how to make it happen. “I’ve felt so supported in this journey,” she says. “Without that help, I think I’d still be wondering where to begin.”
And for Su, her pursuit of her degree isn’t just about changing careers. It’s about finding a new way to contribute to her community while continuing to learn and grow. “I was ready to try something new,” she says. “And I’ve found that thanks to the help I’ve gotten along the way.”

CoreCivic, a private prison company, operates the Diamondback Correctional Facility in Watonga. 
CoreCivic was awarded the contract under an agreement between ICE and the Department of Corrections, according to a news release. 
As part of CoreCivic’s contract with the Department of Corrections, the agency will receive a monthly administrative fee of $833,000 to “monitor CoreCivic’s compliance and perform other administrative functions,” according to a contract obtained by Oklahoma Voice through an open records request.
CoreCivic, which has an “ownership interest” in the facility, will be responsible for receiving and housing the federal detainees while the Department of Corrections will “ensure the transfer and placement” of detainees at the Watonga facility, according to a news release. 
The contract with the Department of Corrections began Sept. 30 and lasts five years, with options for renewal, according to a news release. 
When the facility is fully operational, annual revenue is expected to be about $100 million, said Brian Todd, a CoreCivic spokesperson. CoreCivic expects to begin receiving detainees in the first quarter of 2026, he said in a statement. 
The Diamondback Correctional Facility in Watonga has 2,160 beds and has not been in use since 2010, Todd said. 
The facility was built in 1998 and was previously owned and operated by Corrections Corporation of America. 
Todd said the facility is expected to create 400 jobs and generate about $760,000 in annual property taxes and approximately $2 million in annual utility payments.
“CoreCivic does not enforce immigration laws, arrest anyone who may be in violation of immigration laws, or have any say whatsoever in an individual’s deportation or release,” he said in a statement. “CoreCivic also does not know the circumstances of individuals when they are placed in our facilities. Our responsibility is to care for each person respectfully and humanely while they receive the legal due process that they are entitled to. ”
The Department of Corrections will have access to the Watonga facility and its records, according to the contract. 
A spokesperson for ICE did not respond to questions by the time of publication.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)For at least the next dozen years, rural areas will continue to have only about two-thirds of the primary care physicians they need, according to a report released Monday.
The nonprofit Commonwealth Fund based its analysis on federal health workforce data. Its report comes just days after states applied for portions of a $50 billion rural health fund included in the broad tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed in July. Some states want to use the federal money to expand their rural residency programs, as physicians who complete their residencies in rural areas are more likely to practice in one.
About 43 million people live in rural areas without enough primary care physicians, according to the report. Across the country, nearly all — 92% — of rural counties are considered primary care professional shortage areas, compared to 83% of nonrural counties. Forty-five percent of rural counties had five or fewer primary care doctors in 2023. Roughly 200 rural counties lacked one altogether.
Nationally, the report found there was an average of one physician per 2,881 rural residents. States in the South had 3,411 patients per physician, whereas states in the Northeast had 1,979 residents per physician.
Rural residents are less likely to use telehealth for primary care, largely because of limited broadband internet access. About 19% of rural respondents said they received health care from a primary care physician via telehealth over the past year, compared with the national average of 29%.
The report also took the pulse of states’ participation in national programs for rural areas, such as a federal loan repayment and scholarship program for physicians working in areas with a shortage of health care providers. In 2023, 40% of rural counties had at least one primary care clinician participating in the program — compared to 60% of nonrural counties.
While the demand for primary care physicians will surpass the supply, the study estimates that the supply of rural nurse practitioners will exceed demand over time, as nurse practitioners are the fastest-growing type of clinician in the U.S., regardless of geography, the authors wrote.

A three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit overruled a federal trial judge, finding that an ordinance that restricted owner access to even privately-owned beaches violated constitutional public-use provisions. 
The ordinance closed public and private beaches and residents at those homes were kicked off of the beach. Some landowners filed a lawsuit after deputies threatened to arrest them for accessing their private beaches.
“Walton County not only entered private property; Walton County also ejected the Landowners from their property on threat of arrest and criminal prosecution. That is a taking, not a trespass,” Justice Barbara Lagoa wrote. 
The Takings Clause in the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires that private property taken for public use merits “just compensation” to the landowner.
“This case involves a textbook physical taking: Walton County enacted an ordinance barring the Landowners from entering and remaining on their private property; Walton County’s officers physically occupied the Landowners’ property; and Walton County’s officers excluded the Landowners from their own property under threat of arrest and criminal prosecution,” Lagoa wrote. 
In March 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order that asked residents to abide by local beach closures. Two days later, Walton County Commissioners voted to close all public beaches, saying that it lacked authority to keep landowners off of private beaches.
Notwithstanding that position, in April of that year, Walton commissioners temporarily closed all beaches, even private beaches, from April 2 until April 30.
“[T]he district court emphasized that the Landowners retained the ability to sell their property, that the Ordinance was temporary, that the Landowners could still use part of their property, and that the Landowners could still exclude other citizens from their private property. None of these points makes a difference,” Lagoa wrote. 
The appeals court disagreed with the district court, which found that Walton County’s ordinance was neither a physical nor regulatory taking. 
The three-judge panel was made up of GOP-appointees. Judges Lagoa and Brasher were appointed by Trump and Judge Edward Carnes was appointed by President George H. W. Bush.
“Walton County will be held accountable for compensating these landowners for taking their property, along with covering their legal expenses incurred during the litigation,” said Kent Safriet of Holtzman Vogel Baran Torchinsky & Josefiak, who argued the case, in a written statement.
“The Commissioners ignored the advice of their own County Attorney, a decision that impacts the taxpayers of Walton County and could have been easily avoided,” said property owner Eric Wilhelm.

[ONN photo/Sarah Leach]As a West Michigan coal plant continues to produce power nearly 180 days after it was slated to cease operations, several Michigan Democrats are speaking out against President Donald Trump’s administration’s decision to keep the plant online, advising against another extension to its lifespan.
On Thursday, 37 of the Michigan House of Representatives’ 52 Democratic members brought a resolution urging U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to stop issuing extensions for the J.H. Campbell Coal Plant in West Olive. 
Wright first issued an extension on the plant’s operations in May, eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, citing the Trump administration’s executive order declaring an energy emergency and arguing the plant’s capacity was needed to meet peak energy demand across the Midwest over the summer and preventing blackouts. 
The plan to shut down the plant was not a snap decision from its owner, Consumers Energy, which announced in 2021 that it intended to go coal-free by 2025. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Michigan’s energy regulator, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved the company’s shut down plan after weighing input from the Department of Attorney General, environmental and consumer advocates, energy developers, businesses and more, determining Consumers Energy’s plan to retire the plant and shift to other resources was “the most reasonable and prudent means of meeting Consumers’ energy and capacity needs.”
The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, which operates the electric grid for much of the central U.S., also signed off on the shutdown, after determining that it would not violate their reliability criteria.
In their resolution, Michigan Democrats pointed to the grid operator’s projections that it had plenty of energy supply to meet expected consumer demand over the summer, while noting the government order conflicts with Consumers’ decision to cease using coal as an energy source.
They also cited the continued costs to ratepayers for operating the plant, in addition to the toll the plant is taking on the environment as well as the health of residents living near the plant. 
“The plant releases millions of pounds of air pollutants annually, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and fine particulate matter. Nearly 9 million tons of climate-harming carbon dioxide are also released annually,” the resolution reads. “The air pollution generated by coal plants has been linked to several negative health impacts such as asthma, cancer, heart conditions, and lung conditions.”
The resolution is unlikely to move forward, as the Republican-led House is not scheduled to meet to vote on policy this week, and the resolution was referred to the Government Operations Committee – generally considered a graveyard for policy.
However, Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids), one of the resolution’s sponsors, said the Trump administration’s decision to continue ignoring calls to shutdown the plant prompted more formal action. 
The Trump Administration is testing American institutions to the bone, Wooden said, arguing that in order to place the country on the right trajectory, Trump’s opponents need to leverage any and all available methods to push back, whether it’s supporting Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s legal action against the administration’s orders or highlighting the impacts of Trump’s policies.
“Allowing [the plant] to shut down is in line with our own private industry, with our own utilities, and with the environmental community,” Wooden said. “And you know, even if this doesn’t pass, I think it’s important we can remain clear that this is a damaging decision and it is time for the Trump administration to listen to Michiganders who … don’t want to see more utility price hikes and don’t want dirty coal polluting our airways.”

Bentley Johnson, the federal government affairs director for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, told the Michigan Advance that the Trump Administration’s decision to extend the Campbell plant’s operations cuts utilities and regulators’ planning process at the knees, while creating questions for what this means for the state’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2040.
He also pointed to testimony presented by a host of separate environmental organizations in opposition to the second extension, which found that during  the tightest energy margin of the summer, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator had an energy surplus equal to more than 10 times the amount of energy produced at the Campbell plant. 
While Consumers Energy has reported $80 million in costs in keeping the plant open between May 23 and Sept. 30, Johnson noted that this number does not account for the $84 million in costs recovered by selling power to the grid operator. 
“If we had to eat all those costs, that’s a lot. But instead, we’re raising the rates in these other states, you know. Rate payers in other states are helping us pay for this,” Johnson said. 
Breaking down the cost of continuing to operate the plant during that period comes out to $615,384 per day, Johnson said. 
“No one was asking for this, you know, no one wanted this,” Johnson said. 
Affordability is the issue of the day, particularly with electric bills, Johnson said.  The first step in addressing that issue? 
“Don’t make it worse,” Johnson said before noting that it’s not too late for the Trump administration to reverse course. 
However, if the extensions continue, Johnson argued Consumers Energy has a duty to their ratepayers to step in and say “this is not right.” 
Brian Wheeler, a media relations specialist for Consumers Energy, said the company is ready to continue operating the plant if they receive another order.

The states allege, in the amici curiae filed, the California laws would impose an “illegal greenhouse gas disclosure policy” and would cause “nightmarish compliance costs and liability on companies across the country.”
In 2023, California enacted laws that require businesses of a certain size to submit greenhouse gas emissions reports and reports on the measures the business planned to adopt to reduce their climate-related financial risk.

The brief from the states said California is “trying to be the national regulator of American greenhouse gas emissions—but for many reasons it may not do so.” 
The State of Iowa and several other states that also signed onto Bird’s brief, have already sued the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over a similar law that sought to impose emissions reporting standards. That case is still being litigated, but the attorneys general allege the California law seeks to step in and do the same thing the states objected to at the federal level. 
The brief said the California law, which would impact businesses outside of the state with revenues above a certain level, requires businesses to express a “certain viewpoint on the highly controversial issue area of climate change.” 
It said even if a business believes the climate-related “doomsday scenarios” are unlikely, it has to submit reports about how it plans to respond to the effects of a changing climate. 
The brief alleges the California laws are illegal because they compel speech from these companies on a topic they may want to avoid speaking on. 
It also alleges the laws would impose “irreparable economic harm on other states.” The brief estimates out-of-state businesses would incur “millions” in auditing and reporting costs for emissions that are outside of California’s borders. 
Businesses with more than $1 billion in annual revenue that do business in California are required by the law to disclose “comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions” along their supply chains. Business with $500 million in annual revenue that do business in the state will have to supply biennial climate-related financial risk reports that are publicly available. 
California’s enacted Senate Bill 261 says climate change is affecting California communities and economy with wildfires, sea level rise, extreme droughts and extreme weather events. 
“Failure of economic actors to adequately plan for and adapt to climate-related risks to their businesses and to the economy will result in significant harm to California,” the law reads. 
According to the California statute, mandatory disclosures set by law will help to “ensure a sustainable, resilient, and prosperous future” for the state. 
Bird said in a news release Monday about the amici curiae that “California needs to stay in California.” 
“California has no right to tell Iowa or any other state what to do,” Bird said in the release. “Their attempt to continually tell other states and businesses how to do business outside California is radical overreach and needs to be stopped.” 
Pam Mackey-Taylor, Sierra Club Iowa Chapter’s director, said in a statement that Iowa families are “suffering the real consequences of corporations burning fossil fuels for profit” and cited derechos, droughts and rising insurance costs as an example.
“Climate change is real, and consumers should be able to make informed decisions about whether they prefer supporting companies that are reducing greenhouse gas emissions versus those that are not,” Mackey-Taylor said.  “Here in Iowa, we expect our attorney general to serve as the lawyer of the people and take up the everyday issues that affect Iowans, not fight the policies that help protect us.”
The attorneys’ brief is in support of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America’s suit against the chair of the California Air Resources Board. The parties involved requested, Nov. 10, an emergency injunction prohibiting the enforcement of the California laws, which are set to go into effect Jan. 1, 2026. 
Attorneys general from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming joined the brief from Bird.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-17 21:47:21+00:00,CT Mirror,Climate activists protest gas expansion projects in Lamont’s office,Josie Reich and John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/17/ct-climate-natural-gas-expansion-protest/,Activists called for Gov. Ned Lamont to deny permits for new projects expanding natural gas usage in Connecticut. Nine people were arrested.,"Around 30 activists in neon pink T-shirts gathered around Gov. Ned Lamont’s office on Monday afternoon, singing “This Little Light of Mine,” to protest his support for new methane gas construction in Connecticut.
The protest was organized by a new coalition calling themselves Don’t Destroy Our Future, a group organized for the sake of this protest by members of climate justice groups including Sunrise Movement Connecticut, Third Act and Interreligious Eco-Justice Network. 
Activists called for Lamont to deny permits for new projects expanding natural gas usage in Connecticut. They argued that these buildouts contradict the state’s goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, a target Lamont signed into law earlier this year.
“Gov. Lamont has been clear that he wants to bring new energy resources into New England to increase our energy supply and lower costs for ratepayers,” said Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Lamont’s office. “We look forward to continuing the conversation with regional partners on how we can best achieve this goal, while protecting the state’s investment in renewable energy.”
Nine of the activists entered Lamont’s office and explained their demands to a Lamont staffer, who nodded and said he would pass their concerns along. In a planned political arrest, those nine activists then refused to leave the office and were peacefully escorted out by Capitol Police.
They were charged with obstruction of free passage, a misdemeanor, and released, according to Lt. Greg Wimble of the Capitol Police.

Claudia Allen, a 79 year-old Thompson resident, said she felt a generational responsibility to be arrested for the first time in her life, because she doesn’t have the same career considerations as young people.
“I really feel that my generation has to make the right decisions in order for [the younger] generation to have a livable future,” she said. “It’s really all about the young people for me.”
Most of the protesters were around her age. Two of the arrested protesters walked with canes, and one had been arrested protesting the Vietnam War.
Kate Donnelly, a former first selectman of Hampton, said she saw Lamont’s approval of natural gas projects as incompatible with his support for climate goals.
“When Gov. Lamont ran for office, he made a lot of promises about addressing climate, and he hasn’t kept them,” she said. “We’re here to say, Gov. Lamont, we need to secure our future for the planet and our children and future generations, and we want him to address these issues.”

Lamont, a Democrat, has long expressed an openness to natural gas as a means of keeping energy prices in check while reducing emissions from older, dirtier forms of power such as oil and coal.
In July, his administration gave tentative approval to a plan to expand the capacity of the existing Iroquois Pipeline by building a series of compressors capable of pumping an additional 125 million cubic feet of gas each day through the pipeline. The decision angered both environmental activists as well as local residents in Brookfield — the town where the compressors will be built — who have raised concerns about the pipeline’s proximity to a nearby middle school.
The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection has yet to issue a final permit for the Iroquois project, which is scheduled for an informational public hearing in January. 
A spokesperson for the Iroquois Pipeline did not respond to a request for comment Monday.
During his state of the state address in January, Lamont urged lawmakers not to “rule out natural gas” as a way of addressing the state’s spiking energy costs, despite concerns about methane and other greenhouse gas emissions.
Connecticut, like most of its New England counterparts, relies on natural gas to produce the majority of its electricity. In addition, more than a third of the state’s homes are heated with natural gas during the winter.
“We bring in very inexpensive natural gas from Pennsylvania, but that pipeline is at capacity,” he said. “And we bring in [liquid natural gas] by foreign ships, which is more polluting and more expensive.”
Critics of natural gas, however, argue that the commodity is subject to volatile price swings that could undermine promises of long-term savings.
“His embrace of more gas is really unfortunate,” said Peter Millman, the director of People’s Action for Clean Energy, an environmental group. “I think that he and his advisors are underestimating what the future cost of gas prices will be.”
Millman was not in attendance at Monday’s protest. 
The Lamont administration has also drawn criticism over a plan to invest $42 million in a new gas heating system to power a network of pipes that deliver heating and cooling to more than a dozen buildings in downtown Hartford, known as the Capitol Area System. 
Advocates had pushed for lower-emission — and costlier — alternatives that would replace the aging gas-powered system with either all-electric boilers or an underground geothermal system.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1117_SR_SunriseProtest_248-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-17 16:57:40.587874

Traveling via bike — even in such unwelcoming conditions — can be a practical way to get outside while reducing emissions in the process, fans of year-round biking say.

Fiona Medeiros is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
Winter rushed in last week with parts of Chittenden County seeing nearly a half a foot of snow.  But that’s no obstacle for the year-round cyclists who see winter as merely an invitation to swap their nice, expensive rides for ‘beater bikes’, and to remember to charge their lights. 
Whether it’s to and from work, picking up the kids or running errands, year-round cyclists prove that it can be done without using a car. While snow shovels have already been put to use in Vermont, winter’s official start date is Dec. 21. Average temperatures typically drop in December, and Vermont sees its earliest sunset and fewest daylight hours.
Still, traveling via bike — even in such unwelcoming conditions — can be a practical way to get outside while reducing emissions in the process, fans of year-round biking say.
More and more people seem interested in staying on their bikes through the winter these days, including people who are dedicated to lowering their reliance on fossil fuels, said Deb Kraft, mechanic and communications coordinator at Old Spokes Home, a non-profit bikeshop and Burlington staple. 
Adaptations are necessary, though. Personal preparedness and bike maintenance are important to successfully transition to winter riding, a time when there is less visibility and more grit to get between your gears, according to Kraft. Some folks even don their ski and snowboard attire out on the road.
A sign at the store outlined a list of specific tips and warned that bike travel can take 30% longer in winter conditions.

Consider adding extra lighting, a fender and studded tires. Running bike tires at lower pressure might also be a good move, depending on travel routes and bike type. Fat tire bikes are also a popular choice for the winter. Dressing in layers that can be added or removed is another strategy.
“Wear less clothes than you think you need if you have an uphill portion in your commute,” said Val Cyr, communications specialist at Local Motion, a Burlington-based nonprofit. 
It’s important to prepare thoroughly for both cold and wet conditions, with rain pants and waterproof shoe covers good options for protective measures. Riding an e-bike to get places with a bit less sweating involved is another option, though winter temps can present charging challenges for e-bike batteries.

Both Cyr and Burlington-area bike legend, Peter Burns, contribute to Local Motion’s blog. At 69, Burns jokes that he was one of the “original three” winter cyclists in Burlington. He traces winter biking back to the 1980s when “winters were snowier and colder.” 
Having biked through the past fifteen winters, “technology is such that I can ride every day, except in a blizzard,” Burns said. 
He has seen gear come a long way, with modern luxuries like electric mittens coming in handy when the mercury drops. Other warmth accessories include heated saddles and handlebar mitts.  “Dress for the weather that’s actually out there,” he counseled, “not the weather you hope for.”
Burns advises a gradual approach to folks curious about transitioning to all-seasons cycling. One option is to ride as late into the winter and start as early in the spring as they feel comfortable.  “Don’t approach it as all-or-nothing,” Burns said.
Local Motion and Old Spokes Home are strong networks with resources for all-seasons cycling, including winter biking seminars, tips and encouragement. Local Motion hosts a year-round group bike ride, typically on the last Tuesday of every month, without stopping for winter. 
Local Motion also works statewide to improve accessibility for cyclists and walkers with safer road design, more trails and community advocacy.
Local Motion recently partnered with volunteers in a pilot project to put up tall cones along Burlington’s North Avenue bike lane to improve safety and bike/pedestrian access over 6,000 feet of protected lane. 
In general, conditions on winter roads vary and the outside portions of roads may not be salted. It is imperative to go slowly and give plenty of space for wider turns and slower stops than riders may be accustomed to in warmer seasons, cycling advocates say. 
Biking safely in the winter, in addition to possibly extending trip time when the conditions are icy and snowy, also may require more planning ahead. 
Despite Vermont’s harsh winter climate, cycling remains an ecologically-friendly way to move from place to place. Over the years, Burns has pedaled through his share of dismal weather and managed to navigate both biting cold and spitting snow. 
“I made the trips,” said Burns. “It wasn’t all that fun, but I made them.”

Now, despite some statewide efforts to improve health outcomes, the threat of federal health care funding cuts could worsen the problem, health care professionals say.
The annual Missouri “report card” published Monday by the March of Dimes again lands the state squarely in the bottom half of the country for rates of infant mortality, maternal mortality, preterm births and severe maternal morbidity.
“This is not the time to let our foot off the gas,” said Dr. Michael Warren, chief medical and health officer with March of Dimes. “We are among the most dangerous high income countries in the world for giving birth, and so we really need to be doubling down on our efforts to make sure that everybody has access to care.”
That’s why Warren is keeping a close eye on President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which cleared Congress earlier this year and could have dramatic implications for families by reducing the funding going to state Medicaid programs. 
“In places like Missouri, where almost 40% of your births are covered by Medicaid, that really has the potential to make maternal illness and health outcomes worse,” he told The Independent Monday. “It has the potential to increase closures of rural hospitals and places where moms can get access to prenatal care.” 
While infant mortality rates decreased slightly from 2022 to 2023, maternal mortality rates worsened, according to the nonprofit focused on infant and maternal health outcomes. 
Missouri again earned a “D” for its preterm birth rate.
In 2024, more than 7,400 — or 11% — of babies born in Missouri were preterm, before 37 weeks gestation. This is the same rate as the year prior, and lands Missouri at 37th worst state in the country for prematurity rates. 
“One of the things that really jumps out to me is a high rate of chronic diseases among women even before they become pregnant,” Warren said, adding that chronic conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and smoking increase the risk of preterm birth.
Warren noted that while Missouri has remained stuck at a D grade for premature births, the U.S. overall remains at a D+.
“This is a call to action for us,” Warren said. “The United States is among the most dangerous high income countries in the world for giving birth, and these numbers help explain why.” 
While the state’s infant mortality rate improved slightly from 2022 to the latest 2023 data, 441 babies still died before they turned 1 year old in Missouri in 2023. Missouri ranks 33rd in the nation for infant deaths, with infant mortality rates for children born to Pacific Islander mothers 2.5 times the state average between 2021 and 2023, the most recent years analyzed.

The leading causes of death for infants in Missouri between 2021 and 2023 were birth defects, preterm birth, sudden unexpected infant death and accidents, according to the report. 
“All of those lost babies are so much more impactful than people realize, because it is the loss of these parents’ future,” said Denise Côté-Arsenault, a professor of maternal child nursing at Saint Louis University.
Côté-Arsenault, a nurse whose research focuses on bereaved parents, also noted the lack of mental health support for new mothers in Missouri in the report. 
Missouri does not require clinicians to screen women insured by Medicaid for postpartum depression during their child’s pediatric visits. Missouri Medicaid also doesn’t reimburse for this screening, as is recommended by the March of Dimes.
In 2024, 38% of births were covered by Medicaid. 
A year prior, Missouri expanded Medicaid coverage through the first year postpartum. Warren applauded this decision, but said the state should go one step further by expanding medicaid coverage to include maternal mental health screenings. 
Mental health conditions accounted for one-third of recent pregnancy-associated deaths in Missouri, according to the most recent maternal mortality report published over the summer by the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services. This includes substance use.
Warren said this review board, as well as a new Missouri law that allows doulas to be reimbursed through Medicaid, are among the improvements Missouri has made in recent years that he hopes will begin yielding better outcomes.
Mothers and babies of color and mothers insured by Medicaid continue to make up an outsized portion of the data, complicated by factors like poverty, racism and violence, she said.
“Unless we have constant support and changing social situations, we’re not going to make much headway overall,” Côté-Arsenault said. “ …These folks need more health care, not less.”
In addition to the cuts to Medicaid, she is also watching other policy changes that impact low-income families, such as threats to local Head Start programs and efforts to improve access to affordable child care. 
The March of Dimes report also recommends Missouri require paid parental leave.
But Côté-Arsenault, who has spent nearly 50 years working with mothers and babies, said increasing support for community health, creating more public health programs for mothers and babies (including postpartum home visits) and increased specialized educational support for nurses could make a difference. 
It’s going to take a concerted effort on a local and federal level.
“A lot of people are looking for an easy fix,” Côté-Arsenault said. “And there isn’t one.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1210311035-scaled-1-1024x684.jpeg,,,2025-11-17 16:57:40.587874

(AP Photo/L.G. Patterson)
Mississippi football history is rich with legendary players who were lightly recruited out of high school but went on to become among of the most productive college and professional players on the planet.
Names like Payton (Walter), Rice (Jerry), Favre (Brett) and Manning (Archie) are part of American football lore. None were heavily recruited as 17- and 18-year-olds. “Diamonds in the rough,” sports writers and sportscasters used to call them. Popular opinion is that such rare diamonds no longer exist, what with the proliferation of summer football camps, scouting combines and .com recruiting services.
Rick Cleveland
But just when we think that, out of nowhere (actually from out of Oma, Mississippi), comes a guy like Ahmad Hardy, the 19-year-old Missouri running back, who Saturday night appeared a second coming of the great Payton. All he did was slash and dash for 300 yards and three touchdowns on 25 carries in the Tigers’ 49-27 trashing of Mississippi State. Like Payton, Hardy can run around you or he can run over you. He hurts tacklers more than tacklers hurt him. Like Payton, Hardy is listed at 5-10 and 210 pounds. Like Payton, Hardy is just getting started when opponents first hit him.
Yet when signing day arrived in February of 2023, Hardy had just one FBS offer and that was to the University of Louisiana-Monroe. You, as I, must wonder, how can that be?
Jesse Anderson, now the head coach at Hazlehurst, was Hardy’s coach at Lawrence County, and he knew what he had in Hardy. “I knew he was an SEC running back, I knew how good he was, and I told every college coach I could,” Anderson said Monday morning. “I sent them all film. I never got a straightforward answer on why nobody was offering him. They’d tell me, ‘Coach, he’s on our radar. We’re tracking him.’ But his only offer on national signing day was Louisiana-Monroe, so he took it.”
Hardy’s grades weren’t a problem. Neither was his production. Said Anderson, “Ahmad led the state in rushing (2,442 yards and 24 touchdowns) as a senior. He was a dream to coach. He wanted the ball on every play. You never wondered what you were going to get with Ahmad. You always got his best effort.”
Until his senior season of high school football, Hardy played both running back and linebacker. In fact, Anderson’s favorite memory of Hardy remains a game against Brookhaven his junior season. “Ahmad ran for 170 yards in the game, and we were ahead late. Brookhaven was driving deep in our territory for what would have been the winning touchdown,” Anderson said. “Ahmad made four straight tackles on first, second, third and fourth downs. I don’t know why they kept running to his side but they did. He stuffed them.”
Hardy’s toughness was never an issue. Perhaps his foot speed is what turned off recruiters. He reportedly ran a 4.6 40 at a scouting combine. But track speed and football speed are two entirely different things. Jerry Rice famously ran a 4.71 40 at the NFL combine. But did you ever see anybody catch Rice from behind? Me either. Nobody has been catching Hardy either, including State on one 72-yard touchdown run when Hardy was clocked at a top speed of 21 mph. (I remember asking the late, great Archie Cooley, Rice’s coach at Mississippi Valley State, why Rice ran a 4.71 at the combine. Said Cooley, “Because nobody was chasing him.”)
What makes Hardy’s college recruitment (or lack of) even more mystifying is that he comes from a football family. Two uncles (Wayne Hardy and Kendrick Hardy) were outstanding players at Southern Miss. His father, Kentario Hardy was a terrific defensive end at Nicholls State.
Southern Miss reportedly offered Ahmad Hardy during the fall recruiting period but wanted a verbal commitment from him right away. When Hardy opted to wait until the national signing day in February, USM retracted the offer. Huge mistake, that was.
So, naturally, Hardy torched the Golden Eagles as a freshman for 121 yards and two touchdowns rushing and 52 yards receiving in ULM’s 38-21 victory. Hardy ran for 1,351 yards for the Warhawks, garnering transfer portal interest from football powerhouses around the country. He chose Missouri, and he has treated SEC defenses every bit as rudely as he did those in the Sun Belt. Through 10 games, he had rushed for 1,346 yards and 15 touchdowns. He has yet to fumble in well over 400 carries in two seasons of college football. Not bad for a teenager from Oma, a small community about 15 miles north of Monticello on Mississippi 27.
“Ahmad’s just special,” Anderson, his high school coach, said. “He’s a country kid, loves to fish and ride horses. He loves him some horses, now.”
Seems fitting. Hardy looked like Secretariat running down the stretch against Mississippi State.
“No doubt,” Anderson said. “Ahmad runs like a thoroughbred.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/17135016/AP25320194698834.jpg,,,2025-11-17 16:57:40.587874
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-17 21:31:06+00:00,CT Mirror,Report urges lawmakers to commit to early childhood education,Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/17/report-urges-lawmakers-to-commit-to-early-childhood-education/,"The CT Voices for Children report says the early childhood education system needs an overhaul, with dysfunction at virtually every level.","Connecticut Voices for Children released its annual report on the state of early childhood on Monday, painting a picture of a system that is struggling to meet a demand but is hopeful about a plan to expand access to early childhood education.
The report calls 2025 “a transition point” for early childhood education in Connecticut.
“This session’s policy changes lay out an ambitious path forward that, if given continued support, could begin to address long-standing structural barriers,” the report says. 
Those policy changes include the creation a new endowment for early childhood education, a signature issue of Gov. Ned Lamont that will draw up to $300 million from surplus funds each year. Depending on how quickly that fund grows, it will eventually allow families making less than $100,000 to pay nothing for infant and toddler care and pre-K, while families making more than that would pay no more than 7% of their annual household income toward those expenses.
But the report released Monday shows why that system needs a significant overhaul, with dysfunction at virtually every level, from the low compensation for workers, lack of spots for kids, unaffordable options for parents and closures of existing businesses due to the inability to make a profit in the sector.
According to the report, there has been little improvement in the number of spots for early learners over the past decade. Most notably, enrollment in publicly funded infant and toddler care grew by 34%, while preschool age enrollment in such programs fell by 9%. By late 2024 and into this year, the wait list for Care 4 Kids, a program that helps low to moderate income households pay for child care, grew to more than 3,000.
The number of providers also declined significantly, from 4,527 in 2014 to 3,861 in 2024. The report puts blame on low wages and incremental policy shifts created in a piecemeal fashion, and it calls early childhood education “a fragile and untenable system that is nonetheless essential infrastructure, central to a thriving economy.”
The report applauds the creation of the early childhood education endowment but also sounds a note of caution to lawmakers, urging them to stay the course to that enough money is set aside to make the model work as imagined. The fund depends, after all, on surplus funds.
“While ambitious and moving in the right direction, much of the realization of this legislation will depend on an economic climate that is conducive to a growing endowment and continued funding for existing programs,” the report said. 
Ruchi Sheth, the principal author of the report, was optimistic about the joint impact of legislation passed during the 2025 session.
“This legislation in tandem will increase child care slots, make child care more affordable for families and increase provider pay to increase the state’s ECE (early childhood education) system,” Sheth said.
Still, Connecticut Voices for Children had a number of policy recommendations. First, stick to the endowment goals set out. Next, the group recommended that the state index personal income tax to inflation, to account for lagging cost of living increases to worker pay and to ensure that taxes don’t continue to take bigger bites of household income over time.
The group also urges the state to hire more auditors to improve what they called an “exceptionally low” audit rate of 0.39%, which they said results in a significant loss in uncollected tax revenue. According to Sheth, other state tax agencies have an average audit rate of 3%. 
“With damaging changes at the federal level that shift more costs onto the states, this lost revenue means there’s less available to invest in essential programs such as child care, health care education and more,” Sheth said. Sheth called investment in audit capabilities a common sense investment.
Finally, the group recommends establishing scheduling protections for hourly workers, a key issue for early childhood education workers. 
“Our position is that early childhood is essential infrastructure and should be resourced as such,” said Emily Byrne, the executive director of Connecticut Voices for Children. She said that the policies enacted in 2025 could prove to be “the most transformative and comprehensive early childhood policy in the country.

Ten days after CommonWealth Beacon first reported on the proposal, House budget chief Aaron Michlewitz on Monday said more conversations need to take place about whether or how to defang the state’s next major emissions-reduction target. 
He described the bill as “still something that we’re working on,” and added he does not “foresee us necessarily getting to it before the end of the week.” 
It’s a significant balking from House leadership after state Rep. Mark Cusack, a Democrat from Braintree who is the chamber’s point person on energy policy, fast-tracked the reform bill through committee last week.  
“Some of the rollback pieces on the 2030 numbers have gotten a lot of interest, a lot of energy behind it, no pun intended there,” Michlewitz said of the blowback to the early House plan. “We are certainly wanting to focus on affordability and not necessarily on things of that nature,” he said, referring to the emissions deadlines. 
Under Cusack’s measure, the state’s legal goal to halve its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels could become merely “advisory.” The bill would also trim the energy efficiency program known as Mass Save by $500 million and cut the amount of clean energy utilities here must purchase from a 3 percent annual increase to 1 percent. 
But those dramatic changes are on ice, at least for the next few months, and Cusack’s proposal now looks more like a trial balloon whose journey quickly hit a tempest than a plan with the full backing of House Democrats. 
“We are probably going to have to have to have a conversation at some point related to whether we can meet our goals for 2030,” Michlewitz told reporters. “I think that’s a real challenge that we’re facing, particularly when you have a federal government that is trying to thwart us at every possible turn in relation to trying to get to those goals. Having that conversation is certainly coming to a head at some point, but I do not think it will be in this vehicle as we move forward.” 
“We still have a lot of work to do on that particular piece,” he added. 
The delay will give House Democrats time to forge a position more palatable to climate groups. It also pushes any action on Gov. Maura Healey’s energy-affordability legislation, which she filed in May, until into or after the winter with high utility bills again looming. 
Cusack’s proposal sharply raised eyebrows both in Massachusetts and across the country. The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board highlighted the bill as a symbol of Democrats reconsidering climate priorities. 
It triggered an avalanche of opposition from climate groups, who viewed it as a betrayal of the state’s legal commitment to slashing greenhouse gas emissions and a sudden pivot with little warning. 
Activists rallied outside the State House last week, and representatives from nearly 100 environmental and development groups wrote to Michlewitz on Friday calling the proposal a “grave misstep.” 
Some influential voices outside the climate movement supported the measure. Associated Industries of Massachusetts president Brooke Thomson last week announced her group “unequivocally supports” Cusack’s proposal, saying it “balances realistic climate policies with real savings that keep the lights on.” 
Cusack said he wanted the 106-page bill — which was released publicly for the first time on Thursday — to receive a House vote by Wednesday, November 19, the last day for major action before lawmakers break for the year.  
The Braintree Democrat also said from the outset that he had the support of House Speaker Ron Mariano, though the speaker’s office later said Mariano had not yet taken a position on the bill. 
“I do think that we still have some work to do on this bill, and I think that that’s been very clear,” Michlewitz replied when asked if he thought Cusack was incorrect to claim the speaker’s backing. 
With the energy bill out of the mix, Michlewitz laid out the House’s plans for the remaining two days before lawmakers shift into holiday vacation mode. The chamber on Tuesday will take up a nearly $3.3 billion borrowing bill to fund investments in higher education infrastructure. On Wednesday, the House will tackle legislation dealing with workplace violence and a resolution rescinding an application for a federal Constitutional Convention amid fears of federal overreach. 
Both branches are also set to vote this week on a compromise $2.3 billion spending bill to close the state’s financial books for fiscal year 2025, which ended June 30. 
Michlewitz and his Senate counterpart, Michael Rodrigues, on Monday announced an agreement on that legislation, which will direct $1.67 billion toward MassHealth, put $10 million in state funding on the table for costs associated with the 2026 men’s World Cup, and demand a new probe of spending by county sheriffs. 
The final accord will provide about $27 million for sheriffs, withholding more than $100 million that Healey originally proposed until after the inspector general reports on spending habits in the county law enforcement offices. 
Lawmakers stopped short of embracing the Senate’s more dramatic proposal, which would have created a new oversight council to keep a close eye on sheriffs’ budgets. 
“I don’t think we necessarily were objecting to that from the House side, but I think it was more we want to see what the IG actually has to say,” Michlewitz said. “We’re open-minded to it, but just for right now, I think we wanted to make sure that the IG had the ability to do his job on it [first].”",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11-17_Michlewitz_Rodrigues_1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-17 16:57:40.587874

Nachmanoff, a President Joe Biden appointee who is overseeing the Comey case, ordered the materials be turned over, but the process was halted when the government challenged the order. Nachmanoff then remanded the case to Fitzpatrick, who in 2022 was selected on merit by a panel of U.S. District judges in the Eastern District of Virginia to hold the magistrate position for eight years.A federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, indicted Comey in September on one charge of making false statements to Congress during testimony in 2020 and another of obstructing a proceeding of Congress. Prosecutors had sought an additional charge of making false statements, but the grand jury returned only the two charges. Trump, who publicly urged U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute Comey, ousted the then-U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik S.

This Mountaire Farms’ tradition began almost 30 years ago as a small community service project and has grown into one of the most anticipated outreach events in Delmarva.
Contributing Writer | Delaware Live | November 2025
Mountaire Farms is gearing up for one of the region’s largest holiday traditions as volunteers prepare to pack more than fifteen thousand Thanksgiving meals for families across Delmarva. The annual Thanksgiving for Thousands event, set for November 22, continues a long-standing effort to ensure that every household has the opportunity to enjoy a full holiday dinner, even as food costs continue to rise.
The large-scale distribution brings together volunteers from community groups, churches, schools and local organizations. Together, they will pack 15,250 boxes filled with all the items needed for a traditional Thanksgiving meal. Each box includes a Mountaire roaster chicken and holiday staples such as stuffing, yams, corn, green beans, cranberry sauce and dessert items. Organizers say the final count of participating groups often grows as the holiday approaches.
The Mountaire tradition began almost 30 years ago as a small community service project and has grown into one of the most anticipated outreach events in Delmarva. Families experiencing financial hardship, seniors and individuals served by neighborhood nonprofits benefit from the holiday boxes, which provide both comfort and relief at a time when grocery bills can stretch household budgets. Local leaders say the event showcases the region’s strong spirit of service, where neighbors continue to look out for one another.
The packing process has become an annual highlight for many volunteers. The event is known for its upbeat, assembly-line atmosphere, where participants move quickly from station to station filling boxes that travel down long conveyor-style rows. Groups often return each year, describing the event as a meaningful kickoff to their own holiday season and a reminder of the power of community.
The program also supports dozens of partner organizations that serve families across Delaware, Maryland and the broader Delmarva region. After the packing event, these partners pick up their assigned boxes and distribute them to households that signed up through their local nonprofit or organization.
How to Get Involved
Community members interested in supporting the effort can sign up to volunteer at one of Mountaire’s packing events. Volunteers help assemble meal boxes, organize food items and assist with preparing boxes for pickup. While registration for organizations requesting boxes has closed for this year, general volunteer opportunities may still be available depending on location and capacity. Those who want to participate are encouraged to reach out directly to learn about remaining openings and ways to help.
Mountaire Farms expects this year’s turnout to be one of its largest yet, continuing a tradition that brings warmth, comfort and connection to thousands of families each Thanksgiving.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The amount of state tax obligations Nebraska taxpayers have evaded has soared beyond $310 million, growing by 15% this past year, according to a letter released Monday by the Nebraska State Auditor.
“Worse yet, they are being allowed to get away with it,” Auditor Mike Foley said in a statement.

The “staggering” amount, according to Foley, is a cumulative result of unpaid corporate and individual income taxes, sales and use taxes, partnership income taxes and withholding taxes.
Delinquencies have increased steadily over the past decade. But for 2025 alone, the auditor reported that outstanding tax revenues grew more than $41 million, or 15% more than the previous year — ranking it among the highest increases in recent history for tax delinquency.
 Picking up the slack

Foley quipped: “Benjamin Franklin once observed wryly that only ‘death and taxes’ are certain. In Nebraska, it is indeed impossible to escape mortality, but far too many individuals and corporations have found ways to evade their legal tax obligations.”
He said the rising delinquencies put a burden on tax-paying Nebraskans who pick up the “slack” for those who “shirk” their financial responsibilities to the state.
“That is neither proper nor sustainable,” Foley said.
 

What is a delinquency?
Any tax, interest, penalties or costs which are owed and past due, regardless of whether the amount was simply unpaid or issued by the department as a balance due notice, jeopardy assessment, notice of proposed deficiency determination or any other assessment.
– Nebraska Department of Revenue



Concerns were laid out in a six-page letter sent to Nebraska Tax Commissioner James Kamm. It noted that the full audit of fiscal year 2025 was still ongoing, but that “early communication” was sent due to “urgent need for corrective action.”
“The seriousness of the matter warranted early disclosure, so the Legislature would be aware of such balances prior to the start of the next legislative session,” said the letter signed by Kris Kucera, assistant deputy auditor.
The Revenue Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Nebraska Examiner. 
Kamm and his staff were provided draft copies of the letter to review, but declined to respond, according to the letter.
Based on history,  the department has expected to collect about 20% of outstanding balances. 
 New program could help

Foley said the Department of Revenue did point to a new strategy: planned use of an automated data exchange process to aid the collection process.
The process was authorized by the Financial Institution Data Match Act, passed by the Nebraska Legislature and effective July 2024. It requires Nebraska financial institutions to participate in a data match program upon request by the Revenue Department. 
The department is to identify tax debtors by name and social security number or federal employer ID number to match against financial institution account records. Information may be used to pursue delinquent tax balances via bank levy or other means.
Foley noted that the Revenue Department already had authority, prior to the new law, to recoup unpaid taxes directly from the bank accounts of corporate and individual tax debtors since 2014. 
But the new law permits automation of the process to identify individual and corporate taxpayer accounts and balances, a development Foley said should “facilitate the agency’s pursuit of available tax evader funds.”

Previous state law for years has authorized the Revenue Department to use additional means to collect unpaid taxes. Those ways include: imposing property liens; seizing and selling property; contracting with collection agencies; revoking or suspending tax licenses or permits; issuing a levy on an employer or financial institution; and entering into a payment agreement.
Foley said he is surprised that the department’s collection rate on outstanding taxes has been so low.
“With all the tools they have at their disposal, you would think they’d be able to get more out of taxpayers who have income,” he said.
Foley said his office issued a previous warning. In April, it reported to the Legislature that more than $650 million in both delinquent and protested taxes due to the state remain uncollected as of  July 2024, “indicating that action may be needed to encourage more aggressive collection of those delinquent tax revenues.”
The delinquency problem rises as the state faces a $451 million projected deficit in the two-year budget cycle.
 Terminations 

Among highlights noted by the auditing team:

On June 30, 2025, the Revenue Department showed that more than $687 million was due from taxpayers, including $310,663,621 in delinquent tax balances and $376,898,769 in protested balances. (Taxpayers have a right to formally protest a notice of deficiency, and the department considers the balance due “protested” until it is resolved.)
Over the previous 10 fiscal years, dating back to 2016, the delinquent tax balances have grown from $138.9 million to the $310.6 million, an increase of about 124%.
The balance of delinquent sales and use taxes has grown in each of the last 10 fiscal years, while the balance of delinquent individual income taxes has grown in each of the last five fiscal years.

Monday’s letter noted that 385 full-time staff were employed by the Revenue Department as of July. It said that despite the increase in delinquent taxes, the department recently terminated staff involved in the collections process. 
This month, state records show the department “involuntarily terminated nine revenue agents,” the letter said.
Kamm has told reporters previously that the plan to use the automated technology would enhance operations and position the state for long-term success. 
Foley said his office doesn’t analyze the department’s management decision. But, he said, “it is curious” that staff was reduced at a time when uncollected taxes are rising.
Of the new strategy authorized by the 2024 data match law, he said, “Time will tell if that is effective.”

Legislation would create a framework for more rigorous assessment, teacher training and tailored strategies to help Wyoming’s struggling readers. “Please do not fail these children,” one grandfather said.
The post With literacy bill, Wyoming advocates and lawmakers aim to shore up students’ futures appeared first on WyoFile .","Many tears were shed inside a nondescript meeting room inside the Wyoming Capitol, where legislators gathered last week to discuss education policy.
Adolescent students cried while telling lawmakers about their own debilitating reading struggles and the subsequent anxiety and self-doubt they felt. Parents broke down describing the frustrations of watching their children advance in grades even as their reading difficulties undeniably impacted their performance. A grandfather’s voice cracked as he recounted the transformation his granddaughter made once she was finally identified as dyslexic and received appropriate help.
“Please do not fail these children,” the grandfather, John Ridley, implored lawmakers on the Legislature’s Joint Education Committee.  
Ridley joined family members, students and educators calling for the committee to advance draft legislation that would create a more robust K-12 language and literacy program in Wyoming. 
Over several hours Wednesday, the literacy advocates described in detail their own personal challenges with reading instruction in Wyoming schools. Parents talked about recognizing deep learning challenges in their children that educators assured them were no big deal. Educators spoke about how a popular method for teaching reading has been debunked in recent years and should be outlawed for the way it leaves certain students behind. And students spoke of a growing dread and anxiety around their inability to keep up in school.
Many of them talked about Paul Pine, the Cheyenne fifth grader whose story has become emblematic of how deeply literacy struggles can impact lives. Despite repeating kindergarten and receiving small-group interventions, Pine was only reading at a first-grade level by fifth grade. It wasn’t until that year that assessments determined he was likely dyslexic. By then he was distraught, and he died by suicide one day in 2023. 
“Many of you know the heartbreaking story that brought me here,” his mother, Chandel Pine, told lawmakers. She first testified to the committee in favor of literacy improvements in 2023, she noted. 
“That day, I learned something I wish I had known sooner,” she said. “We’re not alone. Only half of Wyoming’s children can read proficiently by third grade.”

Ultimately, lawmakers agreed to sponsor the bill as a committee in the 2026 Legislature. Their vote comes just weeks after Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder announced a new statewide language and literacy initiative involving stakeholders such as parents and the University of Wyoming. Together, they represent a commitment to align Wyoming’s educational system with top evidence-based methods for building student literacy. 
“This is very exciting and a huge priority, perhaps the biggest priority for me this legislative session,” Degenfelder told the lawmakers. 
A group effort 
The bill aims to ensure that every K-12 Wyoming student develops strong language and literacy skills and that struggling readers do not fall through the cracks. 
It comes as reading scores in Wyoming and nationally have ticked down in recent years. In 2024, 36% of the state’s fourth graders and 29% of eighth graders performed at or above the proficient level in reading on national standardized NAEP tests, lower than the previous five years. 
Some 32% of Wyoming fourth graders performed below basic, which was a slight increase from 29% in 2022. For eighth graders, 30% scored below basic in 2024, up one percentage point from 2022. 
Wyoming’s scores hovered above the rest of the country; the state has long ranked comparatively high in national testing. But literacy challenges still appear across the educational spectrum. 
National experts have pointed to reading instruction as one of the contributing factors. Journalist Emily Hanford’s well-known 2022 podcast “Sold a Story” exposed how educators across the country believed they were teaching a best-practice approach to reading that was later disproven. The podcast shifted how the literacy field views reading instruction. At least 26 states have passed laws about how schools teach reading since it began to air.
Wyoming could be next. The legislation resulted largely from the work of a literacy subcommittee with input and feedback from stakeholders working on the statewide initiative. 
The statewide partnership includes a range of entities — from the UW College of Education to WYO Right to Read and the Wyoming Professional Teaching Standards Board. 
“This was a group of highly educated, highly focused individuals who all came together to reflect their interests, and those interests are reflected in the document,” said Sen. Chris Rothfuss, D-Laramie, who worked on the subcommittee. “I honestly think this bill is exceptional at this point.” 
At nearly 20 pages, the bill includes many provisions. But in broad strokes, it would establish a system of instruction, intervention and professional development that is evidence-based to provide teachers, families and students with comprehensive and effective tools for teaching reading and addressing deficiencies.

That includes shoring up statewide assessments to better identify dyslexia and other learning disabilities; ensuring that every district has a written literacy strategy; triggering individualized education services for struggling readers; and mandating that no district relies solely on a debunked approach, known as a “three-cueing system,” to teach reading. 
“This bill reflects what we’ve seen in other states that have successfully implemented literacy policy,” said Nish Goicolea, chief policy officer at Wyoming Department of Education. 
Pinedale teacher Lindsay Adam told lawmakers that Wyoming schools need the resources to retrain teachers in the advanced skills it takes to identify student needs and to teach in a way that appropriately addresses them.
“We can dig ourselves out of this hole,” Adam said. “But we spent the last 30 years digging our way into it. So it’s going to take some time, and it’s going to take some money.”
‘A promise to Paul’
The Education Committee heard several hours of testimony Wednesday related to the bill, including support from parents and concerns about how the measure could have disparate impacts on Wyoming’s wide range of districts. 
When the committee closed testimony and began to work the bill, Sen. Charles Scott, R-Casper, said he didn’t think it was quite “ready for prime time.”
“I think it is headed in the right direction,” Scott said, but added, “I think it has some major deficiencies and some things that need to be fixed.”
Martha Lawley, R-Worland, who also sat on the subcommittee, cautioned against “letting the perfect get in the way of the good.” Committee chair and retired teacher Wendy Schuler, a Republican state senator from Uinta County, echoed that, and the measure carried enough votes to advance. 
During public testimony, many people talked about how Paul Pine’s mother, Chandel, had connected them with one another and to resources crucial for helping them or their students deal with reading difficulties. They have found community in the common goal, they recalled.
Indeed, after she first testified in 2023, Chandel Pine and her husband founded a nonprofit called Paul’s Mountain to help students with similar struggles of their son. Many testified to the life-changing possibilities the nonprofit has connected their families to in the two years since. 
It’s part of a vow Chandel Pine made in the wake of her son’s death. 
“After that first testimony, I made a promise to Paul, to every child like him, that his story would not end in silence,” she told the committee. 
Kim Coulter has spent a lot of time and money supplementing her daughter’s education due to a reading disability, she told lawmakers. Coulter likened reading gaps to a cracked foundation — a base of all other learning that is fundamentally compromised. 
“Having additional support in place when we recognize a cracked foundation can help support future growth in each child’s education, allowing our children to be successful learners,” Coulter said. “This bill is that support.” 
Parallel paths 
Meantime, the statewide initiative has laid out plans that also aim to bolster literacy support. Those include offering professional development to educators statewide in the “science of reading” — a body of evidence that supports things like phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency and comprehension. Wyoming’s educator preparation pathways will be expanded through a new dyslexia specialist program at UW. And a new grant will allow for Wyoming educators to earn national reading instruction certification.

The education department also secured a $24.4 million federal grant this fall to improve literacy instruction. The department will launch a competitive grant process for school districts in January to disperse these funds.

Jim Pillen announced two appointments Monday to the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission. The appointees will also serve on the Medical Cannabis Commission.
Pillen announced his appointment of Robert “Bud” Synhorst of Lincoln and James Elworth of Nebraska City as the newest members of the regulatory boards. The duo succeeds Bruce Bailey of Lincoln and Kim Lowe of Kearney, respectively, who resigned Sept. 29 at Pillen’s request.
Bailey and Lowe resigned following a federal indictment against the former executive director of the Liquor Control Commission they had worked with. Neither commissioner was implicated in the indictment alleging public corruption. The former director has pleaded not guilty.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Synhorst and Elworth will join retired District Judge J. Michael Coffey on the Liquor Control Commission, who joined the commission this summer. Coffey is a registered Democrat; the others are registered Republicans. 
Bailey, Lowe and a third commissioner not reappointed in May together brought decades of liquor industry experience to the regulatory board.
All three new appointments are subject to confirmation votes in the Nebraska Legislature in 2026 for staggered terms — Elworth to May 2027, Synhorst to May 2029 and Coffey to May 2031.
Pillen’s office immediately began accepting applications for the 1st and 3rd Congressional District seats after the resignations of Bailey and Lowe. Nearly 30 people had applied by an Oct. 17 deadline, according to a public records request.
Among other notable applicants were Craig Hubbard of Hastings, a member of his city’s planning and zoning commission; Mary Christensen of Lincoln, a palliative care nurse; Lanette Richards of Scottsbluff, executive director of Monument Prevention, which advocates for alcohol and marijuana prevention; Habib Olomi, a member of the Nebraska Board of Parole; James Smith, a former assistant attorney general for 30 years; Daniel Shukis, a retired deputy sheriff in Sarpy County; and Tom Safranek of Licoln, Nebraska’s former state epidemiologist for 31 years.
Newest state regulators
Synhorst is the owner of RobNik Strategies, a government affairs consulting firm. He is a former president and CEO of the Lincoln Independent Business Association and served on the State Board of Health between 2020 and 2024 at the appointment of former Gov. Pete Ricketts. Synhorst previously served as executive director of the Nebraska Republican Party and of the Alpaca Owners Association, which supports Alpaca breeders, fiber producers and exhibitors.
Synhorst’s experience in the liquor industry, if any, wasn’t immediately clear from his application.

Elworth retired in 2020 after 21 years with the National Collegiate Athletic Association, where he investigated, interpreted and enforced rule violations. He served as a former state assistant attorney general in the Drug and Violent Crime Unit between 1990 and 1997 and was a deputy county attorney in Lancaster County (1986-1990) and Dodge County (1983-1986). In 2008, Elworth opened a bar in Lincoln that expanded to a second location in 2012. He continues to own and operate one Grata Bar & Lounge location in Lincoln.
As references, Synhorst listed State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers and Maureen Larsen, director of the Nebraska Department of Economic Development and former general counsel for Pillen. Elworth’s list included former Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning and David Sankey, director of the State 911 Department.
Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission
Neither Synhorst nor Elworth mentioned medical cannabis in their applications, a medicine they will oversee regulations for with Coffey and two other at-large commissioners.
The Medical Cannabis Commission faces multiple legal threats, including an effort that will go before the Nebraska Supreme Court on Dec. 3 on whether the voter-led petitions were properly on the 2024 ballot. The opposition is led by former State Sen. John Kuehn of Heartwell, a former member of the State Board of Health, and the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office. 
Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong rejected arguments alleging petition fraud last year. Earlier this year, she dismissed a second Kuehn-led case trying to challenge the laws’ constitutionality, which is also being appealed to the Nebraska Supreme Court.
The Nebraska AG’s Office has threatened to separately challenge the Medical Cannabis Commission’s constitutionality. That lawsuit hasn’t yet materialized.
The Medical Cannabis Commission is finalizing rules and regulations for licensed registered cannabis establishments. Commissioners will soon consider licensing transporters, product manufacturers and dispensaries. The commission issued two cultivator licenses in October.
The Liquor Control Commission and Medical Cannabis Commission are both scheduled to meet next the first week of December, the same week as Supreme Court oral arguments in the alleged petition fraud case.

Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex) is sponsoring the bill that would require social media companies to set up 24-hour hotlines. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A bill that would require social media companies to create a 24-hotline for people to report fraudulent accounts is moving forward. 
The state Senate Commerce Committee unanimously advanced legislation that would require those companies to provide a toll-free phone number where New Jersey residents could speak with a live representative to report fraudulent activity on their accounts, like hacking. 
The Democrat-sponsored bill advanced out of the Assembly in February, largely along party lines. Sen. Jon Bramnick (R-Union) said Monday that he doesn’t see why this bill doesn’t have bipartisan support, and why social media companies would be against this. 
“I see constant fraudulent activity, and if you want to reach out to the company, how are you supposed to do it?” he said. “Some people are not that fluent or fluid with social media, and I think it’s a good bill. I’m just trying to find out why they don’t like it.” 
Companies that fail to comply with the bill would be subject to hefty penalties under the state Consumer Fraud Act. Social media companies would face up to $10,000 for a first offense and $20,000 for any subsequent offenses. A violation could also lead to a cease and desist order issued by the attorney general, according to the bill. 
Phone numbers would be included on any email notifications sent to accounts in New Jersey, and would also be required to show up on the platform’s main feed or help page. Some free hotlines exist for people to report hacking, but most social media companies make users file an online report. Meta and X, formerly known as Twitter, did not respond to a request for comment on the legislation. 
In a statement, bill sponsor Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex) said the measure ensures social media users connect to a real person who can solve their issue quickly. 
“Too many New Jersey residents fall victim to fraud on social media platforms, just to be told that their only recourse is through automated messages or unresponsive help centers,” he said. “With Americans losing over $1.4 billion through social media scams in 2023 alone, it is clear that better resources are necessary.”

But they will have to wait a while for the decision to begin paying dividends.
Nearly 58% of voters approved Senate Joint Resolution 8201 amending the state constitution to end restrictions on the types of investments that can be made with dollars flowing into the WA Cares fund. 
The state constitution generally bars investing public money in the stock of private companies, limiting state and local governments to fixed-income securities like government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit that are less risky but typically deliver lower rates of return. The WA Cares account has been subject to this limitation.
Once the results of the Nov. 4 election are certified, the Washington State Investment Board will be legally able to handle the program’s assets in a similar manner as it does pension and retirement funds. The WA Cares fund had a balance of $2.9 billion on Sept. 30.
Changes won’t occur immediately, members of the Long Term Services and Supports Trust Commission learned at their most recent meeting.
The state investment board will first hire a consultant to study how to incorporate public equity investments into the allocation of assets of the Long Term Services and Trust Account.
Completion of the study is expected next fall. Any recommendations for rebalancing the allocation of those assets will be considered by the board and, if approved, implemented, Assistant Senior Investment Officer Kristi Bromley told committee members. 
Passage of the measure is another milestone for the long-term care program created in law in 2019.
WA Cares is funded with a 0.58% tax on the paychecks of most workers in Washington. Collections began in mid-2023. Beginning in July 2026, those who qualify can begin accessing the benefit, a lifetime amount of $36,500 — a sum that is set to rise in future years to account for inflation. A pilot program will start in January in a handful of counties.
Supporters of the measure argued investing in the stock market could lead to larger returns, helping keep payroll taxes from rising too high and the program solvent.
The state investment board uses a long-term, diversified investment strategy. There is a 7.25% return assumed on dollars invested through the state’s pension accounts, a level set by the Pension Funding Council.
Opponents argued it would be “financial roulette” and a breach of the state’s fiduciary responsibility because it would put taxpayer dollars at risk should the economy or market crash. They argued investing in municipal bonds may earn less, but it provides a broad public benefit by helping local governments carry out projects.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/long-term-care-hospital-wheelchair-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-17 18:58:09.642628

They hope the scope of that audit goes beyond just the state's ""error rate.""","GOP lawmakers are calling on the Legislative Finance Committee to look into SNAP fraud with the help of $50,000 they secured for an audit during the special legislative session last week. (Daniel Montaño/KUNM)Republican lawmakers in the New Mexico Legislature are urging state officials to expand the scope of an audit into the state’s food assistance program with the help of $50,000 they secured during the recent second special session.
State legislators approved $162.5 million during the Nov. 10 session to pay for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits through January that were threatened amid the federal government shutdown. During negotiations, Democrats in the majority agreed to accept a Republican amendment that allocated an additional $50,000 to conduct an audit of New Mexico SNAP allocations. 
Republicans said the audit is necessary, in large part, due to the state’s high SNAP “error rate,” which is a calculation of the state’s over- or underpayments to recipients. At 14.6%, New Mexico  has among the highest such rates in the country, according to federal officials.
The high rate poses potentially huge consequences for the state. The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” spending bill contains provisions requiring states with high rates to use their own funding to pay administrative costs.
New Mexico Legislature passes, acting governor signs $162.5M to cover SNAP payments if needed

States with rates above 10% incur the highest penalty, which amounts to about $173 million, according to a recent presentation from the Legislative Finance Committee. Under the law, the state has until October 2028 to bring the rate down, state officials said.
But Republicans said Friday that they hope the LFC, which is conducting the audit, expands its scope beyond systematic, state-level errors in SNAP administration and also examines fraud. Democrats noted during the session that the error rate does not include estimates of fraud, which is a crime. 
Health Care Authority Kari Armijo affirmed that in testimony during the session, as well.
“Some of [the error rate] is caused by the agency. Some of it is caused by customers that didn’t report accurate information,” she said. “So it’s not really necessarily an indicator of fraud or any other kind of abuse.”
New Mexico will supply $30M in emergency funding for food assistance

In a statement Friday afternoon, Sen. Crystal Brantley (R-Elephant Butte) cited recent criminal allegations against a Sierra County man accused of selling SNAP benefits in exchange for fentanyl. 
“The families in my district—and across our entire state—deserve to know that every SNAP dollar is going where it’s intended: to feed people in need, not to fuel the fentanyl crisis,” she said.
Also on Friday, Republicans in both chambers issued a statement touting the audit funding and asking LFC Director Charles Sallee to use the funding to strengthen eligibility checks; fight Electronic Benefit Transfer card fraud; block payments to undocumented immigrants; and improve food nutrition standards, along with tackling the error rate.
Republican leaders in both chambers wrote to Sallee on Friday and said they are “strongly supportive” of the review. 
“The findings and recommendations contained in the review’s final report will likely provide a pathway towards long overdue reforms and improvements,” they wrote. 
Helen Gaussoin, a spokesperson for the LFC, told Source in an email Monday that LFC staff “always consider legislator suggestions” on program evaluations.
“We will do that in this case, as well,” she said. “We are still in the process of building the scope for the SNAP review so we don’t know yet how an examination of fraud will fit in.”
Under the Republican amendment, the LFC must present legislative leaders with preliminary findings about the review by Jan. 20 when the 30-day legislative session begins, and issue a final report on or before July 1.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/download-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-17 16:57:40.587874

(Screenshot from Facebook.)The hemp industry in North Carolina has a surprising new face: former Democratic Gov. Bev Perdue.
Perdue is one of many political figures in the state connected to the state’s emerging hemp industry since its legalization through the 2018 Farm Bill. Across the aisle, state Rep. John Bell (R-Wayne), the powerful chairman of the House Rules committee and former House Majority Leader, became president of hemp company Asterra Labs in 2024. Bell has not responded to multiple requests for comment from NC Newsline.

Naternal, a Morrisville-based company founded by Perdue’s son Garrett Perdue, sells hemp-derived CBD drops, gummies, seltzers, and creams. He is the CEO of its parent company, Root Biosciences, which he co-founded just as hemp products became legal nationwide.
A recent ad for the company’s $55 Lift gummies features Garrett Perdue and the former governor herself, smiling at her son’s side on their way to Cirque du Soleil. “My mom turns every errand into an adventure,” he wrote in the Nov. 7 Facebook post. The video features photos of Bev Perdue taking the oath of office and standing beside former President Barack Obama.
“If you were spending the day with her, you would eat a gummy,” Garrett Perdue says in the ad. “You want one, mom?”
“No, thank you, it’s before my breakfast,” she replies, grinning. “I’ll have one at lunch.”
Naternal did not respond to an inquiry about the former governor’s role in the company.
The many political figures who have stakes in the future of the hemp industry in North Carolina and nationwide could complicate a new ban on most recreational hemp products in November 2026, a measure that was attached to the bipartisan agreement to fund the government that ended the federal shutdown.
Opponents of hemp supplements say the products carry many of the same risks as marijuana. They point to a sharp rise in cannabis-related emergency room visits since the legalization of recreational CBD products, which are currently not age-restricted in North Carolina.

Most of the products sold by Naternal are set to become illegal under the ban, which restricts the sale of any hemp products containing more than 0.4 milligrams of THC per container. The Lift gummies in the ad contain roughly 90 milligrams per container, well above the new threshold. Only two of the company’s products are advertised as THC-free.
The “Our Story” page of Naternal’s website credits Bev Perdue as “the compass we needed,” describing how Garrett Perdue first became interested in hemp supplements to help his daughter’s childhood insomnia. Though the former governor put him in touch with top researchers at UNC, Duke, and Harvard Medical School, none could solve her granddaughter’s sleep issues, the website claims.
A hemp extract finally helped her get her to sleep again — a result that led Bev Perdue to ask her son to “send me everything you know about hemp,” according to the site.
“Sometimes the right solutions come from the most unexpected places,” she says in a quote beside her official gubernatorial portrait on Naternal’s website.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bev-Perdue-Ad-e1763411924859-1024x682.png,,,2025-11-17 16:57:40.587874

The character that drove his long career was forged in the fires of war on a Pacific island 80 years ago.
In December 2019, I and my colleague Bob Neymeyer, a state-renowned historian for Waterloo’s Grout Museum District, interviewed Bill at his rural Van Meter home about his World War II experience for the Grout’s Sullivan Brothers Iowa Veterans Museum, as part of the museum’s “Voices of Iowa” oral history project.
A five-minute clip of excerpts from that interview are in the video below.



Bill piloted a U.S. Navy landing craft at the Battle of Okinawa, one of the final and most devastating battles of World War II, fought from April 1 to June 21, 1945. It resulted in a total of nearly 300,000 killed or wounded on both sides including Okinawan civilians.
“You don’t know how devastating war is unless you’re there,” he said. “It was either kill or be dead.”
It was an experience which shaped the rest of Bill’s life as entrepreneur, builder and philanthropist.

We were afforded the opportunity to interview Bill through a seemingly unlikely connection: Jeff Lamberti, the former Iowa Senate president and former chairman of the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission, more recently president and owner of the Iowa Barnstormers arena football team.
Jeff Lamberti (Photo courtesy of the Iowa General Assembly)
Lamberti is a Republican. Knapp was a Democrat, a longtime supporter of Democratic candidates and a friend and confidante of Iowa Gov. and U.S. Sen. Harold Hughes, a Democrat and one of the towering figures in Iowa government and politics.
However, Lamberti and Knapp saw eye to eye on many things when it came to projects of lasting benefit to Des Moines and the state. One of those things was preserving the history of the service and sacrifice of Iowans in our nation’s armed forces in the cause of liberty.
Lamberti was instrumental in raising funds to preserve our state’s namesake battleship, the USS Iowa BB-61, as a museum ship, helping secure a state appropriation of $3.5 million for that purpose. It is docked at the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, Calif., and is one of the most popular tourism attractions in the Los Angeles area. Because of the state’s support of the ship’s renovation, Iowans can tour it for free by showing an Iowa driver’s license or state identification.
When the Grout Museum District added a permanent USS Iowa exhibit to the Sullivan Brothers Iowa Veterans Museum, Lamberti put Grout staff in touch with staff at the Battleship Iowa Museum in San Pedro to provide advice and assistance.
And he took the additional step of helping make connections for an interview with Knapp — a valued addition to our collection of 2,300 oral histories of Iowa veterans and others. More information on the Voices of Iowa oral history project may be obtained at the link here.
Bill and his wife, Susan, were gracious hosts during our visit. Bill showed us his weight room on the lower level of his home. In it was a large photo of another legend — country singer-songwriter Willie Nelson.
“Oh, you like Willie, Bill?” I asked.
“Yeah, he was here for my birthday,” Knapp said.
Indeed, it did happen — in 2001, a shared birthday party with former Des Moines Register chief executive officer David Kruidenier.,
So when my adult daughter and son took me to see Willie, now also in his 90s, at Des Moines Water Works Park’s Lauridsen Amphitheater on Memorial Day weekend 2024 as an early Father’s Day/birthday present, I wondered if Willie kept coming back to Iowa at least partly because of Bill Knapp. I’d like to think so.
I also thought of Bill when my daughter and I attended an appearance by Kai Ryssdal, host of the syndicated public radio show “Marketplace,” at Drake University’s Knapp Center, as we did former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, both part of Drake’s Bucksbaum Distinguished Lecture Series. Both events were in the “House that Bill Built,”
I also recalled that, many years earlier, the Knapp Center was one of the venues where surviving Korean War veterans received medals of appreciation from the South Korean government, an event organized by the late Sid Morris of Cedar Falls, the head of an Iowa Korean War veterans chapter who passed away in 2021.
That would fit with another of Bill’s passions: to honor veterans.

Bill said his war experience was “a real eye opener about what life was like, what it could be — how bad it could be — and the price that’s paid for our freedom.
“You can never give them enough thanks,” Bill said of veterans.
It’s why he donated land for what is now the Iowa Veterans Cemetery, a beautiful vista overlooking Interstate 80 near Adel and Van Meter.
It’s where my uncle, like Bill a veteran of World War II in the Pacific, was laid rest last year.
And it’s where Bill will be laid to rest, on Friday, Nov. 21.
Bill said his war experience shaped his life and career because it taught him how precious life is, and that “you better live every day like it’s your last.”
Bill Knapp’s last day has passed. But his legacy will live on. Because he lived his life exactly that way — for today, but with an eye on the future, He gave his community, his state and his country his last full measure of devotion — including and especially his brothers and sisters in arms.
He’ll be laid to rest with a whole lot of them, including my uncle.
And I know that I, as a fellow Iowan but also now a very personal level, can’t thank him enough.



Current and former state officials mourn Knapp
Sitting and former Iowa public officials mourned Bill Knapp’s passing Saturday, remembering the businessman and philanthropist for his contributions to Des Moines and the state. Knapp had long been a major player in Iowa politics, supporting Democratic candidates.
Former Democratic Gov. Chet Culver said Knapp will be “sorely missed but his legacy and impact on our capital city and state will live on forever.”
“William C. Knapp did it all with style, grace and a smile on his face. He was an Iowa icon, favorite son, humble veteran, proud patriarch, avid sports fan and cherished friend,” Culver said in a statement. “… As a trailblazing entrepreneur, real estate pioneer, visionary business leader and generous philanthropist, he personified the very best of Iowa values; love of family and friends, relentless determination, remarkable work ethic and selfless service to others.”
Former Sen. Tom Harkin, alongside his wife Ruth Harkin, said in a statement Saturday Knapp was an “an inspiration for a successful and meaningful life.”
“For most of our adult lives, Bill Knapp was a close personal friend, advisor, and sounding board in both our political and personal lives,” the Harkins said. “Bill was a committed patriot, devoted to his family, friends, community, and nation.”
Condolences also came from Republicans including former Gov. Terry Branstad, who also served as U.S. ambassador to China during President Donald Trump’s first administration. Branstad said in a statement while he and Knapp “were not in the same political party, we eventually became friends, meeting on a regular basis.”
“He always joked that he spent more of his personal money trying to defeat me but he laughed that over time, we gained mutual respect, working together on many Iowa economic development issues so in the end, Bill contributed to my last political campaign,” Branstad said. “Bill was unpredictable but as genuine! He will be missed by all.”
Gov. Kim Reynolds offered her prayers and sympathy to Knapp’s family and gratitude for his legacy, “which will endure for generations,” she said in a statement.
“The city of Des Moines is what it is today thanks to the vision of Bill Knapp, but his impact extends far beyond,” Reynolds said. “A generous philanthropist, WWII veteran, devoted family man, and friend to many, Bill lived his life in service to his country, his community, and his fellow Iowans.”
Knapp’s family will host a visitation from 4 to 7 p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 19 at Iles Dunn’s Chapel in Des Moines, and his funeral service is set to take place 10 a.m. Thursday at Plymouth Church. His committal service with full military honors will be held Friday at 11 a.m. at the Iowa Veterans Cemetery in Van Meter.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Former state Attorney General and conservative state Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel has been appointed as the interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. 
Schimel, who was also previously a Waukesha County Circuit Court judge and the Waukesha County district attorney, will now be the highest ranking federal prosecutor in the district that covers the eastern part of the state, including Milwaukee. 
Usually, U.S. attorneys are first recommended for the office by the two U.S. senators in a state and then nominated by the president before being confirmed by the Senate. In Wisconsin, Sens. Tammy Baldwin and Ron Johnson operate a joint commission responsible for finding candidates. 
Schimel told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that the commission was unable to reach a consensus for the job — which has been empty since February when former U.S. attorney Gregory Haanstad, a Biden appointee, left the role as part of the normal transition when a new party enters the White House. 
Once the commission failed to find a candidate, Schimel said he reached out to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, whom he knows from their time as state attorneys general. 
Interim U.S. Attorneys are allowed to hold that role for 120 days, though the Trump administration has tried in other states to extend that period. 
Schimel will now take over the office as it manages increased federal immigration enforcement happening in the state and heads into the highly political trial of Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan, who federal prosecutors have alleged obstructed the work of federal agents attempting to apprehend a migrant in the county courthouse. Dugan’s trial is set for Dec. 15, Schimel told the Journal-Sentinel the prosecution team on the case will remain the same. 
Schimel ran for the state Supreme Court earlier this year in what became the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history — largely due to the involvement of Elon Musk, who was at the time a part of the Trump administration through his DOGE office. 
Schimel lost by more than 10 percentage points to Justice Susan Crawford. In his campaign, he touted his prosecutorial experience but was unable to separate himself from criticism that he was too closely tied to Trump and Musk.

Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, called the legislature back to pass a bill funding the low-income health care program, which the administration says faces a $319 million budget shortfall this fiscal year. But Republicans refused to convene Monday, calling it a “manufactured” crisis and arguing that the program has enough money to pay bills into next year without rate cuts.
A group of Democrats, including both chamber leaders, returned to the building anyway — gathering on the floor of the House to blast House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) and Senate Leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) for failing to reach an agreement.
“We’ve got providers that are trying to figure out how they’re going to keep their doors open during Christmas,” House Democratic Leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) told reporters. “Yet we’ve got folks that will not sit down and have a conversation about passing a budget for North Carolina, like 49 other states have done.”
North Carolina cut payments to providers under the low-income health care program from 3-10% on Oct. 1. State Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai has said the cuts are necessary because of the budget gap.
GOP leaders in the House and Senate have been unable to agree on a bill to fund the program, though both have agreed on the need for money and passed separate bills. Senate Republicans have included money for a children’s hospital in their version; House Republicans have opted for a version that does not include that line item.
“They’re allowing two petulant children who are running both chambers to have infighting that ends up with no budget in this state,” Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) said of Republicans in the General Assembly.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Hall called the press conference “another attempt by Democrats to play politics with people’s health care.”
“Here’s the truth: Gov. Stein’s Medicaid cuts are politically motivated and unnecessary, the NC House has already passed three clean bills to fund the rebase long-term, and Medicaid is fully funded through April 2026 thanks to NCGA appropriations,” spokesperson Demi Dowdy said. “It’s time for Gov. Stein to stop playing politics and end all rate cuts, given that the General Assembly will add more funding in due course.”
Berger’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Stein’s administration has said that they cannot continue pledging full payments as long as full funding is not guaranteed by the legislature. The timeline on a potential deal remains unclear: lawmakers are scheduled to return for a mid-December session, but both the House and Senate have said they are done with votes for the calendar year.
NC Sen. Natalie Murdock (D-Durham), left, and Stephanie Molina, owner of KM Pediatric Therapy, talk after a roundtable discussion about how Medicaid rate cuts will leave children without needed speech and occupational therapy.
Provider with Medicaid patients: ‘I have been crying on the daily about this’
Earlier Monday, Sen. Natalie Murdock (D-Durham) invited speech and occupational therapists to the legislative building to discuss the impacts of Medicaid rate cuts.
Stephanie Molina, a speech language pathologist, shed tears as she described what cuts were doing to her business. She said it hurts children who most need the therapy, including those with autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy and other genetic conditions.
“These are not elective therapies,” Molina said. “These are critical therapies that are teaching life skills that will not develop naturally because the children have underlying medical conditions they did not ask for.”
Molina said she and other health care providers spoke to lawmakers in late October about funding Medicaid.
“While people met with us and shook our hands, and took pictures with us, and said they understood and they were on our side, instead of discussing this topic and voting on it, they chose instead to discuss and vote on the redistricting maps,” she said.
“I have been crying on the daily about this for months,” she added. “Now I’m pissed off, knowing they have the money.”

Gov. Kelly Armstrong announced the 12-member council to be chaired by a member of the North Dakota Housing Finance Agency that will work to develop strategies for preventing homelessness. 
“While North Dakota already has a strong network of support services and programs for those experiencing homelessness, we still have individuals falling through the cracks,” Armstrong said in a statement.
The Interagency Council on Homelessness will make annual reports to the governor and state lawmakers on its progress. The report will also include recommendations for executive and legislative actions.
From October 2024 through September 2025, North Dakota had 3,835 people who were experiencing homelessness, an increase of about 100 people over the previous year, according to the North Dakota Homeless Information System. Of those, more than 2,400 required emergency shelter.
Brandon Dettlaff, executive director of the North Dakota Housing Finance Agency, said the council will be chaired by Jennifer Henderson, director of community housing and grants management at the agency, because of her direct involvement with homeless service providers in the state.
He said the Legislature allocated the agency $10 million to address homelessness during the biennium, but half has already been spent this year. Dettlaff said he’s confident the group can find ways to prevent homelessness.
“What’s the alternative? It’s to do nothing, and it just keeps getting worse,” Dettlaff said. ”When it comes down to it, it’s a housing issue. It’s a lack of housing.”
The council will look at what programs and funding are available across state agencies to make an impact during the interim, Dettlaff said. He said he hopes the council will present lawmakers with proven programs to fund during the 2027 legislative session.




Members of the Interagency Council on Homelessness are:

Jennifer Henderson, chair, director of community housing and grants management at North Dakota Housing Finance Agency
Jonathan Holth, commissioner of recovery and reentry, vice chair
Brad Hawk, executive director of the North Dakota Indian Affairs Commission

Those electing the delegates were “We the People of Montana” who then ratified our Constitution, creating a government by which ee govern ourselves through elections.  We hold the power of government by electing officials to represent us and serve our interests. 
We are not the subjects of our state government – we are more like owners.  It’s our government.  Those we elect are our public servants.    
One of my primary interests as a delegate was insuring government transparency. Our 1889 Constitution did not require “transparency.”  Before the 1972 Constitution, We had no idea how our elected officials were performing their duties.   
Our 1972 Constitution changed that.  
Before 1972, voting by legislative committees was closed to the public – committee votes were not recorded. Legislative votes during floor sessions (except for Third Reading) were also not recorded.  We could not tell how any legislator really voted.
Our 1972 Constitution requires all sessions of the legislature to be open to the public.  Every vote of every legislator on any substantive question must be publicly recorded.  That’s fifty-three years of public scrutiny.  We now have a report card – a voting record – on what legislators do.  Legislative records are open and honest to our voter/citizens. 
Our Bill of Rights requires openness from all agencies of state and local government.  Our “right of participation” requires governmental agencies at all levels to provide a reasonable opportunity for citizens’ participation in the operations of agencies prior to final decisions, including submitting their views at public hearings.  
Also in our Bill of Rights is the citizens’ “right to know” – designed to open government. The right to know is a self-executing constitutional provision that is immediately effective without implementing legislation. The right to know provides that no person be deprived of the right to examine documents or observe the deliberations of public bodies or agencies of government except in when demands of individual privacy clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure.     
Subject to that privacy exception, our Constitution intends that the deliberation and resolution of all public matters be subject to public scrutiny and awareness – that “We the People” are given every reasonable opportunity to comment or otherwise participate before any final governmental decision is made.
Montana government is our government. The right to participate in it and know “who is doing what” can be accomplished by individual citizens utilizing these tools of transparency set forth in our Constitution.  It is my belief that “We the People” have an inherent duty to utilize these tools, given to us in our Constitution, to keep our government open.  Public trust in our government will come from knowing that government affairs are conducted in public view.  Respect for our government will only occur when the activities of government are visible.  Government operates most effectively, most reliably, and is most accountable when it is subject to public scrutiny.  Mischief is a close companion of secrecy.
I believe that when Montana’s Constitutional Convention delegates proposed the openness and transparency provisions of our Constitution we deemed transparency essential to a democratic republic – that the deliberation and resolution of all public matters be subject to public scrutiny and participation. “We the People” must use the tools of transparency to ensure the concept of ordered liberty encapsulated in our founding documents remain.  After all, we were warned at a national level more than two centuries ago that “the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.”

Janet Mills is asking the federal government to rescind new guidance that could put more than 1,200 Mainers at risk of losing their housing. 
Last week, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced it would cap funding for states to house people who were previously homeless. Under that new directive, Maine will receive less than $7 million next year for Continuum of Care programs, which is a steep drop from the current $20.5 million allocation.
This is a marked change in the federal approach to homelessness, shifting money from programs that have successfully kept people in stable housing to already overwhelmed short-term shelters and time-limited transitional housing.
“Donald Trump has never had to worry about where he sleeps at night,” Mills said at a press conference Monday. “I will not stand idly by as the president hurts Maine people. I call on the Trump administration to rescind this needless, misguided directive.”
Programs that rely on Continuum of Care funding support stable housing for more than 1,800 people in more than 100 communities throughout the state. This includes families with children, seniors, veterans, people with disabilities and survivors of domestic violence, according to a news release from the governor’s office. 
What to know about housing first and what it will look like in Maine

Nearly seven in 10 of those people could lose their housing and become homeless under the new funding cap. Nationally, critics fear the changes could put more than 170,000 people who used to be homeless back on the streets.
Erin Kelly, senior director of social work at Preble Street, said the changes will not only increase the number of people who are unsheltered and living outside but could also increase demands on emergency services such as police and hospitals. Preble Street operates four shelters in Portland, Bangor and numerous housing programs. 
The changes from HUD target the “Housing First” approach to chronic homelessness, which  prioritizes getting someone into stable housing and then addressing substance use disorders, mental health conditions or whatever else may be contributing to their living on the street. 
In 2023, Mills signed a budget that included housing first funding, making it one of the few states at the time to invest in the model.
The Trump administration is arguing it is a failed approach and encourages dependence on the government rather than addressing the root causes of homelessness. 
“Our philosophy for addressing the homelessness crisis will now define success not by dollars spent or housing units filled, but by how many people achieve long-term self-sufficiency and recovery,” said HUD Secretary Scott Turner. 
Maine’s largest Continuum of Care program provides housing vouchers to nearly 1,300 people with disabilities and their families. Administered by the state Department of Health and Human Services, the program also connects residents to treatment for substance use and mental health disorders. Under the new guidance, two-thirds of recipients may no longer be served by that program.
There may also be cuts to services that prevent youth homelessness, support survivors of human trafficking and help people who are newly homeless return to stable housing.
“These programs benefit our communities and help keep people in stable housing and out of our jails and emergency rooms,” said Dean Klein, executive director of the Maine Continuum of Care. “Changing them so drastically without any exit ramp for the many people across our state who rely on them is not just shortsighted, it is cruel.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/homeless-bedding-biddeford-scaled-e1763410957137-1024x736.jpg,,,2025-11-17 15:56:42.614403

And it's much more local. And they'll develop a system. And I think it will be a great system.”The FEMA Review Council’s report is supposed to include an “assessment of the adequacy of FEMA's response to disasters during the previous 4 years,”“comparison of the FEMA responses with State, local, and private sector responses” and “analysis of the principal arguments in the public debate for and against FEMA reform, including an appraisal of the merits and legality of particular reform proposals,” among several other elements. FEMA action underway in CongressAny major changes to FEMA would likely need to move through Congress before they could take effect. But a bipartisan group of lawmakers hasn’t waited for the review council’s suggestions to get started. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee voted 57-3 in September to send a bill to the floor that would make significant changes to FEMA, including making it a Cabinet-level agency. House GOP leaders have yet to schedule the legislation for a vote.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025)The U.S. Department of Agriculture is launching the second round of relief funding for farmers who suffered losses from natural disasters in 2023 and 2024, USDA officials announced Monday.
Tennessee farmers faced multiple disasters in this time frame, including Hurricane Helene in September 2024 and multiple instances of severe storms and tornadoes from March 2023 through May 2024. Additionally, out of Tennessee’s 95 counties, 78 are eligible for relief for drought conditions in 2023 and 2024, according to the USDA. 
While stage one funding covered mostly major commodity crop producers, stage two funding of the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program covers losses for eligible crop, tree, bush and vine producers whose losses were not covered by insurance, or who lost money due to diminished crop quality. For the first time in USDA disaster assistance history, according to Under Secretary for Farm Production and Conservation Richard Fordyce, the funding will also cover “shallow losses.”
“If a producer suffered a loss that did not exceed their crop insurance deductible, they will now be indemnified for their loss and receive the same crop insurance premium and fee refund as producers did (in the first round),” Fordyce said during a Monday news briefing. “This addresses a clear gap in previous disaster assistance programs.”
Congress set aside roughly $16 billion for both rounds of the aid program. The USDA has paid more than $5.7 billion to about 381,000 producers nationwide to date. The department has paid 3,398 Tennessee producers a combined total of $64.4 million in first-round funds.
The application period for stage two funding begins on Nov. 24. Applications for both stages of funding will remain open through April 30, 2026.
To participate, producers must obtain either federal crop insurance or Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program coverage of at least 60% for two years.
Payments to eligible applicants will be limited to $125,000 per calendar year, or $250,000 per calendar year if at least 75% of the applicant’s adjusted gross income is derived from farming, ranching or forestry activities. Producers that grow high value or specialty crops — including trees, bushes, vines, aquaculture, hemp, grass for seed, tobacco and vegetable seed — can receive up to $900,000 per calendar year if crop production accounts for at least 75% of their adjusted gross income.
Producers may be eligible for payments from both stages, depending on their losses.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Stephen A. Vaden said Monday there will not be additional funding stages for the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program. If funds remain after applications close and money is distributed, the department will adjust its payment factor for those who submitted claims until the funding is exhausted.
“There will be no progressive factoring,” Fordyce said. “Hurricanes, derechos, and wildfires do not bias producers based on their race or ethnicity, so the assistance provided by USDA should not either.”
The department also announced enrollment for a Milk Loss Program that will provide up to $1.65 million to dairy operations that were forced to dump milk due to power losses or logistics delays caused by disasters. Additionally, the On-Farm Stored Commodity Loss Program will provide up to $5 million for producers who lost harvested commodity crops that were stored on farm property due to disasters. Applications for these programs also open on Nov. 24, and will close Jan. 23, 2026.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TENNESSEE-FLOODING019-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-17 15:56:42.614403

“We have to address the quality of public education in public schools,” Pack said. “And one way we can do that is with competitive teacher salaries. We want the best public schools, better outcomes, and phenomenal teachers. We have to pay them a competitive salary.”
Pack said he wants the teacher pay raises to be in effect by July 2026. He’d like the proposed raises to mimic a program that Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders did in Arkansas. 
“It’s really worked well for them,” Pack said. “They showed the lead on how to do that, how to invest in public education and put that money back in the classroom, put it in the pockets of our teachers. We really need to get this done. We need to get it done quick.”
West Virginia has the lowest teacher pay in the country. State workers — including teachers — saw modest pay raises under Gov. Jim Justice. Gov. Patrick Morrisey called for teacher pay raises during his first state of the state address. State lawmakers last year rejected a bill that would have tied teacher pay to the home values in the counties where they live. 
Teacher pay raises were one of four legislative priorities for 2026 that Pack announced at a news conference on Monday.
Pack said he would also ask state lawmakers not to change a law that will open up the state’s school voucher program to more families during the 2026-2027 school year. Unless lawmakers change the program, all families in the state will be eligible for the Hope Scholarship during the 2026 school year. The program provides about $5,000 per student to families who enroll their student in private schools or teach them at home. 
“We believe it is crucial that the Legislature and the governor resist any temptation to roll back universal eligibility,” Pack said. 
According to estimates by Pack’s office, the Hope Scholarship will need around $245 million for the next year. Currently, the program is open to students enrolling in kindergarten, those who have been enrolled in a state public school for the year previous to when they’re seeking the scholarship and those enrolled in a public school for at least 45 calendar days at the time they apply. 
“I know that many debate the cost benefit of the program, but the reality is that Hope is truly changing lives in the Mountain State,” Pack said. “We will continue to fight for those who utilize the program and advocate for education as a whole. Moving forward here today, I’m vowing to work against any effort to limit access to the program.”
No tax on overtime, tips
Pack said he would again push for the state to follow President Donald Trump’s lead and eliminate its income tax on tips and overtime. In October, Pack called on Morrisey to call a special legislative session to eliminate the taxes. 
Pack called eliminating tips and overtax time a “workers’ tax cut.”
“We have done a lot of state tax cuts in West Virginia for big business people, but these are for workers,” he said. “These are for nurses. These are for waitresses. These are for the guys and gals working on construction projects.”
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed into law this summer, cut federal taxes on tips and overtime. According to the IRS, workers of certain occupations can deduct tips up to $25,000 annually during tax years 2025 through 2028.
Workers who receive overtime pay may also deduct the pay that exceeds their regular rate of pay — for example, the “half” in “time and a half” pay, up to $12,500 annually or $25,000 for joint filers. 
Policy analysts say the tax cuts are popular, but few benefit from them. About 3% of households will benefit from the deduction for tipped income in 2026, according to the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. 
About 9% of workers will pay on average $1,400 less on their overtime as well, according to the Tax Policy Center. 
Pack said he would also prioritize:

Increasing local control of schools by loosening timelines and requirements for reduction in force (RIF) and transfer of personnel and greater autonomy on how the state portion of the school aid formula can be spent
A bill that aims to protect the rightful owners’ unclaimed property benefits and prevent increased predatory practices by out of state companies that try to take advantage of West Virginia citizens
A constitutional amendment that limits anyone in the roles of secretary of state, auditor, state treasurer, commissioner of agriculture, or attorney general to three consecutive terms 

The regular session of the West Virginia Legilsature is scheduled to begin Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Trump administration lawyers asked a federal judge to allow their challenge to sanctuary policies in four New Jersey cities to continue, arguing they are preempted by federal law.
The filing is the latest salvo in the federal government’s push to force local and state authorities to aid the enforcement of civil immigration laws by asking courts to strike policies that limit voluntary assistance and information sharing by local and state law enforcement.
“Defendants’ sanctuary policies, whatever the intention behind their passage, afford ‘sanctuary’ to criminal illegal aliens, allowing them to evade federal law enforcement and remain in our communities, where they endanger the safety and security of all people, including American citizens,” government attorneys said in their filing. “These sanctuary policies are illegal and must be enjoined.”
Attorneys for the cities have said the court should uphold their policies, as a federal appeals court did in a 2021 decision affirming an earlier ruling that upheld the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive, a statewide policy that limits voluntary cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
Hoboken, Newark,  Jersey City and Paterson in legal briefs have said the Trump administration’s suit mirrors that case, adding local governments had the authority to determine how much their workers would comply with voluntary federal government programs.
The cities have asked the court to dismiss the administration’s suit based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing the federal government could not establish that it had been harmed by the cities’ policies in the face of a statewide directive limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
They argue striking the cities’ sanctuary policies would not bring the federal government any relief while the statewide directive remains in place.
“Even if this court enjoined the city’s policy, Paterson would still be bound by the New Jersey attorney general’s Immigrant Trust Directive, which applies uniformly statewide and has already been upheld as lawful and constitutional,” attorneys for Paterson wrote in a brief last month.
Administration attorneys argued the city policies imposed greater limits than their statewide counterpart, which they say was wrongly upheld. They argue local rules barred officials from complying with any request from ICE to hold individuals so they may be taken into federal custody.
The Immigrant Trust Directive bars officials from acceding to detainer requests unless the person immigration authorities are seeking custody of has been charged or convicted of a serious violent offense, like any first or second degree crime, domestic violence assaults, or arson, among others.
The directive also allows officials to accept detainers for persons who have been convicted of an indictable offense in the last five years, or are subject to a removal order signed by a federal judge.
“In other words, while the [Immigrant Trust Directive] sets a ‘ceiling’ on the ability of officers in New Jersey to assist in immigration enforcement … defendants’ sanctuary policies lower that ceiling,” administration lawyers said in the filing.
But compliance with ICE detainers is wholly voluntary, and the federal government cannot require state or local governments to enforce them under existing federal law.
There are still limits within the cities’ policies. Newark’s sanctuary order, for example, permits the city to accede to detainers accompanied by a warrant issued by a judge.
The Trump administration argued local rules requiring cooperation with judicial warrants but not with administrative warrants issued by ICE impeded the agency’s authority and improperly regulated the United States government.
The cities have said their policies do not obstruct the federal government and instead just prevent the city from expending its own resources on the federal government’s immigration enforcement. They regulate local officials and not the federal government, the cities have argued.
“There is no imposition on the federal government; no tax or regulation, the Jersey City defendants simply are following state law and setting forth limits on its voluntary cooperation with the government,” attorneys for Jersey City said in their motion to dismiss.
State and local governments are not required to enforce administrative warrants, which unlike judicial warrants, do not allow officials entry into private areas.
The Trump administration says the local policies barred information sharing regarding individuals’ citizenship or immigration status that is required under federal law.
“Defendants have not explained how the power they seek—prohibiting information sharing — is reserved to the states,” administration attorneys said in their brief.
It’s not clear the cities’ policies run afoul of those laws.
Policies in Newark, Jersey City, and Hoboken, bars officials from retaining or sharing personal or contact information except where required by law or court order.
Paterson’s policy, like Jersey City’s and Hoboken’s, explicitly allows information sharing under the statutes cited in the federal government’s briefs. The policies also bar officials from asking individuals about their immigration or citizenship status.
District Court Judge Evelyn Padin is set to rule on the motions to dismiss based purely on the briefs and will not hold oral arguments on whether the case should be allowed to continue.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/0JS13415_1-1024x697.jpg,,,2025-11-17 15:56:42.614403
,Michigan Advance,2025-11-17 20:06:51+00:00,Michigan Advance,Michigan districts sue state for tying school safety and mental health funding to privilege waiver,Katherine Dailey,,,,,https://michiganadvance.com/2025/11/17/michigan-districts-sue-state-for-tying-school-safety-and-mental-health-funding-to-privilege-waiver/,Superintendents and leaders in three dozen school districts around Michigan have filed lawsuits in both federal and state court to challenge a provision of the school funding bill passed last month that would tie funding for mental health and school safety grants to a waiver of “any privilege that may otherwise protect information from disclosure […],"Getty ImagesSuperintendents and leaders in three dozen school districts around Michigan have filed lawsuits in both federal and state court to challenge a provision of the school funding bill passed last month that would tie funding for mental health and school safety grants to a waiver of “any privilege that may otherwise protect information from disclosure in the event of a mass casualty event.”
The funding totals around $321 million set aside for hiring mental health professionals, school resource officers, security equipment or anything else a district determines it needs to promote mental health and safety for students. 
The school officials filing suit say that this provision is unconstitutional — both because it is vague as to exactly what legal privileges school officials would have to waive, under what circumstances and for how long, and because it would require the disclosure of personal information. 
“By conditioning critical safety dollars on an undefined waiver of ‘any privilege,’ Section 31aa(9) operates as a coercive compliance trap that chills the exercise of protected rights without clear guidance,” the federal court complaint, filed in the Eastern District of Michigan, said.  
The inclusion of the waiver was spurred on after the deadly shooting in 2021 at Oxford High School, after which an independent report found that top school officials and administrators could have prevented the shooting and confusion surrounded the responsibility of the state to investigate the incident themselves. 
The definition of a “mass casualty event” in the legislation is also quite broad — it includes any incident with “significant injuries” to three or more people, with fatalities, that “exceeds the normal resources for emergency response,” or that “results in a sudden and timely surge of injured individuals necessitating emergency services.”
The court filing, filed on Nov. 12, says that this could include accidents, such as a school bus crash or school bleachers collapsing, that has nothing to do with institutional negligence. 
“The result is a statutory scheme that sweeps so broadly and indistinctly that no reasonable official could discern the conduct required to comply or the rights forfeited by participation,” the filing says. 
Devault v Michigan Dept of Ed
Districts do have the option to opt in or out of the program, and must make that decision by Nov. 30. However, some districts, including Detroit Public Schools and Lansing Public Schools, have already opted in, with Detroit’s schools receiving over $7 million through this budget provision. 
“Plaintiffs cannot realistically forgo participation in the Section 31aa program without suffering immediate and substantial harm to their ability to provide safe and supportive learning environments,” the federal complaint says. 
The Department of Education declined to comment on the cases, saying that they “do not discuss pending litigation.”
Initial hearings on both the state and federal levels will take place later this week, with the school officials asking the federal court to permanently remove the privilege waiver section from the law.

Jeanne Shaheen (right) sits beside Concord Mayor Byron Champlin during a roundtable discussion on the WIC program. After the event, she spoke with the Bulletin about her decision to vote to end the government shutdown. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)The longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history ended last week after a group of senators — led by New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan — voted with Republicans in a deal that divided the Democratic Party nationwide.
“It has been a hectic week,” Shaheen said Friday in an interview with the Bulletin after a Concord roundtable on the Women, Infants, and Children Nutrition Program, or WIC. “But I’m glad that the government is reopening, and that programs like the WIC program are reassured that the people that they serve will get the food that they need.”
The shutdown began in early October after the Senate failed to pass a spending plan. Democrats continually refused to vote for any budget legislation that didn’t come with an extension of a set of tax credits that Americans use to purchase health insurance. Republicans, however, said they wouldn’t discuss those tax credits until the government reopened. That impasse kept the government closed for a record-breaking 43 days, until Shaheen, Hassan, and six other senators gave in and voted to end the shutdown for the promise of a vote on the issue.
“What we heard consistently throughout the shutdown was that the White House and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate were not going to talk about extending those premium tax credits or health care as long as the government was shut down,” Shaheen said. “But what we have now is a commitment to take up in the Senate the premium tax credits on a bill that Democrats write by a date certain by the end of the second week in December. … So we’ll see, and if they don’t come to the table, the American people know who to blame.”
Asked what part of that deal was not on the table on day one of the shutdown, Shaheen pointed to “a date certain, a bill that was written, the three bills that got attached to the continuing resolution and how far they went out, protections for federal workers, agreement to hire, hire back those who had been let go, and back salaries.”
Still, there’s no guarantee that enough Republicans will vote to extend the tax credits, but Shaheen said Democrats have heard from Republicans who are willing to work with them on it. Ultimately, though, voters will take notice if they don’t get on board, sh said.
“We are going to keep this front and center before the American people so they know who’s responsible,” she said.
More than 1 million federal employees went without pay and many who are reliant on federal assistance programs weren’t receiving all their benefits during the shutdown. Asked what her message would be to those who weathered the hardships if Democrats still aren’t able to secure the tax credits, Shaheen said: “We’re going to keep at it and come next November, if the Republicans aren’t willing to support something to address health insurance costs for Americans, they’re going to pay at the polls.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shaheen-1024x731.jpg,,,2025-11-17 15:56:42.614403

Tate Reeves is asking lawmakers when they convene for the 2026 regular session to provide $1 million for expanding child care access for workers across the state. 
The program, according to his annual Executive Budget Recommendation, would be a public-private “tri-share model” in which employers, employees and the state government share the cost of child care. 
Reeves, a Republican, said in the report that the child care program could lead to a reduction in absenteeism, increased work performance and the attraction of a larger talent pool. 
“It is a vital workforce-development strategy that will strengthen our state’s historic economic development efforts and help increase Mississippi’s workforce participation rate,” Reeves said. 
The governor also recommended that the Legislature expand “education freedom,” or school choice in Mississippi, though he didn’t recommend a specific policy or propose how much money lawmakers should spend. 
Education freedom is the moniker that Mississippi Republicans prefer to describe school-choice ideas. It refers to a myriad of policies that either disburse tax money to families to pay for education services, including private school tuition, or allow families to move their children to different schools, regardless of type or location. 
The issue has gained traction under the Trump administration. House Speaker Jason White and other state leaders have repeatedly indicated their support for expanding school choice, which is expected to headline the legislative session that starts in January. 
Reeves said legislators should expand charter schools in the state and give students greater flexibility to attend public schools, regardless of where they live. 
Current state law requires students to attend the school district in which they reside. The only way for them to transfer to another district is if their home school district and the receiving school district both agree to the switch. 
Both the governor and Joint Legislative Budget Committee are required to issue budget recommendations before lawmakers convene in regular session. But the full Legislature sets a budget and is not bound by either recommendation.
Other budget recommendations Reeves made include: 

$20 million to fast-track construction of energy generation, transmission and pipeline infrastructure at sites designated by the Mississippi Development Authority.
$100 million to create an Energy Infrastructure Bank to prevent supply chain disruptions.
$20 million for new economic site development efforts.
$50 million for debt management strategies to save money in the long term.
$9 million to establish three 16-bed psychiatric emergency service locations for adults in crisis.
$5 million to create a second adolescent crisis stabilization unit and a secure residential substance use disorder unit.
$10 million to establish in-state facilities for children with extreme behavioral and mental health issues.
$1.5 million to provide more vehicles for the Capitol Police Department to patrol the expanded Capitol Complex Improvement District.
$15 million for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency Disaster Trust Fund to prepare for severe weather events.
$12.75 million to establish a uniform statewide youth court system with 25 full-time youth court chancellors and associated staff.
$8 million to replace the outdated youth court case management system with a modern system for efficiency and transparency.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/04153935/3X0A2136.jpg,,,2025-11-17 15:56:42.614403

(Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Republican Indiana legislative leaders avoided taking questions Monday about the political pressure they are facing from President Donald Trump over congressional redistricting, while the governor accused GOP senators of “hiding behind closed doors.”
Gov. Mike Braun spoke Monday morning with Trump, a day after the president called out Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray for Friday’s announcement that too few Senate Republicans supported redistricting and that the Senate would not convene Dec. 1, as planned.
Trump also had questioned Braun’s efforts.
At least some Republican senators have been invited to the White House to talk about redistricting in the coming days in an attempt to boost support for Trump’s wish for GOP-led states to squeeze out more Republican-friendly congressional seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Braun posted to social media that he “had a great call with President Trump! I told him I remain committed to standing with him on the critical issue of passing fair maps in Indiana to ensure the MAGA agenda is successful in Congress.”
Braun’s post did not address the criticism he faced from Trump, who said Braun “is not working the way he should to get the necessary Votes.”
Pressure continues for December session
The Indiana House and Senate are both scheduled to meet Tuesday for their annual Organization Day. The gathering is typically a low-key day of formalities in preparation for the start of the legislative session in early January.
With enough House Republicans believed to support redistricting for redrawn maps to clear the chamber, House Speaker Todd Huston had announced plans for a two-week meeting in December.
Bray’s Friday announcement seemingly put the brakes on any redistricting action, but Braun and other Trump allies are continuing to lean on lawmakers.
Trump targets Gov. Mike Braun, Senate Republicans in redistricting spat

“Indiana’s State Legislators must show up for work and take a public vote for fair maps to counter the gerrymandering in California and Illinois,” Braun’s post said. “But the Indiana State Senate is hiding behind closed doors and refusing to even bring redistricting to a vote. Hoosiers deserve to know where their legislators stand and expect them to show up for work, not walk out and hide in the dark.”
Bray and Huston both took part in a Monday panel session sponsored by the Indiana Chamber of Commerce as a preview of the upcoming session.
They did not discuss the redistricting controversy during the hour-long program — and both quickly left without talking with reporters and TV news crews who followed them.
During the program, Bray referred in passing to redistricting as he said “this is a strange build up to the legislative session.” Bray later indicated he was sticking by the Senate’s plan of not meeting in December by saying: “It’s our anticipation, as I said last week, that we’re going to come in January 5th.”
The offices of Bray and Huston did not reply to questions from the Indiana Capital Chronicle Monday.
GOP senators called to White House again
Sen. Rick Niemeyer, R-Lowell, said he would not be joining other Republican senators on the upcoming White House trip.
“I’m not going. Too much going on in Indiana right now,” he said, noting it’s the second or third time they have invited folks to D.C. recently. “It doesn’t fit my schedule right now.”
Niemeyer is one of five Senate Republicans targeted by a post circulating on various social media sites. It’s not clear why the five were chosen since there are 19 who haven’t gone on record with their stance. Additionally, there are eight who have come out against drawing new maps.
“I haven’t heard a lot of comments personally. I guess there’s stuff on Facebook,” Niemeyer said. “I don’t do much Facebook, OK, but personally, I haven’t heard a whole lot from my constituents, a little bit.”
Indiana Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, speaks with reporters following an Indiana Chamber of Commerce event on Nov. 17, 2025. (Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Niemeyer said it doesn’t make sense to say whether he will vote in support or against a redistricting plan because “right now, we don’t even have a bill.”
“People say, ‘How you going to vote?’” he said. “Well, I’m going to vote when I see what I need to look at and I’m ready to vote, but there’s nothing there right now.”
Trump started the national redistricting fight by pushing Texas Republicans to redraw its congressional map this summer. The pressure on Indiana Republicans has included two trips by Vice President JD Vance to Indianapolis.
Redistricting supporters wanted Indiana lawmakers to craft a map with all nine of the state’s congressional districts favoring Republicans based on 2020 census data. 
The current congressional maps drawn by Republicans in 2021 maintained a 7-2 GOP majority — with Democrat Frank Mrvan holding the 1st District in northwest Indiana and Democrat Andre Carson holding the 7th District, which covers much of Indianapolis.
When asked Monday about Braun’s criticism of Republican senators, Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, told reporters that the mid-decade redistricting request “was unprecedented.”
“Folks took several long months to listen to their constituents and again and again and again Hoosiers made their voices very loud and very clear,” Yoder said. “They do not want their congressional maps redrawn — across the board, every poll. This wasn’t a party thing. This was Hoosiers saying ‘We are a state that doesn’t cheat. We are a state that abides by the rules.’”
Swatting of senator’s home denounced
Trump’s Sunday post also specially called out Sen. Greg Goode, R-Terre Haute, as a redistricting opponent — even though Goode hasn’t stated his position despite a Nov. 1 town hall he held in his district where dozens of people spoke against redistricting and none in favor.
Hours after Trump’s post, Goode was the victim of swatting when someone called police and made a false report of a “domestic violence emergency” at his home, according to the senator. 
Goode was elected by a Republican Party caucus in late 2023 to complete the term of Sen. Jon Ford, who resigned. Goode, whose seat is up for election next year, is the state director for U.S. Sen. Todd Young, who did not endorse Trump’s presidential run last year.
In a social media post Monday, Young called the swatting incident “shameful and cowardly.”
“This was a serious situation, and I am grateful that no one was injured and for the professionalism of law enforcement,” Young’s post said. “This incident is not representative of the millions of Hoosiers who love their neighbors and resolve policy disagreements in a civil manner. Let’s remember the spirit of Hoosier hospitality as our state policymakers meet in the days ahead.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said Monday that he supports the nationwide ban on most hemp-derived THC products that Congress approved last week and that is scheduled to take effect late next year.
Language in the federal legislation reopening the government prohibits sales of hemp products with more than 0.4 milligrams per container of total delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) — the psychoactive compound found in the cannabis plant. That effectively would prohibit hemp-derived products like Delta-8 from being sold online, in gas stations, and corner stores around the country.
The vote came weeks after 39 state attorneys general from both red and blue states signed a letter asking Congress to outlaw intoxicating hemp products at the federal level.
Uthmeier was not one of them, however.
Speaking during a press conference in Tampa, Uthmeier said he declined to sign because he wanted to review the request “a little bit more,” but agreed that “a full sweeping regulatory overhaul of hemp, I think, was greatly needed.”
“Our team is looking in on that and we’re going to make sure that we’re getting illegal products off the market,” he said.
Against the collective objections of the billion-dollar hemp industry in Florida, the Legislature passed a bill in the 2024 legislative session that would have banned Delta-8 and imposed strict limits on the amount of THC that could be included in hemp-derived products. It was ultimately vetoed by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
The Legislature came back in the 2025 session with proposals to regulate hemp, but failed to approve a bill.
7-OH
Uthmeier repeated his concerns about 7-OH, a concentrated byproduct of the kratom plant (7-OH is abbreviation of the substance 7-hydroxymitragynine). The attorney general announced in August that he had filed an emergency rule classifying 7-OH as a controlled substance in Florida, making it illegal to sell, possess, or distribute any isolated or concentrated form of 7-OH in the state.
That prompted Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Wilton Simpson to announce last month that his agency had removed 17,113 packages of 7-OH from retail locations in more than 20 Florida counties.
“If you don’t know what this 7-0H is, it’s dangerous. It’s highly concentrated,” Uthmeier said Monday.
“We’ve taken measurements that it’s 13 times more potent than morphine and it was being sold on a shelf right next to candy and retail products. So, just because something’s on a shelf doesn’t mean it’s gone through all the regulatory approvals, it does not mean it’s safe. We’re in a world where there’s a lot of new products coming in and it’s up to us — state leaders, law enforcement, and the Legislature — to get involved, crack down, and make the tough decisions to protect our consumers.”
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is also pushing to ban 7-OH. In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse.

(Screengrab of Summerlin from ""A Strategic Overview of Howard Hughes Communities"" video presentation to investors)“The investment.” 
That’s what authors of and apologists for the film subsidy scheme keep saying to defend giving public money to private corporations.
No state tax credits will be handed out to film companies to sell to Nevada corporations — who can use the credits to pay taxes, thus diverting tax revenue to the film companies — unless hundreds of millions of dollars is spent building … something. 
Therefore, the tax credit scheme now being debated in a “special” legislative session will generate hundreds of millions of dollars of “investment,” assert the scheme’s backers.
As was brought to the fore in the Current over the weekend, the geographical district in which such qualifying spending occurs includes Downtown Summerlin (Howard Hughes Holdings, proprietor), a couple miles away from the site of Sony Pictures Entertainment’s proposed studio complex.
Office space and restaurants and hotels and retail and whatever else gets built in the Downtown Summerlin area could count toward the spending requirements — “the investment” — that trigger the tax credits to the movie corporations.
So presumably every time Howard Hughes Holdings develops … anything …  or sells/leases land to a company that does, in the general vicinity of where some studio-related infrastructure might be constructed, that would count toward the investment prerequisite forcing the state to give tax credits to film companies.
“We need to prove” to the Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED) “that there is a concrete nexus between that development at Downtown Summerlin and the studios,” Matt Walker with Howard Hughes Holdings, who has been shepherding the bill through the special session, assured lawmakers. “It’s not as if we just build a new office building and call it connected.”
Given the inclination of Nevada economic development officials to side with companies whenever possible, and brag about it, one can be excused for presuming GOED will interpret “nexus” very generously.  
And then the millions diverted from state revenues to the film companies will be used by the companies to lease land from Howard Hughes, as well as pay Howard Hughes, a developer after all, to get stuff built on it?
The Assembly (barely) passed the scheme Sunday, and a Senate committee has already advanced it to the Senate floor.
If it’s enacted, it will be of a piece with Nevada economic policy generally, which is anchored by an almost spiritual dedication to providing public subsidies to big business.
But at least it will be interesting to track how much of the revenue that film companies make selling $1.65 billion in tax credits will ultimately end up as entries among Howard Hughes Holdings’ accounts receivables.
Alas, we will likely never know how much of that development would have happened anyway, even without diverting tax revenue to Howard Hughes, er, film companies.
Probably a lot.
As HHH CEO David O’Reilly boasted in a recent video to shareholders, the company has “tens of thousands of undeveloped acres” nationwide, “both residential and commercial, that we’ll be building on, unlocking the value into great income producing assets.”
But Nevada legislators can’t be bothered with niggling concerns about whether their tax credit scheme is designed primarily to create a new industry or coddle a long-standing and very powerful one. There’s a “special” session to rush through. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Mustn’t delay.
Of the bits and pieces of the session I watched over the weekend, probably the best short summation of the Legislature’s film tax folly process, and the best explanation of why legislators were even there, was delivered by Republican Assemblymember Jill Dickman. Lawmakers are speeding through the scheme during a special session “not because it’s urgent, but because someone wants it rushed.”
Someone like the self-described “country’s leading developer of large-scale master planned communities.”

Bonamo,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/17/lamonica-mciver-federal-assault-case/,Prosecutors say there are 30 more videos related to Rep. LaMonica McIver's alleged assault of federal agents in May.,"Prosecutors say there are 30 more videos related to Rep. LaMonica McIver's alleged assault of federal agents in May. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The federal judge in Rep. LaMonica McIver’s federal assault case urged prosecutors to move faster in providing video evidence to McIver’s legal team in advance of her trial.
At issue are videos surrounding the May 9 melee at the Delaney Hall migrant jail in Newark as federal agents moved to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. Prosecutors allege that McIver (D-10) assaulted federal agents in the resulting scuffle.
McIver has pleaded not guilty and asserted that the charges amount to political retaliation on behalf of the Trump administration. The two sides met in a Newark federal courthouse for a brief conference Monday.
New videos capture tense moments surrounding arrest of Newark mayor

“Everything involving the scrum and the congresswoman are fair game,” U.S. District Court Judge Jamel K. Semper said to the prosecution team, led by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark McCarren. “I’m frustrated that evidence is coming in a piecemeal kind of fashion. It’s unnecessarily lengthy.”
The videos were taken in and around the jail and were initially in possession of the Department of Homeland Security. Prosecutors say the department has given them seven videos from May 9, but has yet to produce 30 more. 
“It’s mystifying that we’re standing here months and months after the indictment,” said defense attorney Lee Cortes. “It’s the job of the government to do this.”
It’s not clear what the videos show. Prior videos released in the case include security footage showing the scuffle that resulted in Baraka’s arrest and body-worn camera footage captured by federal agents involved in the arrest.
Semper set a deadline of Wednesday, Nov. 26, for the prosecution to provide the needed discovery to McIver’s team. The judge stated that he wanted the prosecution to focus on video footage taken between 12 noon and 5 p.m. on May 9.
Monday’s hearing comes four days after Semper declined to toss the charges against McIver, who alleges she is the victim of selective prosecution and that her actions on May 9 should be shielded by legislative immunity. Semper is still mulling whether to throw out one of the three charges McIver faces.
Semper on Monday also advised prosecutors to inform the Department of Homeland Security to remove anti-McIver posts issued by the department that Semper has previously said are prejudicial. Prosecutors have told Semper they have had trouble getting the department to do so.
“It shouldn’t have come to this point,” Semper said Monday. “I want to make sure that DHS conduct doesn’t make me have to give an order.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-17 19:33:07+00:00,CT Mirror,PODCAST: CT towing companies often list cars cheap to sell them fast,CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/17/podcast-ct-towing-companies-car-listing/,WSHU's Ebong Udoma and CT Mirror's Ginny Monk discuss her article about the latest in an investigation into Connecticut's towing laws.,"A multi-part investigation by The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica looks into how state laws have come to favor towing companies over the residents whose cars are towed.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Ginny Monk to discuss her article written with Dave Altimari and Sophie Chou, “CT towing companies frequently value cars low, allowing them to sell vehicles quickly,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read the story here.
WSHU: Hello, Ginny. You and your colleague, Dave Altmari, in collaboration with ProPublica, have been investigating Connecticut’s car towing businesses for a while now. As a matter of fact, your initial reporting prompted state lawmakers to pass a new law that took effect in October, and now this follow-up data analysis of more than 6,000 forms submitted to the DMV by towing companies. It’s quite fascinating. What made you decide to do this?
GM: So when we started this investigation, we had requested all of these forms, not really knowing how many we’d get or what quality they would be, or how easy it might be to analyze them. And as we started asking the DMV more questions about the forms, we began to realize that they had not done a wholesale analysis of this data. So we set out to do that. We hand-cleaned a lot of these forms and eventually created a database that resulted in the story that you saw on Sunday.
WSHU: You know, it’s quite fascinating. There’s Ruedean Harvey, who had a very expensive Range Rover that was towed and valued at less than $1,500. How did that come about?
GM: That’s a great question. So Ruedean had this, this vehicle that, as you mentioned, she paid a lot of money for. It did need some engine repairs, which is what the towing company attributed it to. They, I believe, valued it at $1,475 after the tow happened.
WSHU: This was a car she bought 12 years before for about $135,000, right?
GM: That’s right. And it was, I think, one of those sales experiences that I have never personally had. But for her, it was really meaningful. They popped champagne when she bought it; the car was in a glass case. It was a really nice vehicle.
WSHU: Okay, now, so what happened to the vehicle, and how did it end up being towed?
GM: So the vehicle, she had taken it to a repair shop, because, as I mentioned, it needed engine repairs. While the vehicle was there, the shop closed down, and it’s not immediately clear to us how it wound up being towed to a public street, but that’s where it was, and from there it had been towed by this tow company, which eventually valued it at $1,475.
WSHU: However, she was able to stop it before it was sold.
GM: She was able to stop it before it was sold. She got her car back. But the form that the tow company submitted asking permission to sell her car, as I mentioned a couple of times, was at $1,475, which is just under the $1,500 mark for quicker and private sales.
WSHU: Okay, so basically, the reason why it was valued below $1,500 is that if it’s below $1,500, you can quickly sell a car, right?
GM: That’s how the system at the time in Connecticut worked. And you know, again, the tower does say it’s because of the engine repairs that we valued it so low.
WSHU: But, you found a pattern here. There was one company that had more than 90% its shares valued below $1,500. How did they explain that?
GM: So a lot of them didn’t respond to our request for comment, and some said, look, all the cars we tow are junk. But we, in addition to the kind of big, broad analysis we did of all of the forms, we narrowed it down to a few brands of luxury cars and found that those were also being valued far below their retail value, even those that we couldn’t find had been in any accident.
WSHU: And you found towers altogether seeking permission for 150 luxury cars for less than a third of what they were valued and had no accidents.
GM: That’s right. So for us, that was significant. A lot of toes do happen after accidents, right? You see an accident on the highway, those cars need to be cleared, and that’s kind of what tours have been claiming. These cars are junk. They’ve been in accidents. They’re abandoned, but we couldn’t find evidence of that for 150 luxury vehicles.
WSHU: Now, what advantage does a tow company have by listing it as less than $1,500? How do they make money from that?
GM: So, for vehicles listed at $1,500 or less, first, the process is faster, so after 15 days, they can begin the process of requesting permission to sell the vehicle. Secondly, they can sell it in a private sale versus a public auction. So for these lower-value vehicles, you can sell them to anyone you want.
WSHU: But after they’ve sold the cars, the profits that they make from selling these cars, isn’t that money supposed to go back to the owners after they’ve taken away those tow charges?
GM: It is supposed to go back to the owners after they’ve taken away the tow charges, or in the event they can’t locate the owner, or the owner doesn’t come forward to claim those profits, the money is supposed to go to the state. In previous reporting, the state told us that it had never happened.
WSHU: That’s after a year, they hold on to the money for a year before it goes to the state, right?
GM: Right.
WSHU: And that has never happened?
GM: Right.
WSHU: When you ask the DMV about the situation, what’s their response?
GM: The DMV says that they examine all the forms, and if they note that the values are very different between the retail value and what the tower put, they’ll send it back to the tower to check it again, resubmit the form. They’ve kind of admitted that this is, I think the quote was, it’s not a good system, and it really relies on judgment calls on the part of DMV employees. They also have said that if someone submits a form incorrectly and says, I want permission to sell this after 15 days, and that’s not supposed to happen, based on the value that they’ll hold on to the form for a while and then give it back to the tower.
WSHU: Do other states do it the same way?
GM: No. In other states, it’s really a wide variety. So some states rely on police to value vehicles. Oregon requires a certified appraiser to value vehicles. I believe Florida goes by how old the vehicle is, versus the value. So there are really a lot of different ways that states handle this.
WSHU: So, Ginny, does it seem as if Connecticut is going to do anything different going forward? You were at the first meeting of the panel that was put together to oversee this last month.
GM: Yeah. So, like you mentioned, the legislation that passed during the last session and went into effect in October established a working group through the DMV that’s kind of talking through a lot of these issues, and they’re supposed to present a report to lawmakers in February. They’re actually meeting today, so we’ll see what comes with that.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_0923_SR_HarveyRuedean_188-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-17 14:58:57.702257
,Mississippi Today,2025-11-17 19:32:43+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi earns ‘F’ grade in preterm births from March of Dimes,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/17/mississippi-earns-f-grade-preterm-births/,"With 15% of all births in the state happening before 37 weeks gestation, Mississippi’s preterm birth rate is the worst in the country.","Mississippi earned an ‘F’ grade for its rate of preterm births in 2024, according to the 2025 report card from the March of Dimes. The state has failed every year since the March of Dimes, a national nonprofit aimed at improving the health of mothers and babies, began issuing state report cards in 2008. 
With 15% of all births in the state happening before 37 weeks gestation, Mississippi’s preterm birth rate is the worst in the country. Last year, 5,017 babies in the state were born preterm, which the report attributes to policy decisions, chronic diseases and lifestyle choices. Policy decisions include the state’s failure to expand Medicaid and adopt paid parental leave policies. 
Any state with a rate greater than 11.5% also received an F. The U.S. average is 10.4% – the same as the year before and a full percentage point higher than the 2030 Healthy People target goal set by the federal government to reduce infant sickness and death. 
“I think the fact that Mississippi continues to get this grade really speaks to how challenging this problem can be and how difficult some of the underlying causes are,” said Dr. Michael Warren, chief medical officer of March of Dimes. “One of the things that jumps out to me when I look at the Mississippi report card is the high rate of chronic diseases. We know that the health of women before they ever become pregnant has an important influence on that pregnancy and outcomes for both mom and baby.”

Compared to national averages, pregnant Mississippians are more likely to smoke, have high blood pressure and maintain an unhealthy weight, all of which contribute to preterm births, according to the report. Mississippi’s rate of diabetes in pregnant women – another significant contributing factor to preterm birth – is in line with the national average, the report found. 
Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant death, and Mississippi also leads the nation in this grim statistic. In August, the state Health Department declared a public health emergency over the state’s infant mortality rate. State lawmakers have held several hearings on the issue in recent weeks, even entertaining the possibility of no-strings-attached cash assistance to new mothers to address the crisis. 
Counterintuitively, the report showed more women in Mississippi received adequate prenatal care than those nationwide. While Mississippians consistently visited their health care providers during pregnancy, Warren said high rates of chronic diseases and lifestyle choices undermined those gains. 
“Even with the best prenatal care, even with getting all the recommended visits, if women are coming in sicker and with more chronic disease, we’re really starting from a deficit,” Warren said. 
Preventing chronic diseases before pregnancy requires having health insurance well before conception. But Mississippi’s Medicaid program, which has among the strictest eligibility requirements in the nation, does not insure childless adults. Parents must earn less than 22% of the federal poverty level, which amounts to less than $500 per month for a family of three to be eligible. Those requirements are more lenient during pregnancy, meaning many women only qualify for health insurance once they become pregnant.  
And even when women are going to regular check-ups, long driving times and concerns about additional costs mean some women don’t seek care between scheduled visits, explained Dr. Rashad Ali, a Laurel-based obstetrician who has made it his mission to serve uninsured and underinsured women. Something as simple as an untreated urinary tract infection can lead to an intrauterine infection, which may account for up to 40% of preterm births, research shows. 
“Cervical infections, urinary tract infections – any infections like that – we know that if you treat them, that will reduce your risk of preterm labor,” Ali said. 
Mississippi isn’t alone in the crisis. Half of all U.S. states received a ‘D’ or an ‘F’ for their preterm birth grade, and a third of the 100 U.S. cities with the greatest number of live births received an ‘F.’
Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama are the only states to fail the report card every year, according to March of Dimes.  
In 2023, the Mississippi Legislature extended pregnancy-related Medicaid coverage to 12-months postpartum, one of six policy recommendations by March of Dimes. The state also passed mandated mental health screening and reimbursement for those services and established a maternal mortality review committee. 
However, Mississippi has no universal paid parental leave policy, despite the fact that the Legislature passed paid parental leave for state employees in 2024. The state also does not require reimbursement for doulas, or birth workers who are proven to improve outcomes. Mississippi also remains one of 10 states not to expand Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more low-income residents.  
Now, the country faces the largest cuts to Medicaid in history, signed into law by President Donald Trump over the summer. While the law doesn’t change eligibility for pregnant women, the enormity of the budget constraints will force hospitals to make difficult decisions, said Warren. 
That could bode especially poorly for Mississippi, a state where maternity care deserts pervade more than half of its counties – well above the national average of 33%. 
“Pregnant women are excluded from some of the provisions of this bill, but when you think about the funding going to state Medicaid programs decreasing overall, states have a limited number of options,” Warren said. “The worry is if those hospitals can’t stay open, or if they close their labor and delivery units, then pregnant women are going to suffer.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/06105527/3X0A8209-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-17 14:58:57.702257

Offutt Farms, one of the largest potato growers in the world, agreed to pay $82,770 to 442 workers for failing to provide sick leave in 2024 as part of a settlement with the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry announced on Monday.
The company also sent checks totaling $80,800 to 101 migrant agricultural workers for not providing employment statements with key details including wages, job duties, employment period and housing arrangements.
Under a Minnesota law passed in 2023, all employees are entitled to one hour of paid sick and safe time for every 30 hours worked up to 48 hours a year — at least six days for a full-time employee.
R.D. Offutt Farms told state labor regulators that sick leave was available to all employees, but the Department of Labor and Industry determined most employees were not able to use the time, and the company did not tell employees how much time they had accrued, according to the settlement agreement.
As part of the agreement, R.D. Offutt paid workers the value of the earned sick and safe time they were unable to use. Workers who did not receive employment statements ahead of traveling to Minnesota received $800 each.
“When migrant agricultural workers travel long distances for seasonal jobs, they should receive information about what they’re signing up for before traveling to Minnesota. With limited exceptions, they should also receive the protections of the ESST law when they are sick,” said DLI Commissioner Nicole Blissenbach, in a statement.

One of the most visible and controversial economic policy shifts to be implemented during the first year of the second Trump administration has been the return of big economic tariffs (that is, federal taxes) on foreign imports. The President claims that tariffs will boost domestic businesses, but results thus far – especially given the on-again-off-again way in which they’ve been applied and removed — have been, at the very best, mixed.
One North Carolina businessperson who can testify to the challenging ways in which tariffs have impacted their business is western North Carolina farmer, Mary Carroll Dodd.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Facing scrutiny and potential rejection over proposed winter energy bill credits, Rhode Island Energy has pulled the plug on its $149 million discount plan, according to a letter sent Friday to state utility regulators.
But, the company will still have to come up with an alternative way to satisfy the rate relief requirements tied to the 2022 sale of the state gas and electric operations from National Grid to Rhode Island Energy’s parent company, PPL Corp. 
Rhode Island Energy executives and Gov. Dan McKee championed a plan to provide bill credits over the next two winters, rather than dispersing smaller discounts over a much longer period of time. The proposal would have slashed customers’ electric bills by $20 to $30 per month, and cut gas bills by $40 to $50 per month, from January to March 2026 and again in the same three months of 2027 — the coldest and most expensive time of year. 
Rhode Island Energy’s enthusiasm cooled under criticism from the Rhode Island Attorney’s General office and questions by the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). The politically appointed commission has final authority over the timing and distribution of the bill credits.
“The Company has come to the conclusion that the most likely outcome of the consideration of its tariff advice filing is either a rejection of the proposed miscellaneous bill credits or a modification to the calculation of and/or processing for the miscellaneous bill credits,” Adam Ramos, an attorney representing Rhode Island Energy, wrote in a Nov. 14 letter to the PUC.
Instead, the “best path forward” was to pull the proposal altogether, Ramos wrote.
The decision was first reported by WPRI-TV 12. 
Formula feud: AG Neronha accuses R.I. Energy of ‘shortchanging’ bill credits owed to customers

Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, acknowledged that the company’s proposal ran into “unexpected and unwarranted opposition.” He did not specify the source of the opposition in a statement on Monday. 
“While we are disappointed with this development, supporting our customers through these challenging winter months remains a priority,” Dalo said. “We will continue to work closely with regulators and stakeholders through the Winter Volatility Docket to identify and advance other solutions that may provide relief to customers this winter.”
McKee in a statement Monday called the reversal of the proposal “flat-out unacceptable.”
“My administration negotiated this voluntary settlement with Rhode Island Energy to get families help now,” McKee said. “Without it, that relief gets stretched over 30 years and becomes barely noticeable on monthly bills. Rhode Islanders deserve real relief.”
State utility regulators in 2022 required the company to shield customers from shouldering the cost of tax and accounting changes associated with sale. Additional conditions and ratepayer protections were imposed by the Attorney General’s office under a separate settlement with PPL.

Crunching numbers 
PPL initially estimated the dollar figure for its “hold harmless commitment” — sparing Rhode Island customers from tax expenses — at $240 million over 37 years. By concentrating the credits over a two-year-period, the value dropped to $149 million, according to the discount rate used by Rhode Island Energy. The Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, the administrative arm of the state utility agency, signed off on the plan in September, vetting the company’s math through an expert who determined its calculations “met appropriate accounting industry standards and were wholly accurate,” according to an Oct. 23 letter to the PUC. 
The same day, Attorney General Peter Neronha accused Rhode Island Energy of lowballing the value of the credits, and in turn, shortchanging ratepayers by “tens of millions” of dollars. Neronha’s office in written filings argued that the formula used to determine present-day value of the credits was the wrong one, because it considered risks and benefits to company shareholders —- a separate group from the ratepayers the discounts are aimed to benefit. Alternative calculation methods put forth by an expert hired by Neronha’s office would have added up to $39 million more in total credits for Rhode Island Energy customers compared with the company’s proposal.










My administration negotiated this voluntary settlement with Rhode Island Energy to get families help now. Without it, that relief gets stretched over 30 years and becomes barely noticeable on monthly bills. Rhode Islanders deserve real relief. 


– Gov. Dan McKee


Neronha said Monday the company’s withdrawal of its plan confirmed his reservations about “corporate greed, plain and simple.”
“By taking their ball and going home, Rhode Island Energy is exposing who they are as a company,” Neronha said in an emailed statement. “As soon as my Office pointed out that they were attempting to pull a fast one on Rhode Islanders, shortchanging consumers by tens of millions of dollars, they decided to pull their proposal rather than pay the full amount that they owe. This Company is clearly not interested in providing relief to energy consumers unless it benefits them.”
The PUC has yet to take a stand on the formula feud. However, its recent data requests to Rhode Island Energy suggest some hesitancy. For example, in an Oct. 22 series of questions — the fifth round of detailed questioning over the proposal — the commission sought clarification on how the company could bypass, or lower, its state tax bill by offering credits to customers. Rhode Island Energy in response said the tax costs were separated from the discounts, but acknowledged it would benefit from a reduced tax liability by offering bill credits, which in turn lowers its annual revenue.  
The PUC is scheduled to hold a hearing Wednesday to review other ratepayer relief options for higher winter electric costs, including discounts that could be equal to or more than the Rhode Island Energy proposal.

(Courtesy Joshua Bowling)Source New Mexico has hired a seasoned investigative journalist to join its award-winning newsroom following a national search. 
Joshua Bowling began on Monday as Source’s senior reporter.
Before joining Source, he was an investigative reporter for Searchlight New Mexico for three years, where he covered topics including criminal justice, police accountability, the prison-industrial complex, sex abuse in the Catholic Church and more. 
His December 2023 investigation about lavish spending by Western New Mexico University President Joseph Shepard ultimately led to the president’s resignation, along with statewide efforts to reform university governance that continue to work their way through the state Legislature. The reporting prompted the national Education Writers Association to name Bowling a finalist in its investigative and public service journalism category.
Before joining Searchlight, Bowling worked as a reporter for about six years at the Arizona Republic, which is the state’s biggest newspaper. 
Bowling will be Source’s main legislative reporter, and will also be covering criminal justice, the 2026 elections and other key issues facing New Mexico.
“I was already a big fan of Joshua’s journalism,” said Source NM Editor-in-Chief Julia Goldberg. “He’s played an important role in reporting some of New Mexico’s biggest stories, and we’re excited to have him join us in our work of in depth reporting on state government, health, the environment and the ongoing impact of federal policies on our state and its residents.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)North Carolina published statewide digital skills standards last month that identify key knowledge and abilities for residents and will soon launch an online course, joining a number of states that are hoping to strengthen digital literacy.
The North Carolina Digital Skills Standards, published by the state’s information technology department, is a framework that can be used to help residents understand basic digital skills. Next, an online learning course will be developed and “digital navigators” will be trained to help residents across the state.
North Carolina’s standards focus on six key areas: creating and maintaining an online identity, practicing balanced and cautious technology use, building digital relationships, ensuring internet safety, understanding online information and developing skills for advanced systems and emerging technology, such as artificial intelligence.
Kids are flooded with social media and news. Some states want to help them question it.

“This is important because it elevates the issue statewide,” said Grace Tepper, a senior writing associate at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, a policy group focused on communications and the internet. 
“Even if you have access to the internet, there are still many, many ways in which the majority of people are still learning how to use these tools that are available to them,” she said. “They just may not be able to access it because of a lack of digital skills.” 
As online skills have become more necessary for health care, education, banking and more, many states have been building similar frameworks to help government agencies, school districts, business owners, nonprofit organizations and other groups identify ways to improve digital literacy.
In 2023, New Jersey became the first state to enact legislation requiring information literacy instruction in K-12 schools under the state’s Student Learning Standards. And this year, education departments and nonprofit groups in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas updated their state guidelines for supporting digital literacy.
In the United States, 92% of jobs definitely or likely require digital skills, according to a 2023 report from the National Skills Coalition, a nonprofit organization that advocates for skills training.
In May, President Donald Trump eliminated Digital Equity Act grants, a federal initiative that was created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021. The $2.75 billion program aimed to close the digital divide by expanding broadband access and supporting computer skills training.
Many states had spent years planning how to use the federal funds, including some proposals to establish statewide digital skills standards, Tepper said. Now, the challenge for each state is figuring out how to keep going on their own, she added.
“A lot of states are implementing their own programs,” she said. “They look a lot different — they’re not as comprehensive as what they would have done under the Digital Equity Act. But no matter what happens, states will keep working. They’ve put themselves in good positions to do what they can with what they have.”

State employees worked on the weekend to load benefits onto electronic benefit transfer cards for the almost 600,000 Kentuckians who have benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
Gov. Andy Beshear said Friday that Kentucky had “received the go-ahead to fully fund” food assistance.
On Saturday, he said SNAP benefits were being loaded onto cards. 
Kentucky receives federal guidance for processing full food assistance benefits

“After notification from the federal government, these folks worked through the night to ensure their neighbors had access to food through their SNAP benefits in the morning,” Beshear said in a Saturday statement. “And now, as the shutdown comes to an end, this team is once again willing and ready to process benefits as quickly as possible. To these folks: You’re making a difference, and I am proud to work alongside you. Thank you.”
The longest-ever government shutdown ended Wednesday after 43 days of a political stalemate in Washington. During that time, the Trump administration did not pay SNAP benefits to the roughly 42 million Americans who use the program to buy groceries. 
In Kentucky, Beshear gave $5 million in emergency funds to food banks and authorized interested National Guard members to help staff pantries around the state.

Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) speaks at the Michigan March for Life. Nov. 6, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) has been repeatedly criticized for having never hosted an in-person town hall since being elected to Congress in Michigan’s 7th Congressional District last year. 
That has drawn additional scrutiny after Barrett’s district director, Keith Lane, said that the U.S. Capitol Police instructed members of Congress not to host those events due to safety concerns, although there is no evidence of such guidance. 
In a video posted by Distill Social, Lane says, “Capitol Police, who are in charge of protecting all the members, are advising not to have in-person town halls due to almost double threats against congressional members,” noting that the guidance was given to lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. 
Barrett’s office did not respond to requests for comment on the nature of this guidance from the Capitol Police, including when the guidance was given and what exactly it entails. 
Grassroots organizers delivered more than 1,800 petition signatures to the Lansing, Mich., office of U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett, R-Charlotte, on March 21, 2025, calling on the first-term member of Congress to hold an in-person town hall. (Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)
A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who previously held Barrett’s seat before being elected to the Senate, said that her office was unaware of any new guidelines from the Capitol Police regarding safety at town halls. 
U.S. Capitol Police did not respond to questions about whether or not such guidance had been issued, though they were closed for routine business during the federal government shutdown that ended on Wednesday. 
Distill Social’s video was posted two days after a surprise appearance from Barrett at the Michigan March for Life rally outside the state Capitol building on Nov. 6, which gathered thousands of people — and had no formal security. 
Congressional representatives from Michigan on both sides of the aisle have held in-person town halls this year — in August, Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Tipton) hosted one in Dowagiac, while Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) hosted one in Livonia.

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune) In a rare move Monday, the Utah Judiciary issued a statement addressing threats 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson has received in the days since she issued a ruling in the state’s court-ordered redistricting process, rejecting a congressional map proposed by the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature. 
The statement addressed both the heated political reaction to the ruling, as well as threats of violence that Gibson has received in the wake of her decision. 
“Though the Utah Judiciary does not comment on the specifics of any threats made toward judges or court employees, we acknowledge that such incidents have recently occurred,” the statement said. “We call on everyone to approach concerns involving the courts with civility, respect, and constructive dialogue.”
Utah judge faces impeachment threats after ordering congressional map with 1 Democratic seat

While some Republican lawmakers have threatened to pursue articles of impeachment against Gibson — accusing her of violating the Utah Constitution, despite her ruling largely based on the Utah Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Constitution — the courts’ statement also addressed other types of threats Gibson has received in the wake of her ruling.
Gibson, according to a court spokesperson, has also received violent threats. 
“Threats of violence against judges or court personnel are unacceptable, dangerous, and may violate state or federal law,” the judiciary said. “Any conduct aimed at causing fear for a ruling or undermining the safe operation of the justice system strikes at the heart of the rule of law. Such actions endanger not only the individuals targeted but the functioning of the justice system itself.”
Judges, the statement continued, “have a constitutional duty to apply the law to the facts before them, independent of external pressures.”
“That independence is essential to preserving the separation of powers and ensuring that justice is administered fairly and impartially,” the judiciary said. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

When there is disagreement with a judicial ruling, “the appropriate and lawful avenue for addressing those concerns is the established appellate process,” the statement continued.
The Legislature’s attorneys have signaled that they intend to continue to fight Gibson’s ruling in court, including appeals to the Utah Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. But as the outcry from conservatives over Gibson’s ruling has heated up, so has the rhetoric. 
The judiciary’s statement urged Utahns to respect existing avenues to appeal judge’s rulings and encouraged support of the institution and its public servants. 
“Utah’s courts provide a structured and transparent system for reviewing decisions and correcting potential errors, reinforcing public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process,” the judiciary said. “We encourage all Utahns to stand with the Judiciary in protecting the safety of our judges and employees and protecting the fair and impartial administration of justice.”

(Photo by Leann Ray/West Virginia Watch)A new federal audit of West Virginia’s overwhelmed foster care system showed the state didn’t comply with the required investigation requirements when responding to reports of child abuse and neglect.
The 2024 high-profile death of 14-year-old Kyneddi Miller, who was found in a skeletal state in her Boone County home, and news coverage of the incident prompted the audit, according to federal officials. 
Reporters uncovered that Child Protective Services and the West Virginia State Police were aware of Miller prior to her death; state foster care officials said they had no record of a referral that could have prompted an investigation. After a controversial investigation into the situation, the state Department of Human Services said it would tighten up its abuse and neglect referral process and said it would change how it screens those referrals. 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General sampled 100 of 23,759 of West Virginia’s screened-in family reports of child abuse and neglect for the period of Oct. 1, 2023, through Sept. 30, 2024. 
The audit reviewed if the state was in compliance with the federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, which provides funds to states to improve CPS and child abuse prevention.
“On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that 91% of the 100 screened-in family reports for our audit period were not in compliance with one or more requirements related to the intake, screening, assessment, and investigation of child abuse and neglect,” the office said in its report. The office shared the audit Nov. 14.
The state failed in multiple cases to conduct interviews with children or adults, send letters notifying parents or caregivers of suspected child abuse and assess immediate safety risks.
CPS didn’t asses 61 reports of child abuse and neglect within the required 30 days, according to the audit. 
West Virginia’s Bureau for Social Services said, according to the audit, that it didn’t always follow the required federal child abuse and neglect investigation process “because child welfare workers, who were carrying higher caseload due to staffing shortages, prioritized conducting child interviews over administrative functions such as sending out notification letters to parents or caregivers.”
“Failure to comply with requirements places the children’s health and safety at risk,” the audit said. 
The office made four recommendations to West Virginia, including that the state take the appropriate steps to ensure that child welfare workers perform all required procedures, provide training, develop a system edit and develop written policies and procedures. 
“West Virginia concurred with all four recommendations, and outlined actions that it has taken and plans to take to address our recommendations,” the office said. 
The state is under new foster care leadership since leaders came in this year, including a new DoHS secretary appointed by Gov. Patrick Morrisey.
The Bureau for Social Services told federal officials that the state revised its CPS policy to include additional steps for supervisors that would ensure interviews and assessments are completed in a timely manner.
Following Miller’s death, the state Legislature passed a bill creating a critical incident review team made up of law enforcement, social services workers and legislators to review a death or near-death of a foster child due to child abuse or neglect. 
Miller had been homeschooled from 2021 until her death. Her mother, who was indicted for murder in connection with the girl’s death, didn’t turn in the required documentation tracking Miller’s school progress to the local school board. The girl’s grandmother was also indicted for her death.
Following the girl’s death, Gov. Jim Justice and other lawmakers called for tightening West Virginia’s limited homeschool reporting requirements, but they weren’t changed.
Additionally, the Senate didn’t take up a bill this year that would have paused or potentially denied a parent’s request to homeschool if a teacher has reported suspected child abuse. The House signed off on the bill in February.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Insurance Commissioner Mike Yaworsky ordered a 6.9% decrease in workers’ compensation rates for the coming year. The reduction applies to both new and renewal policies effective Jan. 1, 2026.
“I am pleased to approve a substantial rate cut of 6.9% for Florida’s workers’ compensation policies this upcoming year. This rate decrease directly translates to reduced operating costs for businesses, encouraging investment and growth throughout Florida’s economy,” Yaworsky said in a prepared statement Monday.
“This also marks the ninth consecutive year of rate decreases for workers’ compensation policies — more evidence of Florida’s success in managing risk and maintaining a competitive insurance environment.”
Workers’ compensation is a no-fault system that aims to protect employers from getting sued by injured employees and provide workers injured on the job with the care they need to return to work. Employers are required to provide compensation for lost wages if an employee misses more than eight days of work due to an injury.
Most employers in Florida are required to carry workers’ compensation insurance but there are exceptions for businesses with four or fewer employees and for construction companies with four or fewer officers. While those firms aren’t mandated to carry the coverage, they are required to file for exemptions with the state.
The 6.9% rate reduction matches the recommendation put forth by the National Council for Compensation Insurance earlier this year. NCCI is the licensed rating organization in Florida, authorized to suggest workers’ compensation rates. NCC’s filing is a recommendation only. Florida’s insurance commissioner is charged with setting the rates.
The Oregon Department of Consumer and Businesses Services earlier this year reviewed employers’ workers compensation premiums in 50 states and Washington, D.C. The analysis ranked Florida No. 30 in the nation for workers’ comp costs in 2024. That was an improvement from the previous analysis of 2022 premium data, when Florida ranked No. 28 for workers’ comp premiums.

The campus will include an emergency department, intensive care unit, oncology center, women’s health services with a labor and delivery unit, and children’s services.
Denny Sanford has now given nearly $2 billion to Sioux Falls-based Sanford Health since 2004, helping it grow into the largest rural health system in the United States. The system now has 55,000 employees and serves over 2 million patients and nearly 425,000 health plan members across the upper Midwest.

The 41-year-old Brockman resigned from the post in October after being charged with multiple felony sex offenses with a minor.
Cook had made the decision to run for House District 60 before Brockman’s troubles came to light.
Cook worked for more than a decade in Winston-Salem/Forsyth County and Guilford County Schools. More recently, she founded an educational non-profit that promotes leadership and creative instruction for public school educators.
Cook said that education will be a priority for her while serving in Raleigh. In an interview with WFMY, Cook said she would like to see the General Assembly pass a comprehensive state budget this year and provide teachers with salary increases.
Cook has also pledged to focus on healthcare. Gov. Josh Stein has called on legislators to return to Raleigh and approve funding to a shortfall in the state’s Medicaid budget. But Republican state House and Senate leaders rejected Stein’s call for a special session on Medicaid funding this week.
Brockman has said he is not guilty of the charges against him. He was released from jail earlier this month after posting a $250,000 bond.

“The problem was they kept coming in all different directions. It was like anybody at APT was getting sent an email,” he said.
The AETC discussed disaffiliating from PBS after two AETC commissioners, Les Barnett and Ferris Stephens, brought the idea to Reid meeting last month.
The commissioners said PBS carries a “negative connotation” and doesn’t align with their beliefs.
“I don’t want to fund it,” Barnett said. “PBS has made themselves the enemy of what I stand with, and so I do not like them, and I don’t follow the philosophy of feeding the beast.”
Most commissioners expressed disapproval. 
“This morning in Hoover, there was a church school, and every single morning, these six and seven year olds watch Daniel Tiger[‘s Neighborhood] before the bell rings. And that’s 300 moms that we’re going to have to talk to, because that would just be gone,” Commissioner Pete Conroy said at the October meeting.
Reid said in a phone interview Monday that APT is listening to what Ivey said in the letter and will move forward based on how the AETC votes at the secheduled meeting on Tuesday. 
Ivey said in the letter that APT needs to consider Alabama voters through a survey conducted over a “sustained period of time” and should the organization choose to drop PBS programming, a plan should be available for public review.
“I am aware of, and even sympathetic to, the belief that maintaining a public television network is not a proper function of the government,” Ivey wrote. “But whether the state should or should not operate public television is a question for our legislature.”
Board members and commissioners at the Oct. 28 meeting were split on if PBS programming should be dropped entirely or if APT should choose to keep certain shows including children’s programming and Masterpiece which shows prestige dramas like Downton Abbey, Sherlock and Prime Suspect.
Reid said Monday if PBS programming is dropped it would be supplemented by “a variety” of American Public Television programs. American Public Television is a non-profit outlet founded in 1961 that also provides programming for PBS.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9986-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-17 13:58:26.488514

Last week, the state board adopted The Phoenix Declaration, a paragraphs-long statement pledging to parental involvement in education, patriotism in school, the nation’s founding documents, limited government, and the equal dignity of all human beings. 
Florida affirms Heritage Foundation education priorities, first state to do so

Rep. Robin Bartleman, a Democrat from Weston, is leery of what that will mean in practice.
“I’m very nervous about it and I think we’re going to see bills tied to it, and I think we’re going to see rules and policies tied to it that we never expected. If you read Project 2025, it’s scary,” Bartleman said during a Monday morning news conference. “These are just a couple of paragraphs about what they’re going to do and the devil is going to be in the details.”
The Heritage Foundation is a conservative think tank. It authored Project 2025 in advance of the 2024 presidential election, a conservative policy blueprint for the incoming administration.
“I have to tell you, I was scared as hell when I read Project 2025, and the fact that The Heritage Foundation authored this, and they only gave us a few snippets of paragraphs, what does that look like in implementation? What does that mean for our public school teachers, what does that mean for our children?” Bartleman said.

During the board meeting last week, Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas said the principles in the statement are ones “that everyone across the board, on both sides of the aisle, can agree with.”
That didn’t ring true to House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell from Tampa. 
Driskell said Republican lawmakers and the governor are “trying to force this type of information down children’s throats, that it really is about trying to indoctrinate them with a conservative ideology, not really teaching them to think.”
Driskell said parents in her community “are concerned about the politicization of our public schools.”
The Heritage Foundation introduced the statement during the Conservative Vision of Education Conference in Phoenix, Arizona, in February. 
The declaration has seven categories: Parental choice and responsibility; transparency and accountability; truth and goodness; cultural transmission; character formation; academic excellence; and citizenship.

The Red-Blue Connector: A half-mile of subway that benefits an entire region 

HOW LONG IS too long to wait for all subway lines on the MBTA to be connected?  
100 years?  
This December, it will be 101 years since the Boston Globe first reported on the idea to connect the MBTA’s Red and Blue lines, noting that riders “using either the East Boston Tunnel [the Blue Line] or the Cambridge Subway [the Red Line] could change cars at Charles St, instead of transferring at Scollay Square and Park Street, the most congested parts of the whole system … This would have a distinct tendency to remove this congestion and would therefore be a highly desirable end in itself.” 
A century later, the Globe’s description remains accurate: The Red and Blue lines remain the only two subway lines on the T that do not connect. Riders must make two zigzag transfers, using the Green or Orange lines, to travel between them. Not only is it inconvenient for riders, it also increases congestion and decreases capacity at Park Street and Government Center. These pressures on system capacity will only worsen with time.  
It’s easy to look at the short length of the proposed Red-Blue Connector – less than half a mile – and mistake it for a project with small impact. Nothing could be further from the truth. Connecting the Red Line and Blue Line is a small project with a huge impact, and the time to do it is now, as Massachusetts General Hospital is in the process of rebuilding its campus facing Cambridge Street above the proposed subway connection.  
Today, many of the region’s major job centers and key destinations, like the Longwood Medical Area, Back Bay, and Downtown Boston, can all be reached from every corner of the rapid transit network with at most a single transfer. Employers in these areas (and indeed anywhere along the Green and Orange lines) can therefore leverage excellent transit access to attract talent from across the region.  
Employers in Cambridge, however – including in Kendall Square, one of Greater Boston’s biggest job and innovation hubs – are systemically disadvantaged in this respect. Unlike their peers, these businesses, labs, and schools can’t effectively appeal to some of the densest neighborhoods in the region, in East Boston, Revere, and surrounding communities. Both employers and residents suffer from suboptimal access to transit and opportunities, due to the gap separating the Red and Blue lines. 
Many riders endure this tedious commute nevertheless, straining all other subway lines in the process. As described by the Globe a century ago, these riders have no choice but to squeeze on to already-crowded Green and Orange Line trains, and already-crowded platforms at Park Street and Downtown Crossing stations, all because of this 2,500-foot gap in our subway system. 
The Red-Blue Connector closes this gap. It balances capacity and mobility on our rapid transit network, gives Kendall employers the benefit of better access for potential employees, and gives Blue Line riders better access to jobs in Kendall and elsewhere along the Red Line. Even riders who never set foot on the Blue Line would benefit, as crowding is reduced on trains and platforms throughout downtown. 
The Red-Blue Connector also builds for the future. A total of 10,000 new units of housing are planned for Suffolk Downs, at the East Boston-Revere border: Red-Blue allows Cambridge employers to compete for those workers.  
Suffolk Downs also plans to have office space for 25,000 jobs. Red-Blue makes those jobs more readily accessible by transit to residents along the entirety of the Red Line corridor, from the South Shore, Dorchester and South Boston, to Cambridge, Somerville, Arlington, Belmont, and other communities west of Boston. Cities across Greater Boston are strengthened by connecting the Red and Blue lines. 
But Red-Blue – like all transit – isn’t just about jobs. Extending the Blue Line to the Red Line’s Charles/MGH stop provides patients and health care workers alike direct access to one of the best hospitals in the country.  
Connecting the Red and Blue lines would also cut down on vehicular traffic to Logan Airport. Many travelers using the Red Line, from the entire length of the corridor, are discouraged from seeking access to Logan Airport via the Silver Line bus from South Station as they must endure traffic in the Ted Williams Tunnel. These same travelers often opt for an Uber or Lyft to Logan today.  
With Red-Blue, they would have the benefit of a convenient and reliable two-seat ride to Logan terminal shuttles. No harbor tunnel traffic, no rideshare surge pricing, no missed flights – just convenience via transit. Reducing traffic congestion and emissions in East Boston, an environmental justice community, would be another signature benefit of this long-overdue connection.  
Red-Blue meets the MBTA’s short-term goals of increasing system capacity and resilience, and shouldn’t be thought of as a long-term project. Phil Eng, the MBTA general manager and the state’s interim transportation secretary, in a recent interview, said he supported investments “within our existing infrastructure, [to] build up more resiliency in our system.”  
A new connection at Charles/MGH unlocks additional capacity across the entire system, and enhances resilience by offering redundant transfer points, especially when the Green and Orange lines are suspended for maintenance and upgrades. Connecting the Red and Blue lines fits comfortably within Eng’s vision of supporting rider needs, regional access, and state of good repair. 
Beyond addressing the urgent needs of the present and building for the future, Red-Blue presents an unprecedented opportunity to integrate Mass. General Hospital directly with a new transit station. But Mass General Brigham, MGH’s parent entity, is moving quickly, with work on the second of the new MGH clinical care buildings on Cambridge Street likely to begin in the next 18 months – just around the corner. 
Fortunately, we are not starting from square one. Red-Blue has been well-studied for decades, including as recently as 2021, when its cost was estimated at $850 million.  
In 2018, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation released an update to the 2010 Draft Environmental Impact Report, finding that, unlike many expensive subway projects that utilize tunnel boring machines (TBMs), Red-Blue could instead leverage the cost-effective “cut-and-cover” method.  
Cambridge Street is nearly double the width of the proposed tunnel, significantly reducing utility relocation challenges and providing additional space at street level to accommodate construction. The 2018 update also found that using the top-down cut-and-cover method would enable the full restoration of the sidewalk and roadway early in the process, returning the street to normalcy while work continues underground.  
A well-designed, value-engineered Red-Blue Connector would most likely cost no more than $1 billion through completion. Its significant benefits in comparison – access to key destinations, economic growth, and reductions in emissions – make Red-Blue a low-risk, high-value proposition. 
Municipal and state leaders representing Boston and Cambridge should direct the MBTA to develop a credible plan for completion of the project by 2030. The plan should also aim for 100 percent design and preparation of construction procurement documents as soon as possible.  
Full funding for the project should come from the Commonwealth; waiting or hoping for federal funds, especially in the current political context, is unrealistic and simply a way to delay the project. The city of Boston and the MBTA also need to agree on a location for the connector’s ventilation system – a decision that remains a stubborn barrier to progress – as a matter of urgency. 
Red-Blue has been proposed for at least 100 years. Its profound impact includes better access to jobs, health care, and Logan Airport – a transit access trifecta – for everyone across the region. And the perfect time is now. We cannot afford to wait another hundred years to address a glaring and detrimental gap in our rapid transit network.

Why the Democratic supermajority on Beacon Hill won’t pass Democratic bills

FIVE AND A HALF hours into a tedious rules debate at the Massachusetts State House in January 2019, acting Speaker Tom Petrolati ordered a roll call vote on a noncontroversial amendment, and voted no. Within seconds, red lights, representing “no” votes, lit up the electronic vote-tally board in the House chamber as dozens of rank-and-file members followed his lead.  
Then, realizing he had made a mistake (but not realizing his mic was still on), Petrolati stammered: “It’s a yes?… Switch ’em. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes. Yes!”  
After his vote on the large display board flipped to green for “yes,” so, too, did the votes of at least 63 Democratic representatives. (The video of this moment remains on the Legislature’s website, beginning at 5:35:49.)  
Beacon Hill Roll Call reporter Bob Katzen’s write-up of the all-too-common event didn’t mince words: “Did these 63 even know what they were voting on? Did they care? What would cause them to switch their votes other than they decided to follow the ‘suggestion’ of the speaker?”  
In a separate interview, Rep. Russell Holmes, one of the few at that time to openly criticize the system, offered a blunt assessment: “The entire legislative establishment is a scam. [The Speaker] is like a shepherd leading the sheep. Most reps vote the way he tells them to vote.” 
Having grown up in deep-blue Massachusetts, I viewed politics through a national lens. Beyond knowing my rep’s names, I never thought much about what goes on under the Golden Dome on the corner of Boston Common.  
Like many, I assumed that Massachusetts was liberal, and therefore, so was our State House. If a progressive policy was doable, the same electorate that chose Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey would have chosen a Legislature excited to make it happen.  
That assumption crumbled when I started working on a documentary about why daylight saving time (DST) reform won’t pass the Legislature, despite broad public support. 
What began as an attempt to use the Legislature’s clunky website to trace the path of a DST bill quickly turned into a ten-month (and counting) investigation. Interviews with lawmakers, activists, and reporters all confirmed the same truth of how laws actually pass in Massachusetts: Just a few members of leadership decide which bills live or die. Debate is staged, and the real lawmaking happens behind closed doors.  
Massachusetts has one of the least transparent, least productive legislatures in the country. Despite our state’s progressive reputation — and a Democratic supermajority in both chambers — our State House won’t pass basic party priorities. This includes bills to:  

Prevent offshore corporate tax dodging 


Implement LGBTQ+ inclusive sex-ed 


Provide menstrual products in schools, prison, and shelters 


Stop wage theft  


Enact same-day voter registration 


End state/local collaboration with ICE 


Ban cash bail and mandatory minimum sentences 

The “Act to Stop Wage Theft” referenced above? It had a supermajority of co-sponsors in the House a few years ago, yet it never received a vote. Here’s why.  
Each law must go through several committees led by handpicked allies of the leadership; committee votes were completely opaque until mounting public pressure spurred changes this summer.  
These committees serve as bottlenecks, allowing leadership to effectively choose what bills get a vote by the full chamber. When committee chairs go against the Speaker or Senate president, they risk losing this position and the extra salary that comes with it. Representatives have even lost pay and power just for being critical of leadership.  
Former rep. Denise Provost has pointed out that leadership used to poll members before major bills. But after a threshold of lawmakers with leadership-controlled stipends was reached, the polling stopped.  
This top-down dynamic should frustrate Republicans as well: Minority Leader Brad Jones cooperates with the Speaker to block some roll-call votes Democrats prefer not to be recorded on.   
No House committee is more important than the Ways and Means Committee. Internal rules require that many bills go through that committee, before the full House can vote on them, making Speaker Mariano’s handpicked chair, Rep. Aaron Michlewitz, one of the most powerful people in the Bay State. 
For big money industries, like private insurance, this structure is a gift. Instead of persuading 160 representatives to kill or pass a bill, they only need to win over a small handful of gatekeepers. And if you wonder what their preferred method of persuasion might be, just look at Michlewitz’s campaign reports: Since 2009, he’s run unopposed, yet between 2020 and 2024 he raised $1,995,765.21.  
Beacon Hill’s contempt for the public will is perfectly illustrated by a largely forgotten incident from two decades ago, whose key players now run the Legislature. 
In 2003, Massachusetts residents petitioned to put a constitutional right to affordable health care on the ballot. “Romneycare,” the bipartisan Massachusetts law that served as a blueprint for the Affordable Care Act, was still being shaped, and activists feared lawmakers would gut patient protections to appease the powerful insurance lobby.  
After collecting over 71,000 signatures to begin the process for amending the Massachusetts Constitution, the hard part was finished. All that remained was getting 25 percent of the Legislature to approve it in two sessions. When the first vote confirmed it, 153-41, the second seemed like a formality. However, the vote would never happen.  
When the next session convened, House and Senate leadership backed an effort to send the question to study, a procedural trick to kill a measure without taking a public stance. Lawmakers fell in line, 118-76, and voters never got to decide if affordable health care should become a right.  
Then-committee chairs Ron Mariano and Karen Spilka were among the few legislators to openly argue for the motion on the floor, a gamble that should have made them the face of killing affordable health care. Ultimately, their gamble paid off: Today, House Speaker Mariano and Senate President Spilka each sit atop massive campaign accounts fueled by lots of money from the health care and insurance industry.  
Today, the “study” maneuver is a convenient tactic to quietly kill bills, as citizens are misled into thinking their bill is being actively considered; lobbyists know better.  
When activists challenged the scuttled ballot question at the state’s highest court, justices agreed that lawmakers violated their constitutional duty by failing to hold a second vote on the proposal, but the court said it had no authority to compel action by lawmakers under the separation of powers. The only recourse, the justices said, was at the ballot box.  
It’s taken nearly 20 years, but recent events suggest that political recourse may finally be within reach, and that frustration with Beacon Hill’s establishment is near a breaking point.  
First came last fall’s closely watched contest in Cambridge, when Democratic union leader Evan MacKay took on Rep. Marjorie Decker, a fixture in local politics, making legislative reform the cornerstone of their primary challenge. MacKay attacked Decker for repeatedly taking votes that strengthened leadership’s power over rank-and-file members, undermining the progressive values she claimed to support.  
To say Decker was favored would be an understatement: Her campaign had a four-to-one spending advantage, bolstered by a rooftop fundraiser that drew a who’s who of party insiders, including Gov. Maura Healey. Despite all that, MacKay came within 41 votes of an upset, marking the first time Decker dropped below 83 percent support as an incumbent. 
Then, in June, after mounting criticism for their slowest start in 40 years (six laws passed in six months), legislative leadership caved to rule reforms they had stonewalled for years. Public committee votes, publicly available testimony, and plain-language bill summaries may sound like basic democratic norms, but on Beacon Hill, they were fought tooth and nail. Their sudden passage was such a shock that one activist excitedly texted me: “It looks like we won on nearly everything.” 
Perhaps most telling of all, 72 percent of voters supported a ballot question last November authorizing the state auditor to audit the Legislature, an unmistakable mandate that Beacon Hill can’t police itself. Like clockwork, the Legislature brazenly ignored the result, arguing it was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers.  
Let’s be clear: this argument is cover for preserving unchecked power. The auditor is an independent, voter-elected watchdog; she’s neither appointed by nor answerable to the governor. She is “executive” only in a technical, structural sense, not in any chain of command way that would trigger separation of powers concerns.  
If you’re an aspiring activist who feels waving around a “No Kings” sign falls short of impactful activism, look at state government as an avenue for change. Lobbying your state rep will do far more than mailing a postcard to Wisconsin for a judicial election. Medicare for all is likely to happen here long before Congress secures a filibuster-proof majority.  
If your rep is one of the 85 percent of House Democrats who voted with the Speaker 100 percent of the time in 2024 (full list here), ask them directly: Are they proud that their paycheck and ability to represent the district depends on their loyalty to the House speaker? Are they open to supporting new leadership and new rules that put constituents first?  
And if they shrug you off, connect with local advocacy groups and find a candidate worth backing, or consider becoming that candidate yourself. Only under the threat of losing their seats will rank-and-file members reclaim their power to oust authoritative leaders and rewrite the rules to favor voters.  
For decades, Beacon Hill has shamelessly ignored voters, because the public has never held them accountable. Mariano and Spilka weren’t shamed for helping kill affordable health care, they were rewarded. But sooner or later, enough people will learn how democracy in Massachusetts is a lie. When they do, leadership’s iron grip will crack, not because those in power wanted to change, but because voters finally forced them to.

,DC,2025-11-17 18:07:20+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump in about-face urges US House Republicans to vote to release Epstein files,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-about-face-urges-us-house-republicans-vote-release-epstein-files,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Sunday night abruptly changed his tune, telling House Republicans to vote on a bill to compel the Department of Justice to release all files related to its investigation into sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 awaiting federal trial.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat ‘Shutdown.’”Trump continued in his signature style of arbitrary capital letters: “The Department of Justice has already turned over tens of thousands of pages to the Public on “Epstein,” are looking at various Democrat operatives (Bill Clinton, Reid Hoffman, Larry Summers, etc.) and their relationship to Epstein, and the House Oversight Committee can have whatever they are legally entitled to, I DON’T CARE!” The House is expected to vote Tuesday after a bipartisan discharge petition garnered 218 signatures last week, forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana, to bring a bill to the floor that would compel the DOJ to release Epstein investigation materials. It’s unclear whether Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., would bring the legislation to a floor vote in the GOP-controlled chamber.Kentucky’s Thomas Massie co-sponsored the petition with Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif. Three other House Republicans, Georgia’s Marjorie Taylor Greene, South Carolina’s Nancy Mace and Colorado’s Lauren Boebert, joined all Democrats in signing. The House’s newest Democrat, Arizona’s Adelita Grijalva, became the 218th signature after she was sworn in Wednesday by Johnson, following weeks in which the chamber was out of session. Johnson refused to swear in Grijalva until after the government shutdown, breaking a precedent of swearing in new members when the chamber is out.Johnson has not been in favor of a vote, and rather has pointed to the ongoing House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform’s investigation into the Epstein documents.Committee Republicans released more than 20,000 pages of Epstein’s emails on Wednesday, many of which contained Trump’s name. The committee, led by Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., revealed the massive trove of emails from Epstein’s estate after the panel’s Democrats released a selection of the correspondence that included the allegation that Trump “knew about the girls because he asked ghislaine to stop.”Epstein was referring to Ghislaine Maxwell, his co-conspirator, who would later be convicted on federal sex trafficking charges.Emails and subpoenasTrump denies any involvement with Epstein’s alleged crimes, and has said that he kicked Epstein out of his private Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, because Epstein had poached young female staffers from the club. Epstein was convicted in Florida of soliciting minors for sex in 2008. Trump had a well-documented friendship with Epstein, who surrounded himself with the rich and powerful.Committee Republicans did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment Wednesday on how long the committee has had possession of the emails and their timing of the data dump.The committee has subpoenaed several people in relation to the probe, including Maxwell, several former U.S. attorneys general and former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Trump dispatched Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who is also the president’s former personal defense attorney, to interview Maxwell in a Florida prison in July. According to transcripts, Maxwell told Blanche that she “never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”Soon after, Maxwell was moved to a minimum-security prison in Texas, and House Democrats claimed this month that a whistleblower revealed the convicted sex offender was being “pampered” by the warden. House Democrats also claimed the whistleblower revealed Maxwell was preparing a commutation application to Trump for release from her 20-year sentence.FBI memoThe FBI issued a July memo stating the Department of Justice would not be releasing any further information on the government’s sex trafficking investigation into Epstein.The announcement sparked a firestorm of demands over the summer to release all investigative material, even among Trump’s supporters in Congress and far-right media influencers, including Megyn Kelly and the late Charlie Kirk. Trump promised on the campaign trail to release the files.Since the FBI memo, a magnifying glass has been fixed on Trump’s past relationship with Epstein. The president sued The Wall Street Journal for reporting on a 50th birthday card Trump allegedly gave to Epstein. The card featured a cryptic message and a doodle of a naked woman with Trump’s apparent signature mimicking pubic hair. Trump denies that he created and signed the birthday doodle.The Journal also reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi briefed the president in May that his name appeared in the Epstein case files. The context in which his name appeared is unclear. Trump has denied all reports.A series in the Miami Herald in 2018 by journalist Julie K. Brown drew wide attention to Epstein’s crimes and Trump’s appointment in 2017 of former Miami federal prosecutor Alex Acosta, who cut a deal in 2008 to end a federal investigation into Epstein, as the secretary of Labor.",,,,2025-11-17 13:58:26.488514

Glenn Youngkin from serving on three Virginia university governing boards. Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares appealed to the court after the Fairfax County Circuit Court suspended eight governing board appointments from serving at George Mason University[...],"The Supreme Court of Virginia building in Downtown Richmond. (Robert Zullo/ Virginia Mercury)The Virginia Supreme Court has refused to take up a case that suspended multiple appointees by Gov. Glenn Youngkin from serving on three Virginia university governing boards.
Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares appealed to the court after the Fairfax County Circuit Court suspended eight governing board appointments from serving at George Mason University, Virginia Military Institute and the University of Virginia. The 15-member Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections rejected 22 appointments in the past year and the issue has been one of several that rocked Virginia’s higher education landscape in 2025.
The court heard arguments from the attorney general’s office, representing the three governing board rectors, asking for a temporary injunction be lifted in order for appointees to serve less than three weeks ago. Attorneys representing the nine Democratic state senators who requested the temporary injunction  also made arguments asking for the lower court’s order to be upheld.
In its order on Monday, the high court said the case must be allowed to continue and that it will not review the temporary decision, but the rectors can appeal the overall final outcome later.
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, one of the senators that joined the request for the injunction, posted on social media that the Supreme Court of Virginia “affirmed the Senate P&E Committees authority to reject gubernatorial nominations because MAGA rules don’t work in Virginia where we still have a rule of law that Youngkin and Miyares have to follow.”
In Virginia, when the governor nominates a candidate to a board or commission to a seat, they need the General Assembly’s approval. During each legislative session, it is common practice for the General Assembly to vote on the list of gubernatorial candidates in both chambers.
However, senators rejected the appointees outside of the regular session, a move they said would protect Virginia’s institutions of higher learning from partisan attacks but that Youngkin and Miyares said flouted the law. 
The attorney general’s office did not immediately comment or respond to what its next step will be following the Supreme Court’s decision. 
The attorney general’s office had previously argued that the circuit court’s decision was incorrect, asserting that the court lacked jurisdiction and that the vote by the senate committee did not meet the requirement for a final refusal because there were other ways for appointments to be confirmed.
However, the senators, some of whom serve on the committee, argued that said the committee’s decision to block the board nominees was a “definitive” refusal.
No trial date has been set yet in Fairfax County. It’s uncertain when the case will continue, as Youngkin’s administration prepares to transition out of power and with Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s team being sworn in mid-January.

Even though a federal judge ordered him to disburse the funds, President Donald Trump held up the payments to 42 million Americans starting on Nov. 1. 
That drove record numbers of families to Ohio food pantries.
Trump claimed he couldn’t pay the food benefits because of the partial shutdown of the federal government. But they were paid in every prior shutdown, and the courts ruled that not only could Trump pay them, he had a duty to.
The food program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is administered by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. 
Bill Teets, a spokesman, on Monday said that his department expects to get the food benefits to low-income Ohioans by midweek.

On Friday, the agency issued a written statement saying that it expected to get the money into hungry Ohioans’ pockets by early this week.
“Ohio has begun the process of calculating the full benefit households should have received in November,” it said. 
“It will then deduct the partial amount already paid. Over the weekend, ODJFS will begin testing to ensure the accuracy of payments. Once testing is successful, authorization for those amounts will be transmitted early next week to Ohio’s Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) vendor to issue to recipients through their Ohio Direction (EBT) card.”
Recipients of SNAP tend to have low incomes and benefits are modest. 
Average benefits for a family of three are $588 a month, or a little more than $6.00 per person, per day.
If you’re a single mother of two with just $7,200 a year in net income, your monthly food benefit is $564, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Of the 1.42 million Ohioans who received SNAP in 2022, just over 1 million, or 71%, were children, elderly or disabled, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Nearly three-fourths of able-bodied adult SNAP recipients worked at some point in the year in 2015, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported in April.
The restoration of benefits may only be temporary for many Ohioans.
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act Trump signed last summer contains the biggest cuts ever made to the program.
That could cost more than 700,000 Ohioans their benefits, Policy Matters Ohio reported last week.

(Photo: Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s signature on the document pardoning former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada was among those replaced by the Justice Department because it closely matched others when the president signed a spate of pardons in early November.
The Associated Press reported that the Justice Department put the pardons of Casada and others such as former New York Mets outfielder Darryl Strawberry and former New York police sergeant Michael McMahon online with identical copies of the president’s signature before correcting them because of what was termed a “technical error.”
After online commentators questioned the signatures’ authenticity, the Trump administration replaced the identical copies and claimed the president signed all the pardons himself on Nov. 7, according to the report. The pardons would not be affected by the signatures.  
Trump previously lambasted former President Joe Biden for using an autopen to sign documents.
In addition to pardoning Casada, the president issued a pardon to the former speaker’s ex-chief of staff, Cade Cothren, in the same time frame.
Casada pardon
Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, who is speaker of the Senate, and House Speaker Cameron Sexton both said recently they disagreed with the pardons.
U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson, a former FBI agent and assistant U.S. attorney appointed to the bench by Trump, adjudicated the case and sentenced Casada to 36 months in prison and ordered him to pay a $30,000 fine for his role in a fraud and kickback scheme. Richardson sentenced Cothren to 30 months and ordered him to pay a $25,000 fine.
Casada and Cothren were convicted of setting up a secret company called Phoenix Solutions that tapped into the state’s postage and printing program that provides House members $3,000 a year for constituent mailers. In return for kickbacks, Casada and former Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty and testified against the pair, steered lawmakers’ business to Phoenix Solutions, which was secretly run by Cothren with the front name of “Matthew Phoenix.”
Smith was sentenced to eight months for her role in the scheme. She is seeking a presidential pardon according to the Chattanooga Times Free Press.
Casada and Smith concealed Cothren’s identity in the scheme because they felt lawmakers wouldn’t do business with their company if they knew the former chief of staff was involved. He resigned his post amid a racist and sexist texting scandal that also engulfed Casada.

Thanksgiving is almost here, and so is one of the season’s most joyful traditions. Turkey trots across Delaware offer families, friends, and solo runners a chance to get moving before the holiday hustle. From scenic coastal loops to long-running community favorites, there is a trot for every pace and every part of the state.
Newark’s 53rd Annual Turkey Trot
Newark hosts one of Delaware’s longest-running Thanksgiving races. The event takes place on Saturday, November 22, 2025, with the 10K beginning at 9:00 a.m., and the 5K starting at 10:30 a.m. at Handloff Park on Barksdale Road. The course winds through neighborhood streets, and proceeds support the James F. Hall Scholarship Fund, which helps local youth participate in recreation programs.
Sea Colony Turkey Trot in Bethany Beach
For a seaside setting, this event is hard to beat. The 22nd annual Turkey Trot 5K takes place on Sunday, November 30, 2025, with the race starting at 9:00 a.m. at the Sea Colony Fitness Center in Bethany Beach. The event benefits Special Olympics Delaware and Delaware Womenade, making it both scenic and meaningful for runners and walkers.
Bethany-Fenwick Turkey Trot
A festive, low-key option perfect for families, this untimed 2-mile run and walk in downtown Bethany Beach takes place on Thursday, November 27, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. Participants often dress in costume, and finish along the boardwalk. The event supports the Bethany Beach Volunteer Fire Company, along with other local charities, adding a strong community spirit to the morning.
Wilmington Thanksgiving Day MS Run
For those looking for a longer challenge, Wilmington’s Thanksgiving Day MS Run offers a 10K, a 5K run, a 5K walk, and a children’s fun run. This event is held on Thursday, November 27, 2025, with a start time around 9:00 a.m. All proceeds support the National MS Society, and its work to help individuals and families affected by multiple sclerosis.
Before You Lace Up
Choosing the right trot depends on your style. Here are a few tips to help shape your Thanksgiving morning:

Register early to guarantee race shirts, which often run out quickly.
• Dress in layers, and prepare for crisp November weather.
• Plan for parking and road closures, especially at coastal and city events.
• Bring family, friends, and even costumed pets, if the event allows.
• Enjoy the post-race cheer, photos, and sense of community before heading home for your holiday celebration.

Whether you are a seasoned runner or a casual walker, Delaware’s turkey trots offer a cheerful way to kick off Thanksgiving Day. Grab your sneakers, gather your flock, and join the fun that makes these events one of the most spirited traditions of the season.

The latest such move by the Legislature is a law passed earlier this year that restricts local governments from regulating development. Two separate lawsuits have been filed to block enforcement of Senate Bill 180. Twenty-five cities and counties call the law the “largest incursion into local home rule authority” since adoption of the Florida Constitution in 1968.
“When Tallahassee preempts local governments from being able to make decisions for themselves, you’re at that point adversely impacting the will of the people, and that is something that has to change,” Demings told a Phoenix reporter while speaking on WMNF-88.5 radio in Tampa on Friday.
“As governor, I will certainly look to work closely with our local governments to give appropriate authority, but also at the same time make certain that we have fair standards across the state of Florida with the understanding that those standards can be applied to allow the people closest to government and local residents to be able to make decisions in the best interests of those that they serve,” said Demings, entering his eighth and final year as Orange County mayor, following a decade (2008-2018) as sheriff.
Demings announced his candidacy earlier this month, joining former Republican U.S. Rep. David Jolly as the highest-ranking Democrats so far to enter the race to succeed Ron DeSantis. Southwest U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds and former Florida House Speaker Paul Renner are the top Republicans in the race, with Donalds — already endorsed by Donald Trump — leading in early polls.
Demings says his decision to enter the race was not sudden. “Many people,” he said, have urged him over several years to enter the gubernatorial sweepstakes, in which the eventual Democratic nominee becomes the decided underdog in a state now with 1.4 million more registered Republicans than Democrats, according to the state’s Division of Elections.
“We need change in Florida,” Demings said. “We are seeing some of the most divisive politics that I’ve seen in my lifetime and, as a result of that, I’m in the race looking for change to bring about some common sense, some normalcy, some diplomacy in government.” He added that housing affordability, education, and the high costs of health care are at the top of his agenda.
Demings said he’d like to work with the private sector “to create partnerships to figure out how we can bring down and reduce the cost of childcare for individuals within this state.”
On the topic of education, Florida this week became the first state to adopt The Phoenix Declaration, authored by The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that formulated the Project 2025 plan for Donald Trump’s second administration.
The Phoenix Declaration outlines six core principles for Florida’s education system, including one labeled “citizenship,” which states, “Students should learn the whole truth about America — its merits and its failings — without obscuring that America is a great source of good in the world and that we have a tradition that is worth passing on.”
“We’ve seen progress, but progress still needs to be made to make certain that we have equitable access to quality education within our state,” Demings responded when asked about the policy.
“I don’t believe that we should whitewash the history of our nation, and some people, what they’re trying to do is whitewash the history of our nation. Tell the truth, the good and the bad about what happened to us as a country as part of the strength of our nation.
“I do believe that we remain the United States of America, ‘one nation under God, indivisible, with Liberty and Justice’ for everyone. But every day that’s a struggle. That’s a struggle when we see the politics of the day trying to further divide us, rather than unite us, and that’s not right. Where we have countless book bans, where we’re trying to somehow really make the history for some people in this country more palatable. Well, that’s not right. Tell the whole story, because that is a foundational purpose of our country is to bring people from all over the world.”
The DeSantis administration has strongly pushed back on the book ban allegation, insisting that never happend. However, PEN America, a nonprofit advocating for freedom of expression, reported last month that Florida removed more than 2,000 books from classrooms and libraries last year. The Florida Department of Education reported that 444 books were removed or discontinued by one of Florida’s school boards during the 2024-25 school year.
Immigration
Demings was involved in a dispute with Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier this summer regarding an addendum to modify the county’s 287(g) Warrant Service Officer (WSO) Memorandum of Agreement that allows county jail officials to transport immigration detainees to ICE facilities. Demings ultimately signed the agreement after Uthmeier threatened to remove him and all six county commissioners from office if he did not.
If Florida enforces federal immigration laws, it should do so “humanely with dignity and respect for the people who are trying to come here,” Demings said.
“I don’t believe America can be as great as it can be without allowing immigrant populations who bring something to the table, who are able to work on our farms and agriculture, who are able to work in our higher education institutions to bring the types of science and research to help us as Americans better live and better cooperate across the world, the globe, in terms of world and global peace,” he said.
Demings says he’s poised to get on the campaign trail and engage in a “listening tour,” which will include an appearance at the Florida Association of Counties in Tampa later this week.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-17 12:57:38.094074

But she ended up in court after the home’s true owners, Key Street Trust, filed an affidavit for her removal.","Latasha Chairse said she believed she was on the cusp of homeownership, her mystifying story goes.
In early 2023, the cafeteria worker and her three kids moved into a house on Key Street in south Jackson after a bad experience with a prior landlord. The keys were in the doorknob, so Chairse said she walked right in and got to work cleaning the dusty home, repainting and installing a new water heater. 
“I treated this house like it was my home,” she said. “Like it was one of my children.” 
There was just one problem. It was never Chairse’s home. 
Last week, the 37-year-old pregnant, single mother became the first person in Jackson expelled from a dwelling under a new state law called the Real Property Owners Protection Act, said a Jackson Police Department captain whose team served the order to vacate. A municipal court judge declared her a squatter.

Chairse says she believed she was living in a state-owned, tax-forfeited property. But she ended up in court after the home’s true owners, Key Street Trust, filed an affidavit for her removal. The trust had owned the home since 2008 and was hoping to sell it to a prospective buyer who would not purchase the property while Chairse occupied it, said Dallis Ketchum, a local real estate agent and the property manager. 
Ketchum said he had tried to tell Chairse that she was squatting, but Chairse insisted the home was hers.
“I don’t know that she actually understood what she was doing at all, but frankly, that’s unknown to me,” he said. “It’s a peculiar situation.”
Ketchum and a local attorney for the trust, Stephen Younger, could have filed eviction proceedings in Hinds County Justice Court, but Ketchum said they weren’t confident in that process.
“What’s most difficult is not necessarily getting it through the court,” Ketchum said of eviction proceedings. “It’s getting a constable to ever call you back.” 
They decided to wait to take action until the new law, designed to make these removals swifter than an eviction, went into effect earlier this year. Under the new process, the owner filed an affidavit with the Jackson Police Department. Police served her with the citation, giving Chairse three days to contest the eviction in court, which she did. Jackson Municipal Court Judge Jeff Reynolds could have ordered Chairse out of the home within 24 hours by law but decided to give her 10 days. 
Chairse’s last day in the home is this Thursday.

In an interview, Chairse listed several reasons why she believed the property was available. She said a man in a white truck outside the house next door told her that Key Street house was owned by the state. 
Chairse said she then went downtown in early 2023 and spoke to a woman in the Hinds County Tax Collector’s Office who told her that no one had paid taxes on the home since 2008, which is false, according to county records.
“I had told her that the house was abandoned and I was trying to see how I could get the house,” Chairse said. 
Chairse claimed the woman advised her that the home could become hers if she moved in and paid three years of taxes — an incorrect description of Mississippi’s tax forfeiture process and advice that a Hinds County Tax Collector’s Office employee said the office would not give. 
Chairse said she paid $21 to get a copy of the deed, certified in 2008, then left, believing she could continue to live there and eventually become the homeowner. 
“It was going to be under my name once I paid,” she said. 
A year or so after Charise moved in, a man knocked on her door. It was Ketchum. He told her that she was squatting and she had to leave. Chairse showed him the deed, complete with the name of the owner: Key Street Trust.
“It’s the deed that my owner had. And that was what was so perplexing to everyone,” Ketchum said. “It’s just a copy of the deed. That’s all.” 
Chairse had scrawled her name on the deed for good measure, as if it were a car title. 
“I just ended up signing it to keep people from trying to get it from me, cause I ain’t trust the man that came over there,” she said. 
“I put the tile down myself and painted this room,” said Latasha Chairse of a bedroom she renovated in the south Jackson home she and her family have lived in for nearly three years, Thursday, Nov. 13, 2025.  Credit: Vickie D. King/Mississippi Today
Chairse’s understanding of the process through which she could obtain the home lacked a key element: Mississippi’s tax sale, which occurs when an owner fails to pay property taxes on time. 
In fact, the Key Street home went to a tax sale in 2024 after Randall Martin, a beneficiary and owner of the trust, failed to pay the prior year’s taxes on time. An investment company scooped up the tax lien to the home. Chairse was none the wiser.
The tax sale does not transfer ownership of the home. The original owner can maintain their right to the home if the back due taxes are paid — or “redeemed” — within two years. 
Martin redeemed his ownership of the home on Jan. 23, 2025, paying the 2023 taxes he had missed, according to Hinds County Chancery Court records. Chairse claimed she paid one year of taxes on the home, but this is not reflected in the county’s records and would not have earned her any interest in the home had she paid.
“I had this meter put in three days after I moved in this house,” said Latasha Chairse at the south Jackson home she has been ordered removed from and labeled a squatter, Thursday, Nov. 13, 2025. Credit: Vickie D. King/Mississippi Today
Ketchum said it is very common for owners of investment properties to forget to pay taxes on time, because most homeowners are accustomed to the escrow attached to their monthly mortgage payment covering that duty each year. He added that he was hesitant to talk to the media about what happened in case Chairse was portrayed as “the victim.” 
“The victim is the property owner,” Ketchum said. “He did not have control of what he owned because he had a trespasser living in it.” 
Chairse, who stopped working in the final months of her pregnancy, said she purchased a new water heater for the home. For this, the judge gave her a break, rejecting the financial judgment that Key Street Trust was seeking for attorney’s fees.
The mother said she was in a desperate situation before she moved into the Key Street house. She claimed the water heater had broken at the home where she had been living and the landlord tried to make her pay to replace it.
“I look at it like it was a blessing,” she said of finding the house on Key Street. “I ain’t got no rent to pay. The only thing I got to pay is my utility and take care of my children. I said, ‘That’s all I need.’” 
Earlier this year, Chairse said she visited the Hinds County’s administrative offices in an attempt to pay taxes she believed she owed, only to learn they’d already been paid. 
“And I said it must’ve been God, then.” 
She’s not sure yet where she’ll end up now.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/13204205/Latasha-Charis-2-e1763162400729.jpg,,,2025-11-17 12:57:38.094074

In this image from Oct. 25, 2025, Whipple speaks to a group of Democrats at Wichita State University. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector) TOPEKA — Brandon Whipple considered himself a seasoned politician prior to running for Wichita mayor, but years of legislative wrangling didn’t prepare him for an attack so bizarre and a coverup so flawed it consumed the political career of three conspirators.
Whipple, a Democrat who served four terms in the Kansas House, was elected mayor of the state’s largest city in 2019. He prevailed despite a misinformation campaign designed to destroy Whipple’s credibility and boost the candidacy of his rival, Republican incumbent Jeff Longwell. The strategy was to weaken Whipple by posting a salacious video to social media that featured women alleging sexual harassment among state legislators. The video viewed at least 400,000 times contained the statement: “Stop Brandon Whipple.”
Investigation and litigation led to evidence implicating House Rep. Michael Capps, Sedgwick County Commissioner Michael O’Donnell and Wichita City Council member James Clendenin in the conspiracy. The GOP trio were undone by disclosure of an audio recording of them discussing how to blame other Republicans for the malicious attack. Longwell was quoted as saying the “three stooges probably cost me the election.”
“That whole campaign was pretty wild,” Whipple said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “Like, to the point, were it almost sounds like a ready-for-television type series.”
 
GOP donor’s tip
For the podcast, Whipple spoke publicly for the first time about a Republican donor who tipped him off to the GOP’s covert operation. The donor confided that he’d been asked to help fund the clandestine video.
The donor’s objection wasn’t tied to general loathing of ugly personal attacks, Whipple said. Instead, he said, the donor was upset someone had the audacity to violate an unwritten code among men forbidding the sharing of knowledge about illicit liaisons.
“He basically said that he wasn’t so much concerned with any type of extramarital type activities that men do. He was concerned that some men would actually tell on other men,” Whipple said.
Whipple said a lawsuit produced texts shared among the perpetrators in which they reveled at the chance to damage Whipple’s marriage and career. Their viciousness was alarming, he said.
“They really hated me. It’s nuts,” he said. “We’re attacking people and their character and their families. We’re not just saying, ‘Well, you voted this way.’ That was really eye opening to me.”
In 2020, Capps lost his House reelection bid. O’Donnell and Clendenin both resigned from office.
Whipple, who described himself as a moderate Democrat, said his mayoral reelection loss in 2023 was tied to several factors. Whipple said he made exploitable mistakes as mayor. He irritated voters with a mask mandate during the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the election exposed the reality of competing against a candidate with donors eager to spend eight or nine times as much as he could.
Lily Wu, a former Wichita television journalist and conservative, ousted Whipple. She had benefit of a $190,000 investment by Americans for Prosperity. She raised about $440,000 for her campaign, a record for a Wichita mayoral contest.
“There’s something flattering, but also weird, when someone spends about $1 million to beat you in an election,” he said.
 
Learning curve
Whipple was raised in New Hampshire and earned an associate’s degree in 2003 from Hesser College. At 21, he moved to Wichita for an AmeriCorps assignment working with at-risk high school students. He earned a sociology degree and a master’s degree in public administration at Wichita State University. He received a doctorate in leadership studies from Franklin Pierce University in New Hampshire.
He got into electoral politics in 2006 while working on Kansas legislative campaigns. He personally lost his first campaign for the Kansas House in 2010 despite knocking on 10,000 residential doors.
“Nothing’s worse than losing. It’s very public. It’s embarrassing,” he said. “Of course, I said I was never going to run again and I was done with politics.”
Given a second bite at the apple, Whipple won a House seat in 2012. It happened not because he knocked on a certain number of homes or hit targets for telephone calls or text messages.
Success hinged on connections with people made while listening more than speaking, he said.
“The takeaway from that is this isn’t a numbers game,” Whipple said. “It’s not about the amount of conversations you have. It’s the quality of conversation.”
 
Defining success
Whipple said a member of the majority party in the Legislature could reasonably define success as prevailing on policy votes. Members of a minority party had to look beyond those totals, he said.
“The Legislature is a toxic place, which means if I’m up there debating an amendment or a bill, I better bring it. I better be prepared, because Republicans are going to line up and they’re going to take shots at me,” he said. “In the Capitol, a lot of times, it wasn’t just getting the ‘yes’ votes or even the ‘no’ votes. Sometimes it was just getting the message out of why this is important.”
Whipple said some people approached service in the House or Senate as a retirement gig. Others were there to feel important or to be entertained, he said.
“If you really want to make change, you really want to get good stuff done, you got to put in that constructive time. If not, it’s very easy to also be the person who kind of gets a reputation for drinking too many margaritas.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Brandon-Whipple-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-17 11:57:06.173242

A founding member of Troop 1024 in Sussex County, and the three Scouts from New Castle County, recently completed the Rank of Eagle Scout.
Brandywine Hundred, Del.—Emma Oehmke has become the first member of Scouts BSA Troop 1024 to earn the rank of Eagle Scout. This milestone, Ray Teat, Scouting Executive for Del-Mar-Va Council, says, underscores both her personal dedication and the enduring importance of Scouting’s highest honor.
Oehmke, a founding member of Troop 1024 in Sussex County, recently completed her Eagle Scout Board of Review, capping years of advancement, leadership, and service. Her Eagle project, “Cat Scratchers for First State Animal Shelter,” provided handmade scratchers designed to reduce stress and promote comfort for cats in the shelter’s care.
The project logged 106 hours of work by Oehmke and 17 volunteers. By supplying the scratchers, the shelter can avoid purchasing them and instead direct limited funds toward food, medical supplies, and daily care for the animals.
Oehmke’s achievement comes as local Scout leaders note that, even in 2025, earning Eagle Scout remains a rare and highly respected accomplishment. Fewer than 10% of Scouts ever reach the rank, which requires at least 21 merit badges, leadership roles within a troop, and the planning and execution of a major community service project before age 18.
“Eagle Scout still means something in our communities,” Ray Teat, says, pointing to the combination of character, service, and perseverance demanded by the program. The rank signals that a young person has demonstrated responsibility, initiative, and the ability to see a complex project through from idea to completion.
The Blue Hen District of the Del-Mar-Va Council also recently celebrated three new Eagles, following a night of Boards of Review.
Troop 252 Scout, Braden Butherus, installed an outdoor shade sail area at the Bear Glasgow Family YMCA in Newark, providing a new, sun-safe gathering spot for youth programs and community activities.
Naomi Dominick, of Troop 2522, became the first Eagle Scout in her troop. Her project focused on repairing outdoor picnic tables at The Tome School in North East, Maryland, improving a heavily used outdoor space for students and families.
Alex Beaudette, of Troop 252 in Newark, removed brush, built benches, and repaired a gate at St. John Holy Angels Catholic Cemetery in Newark, Delaware, enhancing safety and accessibility at the historic site.
Another Troop 252 Scout, Braden Butherus, installed an outdoor shade sail area at the Bear Glasgow Family YMCA in Newark, providing a new, sun-safe gathering spot for youth programs and community activities.
Ray Tret says projects like these illustrate how the Eagle rank continues to shape local communities. From animal welfare and school improvements to cemeteries and youth facilities, each Eagle project leaves a tangible legacy of service.
The rank also carries practical benefits. Colleges and universities often recognize Eagle Scouts as proven leaders and self-starters, giving them an edge in admissions. Many institutions and civic groups offer scholarships specifically for Eagle Scouts. Employers commonly view the rank as a sign of reliability and follow-through, and in the U.S. Armed Forces, Eagle Scouts may be eligible to enlist at a higher pay grade.
Beyond credentials, supporters argue that the path to Eagle fosters confidence and resilience. Scouts learn to plan trips, lead patrols, manage projects, budget time and resources, and work through setbacks—skills that translate directly into adult life.
The program’s required merit badges cover areas such as citizenship, environmental stewardship, personal fitness,
and financial literacy, blending traditional Scouting values with modern expectations for well-rounded young adults.
For Oehmke, Dominick, Beaudette, and Butherus, the new patch on their uniform represents more than a final rank. In Scouting circles, the phrase “Once an Eagle, always an Eagle” reflects a lifetime identity that continues to open doors in education, careers and community service.
As Troop 1024, Troop 2522, and Troop 252 celebrate their newest Eagles, Ray Teat suggested that the accomplishments of these Scouts send an important message: In a fast-changing world, character, leadership, and service are still deeply valued—and Eagle Scout remains a trusted symbol of all three.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/579993741_1248817883959521_5652072965530108766_n-e1763395318274.jpg,,,2025-11-17 11:57:06.173242

There were 81 staffing triggers on Nov. 8, a few days before the end of the longest shutdown in U.S. history. “I want to thank the FAA’s dedicated safety team for keeping our skies secure during the longest government shutdown in our nation’s history and the country’s patience for putting safety first,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in the release. “Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, controllers have returned to their posts and normal operations can resume.”The government reopened after a 43-day shutdown on Nov. 12. Air traffic controllers were required to work without pay during the shutdown, leaving many to pursue second jobs and the workforce overstressed. The order to reduce flights, peaking at 6% at major airports, was meant to reduce that stress.The banners at the tops of major U.S. airline websites warning of canceled flights disappeared by Monday morning.One carrier, Southwest, replaced it with a message that its normal schedule would resume Monday. “Good news, the US government shutdown has ended,” the message read. “Our full schedule resumes on Nov 17.

Laurel Libby of Auburn announced Monday that she will not be seeking reelection next year. Instead, she’s partnering with a super PAC to try to get Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins reelected as part of a broader push to build an organizing network to gain more conservative power in Maine’s local and federal offices. 
Libby, whose term ends next year, is launching a state political action committee called Lead Maine that is dedicated to supporting conservative candidates and causes, as well as a federal super PAC, which can accept unlimited contributions, to turn out support for Collins in 2026. Libby created the federal super PAC, Lead Maine Committee, in partnership with Sentinel Action Fund, another conservative super PAC that’s an affiliate of the Heritage Foundation’s lobbying and advocacy arm.
“Defending this seat, and expanding conservative influence in the Maine Legislature, are critical to protecting our values from the far-Left policies of Janet Mills and her accomplices,” Libby said in a statement Monday. Gov. Janet Mills is vying for Collins’ seat along with oysterman and political novice Graham Platner. 
Sentinel Action Fund President Jessica Anderson also called Collins’ seat “key to protecting – and building on – Republicans’ U.S. Senate majority.” 
Libby, who was first elected to the Maine House of Representatives in 2020, gained national attention in February after the body censured her for posting personal details about a transgender high school athlete. Days after the post, President Donald Trump threatened to withhold funding from Maine for not complying with his executive order seeking to ban transgender women from competing in sports that correspond with their gender identity. 
Libby has built her reputation on her fundraising prowess, raising far more than her legislative peers during the 2024 election cycle. She also co-founded the Dinner Table PAC in 2021 with a mission to create a conservative majority in the Maine House, raising over $1 million since its launch to back Republican candidates.
That organization sued the state over a law voters passed by referendum in 2024 that placed limits on super PACs. That case is currently being considered in the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston.
During the recent election earlier this month, Maine voters rejected a referendum from Libby and the Dinner Table PAC that would have required identification at the polls, in addition to other proposed changes to state election law.
“Maine needs a long-term, durable campaign infrastructure that grows our conservative grassroots movement and sets Republicans up for success in 2026 and beyond,” Libby said. “Lead Maine and its affiliated organizations are committed to building exactly that by educating and mobilizing citizens to drive meaningful societal and electoral change at both the state and national levels.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LibbyCensure-1024x576.png,,,2025-11-17 11:00:52.184404

We hope Vermonters will join us in supporting the Vermont Wildlands Act — an essential opportunity to help make our “footpath in the wilderness” live up to its name.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Isabella Lucarelli and Elliott Hungerford: Making good on the wild promise of the Long Trail.","This commentary is by Isabella Lucarelli and Elliott Hungerford. Isabella hiked the Long Trail in 2020 and lives in Richmond, where she practices structural integration. Elliott hiked the Long Trail in 2020, worked for the Green Mountain Club for two seasons in 2021 and 2022, and now lives in Burlington, where he works in the field of community health/social work.


Most Long Trail hikers know the motto, “a footpath in the wilderness.” But how many hikers know that most of the landscapes the trail traverses still lack the wildland protections envisioned by the trail’s founders?
Right now, Vermonters have a chance to finally protect more of the treasured, public lands that the Long Trail passes through. The Vermont Climate Resilience and State Wildlands Act is a simple, incredibly important bill that would permanently protect about 268,000 acres of Vermont state lands as “wildlands” where forests can grow old, natural processes can play out, and people can make deep, lasting connections with the land and one another.
The legislation, introduced by Rep. Amy Sheldon, D-Middlebury, would protect many of the Green Mountains’ most beloved landscapes — Camel’s Hump State Park, Mount Mansfield State Forest, Jay State Forest and the high peaks near Killington, to name a few.
The Long Trail knits together many of Vermont’s wild landscapes as it runs 272 miles along the spine of the Green Mountains from Massachusetts to Canada. As we and hundreds of other thru-hikers each year can attest, a Long Trail experience is quietly transformative. Reconnecting with nature assists us in reconnecting with ourselves. It is an unparalleled resource.
Our “footpath in the wilderness,” however, remains unfinished. When the Long and Appalachian trails were begun roughly a century ago, they were envisioned as “wilderness ways” that would connect broad corridors of wild forest into a wilderness core that could serve not just people, but also the natural world. 
As Benton Mackaye, the forester and labor advocate who first envisioned the Appalachian Trail from the summit of Vermont’s Stratton Mountain, wrote: “The Appalachian Trail is a wilderness trail, or it is nothing.”
Unfortunately, only a fraction of the landscapes the Long and Appalachian Trails pass through, and only 3.7% of Vermont in total, are currently managed as wildlands. The Vermont Wildlands Act would raise that figure to roughly 7%. State scientists recommend that at least 9% of Vermont’s forests be allowed to become old forest to protect ecological function. So it’s a small step, but an essential step towards Mackaye’s vision nonetheless.
The Wildlands Act is not just about protecting hikers’ experiences and the landscapes that most to people. It’s also one of the most cost-effective, practical steps we can take locally to stabilize the life systems of the planet and ensure a future for human and more-than-human life.
The Wildlands Act will let some of Vermont’s healthiest and most intact forests continue to grow old, which scientists tell us is one of the most important things we can do to mitigate the climate crisis. Letting old, natural forests recover also supports maximum native biodiversity over the long term, including many of our most imperiled birds, bats and other species — and, scientists estimate that protected areas like the ones that will be established under the Wildlands Act have over 4 times less invasive plant exposure than unprotected forests.
The Wildlands Act would also maximize flood protection and clean water. As forests age, they get better and better at absorbing heavy precipitation and provisioning a steady supply of clean, cool water to our lakes and streams.
A report commissioned by Vermont’s own Agency of Natural Resources notes that 90% of state-managed land is in critically important, forested headwaters, where any amount of roadbuilding or timber harvest has profound implications for downstream communities.
We hope Vermonters will join us in supporting the Vermont Wildlands Act — an essential opportunity to help make our “footpath in the wilderness” live up to its name, and to protect the public forests that are so critical for climate, clean water and biodiversity. 
In a time of grave social and ecological crisis, it’s not enough just to enjoy beautiful wild places like the forests of the Long Trail — we also need to step up to protect them. We hope you’ll join us today in supporting the Vermont Wildlands Act.

HOST: Paul Hattis & John McDonough
GUESTS: Matt Selig, executive director of Health Law Advocates







THIRTY YEARS IN, the non-profit health care access-focused law firm Health Law Advocates has no shortage of individual and systemic crises on its plate. 
On the monthly Health or Consequences episode of The Codcast, John McDonough of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and Paul Hattis of the Lown Institute talked with Matt Selig, the executive director of Health Law Advocates about the day-to-day work of its 42 staff members and the “devastating” series of federal policy changes rolled out over the last year. 
Health Law Advocates represents about 1,500 people a year free of charge, Selig said. The group was created in 1995 by lawyer and advocate Steve Rosenfeld, inspired by his time volunteering to take calls on the Healthcare for All helpline. 
“A lot of people were calling about problems accessing healthcare, but they were actually legal issues, because the client’s rights were being violated,” Selig said. “But there was a gap, because there was no place that he could really refer them to for legal representation, because most of the callers couldn’t afford an attorney,” but they still made slightly too much to be eligible for legal help from groups who handle people on public benefits.  
Now in their 30th year and fielding thousands of calls every year, Selig said, Health Law Advocates check that potential clients are people who live in Massachusetts, make up to three times the federal poverty level, and have a healthcare access problem that staff can help them address. The income guidelines this year cover clients who make $46,950 as a single person or about $96,000 for a household of four. 
Their bread-and-butter work is includes medical debt problems or health insurance issues like problems qualifying for general enrollment or getting care to cover a specific service. Access to mental health care for young people is another broad area of focus, which involves representing families on issues in schools and special education programs, getting insurance coverage, services through state agencies, and advocacy in the juvenile justice system “where way too many kids with untreated mental illness end up,” Selig said. 
One example of their mental health work Selig offered involved a 4-year-old English language learner. The young girl can get physical when she becomes overwhelmed, he said, and had trouble coping when her preschool routine was disrupted. Once, she reacted badly to a change and pushed another student, “and when the dad came, she was surrounded by a group of, like, five adults yelling at her,” Selig said. 
Calls from the school became routine, with the parents told to pick their child up multiple days a week.  
“The little girl’s mom tried advocating with the school, to provide some services that could address these very clear emotional challenges that the 4-year-old was having,” Selig said. “But the school did not provide any support services whatsoever, and eventually, another incident led to the little girl being removed from the school for three days.” 
Health Law Advocates got involved after the suspension and made sure that if behavior problems occurred, the school would determine if it was related to her emotional disability. The child was able to stay in that preschool with these news systems in place until the legal group helped her family transition her to a new school. 
The non-profit has also worked to push state systems like MassHealth to improve care access. 
“Most of our policy advocacy involves improving the nitty-gritty of public policy,” Selig said. “The regulations and other policies and practices in the weeds that really affect access to healthcare as much, or sometimes even more, than statutes themselves, and are also easier to change.” 
During the episode, Selig, McDonough, and Hattis discuss the history and capacity of Health Law Advocates (3:00), their focus on children’s mental health and the worsening landscape of medical debt (20:00), and the risk to Massachusetts health care systems from federal policy shifts (28:45).",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner-1024x576.png,,,2025-11-17 09:57:30.408388

COOK INLET, Alaska—High in a mountain valley on the far west side of this tidal inlet sits an unusual plot of land.
It’s a private parcel, with a gravel airstrip and four or five buildings that make up a small worker camp. But there are no towns in sight. Known as the Johnson Tract, the property is fully surrounded by the vast Lake Clark National Park—millions of wild acres marked by the broad white peaks of a volcano, sprawling glaciers and a muddy ocean coastline patrolled by brown bears.
Beneath the Johnson Tract lies a potential fortune. For decades, geologists have eyed gold, copper and zinc deposits thought to be worth billions of dollars. But they’ve never been tapped.
Now, amid surging gold prices and rising demand for metals like copper, the prospect is generating new excitement—and concern.
A prominent Alaska mining company is leasing the Johnson Tract from its Indigenous owners, and the property, some 125 miles southwest of Anchorage, has emerged as one of the most promising mining prospects in Southcentral Alaska.
But conservationists, commercial salmon fishermen and local lodge owners fear a mine, encircled by the federal protected area, could disrupt harvests and harm wildlife, including an endangered population of beluga whales.
Getting the Johnson Tract’s minerals to buyers will require trucking ore through a now-roadless corner of the national park to a future port.
Critics point out that the bay where the mining company, Contango Ore, Inc., wants to build a shipping terminal is an important winter habitat for the endangered belugas. Concern for the whales, among other objections, led mine opponents to sue federal regulators earlier this year over a permit that Contango received to build a short access road and expand an airstrip at the site.

Still, the project is advancing.
The land is owned by Anchorage-based Cook Inlet Region, Inc., or CIRI, one of 12 Indigenous-owned regional corporations created by Congress as part of a wider land claims settlement with Alaska’s Native people in 1971.
Contango, based in Fairbanks, started leasing the land from CIRI last year. With gold prices surpassing a record high of $4,000 per troy ounce this year, the mining company is already planning new roads and a tunnel to allow underground drilling on the Johnson Tract.
If a mine gets built, both Contango and CIRI’s nearly 10,000 Indigenous shareholders are poised to profit.
“The stars might be aligned right now,” said Margie Brown, a former CIRI president who also worked for the corporation’s lands department in the 1970s, when the company acquired the prospect.
The conflict reflects a deeper tension between two competing visions for Alaska—one of environmental preservation, the other of industrial development. Both visions extend back to a time when Congress set aside large tracts of the state’s wilderness for protection but also carved out areas for resource extraction, often intended to benefit Alaska’s Indigenous-owned corporations. Rooted in a series of landmark bills in the 1970s and 1980s, the Johnson Tract saga echoes some of the state’s other, higher-profile environmental battles, including over a mining road and oil development in the Arctic.
As Contango forges ahead, CIRI is asserting its right to profit from lands long intended for development, while opponents say that mining imperils a still-wild slice of Alaska.

Among critics of the mining project is Dustin Solberg, a commercial fisherman and environmental advocate who spends summers with his family setting nets for salmon along the beaches of Tuxedni Bay, about 10 miles northeast of the Johnson Tract. Contango could one day load ore onto ships from the same shore where Solberg and other fishermen haul fish out of the bay.
Standing on a quiet Tuxedni beach one day this summer with dramatic cliffs looming overhead, Solberg imagined mining trucks rumbling down a road nearby.
“I think it would irreversibly change this place,” he said.

 A pivotal deal

The Johnson Tract fight is rooted in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.
Intended to resolve disputes over Indigenous land claims in Alaska, the federal legislation in 1971 established 12 for-profit Alaska Native corporations, each owned by Indigenous shareholders with ties to a region in the state. More than 200 other Indigenous companies tied to Native villages also formed.
The act promised to compensate the corporations with nearly a billion dollars and millions of acres of land, to be chosen by the companies’ elected leaders.
Those leaders quickly moved to obtain traditional hunting and fishing grounds and areas with cultural value, but they also sought land thought to be rich in minerals and other resources that they could convert into profits for shareholders.

In the Arctic, Native corporations acquired land with oil deposits. In Southeast Alaska, they logged vast stands of cedar and spruce.
But in CIRI’s region, around Anchorage and neighboring Cook Inlet, the pickings were sparse. The southcentral region is the state’s most populous, and by the time of the settlement, military bases and wildlife refuges had been set aside by the federal government, prime real estate was in the hands of private developers and other parcels had been snatched up by the state.
“You just had so much pressure for lands within the Cook Inlet region,” said Brown, who now serves on CIRI’s board.
The corporation’s leaders argued that they were largely left with glaciers and mountain ridges — dim prospects for shareholders.

Two years after Congress approved the settlement, CIRI sued the U.S. interior secretary, arguing that his agency had not made adequate property available for CIRI to develop. Tense negotiations ensued, producing a sprawling agreement between CIRI and the state and federal governments: the Cook Inlet Land Exchange.
The deal called for CIRI to give up half the property around Cook Inlet that the corporation was entitled to under the original settlement, Brown said. Some of that foregone land would be folded into Lake Clark National Park and Preserve when Congress created it a few years later.
In return, CIRI would be able to acquire land elsewhere in Alaska, and even outside the state.

The deal also allowed CIRI to pick up some key assets around Cook Inlet, including the Johnson Tract, which the corporation chose specifically for its mineral potential. CIRI’s early leaders viewed the land swap as a hard-fought compromise, and Brown called the Johnson Tract “key to the bargain.”
“The ability to use the land in the way Congress intended is something that needs to be preserved,” she said. “It’s unfortunate that as we move further and further from congressional intent, it’s harder and harder for people to remember that.”
The Johnson Tract is really two adjacent parcels, totaling about 33 square miles. CIRI—now a huge business, with nearly $1 billion in assets—owns the minerals beneath both parcels, and the surface of the south tract, where the main deposit sits. The federal government retained surface ownership of the north tract.
Citing a provision in the land exchange, the Department of Interior earlier this year granted CIRI the rights to transport ore through the park, with certain restrictions to limit environmental impacts. CIRI and Contango have not formally proposed building a haul road and port, which would require additional permits.
 An “Awesome” Deposit

Soon after CIRI acquired the Johnson Tract, the corporation began scouring it for more minerals, seeking enough to justify building a mine.
In the early 1980s, CIRI partnered with Anaconda Minerals, a subsidiary of the global oil giant ARCO, to evaluate the prospect.
Anaconda found promising amounts of gold, zinc and copper and at one point—given the area’s prolific amount of snow—envisioned an underground tunnel or aerial tram to move ore the dozen miles from a mine to a port on the coast. But Anaconda went out of business. And aside from another unsuccessful effort to develop the Johnson Tract in the 1990s, the land sat largely dormant until 2019.
That year, CIRI signed a lease with a Vancouver-based mineral exploration company, which quickly handed over the operations to a spinoff firm, HighGold Mining Inc. HighGold spent tens of millions of dollars on exploration and drilled more than 150 core samples before Contango bought the company last year in a deal worth some $35 million.
The Johnson Tract appealed to Contango’s chief executive, Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse, because it seemed to be a good fit for the company’s unconventional development model, which involves shipping raw ore to a processing plant off site, rather than crushing and processing ore next to the deposit, as most mines do.
The approach avoids some of the more expensive and hard-to-permit components of a typical mine, like a mill and a big waste pond. In theory, it keeps construction costs low and makes permitting easier, Van Nieuwenhuyse said. But shipping unprocessed ore also risks higher transportation costs, so Johnson Tract’s close proximity to the ocean and shipping routes made it attractive.
“It’s an awesome deposit,” Van Nieuwenhuyse said, citing the prospect’s high ratio of valuable minerals to rock and its thickness, which he expects will make the mining process more efficient.
Van Nieuwenhuyse is a veteran of Alaska’s mining industry, having worked over the past four decades on some of the state’s most prominent early-stage projects.
He played major roles in advancing Western Alaska’s Donlin project — the state’s biggest proposed gold mine — and high-profile prospects in Northwest Alaska at the end of the controversial proposed Ambler Road. He also led development of the Rock Creek gold mine near Nome, which closed in 2008 soon after opening amid a slew of challenges.
At Contango, where Van Nieuwenhuyse was named chief executive in 2020, he partnered with the multinational Kinross Gold Corp. to spearhead the construction of Alaska’s first large mine in more than a decade, a project in the Interior called Manh Choh.
Unlike that open-pit mine, Johnson Tract would be an underground operation. Several years of exploratory drilling, permitting and engineering are expected before a final decision on building a mine, Van Nieuwenhuyse said.

The mine, according to Contango’s preliminary plans, would operate for seven years and would be small compared to other major Alaska mines. Contango would share royalties on mineral sales with CIRI, which has an option to buy as much as a 25 percent stake in the mine.
CIRI declined interview requests about the Johnson Tract, and the corporation’s executives have made few public statements about it.
The project “presents an opportunity to responsibly develop mineral resources to benefit our shareholders while respecting the environment and preserving the land,” CIRI said in a brief update last year. “The Johnson Tract project reflects decades of hard work to build a foundation of self-determination and financial stability.”
 “We’re Here Because it’s Beautiful”

Dustin Solberg, the fisherman and mine opponent, was motoring to a net he’d set on the west side of Tuxedni Channel one afternoon last summer when he spotted a brown bear on a rocky beach ahead.
“I think it smells the fish, Dad,” 12-year-old son and deckhand Leif Solberg called out.
Neither father nor son seemed particularly concerned. The area has so many beach-loving bears that it draws tourists from around the world for viewing and photography.
Far more worrisome to the elder Solberg is the future of the beach where the bear was roving—near a site that Contango is studying as a port.
Solberg, his family and others who fish in the channel each summer have growing concerns about Contango’s vision. They fear that a new road and industrial dock, and the traffic and noise from trucks and ships, would mar the wild character of the bay and the park around it.

As Solberg looked across the channel, it was remarkably quiet, aside from a few fishing skiffs and an occasional float plane that landed at a bear-viewing lodge on Chisik Island. Other than the lodge and a few fishing cabins, Chisik is a federally designated wilderness area, home to a prolific seabird colony.
A dozen or so crews fish commercially for salmon in the bay. Two or three times a week, from June through August, they set, pick and pull nets along pebbly beaches on either side of Tuxedni Channel, with fishing periods that can last 12 hours or more.
It’s hard labor, Solberg said, but the season moves at a slower pace than Alaska’s bigger-volume salmon fisheries, like Bristol Bay, where boats sometimes work 24-hour shifts.

“If you wanted to make money, you would fish somewhere else,” said Ann Harding, Solberg’s wife. “We’re here because it’s beautiful.”
The area has “phenomenal” mountains and a striking density of birds and bears, added Harding, a seabird biologist who sometimes fishes alongside Solberg.

The family uses a cabin a mile or two down the shoreline from where the bear had been walking. It’s a small plywood structure beneath an A-frame roof, surrounded by an electric fence to keep away curious ursine visitors. The cabin is about a hundred feet back from the water and set fully within Lake Clark National Park.
Solberg and Harding bought the structure several years ago. They don’t have title to the land beneath it or a formal permit from the park service. But the cabin existed before the park was established, and past owners had an informal arrangement with federal officials to keep using it, Solberg said.

The cabin now sits in an easement that the Department of Interior earlier this year granted CIRI for a mining port. Solberg doesn’t think his small business will amount to much of an obstacle.
“This is just a little shack that doesn’t really compete with the value of an operation like that,” he said, referring to the mining plans. “So, I don’t expect this to get in the way of anything.”

A National Park Service Map of the Johnson Tract, as well as easements where an access road and port serving a mine could one day be built.
CIRI and Contango have not made a final decision about where to put the port, and a CIRI environmental document said last year that there is “considerable uncertainty” about future construction.
Van Nieuwenhuyse, the Contango mining executive, said his company recognizes the rights of the setnetters, and he believes a mine can co-exist with the fishery.
“I would ask that everybody recognize CIRI’s rights as well,” he added.
 Where Belugas “Hang Out”

As it gathers pace, Contango is facing opposition not just from the commercial fishermen but also from conservation groups and some tribal governments in the region.
A national group, the Center for Biological Diversity, along with the Homer-based nonprofit Cook Inletkeeper and the Chickaloon Village Traditional Council, a tribal government, are suing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for issuing a key permit to Contango.
Several tribal leaders also have raised concerns about the project and have asked the Trump administration to suspend the permit.
A core concern among those opponents is that a mining operation could threaten Cook Inlet’s beluga whales, which are treasured by many Anchorage residents and local wildlife viewers.
The inlet’s belugas—which are genetically distinct from other beluga populations—once numbered around 1,300 animals, but their numbers sharply declined in the 1990s. They were listed as endangered in 2008 and still have not significantly recovered. The population now stands at some 330 whales.

During the summer, the belugas are commonly spotted feasting on fish at the mouths of salmon-bearing streams near Anchorage. Where they go in winter has been a mystery.
But last year federal scientists announced a big discovery in a study that analyzed underwater sound recordings.
The researchers, affiliated with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, identified Tuxedni Bay as the only known foraging ground for the whales between late fall and late spring. They warned that human-caused noise is a “key threat” to the belugas, which use sound to navigate and communicate, and that industrial activity could affect the quality of the whales’ habitat.
NOAA Fisheries, which led the study, declined interview requests. One of its scientists, in a press release announcing the study, said that “maintaining the status quo” may be all that’s needed to help the beluga population recover.
As Contango studies sites for a port, it’s now funding a new beluga survey by biologists working for the state of Alaska, which has often been more friendly to the mining industry than the federal government.
The survey is focused on the narrow channel where Contango is considering shipping ore, while the NOAA-led study looked more broadly at the 10-mile-long Tuxedni Bay.
“We want to know where the belugas like to hang out,” Van Nieuwenhuyse said.
One of the loudest voices advocating for the belugas and against development at the Johnston Tract is Cooper Freeman, a Homer resident and the Alaska director at the Center for Biological Diversity. The center is a 35-year-old nonprofit that aims to protect wildlife and ecosystems across the country, and it’s a participant in nearly a dozen active lawsuits in Alaska’s federal court.
In an interview, Freeman acknowledged CIRI’s right to the minerals at the Johnson Tract. But he noted that federal environmental laws still apply and argued that CIRI does not have an “absolute right” to build a mine.
In his view, the area is too ecologically rich—with its important beluga habitat and high density of brown bears, seabirds and shorebirds—to risk.
“It’s just an incredibly, biologically, intensively rich and completely intact area—one of the only remaining places like it in all of Cook Inlet,” he said. “I don’t think there’s any amount of money that’s worth destroying this place.”

There are no towns within 40 miles of the Johnson Tract—just roadless mountains, glaciers, forests and streams.
Aside from seasonal fishermen, CIRI and Contango’s neighbors include Silver Salmon Creek Lodge, a bear-viewing and sport-fishing business that’s near the mouth of the Johnson River, a dozen or so miles downstream of the mineral deposit.
Longtime lodge owners David Coray and Joanne Edney have kept loose tabs on the prospect for decades and have grown more concerned as Contango’s project advances.
In a recent interview, Coray and Edney said they’re worried that a mine could pollute the Johnson River and disrupt bear habitat.
“We understand their interest, and we understand their rights,” Edney said of CIRI and Contango. But a mining operation could come into “direct conflict” with her family’s business, she said.
CIRI declined to respond to questions about opposition to the project, and about how it’s gauging the views of its shareholders, some of whom have spoken out against it.
Van Nieuwenhuyse said Contango is committed to protecting wildlife.
“We’ll develop this deposit with minimal impacts to the environment, which we recognize as pristine,” Van Nieuwenhuyse said. “We’re all from Alaska. We enjoy the outdoors. That’s why we all became geologists.”
For Solberg, the fisherman, the convergence of competing interests in the area is “endlessly fascinating—and really complicated and really unfortunate.”
In a conversation after the fishing season, Solberg acknowledged a tension between CIRI’s rights to the Johnson Tract’s minerals and the spectre of a mine transforming the landscape and bay that his family has come to know and love.
Solberg said he feels “really torn” about the issue and that he respects CIRI’s land claims. But as one of the few Alaskans who spends long stretches of time in Tuxedni Bay, he feels obligated to speak in defense of its wildness and beauty.
“I just want decisionmakers to have their eyes wide open,” he said. “And to realize what’s at stake.”

From CalMatters homelessness reporter Marisa Kendall: 
For weeks, California’s homeless service providers have worried about rumors that the federal government was going to cut funds for permanent housing.
Now, those cuts are here. Shortly after the federal government reopened, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development issued a policy change that will shift the majority of federal homelessness funds away from permanent housing and into temporary shelter. 
Each jurisdiction applying for a piece of about $4 billion in federal homelessness funds during the 2025 fiscal year can now spend no more than 30% of their grant on permanent housing. That’s a major change. For years, the federal government and California cities and counties have prioritized permanent housing as the long-term solution to homelessness. Los Angeles County, for example, dedicates more than 80% of its federal funds to permanent housing. 
President Donald Trump’s administration instead wants cities and counties to focus on temporary shelters that get people off the street quickly, and on programs that require people to participate in addiction treatment. 

Scott Turner, HUD Secretary: “We are stopping the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis, shut out faith-based providers simply because of their values, and incentivized never-ending government dependency.”

The National Homelessness Law Center says these changes will force about 170,000 people nationwide out of subsidized housing and back onto the street.

Jesse Rabinowitz, spokesperson: “Trump’s approach towards homelessness will worsen the lives of most people, waste taxpayer money, and instead direct taxpayer dollars towards debunked, disproven, and failed approaches to homelessness.”

The new policy also attacks organizations’ diversity and inclusion efforts; support of transgender clients; and use of “harm reduction” strategies that seek to reduce overdose deaths by helping people in active addiction use drugs more safely. Federal funds cannot be used for projects that further any of those efforts.

Court blocks Trump’s $1.2B UCLA settlement demand

A California federal judge handed the Trump administration another loss on Friday, writing in a preliminary ruling that its demand for UCLA to pay a $1.2-billion settlement or risk continued funding freezes on research grants is unlawful, writes CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.
Siding with University of California scientists, professors, graduate students and other staff, Judge Rita Lin called Trump’s actions towards the public university “coercive and retaliatory.” Her ruling goes beyond just UCLA, and limits the Trump administration’s ability to withhold current and future grant funding for the entire UC system. 
This summer, the Trump administration accused UCLA of not doing enough to combat antisemitism during last year’s pro-Palestine protests, and for allegedly violating federal civil rights law. It sought a $1.2-billion settlement agreement from UCLA to have the campus comply with terms that would have severely hamstrung the institution’s academic freedoms and diversity efforts.
The administration could appeal Lin’s ruling, and the full merits of the case is still wending its way through the courts.
Read more here.
Speaking of the UCLA case: The administration’s leverage over UCLA has remained unclear for months, ever since Lin ordered it to restore nearly all those grants — totaling more than $500 million — in August and September. Mikhail and video strategy director Robert Meeks have a video segment on the rulings for the restoration of those grants as part of our partnership with PBS SoCal. Watch it here.

Dangers of data centers and debris flow

Let’s dive into some environmental news:

The impact of data centers: Electricity use and carbon emissions by power-hungry California data centers nearly doubled between 2019 and 2023, a new report says. Published by environmental think tank Next 10 and a UC Riverside researcher, the report also estimates that public health costs from air pollution associated with data centers have potentially risen from $45 million to more than $155 million within the same time frame. Read more from CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo.


Dangerous debris flow: Though evacuation orders were lifted over the weekend for L.A. County and other parts of Southern California, officials are urging residents to stay alert as wet weather is still expected through early this week. Areas recently ravaged by wildfires, including January’s Eaton and Palisades fires, are especially vulnerable to debris flow and mudslides since these fire-scarred regions have little vegetation to stabilize the earth. Described as “a flood on steroids” by one researcher, debris flow is a problem in Southern California in particular because of the area’s steep topography.

A new era for the coastal commission?

Building affordable housing on the California coast should get a bit easier after the California Coastal Commission voted earlier this month to extend the time frame for projects to be built — a decision that underscores a pro-housing shift among the little-known but consequential government body.
As CalMatters’ Nadia Lathan explains, the commission was created in the 1970s to oversee the protection of California’s 800-mile coastline, including its natural habitats and the public’s access to beaches. Many housing advocates and Democrats say the state agency blocks affordable housing development in California’s coastal regions. 
This year, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a critic of the commission’s broad powers, and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, appointed three pro-development local officials to the agency.
The agency also this year worked with housing activists to boost student housing in coastal cities, and did not oppose a housing reform law that excludes most new developments from environmental review.

Could California see a single-payer health plan that would cover medical costs for all?

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-17 14:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Why no one knows how many people die in Mississippi’s local jails,"Caleb Bedillion, The Marshall Project",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/17/no-one-knows-how-many-people-die-inmississippi-jails-heres-why/,"From medical neglect to suicide, the lack of information on jail deaths in Mississippi can allow the same deadly problems to lead to more deaths.","Amid the 2020 pandemic, Andrew Jones suffered a series of crises. 
The one-time youth cheerleading coach in Mississippi’s Pine Belt entered an addiction treatment facility. There, he was diagnosed with several mental health disorders.
Then, another troubling diagnosis: He had HIV, the virus that can cause AIDS.
He had never been in trouble with the law before, but was arrested in December 2020 on a burglary charge and booked into the Jones County jail.
A month later, Jones was dead. He died from HIV, the state medical examiner ruled.
The jail never gave him the lifesaving medication he’d been prescribed, his family’s lawsuit claimed.
Jones was one among a wider but mostly unknown number of jailhouse fatalities across the state.
At least 46 people have died in Mississippi’s county jails since 2020, according to lawsuits, news reports and law enforcement records reviewed by The Marshall Project-Jackson. But those lost lives do not appear in any official statistics or records.
Mississippi has long failed to count and report all deaths in local jails that serve the state’s 82 counties, despite a federal requirement to do so. These often dangerous facilities operate virtually free of any state oversight.
“If we don’t understand why people are dying, we can’t prevent it,” said Andrea Armstrong, a law professor at Loyola University in New Orleans and a widely recognized authority in the study of deaths behind bars.
Under the federal Death in Custody Reporting Act, states must report all deaths in state prisons and local jails, as well as people who die in the process of being arrested. 
Across the country, these reports are often incomplete. After obtaining five years of unredacted death records maintained by the Justice Department, The Marshall Project found hundreds of deaths were missing and others were inaccurately or incompletely described. In a sample of 1,000 death records, The Marshall Project found that 75% did not meet the Justice Department’s own standard for an acceptable level of detail. 
A key source of data gaps in many places? Local jails. 
Even so, Mississippi still fares worse in its reporting than most of the country. It was one of only four states with locally managed jails to report fewer than 10 deaths in those jails across five years of national records reviewed by The Marshall Project. 
Of those states, Mississippi, North Dakota and South Dakota all acknowledged in 2023 filings submitted to federal authorities that local jail deaths are largely absent from their reporting. 
Within the last year or so, state officials have begun more concerted attempts to collect records of local deaths even when local agencies don’t report them, according to leaders at the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, the state agency responsible for reporting obligations under the federal DCRA requirements. 
“I think everybody sees the value in the data,” said DPS Commissioner Sean Tindell, but he said many of the state’s hundreds of local law enforcement agencies find the reporting requirements burdensome. 
Mississippi does report state prison deaths, which have drawn scrutiny, including federal investigations that in 2022 and in 2024 found constitutional violations. 
Without that same data at the local level, solutions can be scarce to problems like the ones that allegedly led to the death of Jones. His family’s lawsuit claimed better healthcare could have saved his life.
That lawsuit’s allegations described the jail’s medical treatment “orders of magnitude below typical care,” said Dr. Anne Spaulding, who reviewed the lawsuit’s claims for The Marshall Project-Jackson. She is a professor of public health at Emory University and a former medical care administrator for prison systems in Georgia and Rhode Island.
A nurse at the Jones County jail failed to obtain lifesaving drugs for Jones in December 2020 and January 2021, the lawsuit claimed. The county and other defendants, including the nurse, denied wrongdoing in court filings. In February 2025, a judge dismissed the lawsuit after key defendants settled. The settlement terms were kept confidential. 
In 2021, Jones County brought in outside healthcare. The county first contracted with a local hospital and later with a Gulf Coast-area medical firm. The change in medical staffing followed the deaths of three detainees that occurred in less than a year, including that of Jones.
To stop local jail deaths, broader solutions must be based on data from those jails, said Madalyn Wasilczuk, a law professor in South Carolina who spearheads a transparency initiative there around in-custody deaths. 
That’s because local jail deaths tend to occur for different reasons than prison deaths. The Justice Department, for example, has found that jail deaths are most commonly linked to suicide or drug and alcohol intoxication.
To tackle these problems, Mississippi must first count deaths that occur inside local jails, Wasilczuk said. Otherwise, Mississippi “is missing an entire piece of the puzzle.”
A death in Jones County
When a sheriff’s deputy found Andrew Jones leaving the deputy’s home on Dec. 7, 2020, his family contends that Jones was drunk and confused about where he was.
Now facing burglary charges, Jones was held in jail on a $15,000 bond while waiting for an indictment. Jones wasn’t accused of taking anything from the deputy’s home. 
When he was booked into the Jones County Adult Detention Center, near the small town of Ellisville, Jones allegedly listed his health problems: mental health disturbances that included suicidal thoughts, high blood pressure and his recent HIV diagnosis.
At the time, medical care at the jail was provided by a full-time staff nurse, Carol Johnston, with visits from a nurse practitioner by appointment, according to the lawsuit. Johnston was a licensed practical nurse and was providing care at the jail without the supervision required by her license, alleges the lawsuit over Andrew’s death. The county and other defendants, including Johnston, denied this claim in court filings.
Johnston has not worked at the jail since June 2021, Jones County Administrator Danielle Ashley told The Marshall Project-Jackson. The county now contracts with Health Corr LLC, which must provide nurses and medical staff at the jail throughout the week, according to the county’s contract with the Picayune-based medical company. 
Ashley declined on behalf of the county to answer other questions about the lawsuit’s allegations. Johnston did not respond to questions about those allegations. Public records from the state’s nursing board show that Johnston has no disciplinary history.
During Jones’ month in jail — the last month of his life — there were repeated opportunities to avert his death, the lawsuit claimed. 
Johnston arranged for Jones to visit a clinic in nearby Hattiesburg for an appointment scheduled before his arrest. Nine days after his arrest, on Dec. 18, a doctor prescribed Jones a pair of drugs to keep his HIV in check, Descovy and Tivicay. 
Regular access to these pills, or similar medications used to suppress HIV, is “bare minimum” care, said Dr. Tara Vijayan, a professor of medicine at UCLA who specializes in infectious diseases. Ideally, she said, Jones would have begun taking these medications soon after his diagnosis.
However, Jones never got those medications in the jail, the family’s lawsuit alleged. 
The county’s current contract with Health Corr requires that its staff administer prescribed medications.
At subsequent appointments, tests showed concerning results related to Jones’ liver and that his untreated HIV had become full-blown AIDS, meaning his immune system was significantly compromised, and he was now vulnerable to infections that would not otherwise be dangerous. 
Careful monitoring of such a patient would be required to watch for dangerous infections, Vijayan said. However, antiretroviral medications can still bring the disease under control.
Still, Jones’ prescription for the lifesaving drugs allegedly went unfilled, and Jones began to decline rapidly. 
His last day was painful, according to the lawsuit’s recounting of video surveillance from the isolation cell where Jones was confined because of his November bout with coronavirus.
Throughout Jan. 9, 2021, Andrew moved in spastic and increasingly disoriented ways, apparently losing control of his own body. He became weaker and slower.
He lay on the floor as guards placed food on the ground next to him.
Finally, later that day, guards found Andrew dead. The state medical examiner ruled his death was caused by an HIV-linked infection, exacerbated by high blood pressure.
No oversight for Mississippi jails
Jones’ death is one among a string of jailhouse fatalities that have been linked to allegations of abusive jail conditions that haven’t been reported to the federal government. 
Ten years earlier, at the same jail, Albert Graham died from heart problems.
A lawsuit over his 2010 death dragged on for years before a judge found that even if Johnston, the same nurse who treated Jones, provided slow, untimely care, it wasn’t bad enough to be considered “deliberate indifference” — the legal term for the high threshold that must be met to sue in federal court over medical care in jail.
An hour-and-a-half up the road from the Jones County jail, Kemper County has faced several lawsuits over jail deaths, settling one in 2022 over the 2018 jail suicide of a man allegedly held 52 days past his release date. On the day of his death, other detainees warned that Robert Wayne Johnson was trying to strangle himself with a shoelace. Guards allegedly placed the man into an isolation cell with the shoelaces anyway.
In George County, a nurse was convicted of manslaughter in 2017 and sentenced to 15 years in prison for failing to provide insulin to a diabetic man facing drug charges who died in 2014. Jail staff testified that she accused the prisoner of faking his symptoms of distress. A 2022 settlement in a civil lawsuit totaled $2.5 million — half the annual budget of the rural county. 
That George County settlement was among at least 10 settlements within the last five years involving Mississippi jail deaths.
But litigation and criminal prosecutions can also take years to resolve, letting problems linger and yielding — at best — only piecemeal accountability for local officials tasked with jail safety.
There is no state-level law requiring local jails to track and report deaths in custody, one barrier identified in the state’s memo. 
Rather than relying on a sprawling network of more than 360 law enforcement agencies to report local in-custody deaths, Tindell, the DPS commissioner, suggested a statewide system relying on county coroners to identify these deaths might be more effective. However, he said he believes the amount of data requested by the U.S. Justice Department can be “burdensome,” especially for many local officials to administer. He said collecting less information about each death could improve compliance. 
Another key DPS official, Public Safety Planning Director Josh Bromen, said he has made an online system available for local officials to report deaths and plans to ramp up outreach efforts to local officials about the DCRA requirement. 
Bromen also said he has begun to collect records of jail deaths from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, which sometimes examines those deaths.
Federal law allows the DOJ to withhold federal funds from law enforcement agencies that don’t comply with reporting requirements, but that penalty has never been enacted.
The lack of transparency or oversight of jail deaths in Mississippi is part of a broader failure in the state to oversee local jails.
There are no jail licensing requirements in Mississippi, except for spaces used to house certain mental health patients. State officials don’t tour or inspect local jails. Grand juries routinely tour the jails, but their reports are rarely seen by anyone outside the county, are often ignored and lack an enforcement mechanism.
And when jail deaths occur, policymakers and advocates aren’t the only ones kept in the dark. The families and loved ones of those who died often have unanswered questions, said Marquell Bridges, an activist based in Mississippi and Alabama who has worked with survivors and families impacted by police and prison violence across the country. 
“That transparency is important for the families. It’s important for the community,” Bridges said. “The only way this system works is if people believe in it.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/13155525/251025_JBernabeu_JAC-JAIL-HIV.jpg,,,2025-11-17 09:57:30.408388

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Since June of this year, the Trump administration has deployed — or attempted to deploy — federalized National Guard troops to several major U.S. cities against the wishes of state governors. In doing so, the administration has sought to test a legal theory that would broadly expand the president’s ability to deploy military forces on the homefront, on his orders alone. Litigation over these actions has reached the U.S. Supreme Court’s “emergency” docket, in a case involving the deployment of federalized National Guard troops to Chicago.
One of the last times the court spoke to such issues was in 1990, in a case involving former Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich. In Perpich v. Department of Defense, the court held that if the president had lawfully federalized National Guard troops, they could be ordered to attend training operations in overseas locations. (National Guard troops serve a dual state and federal role).
The facts in the current case are much different — involving the deployment of federalized troops to support civil authorities enforcing laws inside the United States. In the Chicago case, U.S. District Court Judge April Perry held that the administration had not met the legal threshold necessary to mobilize troops for domestic deployment.
In a separate case, U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer was even more pointed when he ruled that the administration had violated federal law when it sent California National Guard troops to Los Angeles.
“Contrary to Congress’s explicit instruction,” Breyer wrote. “federal troops executed the laws.”
The administration’s push for broad authority to deploy the military on the homefront has been uniformly opposed by Democrats, but has not yet generated substantial push-back from conservatives despite their opposition in decades past.
In 1993, a standoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidian religious group ended in a fiery conflagration in Waco, Texas. Four federal agents and six Davidians died during a gunfight that erupted during a “dynamic entry” SWAT raid on the Davidians’ headquarters.
The federal government then provided military equipment (courtesy of the U.S. military’s Joint Task Force 6) and Special Forces advisors to the FBI, which conducted a paramilitary raid on the Davidian compound. A fire broke out in the course of the raid, killing 75 Davidians — including 25 children — according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
The Waco raid — including the use of military assets against civilians — alarmed the political right. In the fall of 1993, I traveled with a colleague to a conference in Vevay, Indiana, to conduct television interviews with attendees concerned about Waco and its legacy. The conference brought together a variety of conservative activists, along with former military and intelligence personnel alarmed by the drift of federal agencies towards aggressive, paramilitary-style domestic operations. The FBI’s use of military assets at Waco came just a year after that same agency had employed paramilitary tactics during a raid at Ruby Ridge, Idaho. In the course of that operation, FBI snipers mistakenly killed the wife of a man accused of selling a sawed-off shotgun to a federal informant.
The concerns raised at the Vevay conference were part of a much longer tradition. Since its founding, America has harbored a historical aversion to “standing armies,” as witnessed by the Third Amendment’s prohibition against quartering troops and other features of the U.S. Constitution. While provision has been made for the deployment of federal military forces in true emergency situations (as well as for the use of National Guard troops in state-level emergencies), federal law has placed multiple constraints upon the domestic use of the military.
The principal legal barrier is the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the ability of the U.S. military to “execute the laws” unless another statute provides for an exception. Where those exceptions are found — such as in the federal Insurrection Act — specific requirements must be met before federal forces can be utilized. Those requirements are intended to prevent federal military forces from becoming just another domestic policy tool that presidents can use at will.
In the wake of the Vevay conference, I conducted multiple interviews with people on the right who highlighted the risks of unchecked domestic military activity. I spoke with Gene Wheaton, a federal security contractor and 30-year military veteran. Wheaton characterized himself as a conservative patriot, alarmed by the growing militarization of the home-front.
The use of military assets at Waco, he noted, was made possible by an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act that Congress had passed to enable military assistance for counter-drug operations. (This was the genesis of Joint Task Force 6). Wheaton saw this slow erosion as a major problem.
“While I was in the military, we were instructed that the Posse Comitatus Act was sacrosanct, and we should never, ever become involved in the areas of civilian law enforcement,” he said. “We’re out there to go after the enemy, not after our own citizens that we’re there to protect.”
Similar issues were flagged by Larry Pratt, then-president of Gun Owners of America.  Pratt’s organization had been so concerned about the potential for domestic military use that it commissioned a legal review of how and when a presidential administration might deploy military forces against its own citizens, and it criticized exceptions drawn up for military support to civilian counter-drug efforts.
“We have got the result of a War on Drugs that has increasingly been used to water down, by law, the barrier that had been drawn up by the Posse Comitatus law,” Pratt told me. “So that the military is no longer more than arms-length from civilian law enforcement. And as a result, not surprisingly, since the military function is not compatible with the Bill of Rights, the Bill of Rights has suffered.”
Pratt feared that “emergency” exceptions in various federal statutes could be improperly exploited to normalize future, domestic use of the military.
With its recent state-side troop deployments, the Trump administration has pointed to statutes identified in Pratt’s legal review — stretching the definitions of “emergency” and “rebellion” to justify domestic deployments in circumstances that far exceed the plain text of those laws.
Conservatives of a generation ago raised concerns about the exact kinds of military operations that are occurring on the streets of America today. For them, Waco and Ruby Ridge provided ample evidence of the danger posed by military operations “bleeding in” to civilian law enforcement — distorting the missions of both institutions.
Wheaton spoke about this explicitly. “The military is meant to fight wars,” he told me. “It is not geared, set up, psychologically trained, or physically trained in any way, shape, or form, to be a law enforcement organization.”
When issues of National Guard federalization were last heard at the U.S. Supreme Court (in the wake of legal action by Perpich), the court had a narrow issue (overseas military training) to decide.
The issues that are now before the court could have much wider impacts. In a sign that the court may have misgivings about the breadth of President Trump’s claimed powers, the parties were directed to submit additional briefing on a question that cuts against the administration’s core legal arguments.
While litigation continues, there is also a deeper political question at play — whether traditional small-government conservatism will re-assert itself, and help diffuse Trump’s military brinksmanship.
The answer to that question will have profound effects on the shape of both American conservatism — and presidential power — for years to come.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/losangelesnationalguard-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-11-17 08:57:46.141861

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The Nevada Resort Association and a host of other business and industry groups are backing a fast-tracked bill they claim would codify into state law what is already standard business practice in the state. But attorneys who have represented workers in lawsuits against those companies say the proposed legislation would weaken worker protections.
The question at the heart of the issue is: What sort of ancillary activities should be considered work and be compensated for? And what isn’t?
Senate Bill 8 was introduced on Saturday, the third day of the special legislative session, and presented to the Senate Committee on Jobs and Economy by the lobbyists for the Nevada Resorts Association and Vegas Chamber that same day.
On Sunday, the committee advanced the bill to the full Senate, which voted to declare it an emergency measure and allow an immediate vote. SB8 then passed the full Senate with overwhelming support. Only Democratic state Sens. Skip Daly and Edgar Flores opposed.
The bill now goes to the Assembly for consideration.
SB8 was prompted by an advance opinion filed by the Nevada Supreme Court on Oct. 31 that unanimously declared that the state had never incorporated into law the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, which amended the Federal Labor Standards Act and defined what activities employers can consider noncompensable and what activities must be considered work and paid for.
The District Court of Nevada asked Nevada’s high court to weigh in on the legal issue because of a pandemic era case, Malloy v. Amazon. The online retail giant, which operates several warehouses in the state, during the height of the pandemic instituted mandatory covid testing of employees before shifts. The company did not pay those employees for the time spent undergoing testing.
Amazon argued mandatory testing was a noncompensable activity. Under Portal-to-Portal, employers do not have to pay workers for activities that are “preliminary” or “postliminary” to their main job duties — like the commute to work.
SB8 would have the state adopt certain provisions of the Portal-to-Portal Act. It would also, courtesy of an adopted amendment proposed by the Nevada Mining Association, provide retroactive legal immunity to companies over potential violations.
Paul Moradkhan, a lobbyist for Vegas Chamber, and Paul Trimmer, a lawyer for the Nevada Resort Association, told lawmakers that businesses have been operating for decades on the belief that the principles in the Portal-to-Portal Act were law in Nevada.
The recent Nevada Supreme Court opinion upends that, creating an unstable regulatory environment and opening them up to liability, Moradkhan said.
The Nevada Mining Association testified that, because of Malloy, one national law firm has targeted their industry and state, filing multiple class-action lawsuits.
Nevada Resort Association President Virginia Valentine said businesses “will be forced to make significant, immediate changes to how workplaces function.” She used the example of an employee dining room, gym or on-site daycare, saying casinos would stop offering them.
Valentine said passage of SB8 would be a maintaining of the status quo.
Joshua Buck, the attorney in the Malloy case who also presented his opposition to lawmakers during the hearing, rejected that narrative.
“I can believe in aliens,” he told the Current in an interview. “That’s my own status quo. I believe in aliens, and I’ve been believing them since I was 10. Does that mean there are aliens?”
Buck said the examples being bandied about by proponents were hyperbolic red herrings. Employers requiring workers to come in for a pre-shift meeting before they clock in is a more accurate example of the issue, he said. Or a hotel worker being told to report to their supervisor for an assignment, that employee having to wait around a significant amount of time because the supervisor was busy, and telling them to clock in after they physically reported to their station.
One case referenced numerous times in the hearing involved a theft-security screening that Amazon required its employees to undergo after leaving their shift. According to Buck, an attorney on that case, the workers were spending 20 minutes in mandatory “airport-like” security screening and not getting paid for it. In response to litigation, the retail giant changed that process.
Sen. Daly, whose background is in organized labor, in the hearing said he recognized that some labor and wage laws in the state might need to be addressed with the Malloy opinion. But he said he opposes the proposed solution being pushed in SB8.
“The adoption of these rules without additional protections will result in less protection for workers in this state,” Daly told his fellow senators before the vote. “It will take away (from) those employees, who have a legitimate claim, the right to seek their compensation.”
One of those ongoing court cases that would be thrown out by SB8 goes back to 2024, well before the Nevada Supreme Court issued the opinion that prompted the proposed legislation, according to Daly.
In the Senate committee hearing, Daly referenced a potential future amendment to add language about workers being paid when under the direction and control of the employer.
“Without that provision, workers will suffer,” he said. “When we get this thing to the other side (the Assembly), and if the AFL-CIO can pull their head out and try to get something done, we need to go from there.”
While no less than a dozen employers testified in support of the bill, no groups other than the trial lawyers who presented in the hearing publicly testified in opposition to the bill.
“You want my assessment on that? Everybody, all the other people, are dealing with the motion picture bill,” said Buck, referencing the Summerlin studio bill. “This is why this particular bill should never be rammed through in a special session. It’s intentionally being rammed through in a special session so no one has any eyes on it.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Medicaidwork.jpg,,,2025-11-17 08:57:46.141861

Kelly Keck
Kelly Keck has a child with special needs and is a neonatal nurse practitioner


When my daughter’s development stalled and then regressed, her bright personality dimmed. Doctors said to wait. 
But as a clinician I suspected she needed urgent help — the kind that Early Start, California’s early intervention program, provides. What I feared most was losing the spark that made her unique.
Early Start met us right at our breaking point, offering a lifeline and hope. The program transformed fragility into possibility and gave my child a voice. 
For me, it offered a circle of support that reminded me I wasn’t facing this journey alone. It introduced me to other parents facing the isolating darkness of uncertainty about their child’s future. This community became the difference between despair and determination.
From strengthening my daughter’s muscles to finding her first words, Early Start’s team also became my daughter’s and my biggest cheerleaders, celebrating progress and helping us navigate setbacks. 
But the promise that shapes thousands of families like mine now hangs by a thread. 
This summer Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill, extending tax cuts but slashing billions from Medicaid. In California, federal Medicaid funds sustain the regional centers that coordinate Early Start services for infants and toddlers with — or at risk for — developmental delays.
 With California facing a multibillion-dollar deficit, the future of such early interventions looks precarious. Losing federal support means the state must fill the funding gap or scale back, thus putting therapy, progress and hope at risk for countless children and families.
I’ve witnessed what happens when families lose access to care. When speech therapy disappears, a baby’s first words vanish into silence. When physical therapy stops, a toddler’s first steps may never come. 
From surviving to thriving
Early Start is not a luxury; it’s a bridge from surviving to thriving. When that connection is frayed, a child’s trajectory is altered, sometimes irreversibly.
The Department of Developmental Services has already warned that its caseloads are surging as staffing shortages worsen. Federal cuts will only amplify this with fewer therapists, longer waitlists and children stranded during the most critical period of their brain development. 
Every week’s delay, every family told to “wait and see,” means consequences that may never be undone, developmental windows that will not reopen.
Supporters of the Big Beautiful Bill claim it will foster innovation and eliminate “waste.” But when waste means a therapist teaching a mother to feed her baby safely or a child learning to hold a crayon, the cruelty becomes clear. Efficiency cannot replace empathy. Those proposing it have never witnessed the triumph of a child relearning to walk after months of painstaking effort.
California lawmakers cannot reverse federal decisions, but they can refuse to let our youngest citizens be left behind. California should immediately create an Early Start stabilization fund to offset Medicaid cuts, ensuring therapy access during the critical brain development stage. 
Legislators must require agencies to publicly track staffing shortages and therapy delays, making inequities visible and impossible to ignore. 
California’s congressional delegation must fight to protect the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Part C funds, which guarantee early intervention access. Election-year speeches about potential aren’t enough; lawmakers must safeguard the infrastructure that makes potential possible.
My work in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit only reinforces what’s at stake. Every day, I meet parents whose babies will need Early Start. Families finally bring home babies ready to grow, only to find themselves mired in complex systems of authorizations, denials, and delays.
If we fail to act, those babies will confront mounting waitlists, fewer specialists and programs stretched to the breaking point. 
Early Start caught my daughter and me before we fell through the cracks. For families in similar situations, losing this safety net threatens more than milestones; it threatens hope. When we protect early intervention, we save futures — one child at a time.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/061121_SummerSchool_AW_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-17 08:57:46.141861

For YIMBYs and other champions of more housing development, ditching the extra staircase has become a surprisingly buzzy cause. In Culver City, they have a test case.


In late September, Culver City became the first municipality in California to legalize the construction of mid-rise apartment buildings with a single staircase. 
Unless you’re a member of the niche but fervent subculture of architects, urbanists and pro-housing advocates who clamor for “single stair reform,” this might not sound like big news. But supporters say it could be the key to unleashing the kind of urban apartment building boom that years of pro-development legislation in Sacramento has tried, and so far failed, to deliver. 
Culver City apartments up to six stories tall can now be built around a single stairwell. Conditions apply: These buildings have to be on the small side — each floor maxes out at 4,000 square feet with no more than four units. They’ll also have to abide by an array of added fire-prevention measures.
That’s a break from the standard minimum of two staircases — connected by a corridor — required of buildings taller than three stories in nearly every other city in the country. 
For YIMBYs and other champions of more housing development, ditching the extra staircase has become a surprisingly buzzy and enduring cause. It’s one weird trick, they say, that can turbo-charge urban housing construction at a modest and more affordable scale while also promoting apartments that are bigger, airier and better lit. 
For more than a decade in California, pro-development activists have railed against zoning, the local patchwork of restrictions on what can get built where. Those efforts are beginning to bear fruit: Earlier this year, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a series of housing bills aimed at clearing legal impediments to apartment construction. The campaign for changes to the building code, the rules that specify in mind-numbing detail exactly how buildings must be constructed, appears to be the next chapter of this fight. Single stair, and the fate of Culver City’s ordinance specifically, represents an early California acid test.
“This is bigger than a staircase,” said Bubba Fish, the Culver City councilmember who introduced the single-stair ordinance. “The vast majority of the world builds apartments this way. We are an outlier. It touches on the housing crisis, the affordability crisis.”
It also runs up against more than a century of American conventional wisdom about fire safety. Multiple staircases in mid-rise apartments are meant to give occupants multiple means of escape. Though rare outside of North America, the “two ways out” rule for mid-rises has been a mainstay of fire protection policy in this country and in Canada for the last century. 
There are a handful of exceptions: New York City, Seattle, Honolulu and, most recently, Portland, Oregon, allow single-stair buildings up to six stories. Georgia, Vermont and Puerto Rico permit them up to four. 
Culver City is the first in California to join this small club. But the Los Angeles county burg is also likely to be the last — for now. This summer, state lawmakers passed a bill to freeze local building code changes in place for the next six years. The city passed its ordinance before the freeze went into effect, but others exploring the change, including San Jose and San Francisco, didn’t make the cut. 
That gives Culver City the next half decade to show the rest of the state just how much difference a single staircase actually makes.

Is one staircase better than two?
Fish, the 34-year-old councilmember, happens to be a renter in a block-spanning “luxury” apartment complex: “One of those fortresses that everyone makes fun of.”
You know the type.
Retail and a massive parking lot on the bottom. Three floors of supersized-Lego-looking residential on top. Inside, the apartments are mostly studios and one-bedrooms, long and dimly lit by windows confined to one side. On the other is a wide corridor that runs the length of the building with all the charm and utility of a hotel hallway. 
Fish spends an inordinate time thinking about that hallway. Sometimes he uses it as a place to play fetch with his new dog , but mostly he sees it as a blown opportunity.
“All of that space,” Fish marvels. “All of that could be homes.” 
Seven percent more. That’s how much floor space is dedicated to additional staircases and the various corridors that connect them in the average American apartment building, according to a first-of-its-kind study on the safety record of single-stair buildings issued by the Pew Charitable Trusts earlier this year. 
Reclaiming all that space is the first selling point for single stair advocates: Less real estate for stairs means more units, bigger units, or a combination of both. 
“This is bigger than a staircase.”Bubba Fish, councilmember, Culver City
But it’s not just a numbers game. Single-stair apartment buildings are vibe enhancers, say supporters. Allowing architects to design apartment buildings that wrap around a central staircase makes it easier for them to include units with windows on multiple sides, meaning more light and more air. 
Culver City’s cap of four units per floor also nudges design away from efficiency apartments toward roomier digs that might appeal to families. 
Single-stair apartments may be alien in much of the United States, but “represent a building more like Brooklyn or Seville or Berlin or Paris,” said Ed Mendoza, a building code policy researcher at California YIMBY. “The buildings that single-stair promotes are just more — what’s the word? Nicer. They’re nicer.”
But the biggest perk of this design, according to proponents, is that it allows apartment buildings to go up on small plots of land otherwise too cramped for the modern American apartment block.
“Funky little lots”
Seattle, like most big cities, is full of lots that are “not big enough to allow a larger scale project that would require two stairs and an elevator,” said Andrew Van Leeuwen, an architect with the Seattle-based Build LLC. 
In most cities, these parcels would be the sole domain of single-family homes interrupted by the occasional duplex. But Seattle has had a single-stair allowance on the books since the late 1970s. As a result, “all these funky little lots in the city of Seattle are eligible for nice little boutique apartment buildings,” said Van Leeuwen.
In New York City, which has allowed modest single stair buildings up to six stories for its entire history, such buildings are commonplace.
Promoting more nice little apartments is especially relevant to California this year. In September, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed one of the year’s most contentious housing measures, Senate Bill 79, allowing for much denser and higher residential development close to many public transit stops in major metro areas. The goal: Packing more apartments into California’s major cities where reasonably affordable housing has long been in catastrophically short supply.
As in Seattle, plots in these neighborhoods tend to be on the small side. Under the current two-stair requirement, a California apartment developer hoping to take advantage of the new state law and build a six story building near a train station would need to either purchase a massive lot nearby (an expensive and rare find) or successfully convince a row of neighbors to sell their properties at the same time (also expensive, even rarer). 
Zoning and single-stair reform are “two great tastes that taste great together,” said Stephen Smith, founder of the Center for Building in North America and lead author of the Pew study.
The safety record on single stair
Whenever a local or state government considers this particular change to the code, fire marshals, fire chiefs and firefighter unions regularly rise up to oppose it. The logic of their argument is intuitive enough: In the event of a fire, the more ways out the better. 
Rules requiring multiple internal staircases were born of tragedies. “Great” fires engulfed cities like Chicago, Seattle, and San Francisco in the 19th and 20th centuries. The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire killed 146 workers trapped at the top of a ten story building.
The newly sanctioned apartments in Culver City are modeled on Seattle’s ordinance with fire prevention in mind: The unit count is capped, minimizing the chances of overcrowding in the stairwell. The sole stairway itself must either be pressurized to keep out the smoke or open air. The entire building must be outfitted with the highest class of automatic sprinkler systems. That’s all on top of the strict fire-prevention standards already required of mid-rise apartment buildings: alarm systems, fire-rated walls around stairwells, doors that are set to close automatically.
But no fire prevention system — nor a complex of systems — is perfect.
“What if something happens and that one stairwell is blocked?” said Sean DeCrane with the International Association of Fire Fighters union. And while sprinkler systems and alarms are effective, they have to be maintained. “We can’t just design a building for Day One of opening. We have to think about the life of the building, and I don’t think people are thinking about that as they approach this issue.”
DeCrane’s concerns aren’t reflected in the available data. The Pew study pored over residential fire deaths across New York City between 2012 to 2024 and found that the fatality rate in single-stair buildings was both low and equal to other residential structures. No deaths were obviously attributable to the lack of a second way out. The study likewise could find no deaths in Seattle over the same time period that could be blamed on a missing staircase.
Single-stair skeptics say New York City and Seattle, with their large, professional fire departments, are not representative of much of the rest of the country.
Exporting New York and Seattle’s building code to other municipalities is based on “the assumption that the fire department is going to be able to respond with sufficient resources,” said Crane.
Weighing costs and benefits
Not that buildings allowed under the current code are entirely risk-free. 
In a modern American apartment complex, the distance from any one unit to the nearest staircase might be 250 feet, said Travis Morgan, co-founder of the Livable Cities Initiative, which advocated for the Culver City policy. “Those corridors fill up with smoke, so now you’re having to do a fireman crawl along the floor for potentially hundreds of feet,” he said. 
Even if single stair apartment buildings were found to be more dangerous —  and they haven’t been yet — Smith said the debate over single stair reveals a more fundamental philosophical split over how much risk society is willing to take on and whether certain dangers are more tolerable than others.
“Fire and building officials are looking to drive down the rate of death in new buildings and that is actually pretty different from driving down the rate of death overall,” he said. “You could mandate that every room has a fire station in it, but then that will make the world much less safe because then you live in a world where no one can live in new apartment buildings” because they are so impractically expensive.
“It’s almost impossible to go up against firefighters. They are a highly beloved group.”Ed Mendoza, researcher, California YIMBY
Instead, would-be tenants would turn to older apartment buildings, single-family homes or, in the most extreme cases, shelters and encampments. All are more vulnerable to fire danger than newly-constructed mid-rises. With fewer apartments in urban cores, more renters would also likely live further away, forcing them to commute, which comes with its own set of risks.
“What happens when you drive? You die. You die at really high risks on the road,” said Smith. “That’s a life and safety risk and it’s one that never gets accounted for in developing building codes.”
Even if you buy that argument, it makes for a tough sell. 
Unlike prior housing policy battles, in which development boosters have warred with neighborhood groups and property owners over relatively anodyne concerns like parking, shadows and “neighborhood character,” pushing changes through the building code puts activists in the unenviable political position of disputing rules ostensibly written to keep people alive. 
“It’s almost impossible to go up against firefighters,” said Mendoza with California YIMBY. “They are a highly beloved group.”
In effect, but legally uncertain
The elected officials in Culver City didn’t seem to have much trouble. The vote to pass the ordinance was unanimous. 
Next came the review by the state’s Building Standards Commission. Under California law, building codes are imposed statewide. Locals are then free to amend them, so long as they are “more restrictive.” Rescinding a required staircase would seem, on its face, to be less restrictive, though supporters of the ordinance argued that the additional safety requirements demanded of single stair buildings make it more so — or, at least, a wash. 
Ultimately, the commission accepted Culver City’s code change. But they left things on an ambiguous note, warning in a letter to city staff that the ordinance “may contain a local amendment that is less restrictive” than the state code and therefore conflicts with state law.
Translation: The state won’t be the final judge of whether the code is or isn’t illegal. If Culver City wants to permit these types of buildings, it can go ahead at its own risk.
In the past, local governments have attempted to promote their own stricter rules over the state’s clerical objections only to have developers take them to court. But this is a more unusual case of a local government changing the code not to ratchet up safety measures or energy efficiency requirements, but in order to lower costs and promote development. 
If anyone opts to challenge Culver City’s novel approach, it’s not likely to be a developer.
That leaves Culver City’s ordinance in effect for now. Though the moratorium remains in effect, more changes to the prevailing Legislative thinking on staircases could be coming soon. A 2023 state law directed the state Fire Marshal to study the state’s single-stair rules. That report is due in January.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-Staircase-Hallway-IS-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-17 08:57:46.141861

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s newest immigration judge has a long legal resume. Absent from his credentials: experience in the immigration system.
Judge Matthew Andrasko, who spent the last decade as an attorney adviser for the U.S. Air Force, isn’t alone. He’s among 25 military lawyers across several states who made the same recent career change, the U.S. Department of Justice announced last month. 
The shift comes after the Trump administration fired immigration judges in waves this year and as it continues to tap the military for help with enforcement.

Critics say it’s absurd to expect fair decisions from newcomers who are unfamiliar with the law. Beyond that, some argue the move violates a ban on using the military for law enforcement. 
Andrasko, reached by phone Friday, declined comment and referred Utah News Dispatch to a spokesperson for the Justice Department’s Executive Office of Immigration Review, which oversees immigration courts. 
The office wouldn’t comment on those criticisms. In a new federal rule outlining the plan, it said a national backlog of cases topped 4.1 million by January 2025 and the office has the authority to make the change. 
It also said there’s no reason to pass over federal employees “with stellar credentials” because they don’t have experience in immigration law. Previously, the job was only open to immigration judges, administrative law judges, and Justice Department attorneys with 10 years of experience in immigration.  
The new crop of judges is on a temporary six-month assignment, but the department said the term could be extended. 
Separately, the Justice Department hired 11 judges for permanent roles, mostly in Texas and Southern states. The majority have an immigration background, and some have military ties. 
In Utah, many attorneys understood the new judge, while assigned here, would hear cases from other states. But lawyer Christopher Vizcardo said he represented a client in Adrasko’s courtroom in a brief hearing last week. 
“He was very polite, and he was very kind, very reasonable with my client,” Vizcardo said.

Utah began the year with five immigration judges but dropped down to two over the summer. One judge took a buyout, another left the job abruptly and a third was fired. As a result, the system has slowed down significantly, Vizcardo said. 
“Everything is taking longer now, and I think that for my clients that do fear returning to their home country, they have an interest in having their case adjudicated as soon as possible,” Vizcardo said. “So in that sense, I’m happy that we have more help because I think in the long term, it’s going to be good for my clients so they can finally get legal status in the United States.”
But he’s also concerned about how well the new temporary judges can handle complex legal arguments and convoluted, yearslong cases. He noted they may feel pressure to churn fast as they try to clear the backlog. 
“If they’re too quick about making their decision, I don’t think that that’s good for the due process of my clients, either,” Vizcardo said. 
Attorney Nicholle Pitt White said the change comes with unknowns but she agrees it may work in her clients’ favor.   
“We’ve found that a lot of judges — when they’re new to the bench, especially if they don’t have a lot of prior experience — tend to give more favorable outcomes to our clients in certain situations where another immigration judge may have denied their case,” she said. It’s not clear how much instruction the new judges are getting.

APLS said the Fairhope Public Library has forfeited state money suspended amid a dispute over content. Fairhope library officials said they were not consulted about the loss.  (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Fairhope Public Library has permanently lost over $20,000 in state funding that the Alabama Public Library Service Board had withheld since March amid disputes over library materials found in the teen section.
The $22,000 in question, about half the state aid it had been allocated,  was disbursed to other libraries in Baldwin County because APLS said the library had materials the APLS board considered sexually explicit and out of compliance with state regulations past a June 30 deadline.
Randal Wright, chair of the Fairhope Public Library Board, said Friday she was “disappointed, shocked, confused (and) angry.”

“There are so many adjectives I can think of to describe my feelings in conjunction with this,” she said.” I don’t even know where to start. The bottom line is that I am really disappointed in how APLS has handled this. I am very disturbed that we have lost this funding, it is a critical part of our library’s budget.”
The board first suspended Fairhope’s funding in March after complaints alleging the Fairhope Public Library continued to place books that are sexually explicit and inappropriate on the shelves of the teens’ section of the library in violation of the APLS administrative code.
Others disputed that claim and supported the library. The books at the center of the controversy included ‘Sold,’ a novel about human trafficking and child sexual exploitation in India that includes a scene of a rape, though one the author says does not include graphic language. A second book explained what consent is to minors.
A state law says that libraries not in compliance with the APLS administrative code by the end of June will lose funding allocated at the start of the fiscal year. APLS disbursed the Fairhope Public Library’s funding in either late August or early September.
Libraries may retrieve the funds that were suspended only if the APLS Board declares they are back in compliance with the rules by that deadline or otherwise lost the funding they are due permanently.
Katie Bailey, assistant director of APLS, said on Friday that other libraries in the state have permanently forfeited their state aid because they were not in compliance by the deadline. It was not clear Friday whether the Fairhope Public Library is only one to lose funding in a dispute over library materials.
“I did not expect them to go past June 30 before getting in compliance,” said John Wahl, chair of APLS Board and the Alabama Republican Party. “The bottom line is, they were not in compliance with state code, they were warned about that and were suspended in March. And they could have finished their review process and requested to get in compliance before June 30. They were the ones who did not make that request.”
Libraries are allocated funding at the beginning of the fiscal year but are distributed in four equal installments each quarter. The Fairhope Public Library received two of the installments, half of the total, in December and in early spring of 2025.
However, at the APLS Board meeting in March, members voted almost unanimously to suspend state aid due to the Fairhope Public Library after Amy Minton, one of the board members, made a motion to suspend the library’s funding as well as a second motion to terminate Nancy Pack, the former director of the Alabama Public Library Service.
For the next several months, the board of trustees of the Fairhope Public Library reviewed the books that individuals challenged. The library reviewed 17 books in total, according to Robert Gourlay, the director of the Fairhope Public Library, in an interview on Friday. Board members decided to reshelve seven of the books in the adult section but keep the rest in the teens section where they had been originally placed.
Both Wright and Gourlay said they had not been given any update on the status of their state aid since the meeting in September when they met with the APLS Board in person to discuss their decisions regarding the books that were challenged.
At that meeting, the APLS Board decided to review the books that were challenged to make their own determination before formally deciding whether the Fairhope Public Library was in compliance and eligible to receive state aid.
Wright had expected to receive the funding that APLS had suspended once the library was found to be back in compliance.
“I had hoped that if they voted to reinstate us, that we would get the money,” Wright said. “Now, I am assuming they are going to vote ‘no’ because there is no money to give us.”
Wahl said that the rules are in state code that stated the Fairhope Public Library was at risk of permanently losing its funding.
“The APLS Board was actually expecting them to come back with their review process far sooner than August,” Wahl said. “It was the decision of the Fairhope Public Library to delay getting back with us on that.”
The Fairhope community has been supportive of the library. Supporters raised tens of thousands of dollars this spring.

(Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada Current)Las Vegan Mike Kosor is a longtime thorn in the side of the homeowners association industry, and of state regulators he asserts are too cozy with those they regulate. Wielding powers generally reserved for government tribunals, HOAs can assess fines, deny property rights, and even foreclose. 
Kosor and other critics contend the Nevada Real Estate Division (NRED), which regulates HOAs, is a smokescreen designed to do the bidding of the multi-million dollar industry it oversees, often at the expense of the 1.3 million Nevada homeowners subject to HOA control. 
So it came as a surprise to Kosor when Dr. Kristopher Sanchez, director of the Nevada Department of Business and Industry, which oversees the Real Estate Division, invited Kosor to be a member of an HOA task force that met a few times after it was created by legislators in 2019 as a response to concerns about the independence of NRED, then went dormant. 
“Your expertise and commitment to public service will be invaluable, I appreciate your willingness to serve and look forward to your thoughtful contributions,” Sanchez wrote to Kosor via email on Oct. 13. 
“Surprised by that bold direction — and encouraged by the potential the Task Force offered — when asked to serve, I accepted,” Kosor wrote on his blog. 
But the day after issuing the invitation to Kosor, Sanchez’ office scheduled a phone meeting with Kosor for Oct. 17.  
“Sanchez offered a strained explanation difficult to square: he said he had received ‘many calls’ from parties he declined to identify, expressing “concern” over my selection — creating a level of disapproval he believed would make it impossible for the Task Force to function,” Kosor wrote. 
Kosor, in an interview, notes his appointment had yet to be made public, and wonders how Sanchez could have received so much objectionable feedback in one day, that he scheduled a call to rescind Kosor’s invitation.  
“This is very disappointing and frustrating, Michael,” a key insider in Gov. Joe Lombardo’s re-election campaign, who Kosor asked the Current not to name, wrote to Kosor via email after being informed of his removal from the task force. “You’re making waves in the CIC [common interest communities] community, and major players are exerting political influence. The Governor trusts Kris and will be deferential to him on these kinds of decisions.”
Lombardo’s office did not respond when asked if the governor received complaints about Kosor or discussed his removal from the task force with Sanchez. 
Sanchez also did not respond to inquiries from the Current. 
Kosor contends that because of state inaction, he’s been required to take his beef against his association to court, where he’s spent more than half a million dollars on legal fees. Most recently, he’s been represented by Hutchison and Steffen, the law firm founded by former Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison, who serves as Lombardo’s campaign manager. 
Lombardo, Kosor notes, has promised more, not less, accountability in Nevada government. 
“Accountability is always the key. Throughout my history in education, law enforcement, and as your governor, our constituents continually say we have to hold the schools [to] more accountability… Less money, more accountability,” he said in September during his reelection announcement. 
“The first opportunity his people have to be accountable, they throw off the one guy that wants to hold them accountable,” Kosor told the Current on Thursday. 
In a letter to Sanchez, Kosor says his removal from the task force, “appears to be a bow to industry influence,” adding Sanchez was “keenly aware of my longtime criticism” of the state, and “concems with the industry’s long-standing dominance over all things HOA, and the lack of attention paid to the systemic issues that have plagued Nevada homeowners – and frustrated lawmakers – for decades. Yet despite that, or perhaps precisely because of it, you determined my presence on the ‘reconstituted’ Task Force constructive.”
Kosor wrote that of equal importance was Sanchez’ “decision to include independent and opposing voices – an element missing from the prior Task Force and vital to strengthening its credibility and the public’s confidence in this effort.”
However, Kosor notes, the expanded task force of eleven members includes just two homeowners, while numerous members represent related legal and property management interests. 
“It has become clear that the same forces that captured the regulator and sidelined the original Task Force have now shaped the reconstitution effort,” Kosor wrote to Sanchez. “I am disappointed to see how easily your resolve – and the machinery of reform – can be redirected into preserving the very status quo it was meant to challenge.”
The Department of Business and Industry, which Sanchez leads, is no stranger to allegations that it has been captured by the industries it seeks to regulate. 
The department also oversees Nevada’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which rescinded $400,000 in fines levied against Elon Musk’s Boring Company in May of this year, after a meeting between the governor’s office and company executives, Fortune reported this week. A record of the meeting was removed from Nevada OSHA’s database, according to the story. 
A records request submitted by the Current to Nevada OSHA in September for all fines levied against the Boring Company since it began digging tunnels in Nevada, and the balance owed, was returned with just one fine listed for $112,504, assessed in 2023.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly formally endorsed state Sen. Ethan Corson’s campaign for governor on Monday, favoring a “true middle-of-the-road” politician she believed capable of drawing enough votes from Kansas Republicans, Democrats and independents to prevail in 2026.
Kelly, a popular governor forbidden from seeking reelection to a third term, said the Democrat from Fairway was the candidate most capable of being a voice of reason in terms of the state budget, protecting K-12 public school funding, lowering taxes and delivering economic growth. These themes, and a relentless critique of former Gov. Sam Brownback, anchored Kelly’s gubernatorial victory over Republican nominee Kris Kobach in 2018 and narrow defeat of GOP candidate Derek Schmidt in 2022.
“Kansas is in good shape right now. And that is why I am enthusiastically endorsing Ethan Corson,” Kelly said in a statement. “Ethan will build on my work, but he will also bring visionary and bold new ideas to the job. His allegiance will be to Kansans, not party or politics. Ethan is a good man. He wants to be governor for the right reasons. He is a true public servant.”
Kelly’s endorsement of Corson wasn’t a surprise, given her statement in July that he would be a “very strong candidate” and pointing to Corson as “someone laser focused on the issues Kansans really care about.”
“Ethan is a true middle-of-the-road candidate who will attract that same broad base of support that is necessary to win but also to then govern effectively. He is the most qualified and most suited to be our next governor,” Kelly said.
In the Kansas Democratic Party’s primary set for August, Corson’s main rival would appear to be Democratic Sen. Cindy Holscher of Overland Park. Democrat Marty Tuley of Lawrence also declared his candidacy.
Corson, an attorney and former director of the Kansas Democratic Party, was elected to the Kansas Senate in 2020 and reelected in 2024 to serve a northeast Johnson County district. In the Senate, Corson said, he joined bipartisan efforts to cut property and income taxes, eliminate a state sales tax on groceries and end the state tax on Social Security benefits. He also sought to target tax relief for the benefit of seniors, veterans and working Kansans.
“I’m honored to have Gov. Kelly’s endorsement and grateful for her confidence in my ability to keep Kansas moving forward,” Corson said.
As governor, I’ll build on the progress we’ve made by lowering costs, creating good paying jobs, strengthening our public schools, and bringing both parties to the table to deliver results for all Kansans.”
Corson entered the race for governor in July. He reported Nov. 5 the campaign raised $500,000 from nearly 2,000 donors in the initial 100 days of the campaign. During an 8,000-mile, crisscross journey of Kansas, Corson emphasized lowering the cost of living for working-class families, creating good-paying jobs and strengthening investment in public schools. He said his goal was to bring “both parties to the table to deliver results for all Kansans.”
“Our campaign is about creating a Kansas where the next generation can build a life right here,” he said. “That means lower costs for families, the best public schools in America, safer communities and a growing economy in all 105 counties.”
Corson, 43, earned a law degree at Washington University in St. Louis and worked seven years for a firm in Washington, D.C. He was employed by the U.S. Department of Commerce before returning to Kansas in 2019 to be executive director of the state Democratic Party.
Kansas candidates for governor must maneuver through an electorate that delivered double-digit victories in 2016, 2020 and 2024 for President Donald Trump.
In addition, no political party in Kansas has retained the governorship for more than eight consecutive years since the 1950s.
Candidates for the Republican Party’s nomination for governor include former Gov. Jeff Colyer, Senate President Ty Masterson, Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt, Secretary of State Scott Schwab, businessman Philip Sarnecki, former Johnson County Commissioner Charlotte O’Hara and former Wichita school board member Joy Eakins.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1132285-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-17 08:57:46.141861

A state senator last week said the price tag on a new men's prison in Elmore County had grown to $1.2 billion, eating up nearly all the money the Legislature allocated in 2021 for the construction of two prisons. (FIle)Most Alabama politicians call themselves fiscal conservatives. But in Alabama, fiscal conservatism is usually performative and never consistent.
We often hear boasts that Alabama balances its budgets. This is not a choice. Alabama, like every state except Vermont, has to pass a balanced budget every year. We might struggle to do that if the federal government didn’t pay for 73% of our Medicaid program.
Another fun adventure with numbers took place in 2013. That year, Gov. Robert Bentley and legislative Republicans proclaimed that they had saved the state over $1 billion a year.
What they actually meant was that three years of cutting public jobs and slashing retirement benefits for teachers and state workers would lead to annual savings of $1 billion. In 30 years.
You don’t have to look far to find more examples of situational frugality. Take the Gov. Kay Ivey Correctional Complex in Elmore County.
In 2021, Ivey persuaded the Alabama Legislature to approve a $1.3 billion construction package for corrections facilities. The governor and her supporters had argued for years that Alabama’s prisons were aging and decrepit; that they were unsafe for incarcerated people and staff members, and that they lacked space for training and rehabilitation programs.
The plan called for two 4,000-bed men’s facilities. The first would go up in Elmore County and the second in Escambia County. There was even language (though no dedicated funding) authorizing renovations at other men’s prisons, and construction of a new women’s facility to replace the 80-year-old Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women in Wetumpka.
Four years on, the state is struggling to get the first part of that agenda done.
Barely 18 months after the Legislature approved borrowing for the Elmore County prison, the cost jumped by $300 million. It’s now $1.2 billion. That number will almost certainly rise further by the time the prison is finished, which officials expect next year. At this point, the Escambia prison is little more than an intention.
Ivey and other prison supporters are correct to be concerned about deteriorating corrections facilities. But the high cost of renovating them was a big selling point of the construction program. With every dollar the Elmore prison plucks from the treasury, that case gets weaker.
In light of that, you’d expect fiscal conservatives to demand answers. To this point, they’ve shrugged.
“I mean, I wish it wasn’t up there,” House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, said in 2023, after the first leap in price. “But inflation has hit us pretty hard over the last few months, and I think that’s certainly a reflection of that.”
Two years later, lawmakers continue to treat soaring costs as inevitable. The Legislature borrowed even more money earlier this year for prison construction, and are talking about more for the Escambia facility.
Compare this fatalism to the white hot rage Medicaid expansion sparks in these same people. Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, who has sponsored the prison construction bills, opposes Medicaid expansion and removed a provision from a 2024 gambling bill that could have allowed it to move forward.
What would Medicaid expansion cost the state?
About $225 million a year, according to the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama. The state would make most if not all that money back in new tax revenues from jobs created by expansion. Even better, public health would improve. Hundreds of thousands of Alabamians would have a little more peace of mind.
For the price of one still-incomplete prison, we could have paid for five years of Medicaid expansion. For all the money spent on locking up 4,000 people, we could have improved the lives of at least 174,000 Alabamians.
But that’s a trade-off our leaders will gladly make. Since 1819, our state government has had a single priority: control. Control of Alabamians; control of policy, and above all, control of punishment.
A government obsessed with keeping people in line can never spend enough on a prison. In that view, walls and bars aren’t a service of government; they’re why government exists. The people building them are heroes, worthy of our unquestioning trust.
Inevitably, a government obsessed with order will hold the governed in contempt. A prison going far over budget is just normal business. A person using food aid to buy a candy bar is a scandal.
A corrections facility that costs $300 million than expected, and then $300 million more? Eh, not worth our attention. Not like a person getting $275 a week while looking for job. That’s a serious abuse of public trust and requires weekly reports from the person getting that pittance.
Our lawmakers love creating felony offenses, making our overcrowding crisis worse. But most seem content with the state cutting tens of millions of dollars in checks to settle excessive force lawsuits, instead of confronting the violence and chaos in Alabama prisons. Because prisons are always the answer.
And if the Elmore facility costs $10 billion, our leaders will keep shoveling money into it. In Alabama, there is no greater civic virtue than punishment. And when it comes to punishing Alabamians, no dollar is ever wasted.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-Flag-2019-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-17 08:57:46.141861

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)The Nevada State Legislature over the weekend moved closer to passing the largest public subsidy package in state history — $1.65 billion in transferable tax credits over 15 years to film productions and a 31-acre film studio in Las Vegas.
The Assembly on Sunday morning narrowly passed the film studio bill, 22-20. A Senate committee, after a more than 6-hour long hearing, approved the bill 6-2.
The Assembly’s narrow passage came after another round of political theatre, in which a group of Democrats challenged Speaker Steve Yeager’s decision to allow two Republicans, who were known to be “yes” vote on the bill, to vote remotely. Procedural rules in the chamber allow for remote voting under exceptional circumstances.
The Assembly, minus the two remote members, voted on a razor-thin margin to allow the remote voting, paving the way for the film studio bill’s passage.
The final tally of 22-20 mirrored a June regular session vote by the Assembly on an earlier version of the bill. However, several members changed their positions.
Three assemblymembers who voted against the project in June voted for it on Sunday: Republican Brian Hibbetts and Democrats Hanadi Nadeem and Cinthia Zermeño Moore.
Moore, in an interview after the vote, said she changed her position because of the construction jobs it will create and because of an adopted amendment giving $6 million to Chicanos Por La Causa to create a job training facility on the eastside of Las Vegas.
“Getting outside of this building and going back to my district, I was able to talk to my constituents and regular folks who are not here in the building,” said Moore. “They want this in my district.”
Nadeem declined to speak to the Nevada Current after the vote.
Hibbetts, Nadeem and Moore’s new yay votes offset three other assemblymembers who supported the film studio bill in June but voted against it Sunday: Democrats Jovan Jackson and Elaine Marzola and Republican Burt Gurr.
Vince Saavedra, the executive secretary-treasurer of the Southern Nevada Building Trades Unions, which has been heavily lobbying for the bill’s passage, said after the vote he thought the bill would have “an easier time” over at the Senate because conversations with senators have been happening concurrently with the Assembly.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-1-1024x683.png,,,2025-11-17 08:57:46.141861

“The Chinese Communist Party is not a normal government,” Sobolik, who also presented as an affiliate of the Vandenberg Coalition, a neoconservative foreign policy nonprofit, said. “It’s a one party dictatorship determined to reshape the world to its advantage, to weaken the United States from within. Beijing’s goal is clear: to displace America as the world’s leading power, to export authoritarianism and to erode our freedoms and institutions here at home in the United States.”
From local law enforcement using drones made by DJI to solar inverters made by Huawei to ports using cranes made by CPMC — all based in China— Sobolik emphasized that these companies and others could be feeding information back to the Chinese government. 
“Beijing wouldn’t need to launch missiles from across the world or detonate an electromagnetic pulse from space to darken our cities,” he added. “They could simply trigger the kill switches already hidden within our infrastructure.”
Biotechnology was also a key point for Sobolik.
“During the COVID-19 pandemic, BGI offered cheap testing kits worldwide, quietly gathering genetic data from unsuspecting populations,” he said, referring to a Chinese genomics company, adding that it was “nearly impossible” to know precisely how that data was being used.

Committee chairman Rep. William Bruck (R-Erie) asked specifically about 23andMe, a genetic testing ancestry company whose bankruptcy earlier this year prompted concerns that the company would sell that data as part of a resolution. Sobolik responded that COVID-19 tests were a much greater risk, as many were coming from Chinese companies. 
One additional target of Sobolik’s presentation was higher education, specifically Chinese international students he said were functioning as essentially Chinese Communist Party agents. Sobolik pointed to four instances where students or researchers tied to the University of Michigan were arrested or charged on issues of security. 
In one of those instances, charges were announced last week by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan against three Chinese nationals who allegedly attempted to smuggle biological materials related to round worms into a research laboratory at the University of Michigan. 
Sobolik also referenced a case from earlier this year in which a noncitizen Chinese international student at the University of Michigan allegedly voted in the 2024 election. 
“There are many PRC nationals who are applying for these student visas, not because of some nefarious scheme that they are a part of willingly,” Sobolik said. “When Chinese students come over here, they are monitored, surveilled, and organized, either by consulates or by student organizations that operate on college campuses that report to consulates in the embassy.”
Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) asked Sobolik about President Donald Trump’s plan to bring hundreds of thousands of Chinese international students to American universities — which Sobolik called a “profound concern.”
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed concerns about the issues that Sobolik raised throughout the hearing. The minority vice chair of the committee, Rep. Denise Mentzer (D-Mt. Clemens), as well as Bruck, said that his testimony had “scared the hell out of us,” as Mentzer said.

(Courtesy Castelion Corp.)On Monday, the New Mexico Economic Development Department announced that California-based Castelion Corp. will build its 1,000-acre manufacturing plant, known as ‘Project Ranger,’ in Sandoval County.
The facility will build solid rocket motors, conduct static tests and “assemble components to produce finished rounds,” according to a news release.
The department in August announced New Mexico was in the running for the facility. In a statement Monday, Castelion’s co-founder and CFO Andrew Kreitz said the company conducted a “competitive nationwide search” and ultimately chosen New Mexico “for its technical talent, regional infrastructure, and history of scientific achievement. Project Ranger represents a critical step in restoring America’s capacity to produce the advanced systems our country needs.”
In a statement Monday, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said Project Ranger would help carry forward New Mexico’s “legacy” of being “front and center in shaping the frontiers of American defense and innovation.” Economic Development Secretary Rob Black, in an echoing statement, invoked the atomic Manhattan Project, noting that, “securing this investment propels our innovation economy forward, creating high-tech careers and reinforcing our position as a hub for advanced manufacturing and national security.”
The state says the project will create more than 300 high-paying jobs and “generate more than $650 million in economic output over the next decade.” Castelion, the NMEDD news release says, plans to invest more than $100 million over the project’s first four years, with more to follow.
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) also praised the selection of Sandoval County for Project Ranger, noting his own efforts “to bolster New Mexico’s bases, defense research labs, and private industry partners so we can keep excelling in emerging defense capabilities.”
Rio Rancho Mayor Greg Hull, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, characterized the project as “in line with Rio Rancho’s history of advanced manufacturing and New Mexico’s expertise in national defense.”
According to the state, Project Ranger is expected to break ground early next year.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/castelion-april-launch.jpg-1024x683.webp,,,2025-11-17 07:56:15.156312

Ned Lamont vetoed after the regular session.,"The House and Senate approved a wide-ranging housing bill last week to replace a similar bill that Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed after the regular session.
House Bill 8002 requires towns to create housing growth plans, changes minimum off-street parking requirements, expands fair rent commissions and incentivizes towns to take steps to allow more housing, among other measures.
Its major goal is to make it easier to build more housing in Connecticut. Housing costs have gotten more expensive and homelessness has risen over the past several years. Experts say there hasn’t been enough housing built in Connecticut to meet the need, which has made these and other issues worse.
Lamont is expected to sign the new bill, which he helped negotiate with local leadership.
Here’s a look at what happened in housing legislation in the special session last week.
Why was there a special session?
During the regular session, the legislature passed a sweeping housing bill known as House Bill 5002, but Lamont vetoed the measure after facing opposition from local leaders. He said he wanted to find a way to get them on board with the measure. 
After months of working on a new version of the bill, Lamont called the legislature into special session for two days. The House met Wednesday, and the Senate met Thursday. They passed the housing bill in addition to three other bills.
Lamont has touted the new bill because local leaders, who broadly opposed the old bill, have signed on. A bipartisan group of mayors and first selectmen spoke at a press conference in support of the new bill.
Democrats said they wanted to get a bill passed to meet the need for more housing as soon as possible, while Republicans criticized the special session, saying the bill should have been brought in regular session when the public could read it and comment.
What will change in my town’s zoning?
Some of that isn’t clear yet and is up to your town. The bill requires towns to create housing growth plans, with goals on how many units they’ll plan and zone for.
If towns create these plans or take certain steps to add more housing near train and bus stations or in downtowns, they’ll have access to a new state fund and can get more state reimbursement for what they spend on school construction.
The bill also says that towns can’t require developers who build new apartments with fewer than 16 units to add off-street parking, with a couple of exceptions.
Democrats and housing advocates say these measures will help push towns to build more housing because a lot of local zoning makes it hard to build apartments. Republicans fear it will reduce local control.
What else is in the bill?
This is a big bill that deals with a lot of different issues. It expands the number of fair rent commissions, which is a government body that can hear complaints about rent increases and make decisions on whether to change that rental increase number.
It bans “hostile architecture,” or the use of things like armrests in the middle of benches or spikes to make it harder for people experiencing homelessness to lie down.
It also establishes the Connecticut Department of Housing as a statewide housing authority, which means they can work with towns to build more housing and build on state land.
How is this different from the old bill?
This bill has a lot of similarities to the old bill. Many Democrats who worked on the bill said the majority has stayed the same; it’s mostly the zoning portions that have changed.
One difference is the creation of the state fund to encourage towns to participate in the programs to increase housing density near public transit and in downtowns. The former bill had measures that would have prioritized certain existing infrastructure funding for towns that decided to make certain zoning changes.
It also eliminates a process known as “fair share” that assigned each town a specific number of units to plan and zone for. Instead, regional councils of government will figure out how many units each town needs to plan for. Towns can either participate in the plans from the COGs or create their own plans and their own goals.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1112_SR_SpecialSession_015-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-17 07:56:15.156312

As Obamacare subsidies expire, monthly costs spike for thousands of Wyomingites.
The post Teton County residents grapple with skyrocketing health insurance premiums appeared first on WyoFile .","Though Margie Lynch may have a few decades on Sam Strauss, the two Teton County residents have a lot in common.
They’re both active outdoor recreationists, with Lynch, 58, donning skis in the winter and Strauss, 29, hopping on a snowboard. They’re both nontraditional workers — Lynch runs her own business, while Strauss balances seasonal and contract work as a wildlife guide.
Now, they’re both grappling with skyrocketing increases to their health insurance premiums.
“It truly just boggles the mind,” Lynch said. “It’s reflecting that our health care system is broken.”
If Strauss wanted to continue on her gold health insurance plan, her monthly premium would more than double, from $443 to $919. For Lynch, the bill would jump from $862 to more than $2,000 per month.
Strauss and Lynch could each choose less-optimal bronze plans, but even then, they would pay $810 and $1,585 a month, respectively. And those premium costs do not include how much they could pay in total after factoring in deductibles and out-of-pocket health care costs under the new plans. Both could climb to tens of thousands of dollars every year.

“It’s scary, staring down the barrel of almost $1,000 a month in just my premium cost,” Strauss said. “It’s anxiety inducing, and it’s causing me to ask myself a lot of hard questions and look at tough options, none of them good.”
The two women get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act’s Health Insurance Marketplace, also dubbed Obamacare. In October, the longest government shutdown in U.S. history began with Senate Democrats digging in their heels in an effort to extend the subsidies that have made Obamacare plans more affordable for millions of Americans.
Seven Senate Democrats and one independent voted last Monday to end the shutdown without securing the Obamacare subsidies. The subsidies are now set to expire at the end of this year, driving up costs for many people in Teton County and across the region and country. Though Republicans have promised a December vote on extending them, it’s unlikely that the measure would pass, particularly in the House.
“It looks like the enhanced premium tax credits will expire,” said Jenn Lowe, executive director for Healthy Wyoming, a coalition that advocates for Medicaid expansion in the state. “This is really challenging in Wyoming.”
The subsidies have been credited with nearly doubling the number of Wyomingites who enroll in Obamacare plans. Without the subsidies, the Wyoming Department of Health has estimated that up to 20,000 people in the Equality State could opt out of health insurance entirely.
“Expiring tax credits will force thousands of Wyomingites to go without health care insurance,” Lowe said. “This is a gamble that will not pay off for many of our friends and colleagues and neighbors.”
“It’s what we’ve been warning about,” said Eric Boley, president of the Wyoming Hospital Association, in reaction to Strauss’ and Lynch’s premium hikes. “I don’t know how people are going to afford their insurance” without the subsidies.
Strauss and Lynch do not want to forgo health insurance. Instead, they’re among the Teton County residents grappling with what to do.
“I’m 58. I have real concerns that I may need some pretty significant health services,” Lynch said. “I don’t want to bankrupt myself making sure that I have the care that I need.”

Lynch plans to look at other options, but considers whether she may have to pay up and shy away from accessing care in light of a sky-high deductible.
“I’m wondering if I am going to have to bite the bullet,” Lynch said. “And just not procure any services unless they are free, or I’m in desperate need of them, to avoid the $10,600 of the deductible.”
Unexpected cancer is among Lynch’s worries, as are costs if she were to be injured in an accident given how active she is. She is considering lifestyle changes, including whether to change how she works in order to qualify for health care coverage through an employer.
Strauss is also considering changes, including declining some contract work.
Though the looming Obamacare subsidy expiration would affect people on Marketplace plans across income levels, it will deal the biggest blow to people who make more than 400% of the federal poverty level, or $62,600 in 2025. People who make beyond that will be cut off from tax credits, some of which still would be available to people at the lower income levels.
Strauss’ yearly income hovers right around that level. Given the nature of her work, how much she earns in a given year is unpredictable. That could put her in a bind. If she makes too much, she may face thousands more in health insurance costs. If she makes less, she may have to dip into her savings to afford insurance and deductibles.
“I’m having to choose between saving for a home here in Wyoming and just not having insurance, or just living paycheck to paycheck in order to continue to afford insurance,” Strauss said.
“I feel such sadness for the people of this state who have some really hard decisions to make. And I also feel a lot of anger towards the politicians that are throwing working-class Wyomingites under the bus here.”Sam Strauss
The prospect of declining work in order to access subsidies was disheartening.
“I feel passionate about what I do. I feel like there’s purpose in what I do,” Strauss said. “Saying no to doing that feels like an antithesis to this idea of a hard-working young person trying to make a good future for themselves.”
Other people in Jackson Hole may face even more of a financial hit, putting a decision to enroll in Obamacare plans off the table entirely.
Miga Rossetti, who purchased an Obamacare plan for her family of four in 2025, faces a monthly premium of $4,301 for a bronze plan. That’s more than $50,000 a year, without even considering a hefty deductible of $21,000 before insurance will pay a dime of health expenses.
“It’s a nonstarter,” Rossetti said. She and her husband are exploring catastrophic plans for themselves and student health plans for their two daughters in college.
“Republicans believe that taxpayer dollars should go directly to people who are making their own decisions about health care for their families, not the insurance companies.”Sen. John Barrasso
Strauss said she could weather $919 a month, which she said was a privileged position. She worried about people faced with harder decisions.
“I feel such sadness for the people of this state who have some really hard decisions to make,” Strauss said. “And I also feel a lot of anger towards the politicians that are throwing working-class Wyomingites under the bus here.”
U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, Wyoming’s top congressional lawmaker and the second-highest-ranking Republican in the Senate, decried the Obamacare subsidies in comments on the Senate floor over the weekend. Barrasso formerly was a doctor.
“Republicans believe that taxpayer dollars should go directly to people who are making their own decisions about health care for their families, not the insurance companies,” Barrasso said. “Let the American people decide what works for them and their families.”
The senator’s words were “disgusting and disheartening” to Strauss, who said Barrasso was abandoning thousands of people in Wyoming who want insurance. She contested his logic about letting Americans decide.
“He’s offering agency, when he’s limiting our choices,” Strauss said.

Representatives for U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Harriet Hageman did not respond to emailed requests for comment.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming, the only company that offers Obamacare plans to people in Teton County, attributed rising health insurance premiums to having to pay more for health care and medication. The subsidy expiration might add an additional burden, it said, estimating that more than 10,000 Wyomingites might be at risk of going uninsured next year.
“We understand that the expiration of the enhanced subsidies will put additional financial pressure on individuals,” CEO and President Diane Gore wrote in an email. “Unfortunately, without an extension, some Marketplace purchasers with higher incomes will see a significant increase in health care premiums.”
Lynch has written of her concerns to Barrasso and Lummis, who also acknowledged access to care as important but railed against the Obamacare subsidies.
“They both signal that they support larger reforms to health care costs,” Lynch said. “I agree, but they can’t leave us in the lurch while that gets worked out.”

(Photo Courtesy Santa Fe National Forest)The New Mexico environment and health departments on Friday issued an alert urging Mora Count residents to test their private wells following the discovery of high levels of metal in the groundwater.
While the source of the metals has not been determined, a news release noted that they ones are found in fire suppressant materials used to battle wildfires — including the 2022 Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon fire.
“There are potential long-term health effects that can develop over several years if people continue to drink untreated water with these levels of metals,” New Mexico Department Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau Chief Chelsea Langer said in a statement. “The only way to know for sure what is in your well water is to have it tested by a certified laboratory.”
According to the news release, those metals at higher concentrations or with long-term exposure “can damage the kidneys, skin, cardiovascular system, and nervous system.” Infants, young children and pregnant people have the most sensitivity, particularly to arsenic and manganese, which can impact brain development.
According to a news release, three metals, antimony, arsenic and uranium, exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s safe drinking water limits, and the study found elevated levels of manganese beyond the EPA guidelines as well.
An independent study also found barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, thallium and vanadium at elevated levels, but within EPA standards.
The New Mexico Environment Department is recommending all private well owners test their water at a certified lab, and decrease exposure by drinking bottled water “when possible.” Moreover, NMED recommends installing whole-house reverse osmosis systems “out of an abundance of caution.”
The state says it will be developing additional plans for testing and water treatment solutions.

(USDA Photo by Lance Cheung)New Jersey lawmakers want the state’s retailers to tell consumers how much they’re paying for tariffs, a move criticized as unworkable by an industry group that has broadly opposed the Trump administration’s tariff policy.
Legislation sponsored by Assemblywomen Annette Quijano (D-Union) and Rosie Bagolie (D-Essex) would require retailers to display the portion of a product’s cost attributable to tariffs on store tags, receipts, and online product pages.
“The consumer has the right to know how they’re paying for the tariffs and for the goods. It’s a simple disclosure,” said Quijano, the bill’s prime sponsor in the Assembly.
The legislation, which saw a Senate companion introduced earlier this month by Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson), is Democrats’ latest response to President Donald Trump’s tariff-heavy trade policy, which was a frequent target of Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill on the campaign trail.
Tariffs are a tax on importers — in this case, firms based in the United States — on goods brought in from abroad. Tariffs raise businesses’ costs by increasing the cost of their goods, and firms typically pass some or all of those cost increases onto consumers, though the increases take time to filter through supply chains and into storefronts.
The state bill has drawn some resistance from the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, an industry group that is critical of the administration’s tariffs but warned that complicated international supply chains could make determining tariff costs impractical or expensive.
“There is a good idea behind it. As somebody who does not like tariffs — and BIA has publicly pointed out concerns with tariffs — this is a very burdensome and unrealistic way of trying to tackle the issues that tariffs bring,” said Chris Emigholz, the group’s chief government affairs officer.
Analysts spanning the political spectrum — from the conservative Tax Foundation to the liberal Urban Institute and the slew of investment banks in between — have warned the Trump administration’s tariff regime will cause the country’s gross domestic product to contract and shrink the variety and quality of goods available in the United States.
Disentangling those added costs can be complicated, Emigholz said, because businesses’ supply chains can stretch into multiple countries, each with its own tariff rate, at different stages of production for different products or components that are later imported into the United States.
Complicating matters is that businesses may not pass the entirety of tariff costs onto consumers through price increases. In competitive markets, businesses are incentivized to keep prices down, and those that add the full cost of tariffs to retail prices risk losing sales to retailers that add only a portion.
“Every day, I’m sure there’s some tax increase and some tariff being absorbed by a company for a competitive advantage, and every single day there’s tariffs being passed onto consumers because they can’t afford to,” Emigholz said.
Quijano said retailers could figure out their tariff expenses by talking to wholesalers.
The bill would require wholesalers to maintain records of their tariff costs and share those records with retailers so they can comply with the bill’s disclosure provisions. Retailers found to be out of compliance by periodic audits required under the bill would face fines of up to $500 for each violation.
“You buy from your wholesalers. You know what the price is, and the wholesalers are going to have to tell them. I don’t see it as that hard,” she said.
Uncertainty about how much tariffs were increasing prices was a major driver for the legislation, Quijano said.
“We just see prices increasing. No one’s disclosing that there’s a tariff or how much it is. That’s why this bill is so important,” she said.
The bill includes some exceptions. Retailers with less than $500,000 in annual revenue would not be required to disclose tariff costs, and no retailers would have to disclose tariff costs for any product where the import taxes account for less than 2% of the final retail price.
The bill would grant the state’s consumer affairs director the power to exempt other products from tariff reporting if such reporting would be impractical, unreasonable, or unnecessary to protect consumers.
Quijano, who said she had not yet heard the business group’s concerns, said she may accept amendments to the bill after hearing their worries.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Decades ago, a medical emergency brought Jean Whitehorse to an Indian Health Service facility in Gallup. There, she says, she was coerced into signing a form for a procedure she later learned left her unable to have more children.
Whitehorse (Navajo) is one of an untold number of Indigenous women who have been sterilized in the U.S. without their consent.
Over a roughly four-year period in the 1970s, 3,406 women were sterilized at facilities in four Indian Health Service areas, including Albuquerque, according to a 1976 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Many consent forms the agency reviewed lacked key details required by federal regulations, such as statements that the procedures were voluntary.

New Mexico In Depth originally published this article.

But the review covered only four of 12 IHS areas during a narrow window. How many more women were sterilized remains unknown.
According to later studies, at least 25% of Native women may have been sterilized.
Two state lawmakers think it’s time for a truth and reconciliation commission. During the 2026 legislative session, Sens. Shannon Pinto (Diné), D-Tohatchi, and Linda Lopez, D-Albuquerque, plan to push for a memorial to study the scope and ongoing impacts of the practice on Indigenous women and women of color in New Mexico.
The memorial would direct the Legislative Health and Human Services Committee, in collaboration with the Indian Affairs Department, to present findings and recommendations to the Legislature by the end of 2027.
“This opportunity for New Mexico is a critical one,” Keely Badger, an international human rights advocate whose Oxford University legal dissertation examined the issue, said during a presentation to the Indian Affairs Committee in Santa Fe on Thursday. No state, Badger said, has formally acknowledged this history.
In April, Badger traveled with Whitehorse to New York for the annual session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, an advisory body dedicated to discussing the concerns and rights of Indigenous peoples throughout the world. Whitehorse shared her story before the body and called for reparations for survivors and a formal apology from the U.S.

During their trip, they spoke to an independent U.N. investigator who agreed to visit New Mexico, if invited, and meet with local officials, Badger said.
The practice of forced and coerced sterilizations “contributed to a deep mistrust of health care systems” that’s made some Indigenous people reluctant to seek needed services to this day, Elena Giacci (Diné), an advocate for sexual violence survivors who also made the trip to New York earlier this year, told lawmakers.
“Today, we begin the path to acknowledge the trauma to our families and the lost generations, to discover and confront the depth of what occurred” in a way that strengthens Native communities, Giacci said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1032-e1759359429280-1024x721.jpg,,,2025-11-17 07:56:15.156312

She tole the task force that obesity is a chronic disease and should be treated comprehensively. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)A physician specializing in obesity urged state health insurers Thurday to cover comprehensive treatment of the condition, including medication like GLP-1s and lifestyle management.  
Speaking to the Chronic Weight Management and Type 2 Diabetes Task Force, Dr. Katherine Saunders said insurers must view obesity as a condition and not a lifestyle choice. 
“Obesity is a chronic disease, meaning that we don’t have a cure right now, and that in order to manage obesity effectively, it needs to be treated long term,” Saunders said. “So having patients taking GLP-1 medications and then stopping them, what a lot of people aren’t talking about is when somebody stops a GLP-1, they regain a significant amount of that weight.”
According to the National Library of Medicine, after 68 weeks on semaglutide, a GLP-1 medication, patients who lost 17.3% of their original weight gained 11.6% of it back after withdrawal.
It was not clear if legislation would result. Rep. Ed Oliver, R-Dadeville, the chair of the task force, said it will meet again in three months during the 2026 Legislative session.
“We will take up some of these topics. As the world changes in front of us, I’m sure that in three months things will be a little different than they are today,” he said.
Saunders and her mentor Louis Aronne, one of the first obesity specialists, created FlyteHealth, a comprehensive care model. Saunders told the task force that comprehensive care is the only way to treat obesity.
“It’s not just about getting every single patient with obesity a prescription for GLP-1 receptor agonist,” Saunders said. 
She is one of nearly 10,000 physicians in the United States that specialize in treating obesity, a chronic health condition, she said. There are 77 obesity physicians in Alabama, according to the American Board of Obesity Medicine.
According to the U.S. Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 39.2% of Alabama’s population was obese in 2023, the fifth-highest percentage in the nation. The CDC About 1 in 5 Americans are obese, according to the CDC. 
The CDC defines obese as a person with a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 30. BMI was created in the 1830s by a Belgian statistician, mathematician, and astronomer, who wanted to establish what an “average man” was, according to the National Library of Medicine. It did not include age in the calculation and was not intended to be used as a medical tool.
Saunders said that obesity cannot be treated with only GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, Wegovy and semaglutide injections, which have become increasingly popular. 
“There’s not a single person I can think of who hasn’t had a bump in the road,” Saunders said. “If there isn’t a plan for long term care, and somebody hits a bump in the road, and they’re not still following their medical team, they’re going to regain all their weight. Then they’re going to be in a really bad situation.”
According to ClinCalc DrugStats, a data resource that is managed by pharmacist Sean Kane, almost 5.4 million Americans were prescribed semaglutide, one of four major GLP-1 medications, in 2023. It was the 19th most prescribed medication at almost 26 million prescriptions. It was also one of the most expensive. The average drug cost was $1,322 per prescription with an average out-of-pocket cost of $53 per prescription, according to ClinCalc. 
According to a recent KFF poll, a nonprofit health policy research organization, 18% of adults have taken a GLP-1 for weight loss, diabetes or another condition, with 12% currently taking one. That’s an increase of six points since May 2024, according to the poll.
FlytHealth’s program includes constant contact with physicians, lifestyle management and medication when necessary. Saunders said that not all patients need a GLP-1 to achieve their health and weight goals.
“We start with less expensive, generic alternatives. The medication Metformin can be incredibly effective for a subset of people,” she said. “We use GLP-1s if and when we need to.”
She said there are a lot of factors that lead to obesity, and some are not preventable. Conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), insulin resistance and sleep apnea contribute to obesity and the inability to lose weight and not gain it back.
Dr. Jonathan Parker, an obesity physician in Muscle Shoals, said that there are a lot of hoops providers have to jump through to get patients the medication they need. He said it is hard to get GLP-1s covered for a patient that needs it, he said, like somebody with a BMI of 27 and PCOS.
“We have guidelines from all these national organizations that are telling us ‘This is what you should do.’ At times, that also includes the recommendation to use GLP-1s,” he said.
Despite the popularity of GLP-1 medications, half of the adults polled said it is hard to afford the medication. Rising health costs have impacted public and private insurance, with expensive prescriptions contributing. The Trump Administration announced this month that the out-of-pocket prices of Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound and Orforglipron, will fall when purchased through TrumpRX.com, a new website the White House has created to spotlight Trump’s work to reduce drug prices.
Oliver said he has been taking a GLP-1 for the last few years and pays $500 per month out of pocket.
“The thought of not doing that anymore is really exciting,” Oliver said.
According to the administration, Ozempic and Wegovy will fall from $1,000 and $1,350 per month, respectively, to $350 per month, and Zepbound and Orforglipron, if approved, will fall from $1,086 per month to an average of $346 per month.
“We’re hopeful that the reduction in the cost of real brand name medications will help take care of some of this. But it’s a very vulnerable population that will pay a lot or do anything to finally treat their disease,” Saunders said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1214-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-17 07:56:15.156312

Yet while one part of campus celebrated the right to assemble and speak freely, another faced the loss of that same freedom.
Indiana University ended the print edition of its student newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student, and dismissed its adviser, Jim Rodenbush, after he refused an administrative order to limit content in a Homecoming issue. The university cited a structural deficit and a move toward digital publishing. I along with many others see something else: an attempt to control editorial content. For a public university meant to foster open inquiry it sent a chilling message.
If our largest university can silence its own student journalists, what does that say about free expression across Indiana? We champion cherished liberties, from the right to bear arms to the right to worship freely and pursue opportunity. Yet the First Amendment the foundation of all those freedoms often lacks the same defense.
The university has since reversed its stance on print editions but tensions are still high.
The new face of censorship in Indiana
Free expression faces new pressures across our state. The Attorney General’s “Eyes on Education” portal, launched in 2024, invites citizens to report teachers and schools for “inappropriate” materials or comments. Marketed as transparency, it has instead created fear.
Teachers worry that a book, a classroom discussion, or even a social-media post might trigger an investigation. While no mass firings have occurred, many educators now self-censor to avoid controversy.
National surveys show that more than half of teachers report limiting discussions about race, gender, or current events. Defenders of the portal say it gives parents a voice. But vague accusations and anonymous complaints do not empower families; they intimidate educators. The result is a culture that echoes the McCarthy era, when suspicion replaced dialogue and fear silenced dissent.
In Fishers and Noblesville, the Hamilton East Public Library Board ordered staff to remove and review hundreds of young-adult books, including titles by Indiana author John Green, for “inappropriate” content. After months of public backlash, the board reversed the policy in 2023, but librarians and teachers across the state took note. Many now hesitate to include books that could provoke complaints.
In Carmel, repeated challenges to reading lists and classroom materials have left teachers cautious about introducing complex topics. When lessons are trimmed to avoid controversy, students lose the opportunity to think critically about the world around them. These pressures, from classrooms to libraries, shrink open dialogue in communities that once valued curiosity and debate.
Protecting the First like the Second
We say we cherish our freedoms. Now we have to prove it. The First Amendment deserves the same fierce defense that we give every other right. Without freedom to speak, write, and question authority, our ability to protect any liberty falters.
Rokita’s new ‘Eyes on Education’ portal prompts pushback from Indiana school officials

Free expression is messy. It can offend. It can provoke. But the strength of democracy lies in our willingness to protect even the ideas that make us uncomfortable. When governments or communities decide which opinions are acceptable, no one is safe from shifting political winds.
We do not need portals or book bans to safeguard our schools. We need trust in teachers to educate, support for journalists to report truth, and courage among citizens to disagree without fear. Censorship, whether it comes from the left or the right, weakens the shared foundation we all stand on.
Protecting free speech starts with everyday action. Attend school-board meetings and speak up for fair curriculum policies, as residents did in Noblesville when they pushed to restore banned books. Support student journalists by subscribing to the Indiana Daily Student or donating to the Student Press Law Center. Encourage lawmakers to reform the “Eyes on Education” portal so that only verified complaints, not anonymous tips, trigger reviews. These small steps can rebuild trust and ensure that Indiana’s classrooms and newsrooms remain places for open dialogue.
The First Amendment is the heartbeat of a free society. By defending it with action, supporting educators, journalists, and honest debate, we can keep Indiana a state where liberty is more than a slogan. Free speech, though messy, is our strength. Let us protect it with the same courage we bring to the Second Amendment.

Amid November’s honoring of Native American Heritage Month — a time when many communities reflect on the responsibilities embedded in ancestral teachings —Meredith Migizi, the executive director of indigenous advocacy organization Miigwech, Inc., sees the way that Michigan’s tribal governments respond to the lapse in SNAP benefits amid a government shutdown as parallel to an Anishinaabe oral history of the Hoof Nation Treaty.
In the telling of that story, for a year, the Anishinaabe people no longer saw deer, caribou, or moose. When they started asking each other why, they realized that they had not been wisely using the meat or the hides of the animals that they were harvesting, unnecessarily increasing the hardships on the Hoof Nation, whom they considered to be relatives. When one scout reported back that they saw a deer, they said that they were being mistreated.
“They no longer wanted to be part of the Anishinaabe lifestyle until their grievances were met,” Migizi said. “And so they just up and left.”
That Hoof Nation treaty is one of the first treaties that the Anishinaabe people had, Migizi explained, and has informed the ceremony that happens now when an animal is shot and used for food and clothing. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“If the roles are reversed and our people are not having treaty obligations met by the U.S., then why are we still participating in a system that harms us?” Migizi asked. “Why are we following rules? Why are we not taking our lead from the Hoof Nation, who said, ‘I’m no longer going to participate in things that harm me’?”
These questions were prominent in Migizi’s mind amid the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history, in which Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, a food assistance program that about 1.4 million people in Michigan use, were paused for the first half of November. While those benefits are finally being paid out now that the government has reopened, the broader implications on food sovereignty still apply.
“That’s the key thing. How do we feed our people, right?” Joe Van Alstine, the food distribution program specialist for the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians and the midwest region president of the National Association of Food Distribution Programs on Indian Reservations, said. 
“Food sovereignty for tribes is mandatory,” Van Alstine continued. “For us to go ahead and create our own distribution centers, our own distribution channels, networks, being able to work with local farmers to help put food in food boxes.”
Tribal citizens, in Michigan and around the United States, are also eligible for a different food aid program, the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, or FDPIR, which is colloquially known as commodities. Only a small fraction of Michigan’s tribal population are enrolled in the commodity program — USDA data shows that, as of June, enrollment in the state had not reached over 2,000 households since early 2018.

Households cannot be enrolled in both commodities and in SNAP in the same month. At least one of Michigan’s federally recognized tribes, the Bay Mills Indian Community, announced on social media that they would allow members who are normally on SNAP to apply for emergency benefits, but this would mean disenrolling from SNAP. 
“We were really worried about a lot of folks coming over from SNAP to FDPIR, who are tribal. And here, we have seen a slight increase in that,” said Van Alstine. But the government takes time to process closing someone’s SNAP benefits to switch to the Indigenous distribution program — and his job is to ensure that people are not receiving double benefits, even unintentionally. 
“Once you’re certified on the SNAP side for that month, our hands are tied,” he said. “With this administration, their biggest thing is fraud and abuse right now. For FDPIR we have a pretty good record of being really diligent on that.”










If the roles are reversed and our people are not having treaty obligations met by the U.S., then why are we still participating in a system that harms us?


– Meredith Migizi, the executive director of indigenous advocacy organization Miigwech, Inc.


Migizi also expressed concerns about logistical backlogs for those who would consider switching to commodities, given the uncertainty of when SNAP benefits will be restored. “If you get off SNAP, and then three days later, they decide, we’re gonna put SNAP back in,” she said, “you might have to wait 30 to 60 days to get your application re-approved.”
Migizi is not involved in tribal politics, nor does she want to be. But she urged tribal leaders to think more creatively about how to use the commodities program to help their members in a time of crisis, such as a loss of SNAP benefits. 
“There’s a really unique opportunity to also make sure that there’s food security for our people on SNAP by not making more barriers,” she said. “We know you can’t be on SNAP and commods at the same time, right? Could we make it so our people can do it temporarily? I’m sure there’s a way to do it. I’m sure it’s going to be difficult, but it would also be asserting our treaty rights of guaranteed health and safety during this time for our people.”

Commodities work differently than SNAP benefits — they don’t allow participants to shop at any grocery store. Instead, households get certain ingredients and foods, which do include traditional foods like walleye and wild rice, from a specific distribution center located on or immediately around tribal lands. 
Earlier this year, the food distributor that was supposed to send Van Alstine and other food distribution specialists failed to get the food that they needed to them, and trucks were not arriving with that month’s supplies.  
“It’s not just one item in the food package,” Van Alstine said, noting that this incident led to conversations about how to continue to provide food to the people who rely on the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations. “We didn’t have anything in the warehouse. And so what they (distribution directors) did is they worked with the Commodity Credit Corporation, to provide a monetary supplement to each tribe who wanted it.”
The program is intended to serve those who live on or immediately near the service area of a tribe, which means that for tribal citizens who live outside that area — including in cities like Detroit, Lansing or Grand Rapids — they cannot access this program. And even if they did qualify, Migizi noted, it would be unreasonable to ask people to drive potentially hundreds of miles to get food from the designated distribution center. 
“Low-income American Indian and non-Indian households that reside on a reservation, and households living in approved areas near a reservation or in Oklahoma that contain at least one person who is a member of a Federally-recognized tribe are eligible to participate in FDPIR,” according to the USDA. 
However, Van Alstine noted, he and others in his position have worked with the USDA to change rules around having distribution centers in urban centers where there is a significant tribal population. Lansing, Grand Rapids and Traverse City were all places with a notable population from the Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians, where he would aim to open distribution centers. 
“I would love to set up a store down there and a food distribution center for them to come in there. But it takes tribal leadership to also see that,” he said. “It’s not that we don’t think about them.”

Migizi’s organization, Miigwech Inc., partners with local farmers and tribal fishermen to bring food boxes across the state, including in the metro Detroit area, when they host events, a way to engage those who have become disconnected from tribal government. 
“As a tribal citizen, as someone who runs a tribally incorporated nonprofit, I assert my sovereignty every day, and it’s hard to watch my relations in the community go hungry,” she said. 
“I would hope that tribal governments look and they remember those traditional stories, and that they realize that that’s who we are as Anishinaabe, and that a lot of us talk about treaty assertion,” Migizi added. “How are we asserting those if we’re making it so some of our people go hungry, our most vulnerable, our elders and our youth?”

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Recent changes to Indiana’s property tax system will likely cut bills for most Hoosier homeowners, a new analysis has found.
But owners of pricey houses are expected to get bigger breaks, while those with low-valued dwellings may pay more, according to an Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute report released Friday.
Its author, Indiana tax expert Larry DeBoer, said Gov. Mike Braun’s hallmark tax law may squash growth in assessed value statewide through 2031, when key changes take full effect.
Indiana Senate sends finalized local property, income tax plan to governor

Chief among them is the homestead standard deduction, which Senate Enrolled Act 1 phases out by 2031. The fixed deduction lops $48,000 off the taxable value of a primary residence.
“If you’ve got a half-million-dollar house — you got a million-dollar house — $48,000 is nothing,” DeBoer said. “If you’ve got an $80,000 house, $48,000 is very significant.”
DeBoer, an emeritus agricultural economics professor at Purdue University, presented his results Friday at the Indiana Farm Bureau’s headquarters in Indianapolis.
The supplemental deduction, however, will rise from its current 37.5% to a whopping 66.7% by 2031. Because it’s a percentage, homeowners will save less on cheap homes than pricey ones.
The breakeven point — at which the two policies yield the same taxable value — is a home worth $102,740, per DeBoer. He estimated the average in Indiana at $234,500.
Counties with high homestead values, particularly Boone and Hamilton, will take harder hits to their tax bases, he said.
If Senate Enrolled Act 1 restricts assessed value growth but levies — the total governments can collect — rise, tax rates will also creep higher. DeBoer calculated that most property will hit the property tax caps at a rate of $3 per $100 in assessed value.
Homestead property owners get a circuit breaker credit on the amount of property taxes over 1% of assessed value. Many primary residences will likely reach the caps by 2031, according to the analysis. Property tax bills for those houses will be higher than now, but lower than they would’ve been without the law.

DoBoer joked that when Hoosiers complain bills went up, local officials can reply, “‘Ah, had we not changed the policy, it would have gone up even more!’ And the taxpayer will be satisfied.”
“Rueful laughter, right?” DeBoer said. Under his projections, it “really is a tax reduction … for the average homeowner, but the average homeowner is not going to believe it!”
But, for those not at the caps? Pricey homes are expected to carry smaller increases in their bills — or even slight drops. Low-value homes could see double-digit percentage hikes, per the report.
Also, beginning in 2026, a new supplemental tax credit will apply after the caps, taking off 10%, or up to $300.
More changes
Property types that hit the caps at 2% of assessed value get new breaks under Senate Enrolled Act 1 — “the first deduction that those folks have ever really gotten,” DeBoer said.
Non-homestead residential, like apartment buildings or vacation houses, falls under that category. So does farmland.
The new deduction phases into 33.4% by 2031.
DeBoer estimated that, if gross assessed value for non-homestead residential rises 5% annually through 2031, the net assessed value would fall each year over that time period.
Farmland net assessed value is also projected to fall most years, and. Under DeBoer’s assumptions, the net would be 33.4% lower in 2031 than it is in 2025.
Senate Enrolled Act 1 also raised the business personal property exemption from $80,000 to $2 million. DeBoer said that will impact small and medium-sized firms more, since larger ones with more property will continue paying as before.
Counties with a high share of business personal property will see lower losses from the exemption, like rural counties hosting large electric utility installations, according to the analysis.

The law also ditches a 30% floor on those property assessments after 2025. DeBoer predicted little effect in the short term, higher assessed values in the medium term and lower assessed values in the long run, once the business personal property purchased before 2026 has been retired.
But there could be loopholes.
One attendee asked what happens if, when a company purchases $2 million worth of equipment, it does so under a new entity.
“One of the goals of property tax policies is to create a neutral system that does not influence business decision-making,” DeBoer replied, to laughter. “And I suspect they’ve created something that (could) …”
“Obviously, the big ones aren’t going to be able to divide themselves up into little, $2 million segments, but a medium-sized business, one could manage it,” he continued. “… Accountants and lawyers are going to earn their money.”
Business real property gets no new deductions.
“Taxes in SEA 1 are shifting to big businesses with lots of personal property, and to rural homeowners with very low value homes,” DeBoer said. “It’s an interesting policy mix.”

Bob Ferguson signing Senate Bill 5480, a bill exempting medical debt from credit reports, on April 22, 2025. (Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Just months after Gov. Bob Ferguson signed a Washington law to keep medical debt off consumers’ credit reports, the Trump administration is looking to block such policies.
The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau now says federal law preempts laws like Washington’s. The federal agency’s position is a reversal from the Biden era.
Backers of Senate Bill 5480, which stops collection agencies from reporting medical debt to credit agencies, decried the move. 
“Overturning safeguards around medical debt is just another indicator that we have a president that prioritizes cash money to special interests over people,” said state Sen. Marcus Riccelli, D-Spokane, the bill’s sponsor. “And honestly, I don’t get this upset typically, but I’m pretty upset.”
The bureau’s new interpretation of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, filed in the Federal Register late last month, doesn’t invalidate Washington’s law, but opens it up to legal challenges.
A spokesperson for Attorney General Nick Brown said his office is tracking the issue.
It comes as many people in Washington and across the country face spiking health care premiums due in part to the end of federal subsidies that help pay for Affordable Care Act coverage. These tax credits were at the center of the government shutdown fight. 
Thousands in Washington are expected to forgo health insurance because of the rising premiums. Costs for employer-sponsored plans are also increasing.
Adam Zarrin, of Blood Cancers United, called it “devastating timing.”
“What’s going to happen is that more Americans, more Washingtonians are going to incur medical debt,” Zarrin added. “It will happen.”
Riccelli’s bill passed the Legislature this year with some bipartisan support. It took effect in late July.
In a survey last year from the American Cancer Society, nearly half of cancer patients and survivors reported dealing with medical debt, even though almost all were insured.
About six in 10 Washingtonians say they would struggle to pay an unexpected $500 medical bill, and around the same proportion reported avoiding or altering their medical care because of the cost, according to Northwest Health Law Advocates.
The goal of the new law is to stop debt from hurting residents’ chances of renting an apartment or buying a car, and to remove it as a barrier to people seeking treatment, said Audrey Miller García, the government relations director for Washington at the American Cancer Society.
“This is not debt that they acquired because they were out on a shopping spree,” she said. “They were sick. This is not their fault.”
Over a dozen states have these laws on the books. Others include California, Colorado, Illinois and New York.
In 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under then-President Joe Biden issued the opposite guidance of the Trump administration. The federal agency said states could ban medical debt from credit reports. Many states then passed their laws. 
The following year, three major credit bureaus voluntarily announced medical debt under $500 would no longer appear on their credit reports.
Separate from the 2022 guidance, the Biden administration finalized a rule this January barring medical debt reporting under some circumstances federally. But industry groups sued, and the new Trump administration declined to defend the new federal policy, so a federal judge in Texas voided it over the summer, ruling that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had exceeded its statutory authority.

Now, with Trump in office, the bureau says its own prior interpretation was “manifestly wrong” and “reflected a misguided policy choice that would undermine the credit reporting system and credit markets.”
“The 2022 rule sowed confusion into the credit reporting system by creating a patchwork quilt of federal and state laws competing to govern the marketplace,” states the notice signed by White House budget director Russell Vought, who is also acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Miller García called it a “full 180.” 
In a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year, the conservative majority undercut the power of federal agencies to interpret ambiguous laws, instead leaving that power to the courts.
Meanwhile, Trump is seeking to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau entirely within months.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1724-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-17 07:56:15.156312

Brian Stack, who is also the Union City mayor, would allow towns to ""purchase"" unused sick time from employees annually, which one critic said could fuel fraud and waste. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Public employees who want to cash in on their unused sick time wouldn’t have to wait until retirement to do so under new legislation.
Under a bill sponsored by Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson), government officials could “purchase” up to 120 hours a year of accumulated sick leave from employees at up to 60% of its worth. The bill would undo part of a 2007 law that allowed such payouts to be disbursed only at retirement. Employees would have to maintain at least 800 hours of accrued sick time after such a purchase.
It’s unclear what motivated the bill. Stack, who’s also the Union City mayor, did not respond to a request for comment.
Lavish sick leave payouts to retiring public workers have long been a target for reform by government watchdogs.
Acting state Comptroller Kevin D. Walsh urged state legislators in 2022 to tighten up sick leave rules after his investigators found, in a review of 60 towns statewide, that most illegally paid out millions and ignored state caps on such payouts, which can cripple local budgets. Walsh earlier this month directed Pleasantville to correct sick leave and severance policies he called “wasteful and ripe for fraud” after investigators found the city paid its former business administrator almost $84,000 in accumulated sick leave she wasn’t entitled to.
Asked to comment, Walsh blasted the bill as “a step in the wrong direction.”
“It’s effectively a taxpayer-funded bonus that will fuel waste, favoritism, and ballooning government costs,” Walsh said in a statement. “At a time when the state is facing a budget crunch and many residents are financially struggling, it’s terrible to see this bill that would invite more fraud, waste, and abuse and favoritism.”
The proposal has some cautious early support.
John Donnadio, executive director of the New Jersey Association of Counties, said it could help local officials better financially prepare for the departure of employees who are due checks for accrued sick leave by paying them smaller amounts over time instead of a one-time windfall. He also likes that the plan would allow, but not require, local governments to make these changes.
“I don’t know the politics behind the bill, but it seems like maybe you can use it as a budgeting tool,” Donnadio said.
The bill has no Assembly companion and has not yet been scheduled for a committee hearing. Lawmakers have a short window to act on legislation in the Statehouse pipeline, with the current session set to end in mid-January.

Bill Eigel of Weldon Spring, shown in a 2024 photo, is using recurring donations from across the country to finance his bid for St. Charles County executive (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).A Korean War veteran from Nebraska named Russell Wood made 35 donations totaling $1,050 over the last year to Bill Eigel’s campaign for St. Charles County executive.
The problem is, Wood, who is 92, has never heard of Eigel or set foot in St. Charles County. He told The Independent he had no idea he had made so many donations to Eigel’s campaign.
At some point in the last four years, one of Eigel’s fundraising emails — which focus on national issues and often don’t make any mention of Eigel — showed up in Wood’s inbox. He’s concerned about immigration and crime and donated thinking he was giving to help Donald Trump and other Republicans defeat Democrats. 
That’s when he appears to have been caught in an online fundraising practice that makes donations automatically repeat on a weekly or monthly basis unless the contributor changes a pre-checked box.
Wood said he doesn’t recall making any donations this year, “and if I did, it wasn’t to anybody in Missouri.”
Wood is one of 141 people nationally — including six from Missouri — who made multiple donations to Eigel’s 2024 campaign for governor who are also contributors to his St. Charles County executive race. 
One retired woman in Texas, who made 143 donations to Eigel’s campaign for governor, has contributed $1,205 in 74 separate donations since December. All are about the same dates each month, just like the donations to the campaign for governor.
She could not be reached for an interview.
Automatic recurring donations have been criticized as “dirty and rotten” for taking advantage of people who respond to one message with a small gift but who wind up giving thousands over several months or years.

It’s not the first time Eigel’s fundraising strategy has raised concerns. During his run for governor last year, a similar scheme drew the ire of President Trump’s campaign, who complained Eigel was using his name to raise money without permission.
And thanks to the widely held view that an Eigel victory next year could serve as a springboard for a rematch with Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe in the 2028 GOP primary, he’s facing more scrutiny than a candidate for St. Charles County executive usually endures. 
“I would say that it’s a matter of his character, the fact that he is allowing these tactics to go out under PACs that are supporting him, and has never once condemned the tactics that he’s authorizing,” said Mike Hafner, a Republican consultant close to Kehoe who is working for one of Eigel’s opponents in the Republican primary for county executive, Lake St. Louis Mayor Jason Law.
Law has raised $528,000. Only seven of his donors are from outside Missouri. Incumbent Republican Steve Ehlmann has raised nothing, spent what little he had on consulting during the summer and will start the campaign with $2,436.
Eigel’s campaign declined to comment on his fundraising practices, instead providing an emailed statement on the dynamics of the county executive race. 
“I’m not thinking about Mike Kehoe or Steve Ehlmann and whatever their political goals might or might not be,” Eigel said. “I’m thinking about St. Charles — a St. Charles that is free from personal property tax and growing again after several years of stagnation.”
 Tried-and-true tactics

After victories last week by Democrats in Virginia, New York and other states, Eigel’s fundraising machine warned email recipients that socialists are coming to take over small towns.
There are “radical Democrats who openly cheer when conservatives are hurt or killed,” read one message from the Believe in Life and Liberty, or BILL, PAC.
Another, headlined “Antifa Insurrection Warning,” told recipients: “They want to destroy our country through violent uprising to install a Socialist ‘utopia’ where the law of the land comes from leftist ideology, not morals or principles.” 
The appeals never mention Eigel or identify the purpose of BILL PAC, which is named as the recipient in small type at the bottom of the emails.










When I started getting my thoughts back and my memory was rebounding, I realized, holy crap, I've given almost $9,000 the last four years.


– Russell Wood, Nebraska veteran


The fundraising emails caught the attention of Bill MacKenzie, a former reporter and Capitol Hill staffer for Republicans and Democrats who lives in Oregon. In a post on his personal blog from early October, he wrote that it was “deceptive” to use a national focus in the BILL PAC appeals to collect money for a candidate seeking a Missouri county office.
“He’s successfully raising a ton of money,” MacKenzie told The Independent, “by appealing to a very narrow constituency, seniors all around the country, when he’s not even running for a national office.” 
Those appeals, and hundreds of similar messages sent this year, have brought in nearly $480,000 to BILL PAC. Of that amount, nearly $90,000 has been spent raising the money, while $154,000 has been transferred to Eigel’s campaign committee.
Similar fundraising messages with a national sweep helped Eigel raise $1.8 million and BILL PAC raise almost $5 million during the 2024 campaign for governor. Kehoe won with 39% of the vote, after spending more than $17 million through his campaign and PAC efforts, while Eigel took 33%.
Both BILL PAC and Eigel’s campaign committee raise the vast share of their itemized donations from outside the state. Of 3,679 itemized contributions this year to BILL PAC this year, only 137 are from within Missouri. Fewer than half that number are from constituents who could actually vote in next year’s county executive election.
Of the 1,074 itemized donations so far this year to Eigel’s campaign committee, only 11 are from Missouri, representing seven individual contributors. Only four live in St. Charles County. 
There are more contributors to Eigel from New Jersey, Florida, Texas and California than Missouri.
“It really exposes a weakness in our political system, that people who give money are giving based upon some ideology nationally,” MacKenzie said. “They’re giving based upon ideological viewpoints about national issues, without even necessarily being aware of where that money’s going.”
Hafner said the Missouri Ethics Commission should investigate Eigel’s fundraising.
“It appears to me,” he said, “that he has picked up exactly where he left off in the governor’s race in using highly deceptive fundraising tactics to con people out of contributions.” 
 Automatic contributions

In 2021, after an investigative series by the New York Times, the Republican National Committee and the campaign committee for Donald Trump refunded $12.8 million collected from people who thought they were making a single donation.
Instead, the online solicitation signed them up for weekly contributions. The tactic was adopted by Republican and Democratic fundraising organizations. In 2023, an analysis of millions of campaign contributions by researchers at Columbia University found that about half of top Republicans signed donors up for automatic repeats. The practice was less prevalent among Democrats.
That’s the system that brought Wood’s money into Eigel’s campaign.
Wood’s first donation to Eigel occurred Oct. 1, 2023, with additional donations on Oct. 12, Oct. 24 and Oct. 29 of that year. The contributions, totaling $1,380, repeated on or about the same days each month until August 2024, with one final donation on Sept. 29, 2024. That was 10 days before Eigel’s gubernatorial committee closed its books for good.
The automatic donations resumed when Eigel’s campaign rebooted in January, and Wood has given $1,050 to Eigel this year.
The BILL PAC fundraising appeals have a recurring donation box but it is not pre-checked. Even if it were pre-checked, the tactic is not illegal in Missouri.
An attempt to ban the practice in 2023 in Pennsylvania didn’t advance very far and New Jersey lawmakers became interested in banning it this year after reports in Politico about the fundraising by a Republican candidate for governor.
Wood said he made his first online contribution in 2021 to the Republican National Committee. He’s since been diagnosed with early dementia, which Wood said he is combating with vitamin and other therapies.
“I didn’t find out about (this year’s donations) until I got a note from someone thanking me for help,” Wood said. “And then when I started getting my thoughts back and my memory was rebounding, I realized, holy crap, I’ve given almost $9,000 the last four years.”
Wood said he has tried making small donations to uncheck the recurring donation box and thinks some of it has been successful. When it doesn’t work, he’s tried to contact political organizations to stop it but they keep adding charges to his credit card, he said.
“I’ve got my tit in a wringer here,” he said.
 The shadow primary

While Kehoe won the statewide contest in 2024, Eigel defeated him handily in his home county, taking just under 46% of the vote. In 2016, when Eigel was elected to the state Senate in St. Charles County, he won his primary with 40% of the vote.
Eigel’s high name recognition and fundraising prowess, along with fears he could use the office as a platform to stage another run for governor, helped convince Ehlmann, executive since 2007, to forgo retirement and run for a sixth term. 
Ehlmann has never been tested in a contest for county executive. He won his first term in 2006 without a primary opponent and took 60% of the vote in the general election. He’s only had nominal primary opposition, if any, since and has run unopposed by Democrats on two occasions.
Law is staying in the race, Hafner said, and will focus on St. Charles County issues while Eigel raises money talking about national questions. He wants the donors to know what their money is for, he said.
“A lot of them would be furious if they knew that their money was going to a candidate for a local office in a state, you know, on the other side of the country, or multiple states away,” Hafner said.
Mike Elam, a St. Charles County councilman who intended to run for executive if Ehlmann retired, said he wants Eigel to show he can find backers in the county.
“If Bill has so much support from St Charles County, why is it 97% or if not more of his fundraising coming from retirees around the country?” Elam said. “Why is he not trying to fundraise from St Charles County, people who supposedly support his campaign?”
In Nebraska, Wood isn’t thinking about Missouri politics. He said he wants to use his modest income to help his seven grandchildren, 17 great grandchildren and three great-great grandchildren.
The money already donated is gone, Wood said.
“Do I want to get it back? Not really,” he said. “But I want to stop the flow.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Eigel-speaking-20240702-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-11-17 07:56:15.156312

In oral arguments on Nov. 5, a majority of the justices on the court voiced open skepticism over Trump’s claim that he has authority to impose sweeping tariffs under a law that does not even use the word “tariffs.” The law in question is the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.
During the argument, Chief Justice John Roberts told Solicitor General John Sauer in no uncertain terms that tariffs are “the imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been the core power of Congress.” Roberts thus rejected Sauer’s baffling claim that tariffs were a form of “import regulation” and not a tax. Sauer was trying the couch the tariffs as “import regulations” to fit the language of IEEPA.
Roberts also questioned how the authority to impose tariffs could pass muster under the “major questions” doctrine. Roberts observed that Sauer was claiming broad authority under the statute “to impose tariffs on any product, in any amount, for any length of time.”
That stuck Roberts as “major authority,” and “the basis for that claim seems to be a misfit.” Roberts noted the word “tariff” is not even in the statute.
In a surprising set of questions, Justice Neil Gorsuch opined the president’s usurpation of the tariff authority of Congress violated separation of powers. Echoing his concerns under the non-delegation doctrine, Gorsuch questioned how Congress could recover this core constitutional authority once it has been improperly delegated.
Gorsuch was taken aback by Sauer’s claims about the breadth of president’s inherent powers in foreign affairs. Gorsuch asked: “What would prohibit Congress from just abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce — or for that matter, declare war — to the president?”
From a textualist standpoint, Justice Amy Coney Barrett took issue with Sauer’s claim that IEEPA’s language granting presidents the emergency power to regulate imports encompasses tariffs.
Barrett asked: “Can you point to any other place in the code or any time in history where that phrase ‘regulate importation’ has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?” Justice Sonya Sotomayor expressed frustration when Sauer refused to give a direct answer to Barrett’s question.
The three liberal justices voiced their own concerns. For instance, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson observed IEEPA was designed to limit presidential authority, not expand it. She declared: “It’s pretty clear that Congress was trying to constrain the emergency powers of the president.”
With the liberals almost certain to vote against Trump, that appears to make at least a five-justice majority against the tariffs. Because Barrett posed tough questions to both sides, I view her vote as more uncertain. At least that’s my preliminary headcount.
Yet the court was obviously divided.
Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Barrett voiced some possible justification for the tariffs by referring to Nixon’s imposition of tariffs under an older statute that was a precursor to IEEPA. Kavanaugh also has expressed skepticism over whether the major questions doctrine should apply to matters of foreign policy and national security.
And Barrett seemed to acknowledge what a “mess” it would create if the court forced the administration to unwind the tariffs. Justices Alito and Thomas are likely to back Trump on all the tariff issues. So, the final decision is still up in the air. It’s always a bit risky to predict the result from oral arguments alone.
But legal scholars may have been wrong on a fundamental question how the Supreme Court is dealing with Trump. The conservative majority repeatedly acquiesced to Trump in the multiple emergency docket orders. The majority has shown an almost reckless indifference to questions of irreparable injury in these orders. Lawyers have worried the court was not willing to serve as a proper check on Trump’s abuse of power. I have expressed that same concern in some of my own writings.
The tariff appeal shows the blind deference to Trump may not apply when the court is engaging in a full plenary review of major constitutional and statutory questions. In the merits cases, the justices can no longer hide their reasoning behind unsigned orders.
What I find interesting in the tariff appeal is that some justices seem open to applying conservative legal theories like major questions and non-delegation against Trump.
We’ll see how that plays out in the coming months. If I had to guess, I suspect the Trump administration may face similar skepticism from the justices in the birthright citizenship appeal. I’m cautiously optimistic.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/supremecourtoctober2024norman-scaled-e1763058490829-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-11-17 06:56:58.308708

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)A program to expand electric vehicle charging stations in Wisconsin is getting  a $14 million jolt with plans to build 26 more stations across the state.
Gov. Tony Evers and the Wisconsin Department of Transportation announced the expansion plan Monday.
The announcement recharges the state’s electrical vehicle charging network project, supported by the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. NEVI, part of the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law signed by  then-President Joe Biden, provides grants to states to build more charging stations.
“Transportation is evolving, and departments of transportation and states have to adapt with that evolution,” said John DesRivieres, WisDOT’s communications director. “As the market and the number of folks who are driving electric vehicles grows, EV infrastructure is needed.”
NEVI funding paused after President Donald Trump took office, and Wisconsin was one of 15 states along with the District of Columbia to sue the Trump administration in May for cutting off money for the program. A federal judge blocked the administration in June from defunding NEVI, and the Wisconsin DOT subsequently restarted its program.
The $14 million in federal funds for Wisconsin’s new round of charging stations will go to projects in communities throughout the state, from Superior in the northwest to East Troy in the southeast. They include 11 locations at Kwik Trip service stations, six locations at hotels or resorts, six locations at other service station brands and a handful of other businesses.
“My administration and I have prioritized ensuring our state’s infrastructure meets the needs of the 21st Century since Day One because expanding our clean energy and electric vehicle infrastructure helps create jobs and bolster our economy, and it’s good for our planet, too,” Evers said. “Thanks to our actions to get the Trump Administration to release this critical funding that they were illegally withholding, we are thrilled to see the NEVI program continue to support these goals and further move us toward the clean energy future Wisconsinites deserve.”
The transportation department chose projects based on their location, their potential for future development, and the business site’s hours. Extended hours were given preference to accommodate longer refueling times, according to WisDOT.
Wisconsin’s plan calls for charging stations along 15 major interstate, U.S. and state highway corridors that cross the state. A WisDOT EV charging station dashboard shows the locations for all planned chargers in the state.
With the round of grants announced Monday, Wisconsin has invested a total of $36.4 million in federal funds for 78 projects.

The first round, announced in May 2024, invested $22.4 million to build 52 stations. Of those, 11 are operational, 16 have been authorized for construction and the rest are in pre-construction phases.
A federal tax credit for electric vehicles that was included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act abruptly ended, effective Sept. 30, under the Republican tax-cut and spending mega-bill enacted in July.
“There are already 37,000 EVs on the road today, and we saw that number spike as people raced to purchase EVs before the federal tax credit expired,” said Alex Beld, communications director for Renew Wisconsin, a nonprofit that promotes policies and programs to expand solar, wind and hydropower along with building electrification, energy storage and electric vehicles.
“By expanding our network of charging stations, we hope to see that number continue to climb,” Beld said. “Through this transition away from gas-powered vehicles, we can reduce emissions and support our state’s economy.”
An analysis by SRI International published in 2023 for the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. concluded that “there is a tremendous opportunity for Wisconsin to develop a globally competitive cluster centered on the manufacturing of EVs and EV-related equipment, which in turn can help revitalize Wisconsin’s automotive manufacturing industry and drive statewide economic development.”
Beld said that jobs related to clean energy grew four times faster than the rest of Wisconsin’s economy in 2024.
“If this funding had been clawed back permanently, I think we would have still seen progress,” Beld said. “It would have certainly been slower and would have likely cost the state jobs.”

Oklahoma Turnpike Authority officials said such messages are scams, and that they will never contact people via text message about unpaid debt. (Photo illustration by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)I was pretty sure I was being pranked or scammed when a collections company called to inform me that I owed $15.23 in unpaid Oklahoma tolls.
I told the caller bluntly that I was certain it was a scam and I wouldn’t be paying Linebarger, Goggan, Blair and Sampson a dime, despite the collection agent’s assurances that his firm had been retained by the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority to collect the measly amount.
I assumed — incorrectly it turns out — that there was no way a state agency would send any Oklahoma PikePass holder to collections without first snail mailing them a notice that they owed money. Or even reaching out by phone to try to first rectify the situation.
But I felt my first inkling of doubt when the agent inexplicably had my license plate number. Then I tried to access my PikePass account and found it deactivated. At that point, I thought I had been hacked because I’d held a PikePass for nearly a decade, my contact information was up-to-date, and I thought I had always been in good standing.
When I called the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority the next morning, I discovered that the state was the one who had deactivated it, and that they had indeed sent me to collections over $15.
I demanded to know what steps they had taken to contact me about this debt prior to sending it to collections.
The PikePass employee told me the agency had reached out via email three different times. She said the first notice was sent in April, warning me that my credit card was set to expire. The second email was a notice with a generic subject line reading “PIKEPASS Payment Request Notice” sent in late July, which stated that I owed $3.48. And the third came in September, generically titled “PIKEPASS Email Notice” with a random string of numbers. That email contained an account termination warning notice but nothing really specific, including the amount owed.
Like pretty much every Oklahoman, I’ve been subject to multiple phishing attempts along with multiple text messages claiming I owed for tolls. So I hadn’t opened a single one of those communications, assuming they were spam.
OTA apparently never took the time to mail me a paper invoice containing my past due balance because, I was told, at some point, I waived my right to that courtesy by selecting electronic billing.
Ultimately, I paid the $15.23 along with another $40 to get my account turned back on. I couldn’t see the bill, so I have no idea how much of that was late fees. The OTA employee told me none of it was, so I had to blindly trust her on that.
The irony is I’m pretty sure OTA spent more money paying for this collections agency to hound me for $15 than they actually collected from me.
But my bigger concern is that state agencies should be required to do the right thing by consumers before going nuclear and sending them to collections.
And if they won’t do it voluntarily, then lawmakers need to step in and mandate it.
Ahead of publication of this column, I emailed an OTA spokesperson some questions about how they handle collections. I asked how many accounts are in collections and what is the average amount owed. I asked why OTA doesn’t snail mail paper invoices to consumers before they’re sent to collections. I asked about how many overdue notices OTA typically sends to consumers attempting to collect unpaid balances. And, given the number of electronic toll collection scams preying on Oklahomans right now, how can someone know if the demands are legitimate.
OTA had not responded to my questions a week later.
As a state agency, lawmakers have given OTA a lot of power. 
In 2023, Oklahoma Voice reported that lawmakers had granted the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority the power to place holds on vehicle registrations in a bid to help collect unpaid tolls. At the time, tens of thousands of Oklahomans had their vehicle registrations frozen under the law. The number was expected to climb as the state transitioned to cashless tolling.
At the time, we interviewed a Norman resident who said she never received any notice or call that her family owed toll payments. Her first warning was when she couldn’t renew her vehicle registration.
As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility.
The Turnpike Authority should have a mechanism to collect past-due tolls. But they should also first have an obligation to make a good faith effort to collect that before they send Oklahomans to collections, potentially ruining their credit over a few dollars. A person’s credit rating impacts their ability to borrow money to purchase cars or homes. It influences the interest rates on those loans.
Good faith efforts include calling consumers and using the traditional mail to send an overdue notice. 
That will help people differentiate between reality and scams.
In this case, OTA clearly had my phone number because the PikePass agent used it to find my account when I called to ask what was going on.
They also had my mailing address because over a week after I paid the $15.23, I received a collection demand letter in the mail from Linebarger Goggan Blair and Sampson. They amazingly could take the time to send me a letter.
OTA should have sent that letter first. It would have saved both of us an expensive trip to collections.
Oklahoma consumers deserve to be treated with respect, and they deserve the benefit of the doubt. While I’m sure that some PikePass holders are legitimately dodging their tolls bills, I would assume the majority are not. (Maybe OTA will update us on that when they respond to me.)
We entrust OTA with a lot of our personal information with the understanding that they’re going to use it appropriately.
We’re not nameless, faceless people. (It’s like they forget we not only pay tolls but also allocate them a portion of a motor fuel tax to fund their operations). The fact that a state agency is being allowed to treat us like that is problematic.
Our government should always operate in good faith and that goes double when it comes time to collect any money we owe.

On the heels of a failed lawsuit to stop a prohibition on some cannabis products in Wyoming, hemp vendors confront a sudden federal ban on most products. 
The post Wyoming hemp vendors reel from Delta-8 court loss, new federal ban appeared first on WyoFile .","Smoke shops and other businesses that sell hemp products in Wyoming confronted a tough future this week after Republicans in the U.S. Senate inserted a ban on most THC-products derived from hemp into the bill that ended the federal shutdown.
Though hemp advocates have a year to advocate for its reversal, the measure represented a substantial blow to an industry already reeling from a recent court ruling. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Wyoming-specific ban on certain THC derivatives just two weeks ago.
With products containing the THC derivative Delta-8 off the table in Wyoming, hemp vendors were looking toward the sale of edibles and beverages containing hemp-derived THC to make up the sales. 

But beginning a year from now, the federal government will ban any hemp product that carries more than 0.4 milligrams of THC. Hemp is a derivative of the cannabinoid plant, as is marijuana. Hemp has a wide range of uses, from the making of rope and clothing to the production of CBD, a non-intoxicating and widely used supplement.

Under Wyoming law, hemp plants are legal as long as their THC concentration remains under 0.3%. At such a concentration, the plant itself would not get a user high if it were smoked.
But some shops still sell products with higher concentrations in the final product itself — drinks and edible gummies can carry 10 milligrams of hemp-derived Delta-9 THC or more. Those are concentrations equivalent to some marijuana products sold over the border in Colorado, where the drug is legal. The THC in Wyoming comes from hemp and not marijuana, and some shops are operating on an interpretation of the laws that says it’s the strength of THC in the hemp plant itself, not in the substance in which it is packaged, that matters.
The federal ban would end that practice. The language passed into law outlaws a concentration of more than 0.4 milligrams THC in the final container handed to the consumer, meaning all the liquid in a soda can or chocolate bar must have a total concentration below 0.4%. 
Changing laws, changing products
Since the federal government legalized hemp production in the 2018 Farm Bill, vendors in Wyoming and the dwindling number of other states where marijuana itself remains illegal have been playing what is essentially a game of whack-a-mole with regulators and lawmakers. 
The new ban comes just weeks after a federal appeals court in Denver upheld a law passed by the Wyoming Legislature that outlawed the THC derivative Delta-8. Since 2019, when Wyoming legalized the sale of hemp products, stores around the state had built up a thriving trade in Delta-8 products, which are intoxicating. In 2024, however, after reports emerged from Cody of a handful of students getting sick after consuming Delta-8, state lawmakers outlawed that substance as well as two other popular THC derivatives. 
That ban was a blow to vendors in the state, who say the products were mischaracterized as “synthetic” versions of cannabis when they remained natural derivatives of the plant. They were popular among consumers, shop owners say. 
“Before the ban, roughly 70% of our sales came from those cannabinoids,” Alicia Watt, a founder of Platte Hemp Company, which was one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the Delta-8 ban, wrote in a statement to WyoFile. “That hit every hemp retailer and grower in the state hard — from small storefronts to hardworking Wyoming hemp farmers who invested everything into a once-legal crop.”
Another plaintiff in the lawsuit, Justin Arnold, part of the husband-and-wife team behind Cin D’s CBD shop in Torrington, told WyoFile he was selling around $20,000 a month of Delta-8 products before lawmakers banned it. He estimated those sales would have doubled in another year. Arnold imposed an age limit of 21 years old for Delta-8 customers, though the law actually allowed sales to people 18 and up.

His products helped cancer patients and other people struggling with chronic pain, he said, without forcing them to drive to Colorado to buy weed legally and then illegally bring it into Wyoming. “If you’re buying hemp in Wyoming, you’re not buying weed in Colorado, you’re not going to the doctor and you’re not going to the bar,” he said.
To Arnold, this week’s sudden legislative action in Washington, which was pushed by Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, was another example of powerful influences like the legalized cannabis industry and pharmaceutical lobbyists trying to oppress a competitor that is largely made up of small business owners.
McConnell was an architect of the 2018 bill legalizing hemp production. But he has since grown concerned about the practical effects of the bill. “My 2018 hemp bill sought to create an agricultural hemp industry, not open the door to the sale of unregulated, intoxicating, lab-made, hemp-derived substances with no safety framework,” McConnell said this summer, according to the Cannabis Business Times. 
Officials with the U.S. Hemp Roundtable, a national industry group, predict that if the ban is not unwound within the year it will wipe out 98% of a hemp industry worth $28 billion. The group is instead trying to lobby lawmakers to pass legislation that does not ban higher THC quantities but instead regulates production practices to keep out harmful chemicals and outlaw marketing and sales practices that target minors.
Lawsuit fails
In the Wyoming court case, Watt, Arnold and their fellow plaintiffs sought to show that regulating Delta-8 was the province of the federal government, not the state, among other legal arguments. Federal judges disagreed with them, first in the U.S. District Court of Wyoming and then at the appeals court in Denver. 
Platte Hemp Company now sells Delta-9 gummies that are under 0.3% THC, as well as other legal herbal products and glass smoking devices — the traditional and long-running wares of “head shops” in Wyoming and other states. Wyoming lawmakers need to better educate themselves on hemp and cannabis, the difference between the two plants and their respective uses, before passing more legislation, Watt said. 
“Both offer legitimate medical value and industrial benefit, from fiber and textiles to seizure control and pain relief,” she wrote. “Instead of supporting natural medicine and Wyoming’s own hemp farmers, our state is protecting Big Pharma and alcohol.”
At least one plaintiff from the Delta-8 lawsuit has decided the regulatory uncertainty makes it too difficult to run a business. Owners of the Green Room, which describes itself as Casper’s first hemp dispensary, posted a notice to their website saying they’d be closing at the end of this year. “This has been a difficult decision for us, but the law changes have put us into a position where we can no longer stay in business,” the notice said.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Rodney Bennett has finalized a plan to cut up to $27.5 million from UNL’s budget. 
About $9 million in academic cuts go to the University of Nebraska Board of Regents for a final vote in December. This includes $4 million in anticipated savings from department mergers, which an advisory committee supported almost unanimously. Most other cuts are now set in stone, though many details still need to be ironed out.
“I have a strong conviction that even though what we are doing is very difficult, it is in the best interest of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s long-term future,” Bennett said in a Nov. 10 email announcing his final plan.

The UNL chancellor’s latest proposal would cut at least $20.76 million, depending on the regents, and assuming the mergers are accepted. The number could be larger with not-yet-detailed executive administrative “efficiencies” sought and nearly 70 tenured faculty offered a buyout package.
The current minimum total would be just shy of the $21 million Bennett has said is needed to close an ongoing “structural deficit” at UNL. Bennett’s plan also calls for $6.5 million in additional cuts meant to “help safeguard against repetitive budget reduction cycles.” The total is $27.5 million in the latest round of cuts.
The finalized plan shares many similarities with the proposal Bennett unveiled Sept. 12. Here is an in-depth breakdown of the final budget plan and the status of each line item.
Academic program eliminations ($6.74 million) and department realignments ($2 million)*
Nearly $9 million of UNL’s budget reduction consists of eliminating or merging academic departments, which the regents will consider at a Dec. 5 meeting.
Bennett’s updated cuts to the regents no longer include a call to eliminate academic programs in community and regional planning ($475,000) and landscape architecture ($225,000), both in the College of Architecture. Instead, the college will find the same savings through an internal plan that doesn’t require a vote of the regents.

The areas proposed for elimination, as well as nearly all degrees and the 51.5 faculty serving within them, are:

Earth and Atmospheric Sciences ($1.85 million, 13 positions eliminated).
Statistics ($1.75 million, 12 positions eliminated).
Educational Administration ($1.69 million, 15.5 positions eliminated).
Textiles, Merchandising and Fashion Design ($1.45 million, 11 positions eliminated).

In the case of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, some faculty will be “strategically” retained whose teaching, research and service “align with the needs and priorities of Nebraska.” Certain courses supporting federal requirements for meteorology careers and undergraduate minors will still be offered.
The master’s degree in educational administration will also be retained.
Departments the university plans to merge, with estimated savings of $1 million each, will develop plans in the spring and be subject to a later vote of the NU Board of Regents. Those are the departments of Entomology and Plant Pathology as well as Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication.
An advisory committee of faculty, staff and students narrowly supported just two of the eliminations: educational administration (11-10) and textiles, merchandising and fashion design (12-9). It opposed cutting earth and atmospheric sciences (9-11) and statistics (8-13). 
The committee unanimously supported the entomology and plant pathology merger, and just one member opposed merging the agricultural economics and leadership departments.
Advisory committee splits with UNL chancellor on key academic program cuts

In an unsigned Oct. 24 letter, the committee urged Bennett to allow more time to find alternatives. The academic cuts were announced and forwarded to the regents in less than two months.
The committee said it also did not have time to consider department revenues in weighing cuts.
“Multiple units noted in their hearings that they are revenue-positive, meaning that elimination of those units may end up costing the university more than it would save,” the letter states.
A UNL spokesperson said administrators reviewed “all aspects” of the proposed programs for elimination, including tuition and research, and they expect the cuts to yield long-term savings.
*This is the only budget item that requires separate regents approval.
Buyout program for tenured faculty ($5.5 million)
Tenured faculty who were at least 62 years old and had at least 10 years of service to NU by their time of separation were eligible to apply for a buyout program in September. About 130 faculty applied.
While the system intended to allow as many faculty to participate as possible, each campus reserved the right to limit awardees “to preserve the viability of programs and services, as well as to remain fiscally responsible.”
This month, campus leaders in Lincoln, Omaha and Kearney made offers to 116 faculty:

University of Nebraska-Lincoln: 69 faculty.
University of Nebraska at Omaha: 26 faculty.
University of Nebraska Medical Center: 11 faculty.
University of Nebraska at Kearney: 10 faculty.

Faculty must accept the separation agreement by Jan. 5. Awardees would receive a lump sum payment of 70% of one year of their annual base salary they are paid as of Oct. 1.
UNL Executive Vice Chancellor Mark Button had previously said UNL would achieve savings if more than 30 faculty participated in the program. An estimate of savings from a larger number of participants was not immediately available, in part because some positions would be replaced sooner than others and because salary levels differ.
Across-the-board 1% cut ($4.61 million)
An approximate 1% reduction in all state-aided budgets across UNL (budgets made up of tuition and taxpayer dollars). Unchanged from the original budget proposal.
UNL executive administrative reductions and staff ‘efficiencies’ ($2.95 million)
The UNL spokesperson said these cuts are “still in process” and are not planned to be announced until after the Dec. 5 regents meeting. The budget proposal says some administration and staff positions will be eliminated in Bennett’s office, the Executive Vice Chancellor’s Office and the Business and Finance Department.
Bennett’s salary is $732,000. He joined UNL in July 2023 with his contract currently set to expire June 30.
UNL Faculty Senate to weigh ‘no confidence’ vote against campus chancellor Nov. 18

The chancellor faces a possible “no confidence” vote from the UNL Faculty Senate in an emergency meeting set for 2:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Nebraska East Union. While Bennett has not responded directly to the “no confidence” effort, in his Nov. 10 email, he said he followed university processes to pursue budget reductions.
“The Executive Leadership Team and I worked hard to adhere to this comprehensive process — both in letter and in spirit — and to complete all steps within the provided timeline,” Bennett said.
Private philanthropy to cover mandated scholarships ($2.5 million)
UNL leaders continue to work with the University of Nebraska Foundation to secure private funding, but there was no further update at this time, the UNL spokesperson said. 
NU President Jeffrey Gold is continuing to work with the Nebraska Legislature to find solutions to unfunded tuition remissions — mandatory scholarships that lawmakers have said colleges must provide — as costs have ballooned in recent years. 
State-mandated tuition remission expenses for 2025 totaled $8.8 million across NU. Institutional tuition remission expenses, such as the Nebraska Promise, Regents Scholars or Presidential Scholars, totaled $48.4 million.
It’s unclear what slice of scholarships Bennett is trying to fill specifically at UNL. This is the lone part of the UNL budget proposal that seeks or suggests private philanthropy as a solution.
College budget reductions ($1.6 million)
There will be $550,000 less state-aided funding for graduate assistantships in research or teaching in the College of Arts and Sciences ($325,000) and the College of Engineering ($225,000).
The College of Architecture will still find $700,000 to cut, but from an alternative plan to preserve academic degrees in community and regional planning and landscape architecture. The budget proposal says this will mean “streamlining operations, administration, staffing and curriculum.” The advisory committee rejected the architectural cuts 19-2 and supported the alternative.

Also included is $350,000 in specific savings for the College of Fine and Performing Arts. The original idea had been to require the Glenn Korff School of Music and Johnny Carson School of Theatre and Film to share a director, a plan that is no longer being pursued as the college found “alternative budget savings.” Bennett’s plan did not detail those alternatives.
The advisory committee, while not asked to review the proposal, split 7-7-7 in favor, opposition and abstention regarding the idea. Bennett did not disclose the idea in his original proposal.
College administrative and staff ‘efficiencies’ ($750,000)
Administrative and college staff positions, as well as certain operating expenses, will be eliminated in the Colleges of Business, Engineering and Journalism and Mass Communications.
While some specifics are still being finalized, these cuts will create less flexibility in offering summer and elective courses, according to college deans. A separate broadcasting degree will also be formally merged with journalism. The degree paths already share significant similarities, and the three overseeing faculty are retiring, either already planned or via the buyout package.

The event centered around fusion voting, which is the practice of allowing more than one political party to nominate the same candidate on a ballot. Currently used in Connecticut and New York, the fusion voting system means the candidates on the left can appear on the ballot under both the Democratic Party and the smaller Working Families Party while candidates on the right appear for the Republican Party and the Conservative Party. 
In theory this can give the minor parties enough influence to push for policy changes. A minor party that can swing 4% of a vote total can move the needle. 
Throughout the 1800s, fusion voting was the norm across the country — the Republican Party itself was formed in Wisconsin as a fusion party by voters who felt that the major parties at the time, the Democrats and Whigs, weren’t doing enough to end slavery. Eventually, the two major parties worked together to get the practice banned in most of the country.
Often, minor fusion parties are further from the ideological center than the major parties, but a lawsuit is currently pending in Wisconsin from a group called United Wisconsin aiming to create a fusion party that connects moderate voters who don’t feel like they’re represented by the modern Democrats or Republicans. The effort is being helmed by former state Senate Majority Leader Dale Schultz and former Dane County Sheriff Dave Mahoney. The group is represented in the lawsuit by the voting rights focused firm Law Forward. 
Lawsuits to reinstate fusion voting are also pending in New Jersey and Kansas. 
Lilliana Mason, a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University, said during the conference that the two party system and primary election process have polarized the country’s politics and made our’ “sense of winning or losing” more “existential.”
Looming over the discussions, but without being explicitly mentioned very often, was the Trump administration’s anti-democratic actions — including denying the outcome of the 2020 election, supporting the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and pardoning Wisconsin’s fake electors —  and the threat of authoritarianism. The debate Friday was often an exchange over how fusion voting fits into broader systemic reforms and if it can be used in tandem with proposals including proportional representation, multi-member congressional districts, ranked choice voting, gerrymandering prohibitions, filibuster reform and others. 
“It makes it possible for people who want to organize and who want to create and claim their own political power, to do so in an effective way,” Beau Tremitiere, an attorney from the non-profit Protect Democracy, said. They’re exactly right. “People are deeply dissatisfied with the system. There’s a lot of energy to do something better and fusion makes that easier.”
Fusion advocates said the system allows politics to be more dynamic. People’s political beliefs don’t always fit neatly in a party system that encourages big tents and the necessity of coalition management in those big tents means that parties aren’t encouraged to distance themselves from their most extreme members. 
“Politics is a complex, dynamic system that is always changing,” said Lee Drutman, who studies political reform at the think tank New America. “And the key is, how do you keep it from spiraling out of control? How do you keep it from a self-reinforcing tumult? And if you have a party system problem, which we do, you need a party system solution.”
But several speakers at the conference also laid out the limits and downsides of fusion voting. It’s not a major structural reform. Fusion parties are usually further from the ideological center, so if the goal is a more moderate politics, it’s not clear fusion will deliver that. Members of the Green Party expressed concern that fusion enables a patronage system of political favor trading. 
Overall though, the conference often returned to the idea that the country is in a democracy crisis and experimentation is a good thing in the effort to turn it around. 
“I’m supportive of experimentation,” Derek Muller, a law professor at Notre Dame, said. “It seems to me, we should see more real world experiments.”
Schultz, who was in the Legislature from 1983 to 2015, said he’s trying to establish a fusion party in Wisconsin to get more “humanity” in the state’s politics. 
“Why fusion voting? Why does it matter? Because of agency, the fact that suddenly people get a chance to sit at the table, to be a part of the discussions that matter to them,” he said. “Yes, fusion voting is not the be- and end-all political reform, but it is, in my opinion, an essential part of our future if we’re going to get back to having a healthy democracy.”

The issue involves the Idaho Transportation Department’s former administrative headquarters, which is located on a 44-acre campus situated at 3311 W. State St. in Boise. The headquarters building flooded Jan. 2, 2022, suffered water damage and was contaminated with asbestos, resulting in the displacement of all employees working in the building, state records show.
The damaged building has sat vacant since the flood and been subjected to a tug-of-war involving the Idaho Legislature. 
The summer after the flood, the Idaho Transportation Department declared the building surplus property, which paved the way for it to be sold. But in March 2024, the Idaho Legislature abruptly blocked the planned $51.7 million sale of the 44-acre campus to a group of buyers that included Hawkins Companies, FJ Management and Pacific West Communities, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
 After Legislature blocked sale, officials working toward renovating former agency headquarters

Instead of selling the property, which is located just west of Downtown Boise near parks and the Boise River Greenbelt, some Idaho state legislators argued it would be a better deal for taxpayers if the state blocked the sale, held on to the property and renovated it so state employees could use the building again. 
After years of uncertainty, the state is moving in that direction now. 
Based on a property condition assessment report completed late last year, the Idaho Transportation Board approved a resolution during its September board meeting directing staff to work with the Idaho Division of Public Works to award a contract for the abatement of hazardous materials in the damaged building, Communications Manager John Tomlinson said.

Based on the December 2024 property condition assessment report, the estimate for the work to remove the hazardous materials is $8.2 million, state records show. 
During a December 2024 tour of the flood-damaged building, an Idaho Capital Sun reporter observed mold, visible water damage and stains to numerous walls, ceilings, carpets and floors. Exposed electrical wiring and tangled messes of metal and broken wood were present throughout different areas of the building. The elevator, which was not operational, had its doors propped open and electricity and heat were only working in some areas.

Idaho Transportation Department officials also told the Sun and other reporters the building had been contaminated with asbestos. 
 State staffers also directed to begin designing remodel, with plans for employees to return to work once projects are finished

In addition to directing staff to award a contract for the abatement of hazardous materials at the State Street campus, the Idaho Transportation Board also directed staff in September to begin designing a remodel of the building. 
The board said the remodel plans should address:

Fire suppression sprinklers and alarm systems.
Replacing the existing elevators.
Rehabilitating or replacing the building envelope to include windows and doors.
Replacing all of the electrical, HVAC, plumbing and other major systems.
Any needed structural modifications or reinforcements that may be needed.
Landscaping, drainage, rehabilitating the parking lot and increasing exterior lighting for employee safety.

“Once design is done, the plan is to go right into getting a contract and beginning the remodel,” Tomlinson said in an email to the Sun.
Officials are estimating the remodel could take two years to complete, Tomlinson said. 
“Once completed all HQ staff working out of Building 8 at the state of Idaho Chinden Campus would be moved back down to State Street,” Tomlinson said. 
Cost estimates provided in the December 2024 property condition assessment report appear to exceed the amount of funding the Idaho Legislature has provided so far to rehabilitate the building , the Sun previously reported. 
Cost estimates range from $64 million to $69.4 million. But the Idaho Legislature has so far provided a total of $42.1 million – $32.5 million in the 2024 legislative session and $9.6 million during the 2025 legislative session. 
Idaho Transportation Department officials have previously told the Sun that a building design would provide the necessary details to execute the rehabilitation work and provide a more accurate cost estimate.
That estimate would inform the department’s budget request in future fiscal years, Idaho Transportation Department officials said.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)Nearly 40 Tennessee hardwood companies are among hundreds of U.S. hardwood industry operators calling for federal relief from tariff-induced economic hardship.
Tennessee’s forestry products industry supports an estimated 85,000 jobs, according to the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, which includes the state’s Division of Forestry. Forest products are the fourth-largest agricultural commodity in the state. Export sales dipped by $45 million in 2023, resulting in an estimated loss of 362 jobs, according to a University of Tennessee report.
The industry as a whole lost an estimated $9 billion in commercial opportunities since the 2018 trade war began when President Donald Trump first escalated tariffs against China, one of the United States’ biggest export markets since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. But the lumber industry was not included in federal tariff relief payments made to agricultural producers in 2018, according to an Oct. 14 letter to Trump administration officials signed by 452 lumber industry mills, manufacturers and distributors across the U.S.
Tariffs on some Chinese goods continued through former President Joe Biden’s administration. Trade tensions flared again with Trump’s return to office and renewed tariff escalation threats this year as China imposed export controls on rare-earth minerals — key components for electric batteries, computer chips, smart phones and more. 
China halted imports of U.S. logs in April amid retaliatory measures against heightening U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump reached a deal with China in late October, in which China agreed to resume purchases of U.S. logs, according to the White House.
Tariff negotiations and fluctuating trade relationships compounded an already difficult market for U.S. hardwood mills, according to Claire Getty, CFO at Thompson Appalachian Hardwoods in Huntland, Tennessee. The company works with landowners and loggers in a 150-mile radius of its rural headquarters, paying them for the cut logs that the company then processes in its sawmills. Historically, the company focused on creating products for homes: furniture, molding, millwork, trim, floors, cabinets and doors, for example. But the rise in popularity of cheaper man-made materials (for example, vinyl floors that resemble wood) has crippled the hardwood market, she said.
TN Soybean farmers face ‘desperate situation’ amid inflation, weather extremes and tariffs

“The North American hardwood industry has really suffered, and tariffs exacerbated that, because it causes prices (for hardwood) to be even higher, which then causes the manufacturers of these consumer products to have even more reason to find alternative materials,” Getty said.
The letter to Trump’s administration encouraged officials to give the U.S. hardwood sector “equitable access to relief programs” to “safeguard rural jobs, secure a sustainable domestic supply chain, and preserve a proud American industry for generations to come.”
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture did not confirm whether the administration plans to issue payments to agriculture producers who were negatively impacted by tariffs, though Politico reported on Oct. 30 that up to $12 billion may be put toward farm aid payments. The USDA also did not respond to The Tennessee Lookout’s inquiry on whether the department is considering making forestry industry producers eligible for future tariff aid.
“Currently, the farm economy is in a difficult situation, and President Trump is utilizing all the tools available to ensure farmers have what they need to continue their farming operations,” the spokesperson stated in an email, adding that the USDA will continue to “assess the farm economy and explore the need for further assistance.”
Getty and other companies that signed the letter are seeking relief payments and an agricultural designation for lumber mills. Getty said she sees that kind of acknowledgement as a step toward potential federal help for the industry overall. She points to programs that offered tax credits for energy efficiency improvements in homes, and a previously proposed bill that would have offered similar credit for installing solid hardwood products.
“For us, that’s really where a starting point is, being acknowledged as a critical ag producer to manage these resources,” Getty said. “And because we are considered (a critical ag producer), what can be done to support and help strengthen U.S. forest product markets — hardwood markets, specifically — to help us change this demand curve that we are fighting against.”
Mills diversify businesses to survive, ask for federal support
Getty said Thompson Appalachian Hardwoods has weathered the ebbs and flows of tariffs and industry shifts since 2018 by diversifying its export partners and turning toward industrial markets for hardwood instead of products made for homes.
Export sales made up 61% of Thompson Appalachian Hardwoods’ lumber sales in 2018, when exports took a hit from the first trade war. It took until 2022 for exports to rise again to about 63% of the company’s sales, with 45% of those sales coming from China. But in 2025, export sales dropped to 45%, and exports to China fell to 15%, Getty said.










Our forest products companies and sawmills … have been running at either break-even margins or a less than 2-3% profit margin for the last 36 months, or in the negative.


– Claire Getty, Thompson Appalachian Hardwoods 


The volatility and uncertainty caused by trade negotiations proved to be the most challenging, she said.
In October, Getty said the company had nine orders canceled after rhetoric of rising tariffs, followed by an about-face toward smoother negotiations. But those nine loads were still canceled or delayed by three weeks, and the average price of each load is $20,000.
“That was $180,000 that got shifted out of our sales and our revenue to a future date,” Getty said. “That’s what’s been happening all year.”
The trade deal reached with China in late October states that the country will resume its purchase of U.S. logs, something Getty’s company does not directly export to China. But there are several outfits in Tennessee that do sell logs to China, and this will positively impact the price those companies can get for their logs, she said.
The trade deal also brought back an element of overall stability for hardwood exports — Getty’s sales team saw an increase in calls and orders from China directly following the deal’s announcement.
“What we have found this week is it seems like everybody is moving forward in good faith that there will be fair and reasonable trade moving forward,” she said.
But Thompson Appalachian Hardwoods has also taken steps to hamper the negative impacts of any future trade disputes. The company has invested in strengthening trade relationships with Vietnam and is looking for other markets in Mexico and the Middle East region.
In 2022, the business invested in an industrial sawmill that produces railroad crossties used to maintain U.S. rail infrastructure. The mill started running in 2025, providing a more stable source of income — railroad companies typically buy around 19 million crossties every year, Getty said.
“It’s just diversifying our overall blend, because at one point … our exports were a very high percentage of our business, and then that Chinese sector was a very high percentage of that, and we can’t find ourselves in that position again,” she said.
Over the last three years, Getty watched as sawmill after sawmill shuttered, and she worries that in the long term, those losses will stamp out market-driven options for forest management. Companies like hers pay landowners and harvesters for the trees they cut down, and ensure every part of the tree is used, from the logs to the wood chips and sawdust. 
If mills go out of business, landowners and governments may have to shoulder the cost of tree removal instead, Getty said. 
Federal aid could help offset some of the profits lost during trade wars and help some businesses stay afloat, she said. The companies that have survived may not have been able to invest in maintenance for their mills, expansion or employee benefits while they were in “fight-or-flight mode.”
“Our forest products companies and sawmills … have been running at either break-even margins or a less than 2-3% profit margin for the last 36 months, or in the negative,” Getty said. “That insertion of capital kind of helps everybody catch their breath.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Activist groups and community members gathered Saturday morning to denounce the construction of a new federal immigration enforcement detention facility on Milwaukee’s Northwest Side. Renovations at the property, located at 11900 W Lake Park Drive, were clearly underway, with construction equipment sitting behind new fencing, piles of dirt and stacks of building materials visible through the building’s dark windows. Outside, protesters marched in the street and delivered speeches. 
The 36,000-square-foot detention and processing center is planned to serve as a central hub for southeastern Wisconsin, holding people before deportation or transfer to other detention centers.
“You may be here, but you are not welcome here,” said Ald. Larresa Taylor — who represents the district where the facility will be located. Although the city cannot prevent ICE from taking over the facility, Taylor said that this “doesn’t mean that we are going to accept it laying down.”

Activists from Voces de la Frontera, Comité Sin Fronteras, the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, Never Again Action–Wisconsin, the Party for Socialism & Liberation, and the Wisconsin Coalition for Justice in Palestine picketed outside the building for close to two hours. Towards the end of the event, a drone was seen flying overhead, which was not operated by any of the activist groups who held the rally. In a empty parking lot nearby, several deputies appeared to be packing away equipment in the trunk a Milwaukee County Sheriff’s vehicle. The Sheriff’s office didn’t respond to requests for comment on whether its drone team was flying over the Saturday protest. 
Opponents of the facility say that its opening moved forward without community input or consent, and that it will perpetuate troubling uses of force and arrests in cities nationwide including Chicago. The facility will be used to  process ICE detainees, as well as immigrants who must come in for regular check-ins.
Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, applauded Taylor, calling her “the first person to sound the alarm months ago about the expansion of this detention center, and to call attention and condemn what was happening in our city.”  The building is privately owned by Milwaukee Governmental LLC, which originally requested modifications to the property (something Taylor learned about in December). The LLC is linked to the Illinois-based WD Schorsch LLC, which owns properties leased to federal government agencies.

“It’s not an accident what is happening, where this facility is being chosen to be built,” said Neumann-Ortiz. “It’s part of a long-term pattern of discrimination and marginalization, and criminalization of working class people of color.” Neumann-Oritz said that instead of spending “millions” on the facility, “that money should be used to pay for FoodShare, BadgerCare, and our public schools.” 
 Angela Lang, executive director of Black Leaders Organizing Communities (BLOC), said, “We are not free, until we are all free.” Lang added that Black communities “know what it’s like to be ripped away from our families and locked away,” and that people are concerned about federal agents’ behavior in cities like Chicago. “And we have been worried for months, if not years, ‘is this going to happen to Milwaukee?’” 
Over recent months months, videos have suggested an escalating patter of force from federal agents including shooting people in the head with pepper balls, placing protesters in chokeholds, deploying tear gas in crowded neighborhoods in broad daylight, arresting and attacking journalists, arresting parents in front of their children, and having unprofessional verbal exchanges with citizens.

Although Milwaukee hasn’t seen protest-related clashes, ICE stirred anxiety and condemnation earlier this year after arresting members of families with mixed-immigration status at the Milwaukee County Courthouse as they attended court hearings. Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was also arrested and criminally charged after the federal government accused her of attempting to hide a person sought by ICE who’d attended a hearing in her courtroom. Dugan is expected to go to trial in federal court in December. Other high profile arrests and deportations of community members have also occurred in Milwaukee during the first six months of the second  Trump administration. 
Conor Mika, a student activist at the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) condemned what he said is a lack of transparency and accountability for his  school’s relationship with ICE, which has been using a university building for operations in Milwaukee. “It’s time MSOE takes a stand. It’s on MSOE to slow down ICE’s operations, and protect its students by removing ICE from this building, and refusing any future collaborations with these agencies conducting mass deportations in our city.”
Leah Janke and Tanya Brown both attended the rally Saturday, and told the Wisconsin Examiner that it was important to make their voices heard. “I think it’s important that people here know that we don’t want this,” said Brown. “It’s not just a small community that doesn’t want it, it’s everybody. We don’t want it.” Janke said. “It’s 2025, and this is completely unacceptable to be running an ICE facility like this, and be deporting people illegally, without due process. This is insanity. It doesn’t feel right in any way.” Janke added, “I’ve seen a lot happening in Chicago, and that’s my fear…that’s my biggest fear.”

Besides attending rallies, Janke has been making “whistle kits” filled with whistles and information about reporting ICE, or alerting the community if an arrest is happening. “Be safe out there,” said Janke. “Because honestly, it’s scary and people are getting  hurt.”
Raúl Ríos, an activist with both Comité Sin Fronteras and Party for Socialism and Liberation, said it was important to rally people on Saturday both on the North and South Sides of Milwaukee, especially since the city is one of the most segregated in America. “Most people that I’ve heard, not only today but previously, had said that they had no idea that this was even being constructed, and that it’s going to be used as the main facility for southeast Wisconsin,” Rios told the Examiner.

(File photo by Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho faces tough budget choices in the coming months. Cutting mental health peer support should not be part of the answer.
As directed by the state, Magellan, the contractor managing Medicaid behavioral-health services, plans to cut several behavioral health services, including peer support as of Dec. 1. This announcement has had the mental health services world reeling for the outsized impact it will have on some of Idaho’s most vulnerable.
Idaho budget writers prepare to enter new era of trimming state budgets

The decision saves a few dollars in the short term, but at a devastating cost. Not only do hundreds of active peer support specialists face losing their jobs just before the holidays, but the thousands of people they serve, who are seeking recovery and need support navigating daily life, managing symptoms, and building recovery skills, will be left without support when they need it most.
Idaho has made meaningful strides in the behavioral health space recently, including expanding the 988 crisis line to include 24/7 mobile behavioral health response teams statewide – a major step toward accessible, community-based crisis care. Cuts to peer support services represent a larger step backwards.
It’s one that Idaho cannot afford. Mental Health America ranks Idaho 48th out of 50 states. Too many Idahoans still struggle to find timely, affordable care. Cutting peer-support only widens that gap. Any progress we’ve made is at risk if we curtail evidence-based and cost-efficient systems that bolster our behavioral health workforce.
Peer Support Specialists provide the human connection in a system that can otherwise feel impersonal and intimidating. They have walked their own path of recovery and now reinforce that work by helping their clients stay engaged in treatment and connected to their communities.
Research consistently shows peer support reduces hospitalizations, improves recovery outcomes, and lowers costs. A full-time peer support specialist typically carries a caseload of 12-15 individuals who rely upon them. This means, as of December, Idaho faces the quadruple whammy of thousands of Idahoans suddenly losing essential support, peers losing gainful employment that supports their own recovery, another blow to our already beleaguered mental health workforce, and impacts to the work of clinicians.
Especially in rural areas, peers fill the gap where licensed clinicians are scarce. Our 988 mobile crisis teams depend on this workforce; peer specialists turn moments of fear into connection and hope. Dropping this key component jeopardizes that model. Once programs close or staff are reduced, rebuilding will take years.
Budget pressures are real, but cuts that save a small amount now will cost us later in emergency care, hospitalization, incarceration, family disruption, and worse for those who live with serious mental illness. Instead, Idaho should focus on maintaining and even strengthening the peer workforce as a cost-effective method for supporting recovery.
Gov. Brad Little and the Legislature have proven strong stewards of Idaho’s finances. The state’s rainy-day fund, now holding record reserves, is precisely the tool for stabilizing essential services while policymakers plan for sustainability. Protecting mental-health access isn’t excess spending; it’s safeguarding lives and the workforce that supports them.
Idaho is modernizing our crisis response, investing in 988, and talking openly about mental health in ways unthinkable a decade ago. Undercutting that progress will have lasting impact.
Peer support is a bridge between clinical care and real life. It keeps people connected to treatment, hope, and community. If we truly value recovery, dignity, and access to care for all Idahoans, we must protect that bridge. Use the rainy-day fund. Exempt behavioral health services from cuts. Don’t balance the budget on the backs of Idaho’s most vulnerable.

(Photo by Don Petersen/Associated Press)A Colorado law that prevents medical debt from appearing on consumer credit reports is facing a new legal challenge following guidance from the Trump administration that says federal credit policy overrides such state laws. 
In 2023 Colorado enacted a law that requires credit reporting agencies to remove medical debt from consumer reports, limiting who can see it.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at the end of October reversed a Biden-era interpretation of the 1970 Fair Credit Reporting Act that allowed states to ban medical debt from appearing on credit reports. The new rule says the FCRA overrides state laws around reporting debt to credit bureaus, “consistent with Congress’s intent to create national standards for the credit reporting system.”

At the time Colorado’s law passed, about 11% of Coloradans had medical debt in collections. Colorado was the first state to approve a policy limiting how medical debt affects credit, and more than a dozen states now have similar laws.
ACA International, an association of credit and collection professionals, filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado on Nov. 5 challenging the state’s law after the Trump administration announced the new rule. The association says the law has compromised accurate credit reporting and harms medical providers and patients in the state.
New Trump administration rule could override state medical debt protections

“Creditors and lenders who lack a complete picture of a consumer’s credit history may extend a loan the consumer cannot afford, which only hurts their financial situation and increases the cost of credit for everyone,” Jennifer Whipple, ACA’s board president, said in a statement.
Bethany Pray, chief legal and policy officer at the Colorado Center on Law and Policy, said the Trump administration rule is a change in guidance and doesn’t immediately lead to changes, but it opens the door to legal action such as the ACA lawsuit. The guidance itself acknowledges that the courts are the “ultimate arbiters of statutory meaning,” Pray said.
Previous court rulings in Maine and New Jersey found that states are not preempted from implementing bans on medical debt appearing on credit reports, so Pray said those cases offer viable arguments that could support Colorado’s law in court.
Isabel Cruz, policy director at the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, said Coloradans should know that the law’s protections are not immediately threatened, and those affected would be alerted before any changes.
“We were really excited that Colorado was at the forefront of this important policy, and we’ve heard from consumers, from legal advocates and from other folks on the ground that having the ability to pursue housing, to pursue different careers, has really opened up without having a medical debt on credit reports for the last few years,” Cruz said.
The bill has a July 2028 sunset included because of how new the policy was, Cruz said, but she hasn’t heard any desire at the Colorado Legislature to end the law sooner than that because the protections have been “quite popular.”










We know that a big reason people don’t access care is for fear of what it will cost.


– Don't forget to add author


Colorado has seen what medical debt appearing on credit reports does to consumers since the law only recently passed. Cruz says it stops people from being able to build wealth and feel financially stable enough to pay back their debts. Medical debt appearing on consumer credit reports again, she said, “will take us backwards and unravel the progress that has been made for Coloradans.”
“We know that a big reason people don’t access care is for fear of what it will cost,” Cruz said.
Medical debt is not planned or voluntarily incurred, Pray said, so the debt affecting someone’s ability to rent a home, get a loan, or sometimes get a job harms “all aspects of Coloradans lives.” Medicaid work requirements and the end of Affordable Care Act tax credits means more people will potentially incur medical debt, too, she said.
“This is a really tough time for this issue to come up when we know that there are tens of thousands of people who are likely to lose health care coverage in the next months,” Pray said.
Cruz and Pray both said their organizations will closely watch the lawsuit as it goes through the court system.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)The secretary of state is asking for a formal legal opinion from the attorney general on the North Dakota Ethics Commission’s authority, including whether it had the right to issue a recent advisory opinion. 
The request joins previous questions about the commission’s authority raised by other executive branch leaders. The Legislature empowered the commission to issue advisory opinions if a public official wants to know whether an action is permitted under state law. But the governor and other elected officials say the agency has overstepped, with the conflict contributing to a stalled process to fill vacancies on the commission.
Secretary of State Michael Howe (Provided)
Secretary of State Michael Howe asked in a July 22 letter for Attorney General Drew Wrigley to weigh in on the overlapping responsibilities of his office and the Ethics Commission in response to an advisory opinion about campaign finance.
The inquiry is in response to a June 25 Ethics Commission advisory opinion about campaign finance. Howe asks the attorney general if the commission’s advisory opinion is accurate, what would happen if his office disagrees with future opinions, and whether his office is obligated to follow ethics rules adopted by the commission that differ from state law. 
“The advisory opinion appears to provide a legal interpretation of the statute rather than addressing an ethical question or scenario related to the statute,” Howe writes. 
Howe also points out that the secretary of state oversees campaign finance and election laws, but his office was not consulted about the opinion. 
ND Ethics Commission has no authority to punish officials violating ethics laws, state leaders argue

Gov. Kelly Armstrong has raised concerns about the advisory opinion during recent meetings to appoint new members to the Ethics Commission and during a public hearing in July. He has said that paying for day care or security with campaign funds should be a policy question, not an ethical one.
The advisory opinion is one reason Armstrong has objected to reappointing Murray Sagsveen to the Ethics Commission. Armstrong advocates for a “reset” on the commission, while the Senate majority and minority leaders want to reappoint Sagsveen to promote continuity. The three-member selection committee has deadlocked during three previous meetings and is meeting again Wednesday. 
Meanwhile, the Ethics Commission is also set to meet Wednesday and plans to discuss for the first time Howe’s request for an attorney general opinion.
Advisory opinions
In the advisory opinion requested by Sen. Josh Boschee, the Ethics Commission said caregiving and security expenses can be paid for with campaign funds in some instances.
Boschee, a Democrat from Fargo, said he initially tried to get Howe’s opinion about whether a candidate’s child care can be paid for with campaign funds. Howe said he doesn’t recall anyone asking his office.
The lawmaker provided a March 2024 email showing he posed the question to Howe. Boschee said the secretary of state told him during a meeting he couldn’t provide an answer, which led him to request advice from the Ethics Commission. Boschee also asked the commission to weigh in on whether candidate security could be a campaign finance expense, but he did not ask Howe about security.
“By giving these kinds of advisory opinions, I think it helps give clarity to the public, as well as those that are regulated by the Ethics Commission’s authority, on what we can and can’t do,” Boschee said in an interview.

North Dakota voters in 2018 approved a constitutional amendment that created the Ethics Commission to be an ethics watchdog in state government. The amendment, now Article XIV of North Dakota’s constitution, authorizes the Ethics Commission to adopt ethics rules related to transparency, corruption, elections and lobbying for lobbyists and public officials. The commission can also investigate alleged violations of those rules, other sections of the constitutional amendment and related state laws.  
In 2021, lawmakers voted nearly unanimously to give the commission authority to issue advisory opinions at the request of someone they have jurisdiction over. The opinions provide guidance on how state law, ethics rules created by the commission, and Article XIV of the constitution apply “to specified hypothetical facts or prospective conduct.” 
Ethics Commission staff research and write the opinions before they’re submitted to the five ethics commissioners for feedback and approval. People who follow the guidance can claim “safe harbor” or immunity if they are later accused of violating a criminal or civil statute as a result of their action. 
Rep. Larry Klemin, a Republican from Bismarck, was one of the original supporters of giving the Ethics Commission the authority to issue advisory opinions. The practice was modeled after a similar system commonly used by state bar associations to provide ethical advice to attorneys. 
“I think it’s working pretty well,” he said. “It’s a good guide for the people that have questions about the Ethics Commission’s interpretation of the statute and the Constitution, about whether some particular conduct is ethical or not.”
The Ethics Commission encourages requests for advisory opinions as a way to answer questions before potentially unethical conduct occurs, instead of investigating complaints of unethical conduct after the fact, said executive director Rebecca Binstock. 
State Treasurer Thomas Beadle requested an advisory opinion earlier this year. He is president of the National Association of State Treasurers and was considering participation in the organization’s trip to Israel. He asked the Ethics Commission if the trip, paid for by the Israeli foreign ministry and a nonprofit, would violate any ethics laws. The commission concluded it would not. 
“If we can stop things that might be improper from happening before they happen, seems like a good policy,” Beadle said.
Unlike the commission’s constitutional authority, the power to issue advisory opinions stems from state law written and passed by legislators. The Legislature has the power to make changes, such as requiring the commission to follow certain processes in researching an advisory opinion or eliminating the power altogether. 
Ethical versus legal opinions
The Ethics Commission’s decision to issue an advisory opinion on campaign finance, an area of law it shares jurisdiction over with the Secretary of State’s office, has led to allegations by Armstrong of encroachment on the authority of the executive branch. Howe, in his letter requesting an attorney general’s opinion, called it “potentially overstepping its ethical mandate.”
“The Ethics Commission, they’re tasked with determining if something’s ethical or not, not legal,” Howe said in an interview.
But the section of state law authorizing the Ethics Commission’s advisory powers does not make a clear distinction between the two. 
A spokesperson for the attorney general said the office is working on the opinion but declined to provide a timeline. Attorney General Wrigley did not return a call seeking comment.
North Dakota Ethics Commissioners to evaluate ‘strained’ relationship with Attorney General’s Office

Previously, Wrigley has been highly critical of Ethics Commission staff, while commissioners have defended the staff. Wrigley said during an interview on the Plain Talk podcast his office is working on “a pretty extensive AG opinion” in response to Howe’s request.
“As the governor likes to point out, there’s a big difference between something that is a legal question and something that is an ethical question,” Wrigley said during the August interview. 
Ethics Commissioners have said they are committed to working with members of the executive branch who have concerns about the agency’s activities. 
Sagsveen, the ethics commissioner presiding over the public hearing where Armstrong first expressed his concerns about the advisory opinion, has signaled he’s open to creating a process to gather feedback about an advisory opinion before it is finalized. He also invited Armstrong to meet with the full commission at a later date to discuss his concerns. 
The Ethics Commission opted to hold off on scheduling a meeting with the governor until its three vacancies have been filled to ensure the newly appointed members can participate. Two of three vacancies remain. 
Armstrong’s concerns about the advisory opinion have been a factor in his refusal to reappoint Sagsveen to a full term on the commission. The governor also objects to Sagsveen’s answer to a questionnaire in which he said the Legislature has violated the constitution by passing laws to limit the commission’s authority.
Governor wants ‘reset’ from North Dakota Ethics Commission as committee deadlocks on candidates

Ethics Commission Chair Cynthia Lindquist sent the committee a letter on Oct. 30 acknowledging “a need for better dialogue, exchange, and understanding about the work of the Commission.”
“The Commission must be allowed to carry out our responsibilities as outlined in the North Dakota Constitution, and this essential work requires the assistance and collaboration of those the Commission regulates,” she said. “With these goals in mind, the Commission welcomes productive policy discussions regarding its work, including the critiques it received regarding one advisory opinion.”
Lindquist declined to comment for this article because the five-member commission has not had an opportunity to discuss the subject in a meeting. Sagsveen, a Bismarck attorney, has declined to comment on ongoing selection committee discussions.
Boschee, for his part, said he’s glad the Ethics Commission has the power to issue advisory opinions like the one he requested. 
“There are questions that the public has, there’s questions that candidates and policymakers have, and we need someone to be able to provide us that guidance,” Boschee said. “And so far, that’s been the Ethics Commission. I think they’ve done a good job.”

(Photo courtesy of NextEra Energy)For the first time, North Dakota utility regulators are considering proposals for massive battery storage sites that would serve as backstops for renewable energy sources. 
Battery Energy Storage Systems hold energy when it’s produced in excess, such as when wind farms see especially windy days, or when solar panels absorb more sun energy than what’s in demand. Energy harvested by the batteries is later used when those resources are in deficit. 
Such technology has been materializing across the country in recent years, receiving generous production tax credits from the federal government. 
In theory, the sites could help reduce congestion on the power grid and potentially alleviate cost fluctuations that can otherwise cause price spikes for customers. But it’s too early to tell whether that’s the case for projects being proposed in North Dakota, according to Director of Utilities for the Public Service Commission Victor Schock. 
The first-ever project under consideration is being proposed by NextEra, a company with several wind farms across the state including a location in Emmons County. That wind farm is where the company is looking to put its $181 million battery storage site, according to its application to the Public Service Commission.

Chair Randy Christmann said he’s apprehensive of normalizing battery storage systems in the state: “I just don’t know how the benefit compares to what it’s costing.”
He said he’s concerned about the grid becoming “reliant” on energy stored in the lithium-ion batteries, especially since the materials typically come from “adversarial” countries.
China produces the majority of the world’s lithium-ion batteries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
NextEra told the North Dakota Monitor in an emailed statement that the specific battery system has not been finalized for the Emmons County project, but the company has “secured arrangements to source a U.S.-made battery for a significant portion” of its portfolio. 
The massive battery units would have the capacity to store 140 megawatts, the amount of electricity used by approximately 13 average homes in one year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Overall, the project would use 24 acres already housing an adjacent wind farm, with construction beginning May 2026 and, if the project is approved, operations starting as early as December that year. It would bring around 150 construction jobs and one to three permanent jobs, the company estimates. 
Over the 25-year span of the operation, the county is estimated to reel in $7.2 million in property taxes in addition to the nearly $4 million county application fee. 
Emmons County Commissioners and NextEra representatives discussed the permitting costs and taxation at length during a public hearing in August before they approved the project later that month. 
During the nearly four-hour meeting, members of the public raised concerns primarily centered on transparency from the company and the safety of the facility.
Some residents said the company had previously been disingenuous in gathering easements for its wind farm; others mentioned how, if the battery storage system were to malfunction and catch on fire, the response would likely be delayed due to the remoteness of the site’s location.
In response, NextEra representatives told the residents they are working with local first responders and volunteers.
In an emailed statement, the company did not share specific data related to safety of battery storage systems but said its systems are extensively monitored and have physical safeguards to minimize any damages should any issues arise. 
Commissioner Christmann said he is eager to learn more about the project during its hearing, which is open to the public and scheduled for 9 a.m. Thursday at the Emmons County Courthouse Auditorium in Linton. 
On the other end of the state, in Burke County, NextEra is proposing a second battery storage site with 100 megawatts in capacity. The nearly $129 million site would occupy 21 acres and also attach to existing wind energy infrastructure, according to application documents. 
Construction is expected to last six months and yield around 100 jobs, with two permanent positions for operations. 
The second project’s formal, public hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. Dec. 19 at the Bowbells Memorial City Hall.

“It’s a little daunting when you come in every morning and there’s 60 voicemails and every one of them needs something,” said Margaret O’Neal, president and CPO of the United Way of Central West Virginia, which operates West Virginia’s 211 helpline. “In this particular case, those needs were almost always food.”
More than 2,600 calls came into 211 call centers — almost all for food — since the federal government shutdown began on Nov. 1 and benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program weren’t delivered to about 275,000 West Virginia residents who rely on the program.
It’s a 1,680% increase from the number of calls 211 received last year in the same time frame, according to call center data.
There were 2,000 text messages to 211, as well.
During the drawn-out saga over SNAP, Gov. Patrick Morrisey continuously directed people in need to call 211 to get connected with a local food pantry. The state’s charitable food network experienced skyrocketing demand; some food pantries in the southern part of West Virginia saw a 1,800% increase in the number of families in need.
O’Neal said 211 call specialists around the state “were the boots on the ground” talking to people every single day. Sometimes phone lines were overloaded, she said, but call specialists kept trying to call people back. The organization said that all call were answered. 
“We found ourselves delivering food a number of times over the last two weeks,” O’Neal said.
“Seniors would call and talk to the call specialist, and they would express deep concern of no food and no transportation and no way to kind of see the end of the crisis.”
Brian Aluise, community impact associate with the United Way of Central West Virginia, said someone called 211 trying to get food to 70 seniors in apartment buildings in Charleston couldn’t get to food handouts. 
“A lot of them are homebound … Went over there and distributed, like 150 meals to folks there in the community,” Aluise said. “211 is not only great for referring folks to resources, but also identifying big unmet needs for large populations and then trying to address those issues as they arise.”
There were follow-up calls with individuals to make sure they received food, O’Neal said. 
She explained that it was all hands on deck the last few weeks to meet the need while operating on “a shoestring” budget. 
“We’re a little tired and a little emotional, and all the things that go with disaster,” she said.
Morrisey handed out around $13 million in state funding to the state’s food banks.
The United Way receives $200,000 through the state’s portion of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families federal funding.
West Virginians received full SNAP benefits Thursday, Morrisey said, after Congress approved legislation reopening the federal government, ending the longest federal government shutdown in United States history.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht/Tennessee Lookout)“Now we’re going to talk about when you can, and when you can’t, use your firearm,” the instructor said with a grin, barely concealing his enthusiasm at the chance to take his students through a deep dive on Tennessee’s laws governing self-defense. 
My brother-in-law and I were taking a firearms class in Nashville in 2019, seeking to earn our handgun carry permits. As a lifetime gun guy, the class quickly became one of the best educational experiences I’d had regarding firearms, yet since that day, I’ve watched as Tennessee and 16 other states have passed permit-less carry legislation, removing one of the only enforcement mechanisms states have to ensure residents are educated on laws governing firearms.
Just when policymakers in Tennessee need to be doing more to make our communities safer, legislators are passing laws that make it easier for those with murderous intent to obtain and carry firearms, all while totally ignoring the underlying reasons why America suffers from a gun violence epidemic in the first place.
The emergency: Gun violence results from a society that fails to provide its residents with social safety and economic opportunity
The U.S. has the highest murder rate of developed nations, killings that are overwhelmingly driven by gun violence. Even other developed countries with large populations of gun owners, like Canada, Finland, Iceland and New Zealand, have nowhere near America’s gun violence rate. Furthermore, the U.S. is seeing more mass shootings each year, a problem that is truly singular to this nation as compared to other developed countries.
Judicial panel rules against Tennessee “going armed” law and parks gun prohibition

Why is the U.S. unique in this regard? The core difference is that the citizens of other first-world democracies have made their governments provide universal healthcare, affordable housing and education, good-paying jobs and strong social safety nets. Conversely, U.S. politicians and their corporate backers increasingly put profits over people.
This nation’s failure to provide basic safety and opportunity to the American people engenders trauma within the population that is not just experienced acutely; it becomes intergenerational. 
Our system is such that tens of millions of Americans are born into terrible economic situations that lack safety and security. Those experiences shape Americans’ development from birth, including how their parents (who are themselves suffering) raise them, whether they go on to use mind-altering substances as a coping mechanism, and how poorly they do in school, at work and in social settings.
Economics and social safety mean everything to a person throughout their development because they touch every aspect of a person’s life, from the household to the school to the workplace. Americans acting out in insane, criminal, murderous ways at rates far higher than in comparable nations is the end result of a system that has denied them safety and security in some way or another for their entire lives.
Some people are born with serious psychological impairments that could lead them to commit gravely immoral acts regardless of their upbringing. Yet, for these individuals too, America in the 21st century continually fails them by not prioritizing mental health treatment for those who need it. Mental health issues are a global problem, yet only in the U.S. does a mental health crisis end in a mass shooting.
Gun deaths in Tennessee hit a historic high

Sadly, very few in the halls of power have supported policy prescriptions that might reverse our glacial slide into a late-stage capitalistic dystopia where our healthcare, housing, education, fair wages, basic security and social safety are sacrificed on the altar of shareholder value.
The triage: Americans support the actions that would immediately begin curbing gun violence 
Despite our politicians utterly failing us, Americans, including Tennesseans, overwhelmingly support triage actions. For example, Americans support common-sense gun law reforms such as universal background checks, waiting periods, firearm safety training, permit-only handgun carry, and safe storage laws. Even red flag laws receive 71% support in Tennessee when pitched to the public as a gun safety measure that would require law enforcement, family members and intimate partners to petition a court for an emergency protection order to temporarily remove firearms from someone deemed an imminent risk to themselves or others.
These laws aim to keep guns out of the hands of individuals who pose a danger to themselves and others without infringing on the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. 
The long-term care: We also support solving the underlying problems that lead to gun violence 
Triage efforts in the form of common-sense gun laws will make it more difficult for sick people with evil intentions to access firearms, but it won’t solve the core societal problems that produce such individuals. 
Thankfully, we also overwhelmingly support society-improving measures like universal healthcare, publicly subsidized higher education, reducing corporate ownership of housing stock, and increasing American worker power through minimum wage increases, stronger unions and fair labor standards. And perhaps most important of all, Americans also support getting corporate money out of politics and forcing politicians to represent people, not wealthy donors.
I wish it were as easy as, “It’s guns!” “It’s mental health!” “It’s culture!” “It’s substance abuse!” or “It’s video games!” But a problem as complex as gun violence has no easy villain. And there is a lot of work ahead. Our gun violence issue is a uniquely American disease, yet it is perhaps better described as a symptom of a much deeper illness. 
Pulling our brothers and sisters out of the mire that is 21st-century America will take more than tinkering around the edges. It will take a reshaping of our society into one that prioritizes the health and well-being of all who live here, not just the wealthiest and most influential among us.

Harris, 27, stayed on the pill until around 25 but decided to switch to an intrauterine device because of blood pressure issues — and politics.
Harris of Louisville is part of a nationwide surge in demand for long-term birth control since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022. 
Kentuckians told the Lantern they got intrauterine devices, better known as IUDs, because of concern that they would lose access to birth control under the Trump administration. Others got them to manage health conditions while some enjoy the comfort of having a long-term birth control method without having to take a daily pill.  
Among U.S. women ages 15-49 who use contraception, 10.5% used IUDs compared to 11.4% who chose the pill during 2022-2024. IUDs are highly effective at preventing pregnancy — more than 99%, according to Planned Parenthood. 
But for some this popular form of birth control comes with an unwelcome surprise: pain, sometimes extreme. The medical community is responding by offering more in-office treatments, though several patients said they weren’t effective enough. 
Several women interviewed by the Lantern described extreme pain during the procedure to insert the IUD into the uterus and said providers should employ — and insurers should pay for — better pain management, such as more effective numbing treatments and sedation.

They also said having the option for patient advocates to be in the room would be a welcome policy. 
“I was kind of scared into getting the IUD, I will say,” Harris said. “I was kind of frightened into it, at this point, because of the restrictions and limitations that are being put on women’s reproductive justice in this country every day.” 
She felt particular pressure being “a Black, queer person living in the South” and expressed concern over “if I got pregnant by a conservative dude.”  
Harris went to Planned Parenthood for the procedure and was offered over-the-counter ibuprofen, lidocaine and numbing cream for the pain. Even with lidocaine shots, the procedure was quite painful, Harris said. 
The doctor “definitely knew it was going to be painful, and she was trying her hardest to not be super blunt or s – – – – y about it,” Harris said. “But she did offer me several options for pain that … I didn’t even know they offered to women, and they probably don’t in some places.” 
‘We don’t want patients to avoid the procedure out of fears for pain.’ 
Pain associated with IUD insertion went viral on social media in 2024, prompting people to share their experiences undergoing the procedure and medical providers to take that pain more seriously. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance for pain management in August 2024. In July 2025, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists said there is “an urgent need for health care professionals to have a better understanding of pain-management options and to not underestimate the pain experienced by patients and for patients to have more autonomy over pain-control options during in-office procedures.” 
That organization, better known by the acronym ACOG, called for more research into the pain and directed doctors to have discussions with their patients about it. 
Even though patients say much more work remains, Kentucky medical providers are responding and taking pain during insertion more seriously. 



How do IUDs work? 
“There are two types of IUDs, which are small T-shaped devices placed in the uterus to prevent pregnancy: copper IUDs and hormonal IUDs. Copper IUDs work by releasing copper ions that are toxic to sperm. Hormonal IUDs work by thickening cervical discharge so that it’s difficult for sperm to make their way to an egg in the fallopian tubes. In some patients, the hormonal IUD can inhibit ovulation so no egg is released. Some IUDs can also be used as emergency contraception if they are inserted within five days of sexual intercourse.” — University of Chicago Medicine
“IUDs are 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. IUDs and contraceptive implants are the most effective kinds of reversible birth control available.” — Cleveland Clinic



Dr. Maria R Schweichler, an OB-GYN with Total Woman, which is part of Norton Women’s Care, said there are several options available to manage pain of IUD insertion, which varies in intensity person to person. 
Options include taking cytotec (misoprostol) the night before and the morning of the procedure to help soften the cervix and aid in the dilation process for patients who have never given birth vaginally or gone through labor; taking ibuprofen or Xanax; and doing the procedure during menstruation so dilation is easier. 
Doctors also have numbing lidocaine spray or a gel for the actual procedure, according to Schweichler. 
“In the worst-case scenario, people can have the procedure in the operating room with anesthesia,” she said. “However, this adds cost while an in-office procedure is covered by most insurance plans at 100%.” 
Some patients can get a paracervical block in the office, but this comes with “more risks because it involves an injection of a local anesthesia into the cervical stroma,” according to Schweichler. This block will also not help with cramping after the procedure. 
“IUDs can be a safe and effective form of birth control so we don’t want patients to avoid the procedure out of fears for pain,” Schweichler said. “Our goal is to work with patients to ensure the experience is as comfortable as possible.”

Planned Parenthood is working to be a leader in IUD pain management and routinely offers low-level sedation to patients getting IUDs. 
“Gone are the days where we believe that women do not feel pain when an IUD is inserted or removed,” said Rachel Brown, the area services director for Planned Parenthood who works in Kentucky and other states. 
Providers in the organization’s Kentucky locations are trained to offer paracervical blocks and low-level sedation. 
Planned Parenthood staff, she said, “really do want to be a leader in that care.” 
Ibuprofen or over-the-counter pain medication is enough for some people, Brown said, but not everyone. Sedation is both “medically possible” and “medically advisable,” she said, but insurance companies “often are the last to jump on board” and reimburse for it.  
Dr. Colleen McNicholas, the chief clinical transformation officer for the Planned Parenthood network that includes Kentucky, said the low-level sedation doesn’t involve putting patients into sleep as they would expect during surgery. 
“Sedation exists on a spectrum — local, minimal, moderate, deep and general,” McNicholas said. “In Kentucky, we currently offer local anesthesia — numbing medicine around the cervix — and minimal oral sedation, which helps patients feel calmer and more comfortable while remaining awake and responsive.” 
Still, there is a disconnect between what patients want and need to manage pain and what insurance companies consider necessary. 
“Insurance coverage varies by payor, but most plans do cover minimal sedation and a local paracervical block,” McNicholas said. “For patients who face additional out-of-pocket costs, Planned Parenthood works to bundle pricing so expenses are as transparent and affordable as possible.” 
The organization does this, Brown said, because “we don’t think that you should have to pay extra because you don’t want to feel pain during your procedure,” she said.

‘A lot of pain, a lot of blood’ 
Experiences with getting IUDs vary by person. The common theme women shared with the Lantern was that they were unprepared for the pain and while they enjoy the benefits of having an IUD, they wanted a better heads-up on what to expect during insertion. 
The lidocaine and numbing cream Harris was offered at Planned Parenthood were not pain management options offered to all the women who shared their IUD stories. Most said they were instructed to take over-the-counter pain medicines like ibuprofen for any pinching or discomfort, but that it was woefully inadequate to address their pain during insertion. 
Erin Bruker, 35, of Louisville, passed out during her insertion procedure. Her doctor had told her the IUD “goes in easy,” but that wasn’t her experience. 
“If I understood the pain, I would have definitely wanted something stronger than Advil,” Bruker said. 
LaDonna Murphy (Photo provided)
LaDonna Murphy of Lexington, decided to take her chances with cancer rather than endure the “trauma” of an unmedicated IUD insertion. 
She originally got an IUD in 2011 under anesthesia and with private insurance to help manage her endometrial hyperplasia, a condition that raises the risk of cancer. 
Murphy, 54, had Medicaid in 2017 when she had her IUD removed. The removal process went fine, but implantation of a new one never worked even after more than an hour of trying, she said. 
There was “a lot of pain, a lot of blood,” she recalled. “We took a break in the middle of it, and then finally, (the doctor) just said, ‘I don’t think I can get it in there.’”  
Her option at that point was to come back at a later date and try again with a new IUD. 
“It was so traumatic, I decided at that point to never have one implanted again. I just took my chances,” Murphy said. “Luckily for me, the hyperplasia has not returned, but at that point, I was willing to deal with it. To me, it was such a traumatic situation, I was willing to take the chance of getting cervical cancer over having to have that done without anesthesia.” 
After Murphy’s unsuccessful IUD insertion, she stopped receiving any gynecological care for four years. 
“I was not very trusting at that point,” she said. She said it would have helped if, after trying and failing to insert the IUD, her provider had said: “it’s not your fault” or showed compassion for her pain. But she left feeling stigmatized and alone.
She finally found an OB who showed her compassion and took his time with procedures, explained them well and supported her through them. That made all the difference. 
“Even if I had had a lot of pain in that one, I think I still would have felt better afterwards,” she said. “He was really good at making me feel like: However I react is okay.” 
Medical providers say everyone’s experience with the procedure is different, and there are a few pain management tools they can offer patients. The more effective tools, though, aren’t always covered by health insurance. 
Kentucky women who’ve gotten IUDs in recent years say that has to change. They also say they want medical providers to have honest conversations with their patients about the pain they could experience — what they’ll feel is often minimized as a “pinch” or “discomfort” when the reality is much worse. 
Louisville’s Jessica Thacker, 48, described her first IUD insertion procedure, which she estimates took about three minutes, as a “horrible” experience that left her lightheaded, pale and limping. 
“I had no idea how painful it was actually going to be,” she said. “I was at the point I was either going to pass out or ready to scream ‘stop!’ That’s how bad it was.”  
She appreciates that more organizations and providers are looking at policies to help with pain management. People, she said, “should not have to go through pain and even trauma by having this done just because that’s been the norm for so many decades.” 
Even with pain, several women said that if their doctor was more honest about how much insertion would hurt and showed compassion for the pain, it would be more bearable. 
Harris’ IUD experience was painful enough that she cried, despite being a “tattoo person” with a higher pain tolerance. The doctor showed compassion for the pain they felt during insertion, they said. 
“She even asked me before the procedure: ‘do you want me to talk you through the whole thing? Do you want me to tell you exactly what I’m doing? Do you want me to  distract you, or not talk to you at all?’” Harris said. “She was very accommodating and asked me exactly what I needed, if I wanted to put my feet in the stirrups or not. I feel like she did everything that she could to make me as comfortable with the resources and tools she’s been given.” 
What do insurance companies say? 
The Lantern reached out to spokespeople with several insurance providers in Kentucky — WellCare, Anthem, Humana Healthy Horizons, Aetna Better Health, United Healthcare Community Plan and Passport Health Plan by Molina asking for information about IUD pain management coverage. Most did not reply. 
Anthem spokesman Jeff Blunt said his company will “typically cover sedation associated with IUD insertion and removal when these procedures are billed as preventive services, resulting in no out-of-pocket cost to members.” 
“In cases where sedation is required due to complications, such as an IUD displacement, coverage is also available but may be subject to standard copayments, deductibles or other cost sharing based on the member’s specific plan,” Blunt said. “These claims may require additional documentation from the care provider.” 
Medicaid, the state-federal plan that covers 1 in 3 Kentuckians, or about 1.5 million people, will cover sedation “in instances where sedation is medically necessary to perform an IUD insertion,” a spokeswoman with the Cabinet for Health and Family Services said. She did not answer a follow-up query asking what constituted a medical necessity in this instance. 
A spokesperson for the Kentucky Association of Health Plans said Medicaid covers typical in-office pain relief. The association is the trade organization for the seven managed care organizations (MCOs) the state employs to process Medicaid claims.
“When a patient and clinician determine that additional sedation may be required, the request can be reviewed under federal medical-necessity rules by clinical specialists,” the spokesperson said. “Those reviews are based on the patient’s individual needs and circumstances, such as a previous difficult or unsuccessful insertion or personal or medical history.” 
Medicaid rules dictate, according to the Kentucky Association of Health Plans, that “sedation be covered when it is medically necessary and not billed for routine use when it is not. Medical necessity means the clinician provides a clinical reason that the additional level of pain support is appropriate for that specific patient.” 
In other words: Everyone’s case and pain management needs will be different. 
“There is no one-size-fits-all approach: some patients need little to no intervention, while others, especially those with prior trauma, may need a higher level of support to have an affirming experience,” McNicholas, the Planned Parenthood physician, said.
‘I was afraid that they would take away access’ 
Kimber Guinn, 34, has had four IUDs, the most recent of which was in March 2025. Her experiences have varied in the degree of pain.

Guinn’s previous IUD wasn’t due to be replaced until September 2026, but she said she felt pressure to reset her contraceptive clock because of the political climate.  
“I wanted to get it replaced sooner than eight years because of the Trump administration,” said Guinn, who is from Somerset and lives in Louisville. “I was afraid that they would take away access to birth control or do something weird.” 
After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, undoing the constitutional right to abortion, Guinn’s husband got a vasectomy. 
But she still wanted an IUD for a couple of reasons — she enjoyed not having a monthly period and she travels a lot. 
“My worry is always — even domestically, not just internationally, but anywhere — what if I get sexually assaulted and end up pregnant? That is my worst nightmare,” she said. “It’s been my biggest fear that that right to reproductive control will just be taken away.” 
With her current IUD, though, she has effective birth control until 2033.

My two table mates are eager to tell me their stories. They are both veterans, attending an Armed to Farm training for beginning farmers. One went out of her way to welcome me, fetching a chair from a nearby table.

Mary Martinez Rigo, 64, is older than most of the other attendees. She and her husband rehabilitated a former pine forest in Virginia into pasture for alpacas by literally drilling nutrients into the compacted clay. Her husband’s health is declining and she is at Armed to Farm with an eye to the future.
“I don’t want to give it up, and am looking to age gracefully in place as a farmer and a veteran,” she said. “I am looking to pivot from production to offering workshops.”

This November event was the 54th Armed to Farm, a program of the nonprofit National Center for Appropriate Technology. NCAT was founded during the energy crisis of the 1970s to develop energy saving strategies for underserved communities. In 1987, NCAT expanded its mission to include sustainable agriculture.
The week-long training events combine classroom instruction with in-depth farm tours. Experts, some of them veterans themselves, present on beekeeping, marketing, soil health, and agricultural law in the mornings. Afternoon tours provide for a close inspection of thriving small-scale agriculture operations and the chance to ask practitioners specific questions.
Participants begin by discerning goals for their farm. During the week they explore enterprises that could meet those goals. Some are aiming for profitability while others are seeking to be self-sufficient, grow a community garden in order to donate food, or operate a farm that trains other veterans.
The farm visits at the November event, held in Berea, Kentucky, exposed the group to aquaponics, horticulture, beekeeping, fruit and nut production, goat tending, retail operations, and seed saving. The Berea College Forest hosted a session on horse logging that drew a lot of interest.

Towanda Farrington got involved in farming through an equine program for veterans. She found that being outdoors and caring for animals helped her PTSD. She plans to operate her Mississippi-based vegetable and herb enterprises the old-fashioned way.
“I want to use a plow horse on my farm,” she said. “I got my horse from the Humane Society and like nurturing him as he nurtures me.”

Piloted in 2013 and launched in 2015, the Armed to Farm program has welcomed participants from 46 states. It has also proven highly successful; 83% of its thousands of graduates remain involved in farming. Some have gone on to leadership in community food system work.
Participants in this program gain much more than knowledge. Veterans face unique challenges, and being in a group with their former military peers creates an instant community. Participants feel safe to share their military experience in this nurturing environment, and program leaders are intent on accommodating their special needs.

Sean Judge was in a pivotal place in June 2019 when he attended his first Armed to Farm. With a PTSD diagnosis and recent surgeries to remove a tumor from his spinal cord, his physical restrictions dictated that he walk slowly and carry nothing over five pounds. Regardless, he felt like a full participant in the event.
“They asked about accommodations on the application and found a way for me to attend,” he said. “They never let go of me, even though they knew it would take a little bit for me to get there.”

Some attendees don’t know any other veterans interested in agriculture before Armed to Farm. They meet the teaching staff of NCAT, five of whom are veterans, who act as mentors and guides, and emerge connected to a supportive network they can call on in the months and years to come.
“Veterans having their own program is one of the biggest factors in [Armed to Farm’s] long-term success,” said Mike Lewis, a veteran and NCAT staff member. “I get at least four texts a week from graduates reaching out or asking technical farming questions.”
Veterans continue to benefit from NCAT resources after their Armed to Farm experience. Each receives a stack of books and pamphlets to take home, and can take advantage of networking and virtual learning opportunities. The advanced Armed to Farm 2.0 events provide a deeper dive into the business aspects of farming and scaling up production.
NCAT developed and operates Armed to Farm through a cooperative agreement with USDA-Rural Development. Each event relies on organizational partners for expertise and funding. Nonprofit Ranchin’ Vets offers a transportation stipend to participants. The Berea event was in partnership with Kentucky State University under one of their grant programs.
Looking to the future, Armed to Farm leaders hope to expand its reach. They are working on offering more enterprise-specific trainings, and hosting a tribal-focused Armed to Farm event.

(Photo by Jessica Kourkounis for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star)After long and difficult state budget negotiations ended without a plan to tax or regulate gambling devices that exist in a legal gray area, the leading maker of skill games across the nation is back in the public spotlight in Pennsylvania.
A Philadelphia jury recently returned a $15.3 million verdict in connection with the 2020 murder of a convenience store clerk against the software company and game maker that produce Pennsylvania Skill games 
Lawyers for Ashokkumar Patel’s estate argued his death during a robbery was attributable, in part, to the companies’ negligence in ignoring safety and security practices to protect their all-cash gambling operations. 
Patel’s fatal shooting in a broom closet at the Hazleton convenience store where he worked has been held out as evidence of the need to regulate slot machine-like games, which can be found in social clubs, taverns, gas stations and other businesses across the commonwealth.

The verdict against Georgia-based Pace-O-Matic and the Lycoming County business that builds the Pennsylvania Skill game machines came as the companies prepared to defend their business model before the state Supreme Court. 
On Thursday, the high court will hear arguments in an appeal by the Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General asserting that skill machines are functionally no different from casino slot machines and should be regulated under existing state law.
A lower state court upheld findings that because skill machines incorporate games that allow players to win back money they have lost, they’re not illegal under the commonwealth’s gaming laws. 
The attorney general’s office argues skill machines are recreations of traditional slot machines.
“They spin, play, and pay just like the modern electronic slot machines found in casinos today,” the office said in a court filing, adding the Commonwealth Court found they’re not slot machines because they include a “hidden” second game in which a player can win back their last bet plus a bonus of 20 cents, at most. The skill element is difficult to find and so long and tedious that few players use it, the attorney general’s office claims.
If allowed to stand, the Commonwealth Court’s en banc decision, stemming from a Pennsylvania State Police raid on a Dauphin County bar, could have a sweeping impact, the attorney general’s office said.
“These machines are proliferating across the state, in bars, in convenience stores, and even in casino-style gambling halls – all without any special licensing, regulation, or taxation. And under the lower court’s ruling that these slot machines are not slot machines, they could be placed anywhere at all, even in middle school cafeterias,” the office said in its brief.
State lawmakers have proposed legislation to regulate skill games, which they, and casino operators, say have no safeguards against children or problem gamblers using them and are a catalyst for crime in the communities where they’re placed.
Despite Gov. Josh Shapiro’s call in his February budget address to regulate and tax the machines as a badly needed new revenue stream, the state budget package passed Wednesday, 135 days late, without legislation to address skill games. 
As the June 30 budget deadline approached earlier this year, lawmakers pitched competing proposals. Shapiro proposed a 52% tax on the games’ gross revenue. Sen. Gene Yaw (R-Lycoming), whose district is home to Pennsylvania Skill game builder Miele Manufacturing, called for a 16% tax. Senate Republican leaders, meanwhile, pitched a compromise 35% tax.

Pace-O-Matic pressured lawmakers to back its preferred legislation, Yaw’s 16% tax. But the debate turned ugly as Pace-O-Matic accused Senate Republicans of threatening the company’s lobbying firm. And an out-of-state super PAC distributed flyers targeting senators who backed regulation legislation, Spotlight PA reported in June. A spokesperson for Pace-O-Matic told Spotlight it had nothing to do with the flyers.
Asked about the absence of skill machine legislation in the budget package signed into law this week, Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) and President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) said they recognized the need for regulation, but expressed frustration with the intensity of disagreements on the issue. 
“I believe there is some bipartisan interest in figuring this out,” Pittman said. “However, this building has a long history of going through gaming debates, and they are very complex and very tedious, very difficult.”
Ward added that she was angered by what she described as bullying by the skill games industry.
“The only people that aren’t going to like this budget are special interests. But we get threatened all the time by some of these interests,” Ward said. “We don’t do well being bullied. And I think a lot of these gaming interests have done nothing but try to bully us. … In the end, we’re not going to stand for that.”
Yaw told the Capital-Star he sees the regulatory scheme he proposed, along with the 16% tax and a $500 per machine state fee, as a jobs bill.
“Gov. Shapiro’s proposal at 50 some percent is going to kill the industry and it’s not going to generate any revenue, any income for the commonwealth,” Yaw said. “The power to tax is the power to destroy and taking at the rate that has been discussed will kill the industry.”
In addition to 200 jobs in his district, skill machines benefit thousands of workers across the state in bars, stores and clubs where the machines are located, because those businesses share in the revenue, he said.

“If any other senator came to me and said I have an issue in my district and it involves 200 jobs I would help with that,” Yaw said.
Others lawmakers simply want the machines gone. 
Sen. Amanda Cappalletti (D-Delaware) in 2023 sponsored a bill that would ban skill games outright. In a hearing in August of that year, witnesses said skill games are part and parcel of nuisance businesses in their communities, such as stop-and-go shops that sell liquor by the shot without liquor licenses. Others said the cash-based gambling machines were a magnet for crime.
That was the focus of the case attorneys Robert Zimmerman and John Lang presented on behalf of the murdered Hazleton convenience store clerk’s estate. 
Pace-O-Matic and Miele said in a statement Patel’s death is tragic and a terrible loss for his family. But spokesperson Michael Barley said the companies maintain they are not connected in any way to the actions of Patel’s killer. 
Although the jury apportioned only 20% of the liability between Pace-O-Matic and Miele, they plan to appeal what Barley described as numerous irregularities in the case. The remaining liability was attributed 55% to the gunman and 25% to the store’s owner, which settled out of court.
“The decisions rendered in this case set a dangerous precedent by establishing responsibility and liability for criminal activity with businesses that offer any product, service or software license at a location where a crime has occurred — even when there is little to no connection to the crime,” Barley said.
Patel, 50, was working at the Choice Food Mart to send money back to his family in India. The store had several skill machines manufactured by Pace-O-Matic and Miele and other makers. 
“Unlike casinos that have to follow extremely strict safety measures, where they have armed guards, state police on site, double-locked cashier cages … they are in convenience stores with none of those safety measures,” Zimmerman said in his opening statement. “The clerks in these stores have to handle thousands of dollars in cash to pay out the bettors and pay out collectors from the defendants’ enterprise.”
Patel’s killer ​​Jafet Rodriguez, who is now serving a life sentence, had lost about $6,700 playing the games in Patel’s store and knew that the store kept large amounts of money on hand, Zimmerman said. 
After Rodriguez was threatened by a drug dealer to whom he owed money, Rodriguez drove to the store where he pushed Patel into the closet and shot him in the neck, severing Patel’s tongue, which left him unable to call for help.
“Jafet Rodriguez had one goal.  He had one target. He went for one thing. He didn’t go for the cash register money. There was a key right in the cash register, didn’t bother. He went for the betting cash, just the betting cash,” Zimmerman said. “And the people at the bottom paid the ultimate price.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/skill-games-Somerset-County-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-17 05:57:03.754485

I suppose that means I’m overdue for an introduction. 
Saying where I’m “from” requires a lengthy explanation, because I’ve bounced around a few places. Though I was born and (mostly) raised in Utah, I call upstate New York home because that’s where I spent my high school and college years. 
I’m a proud graduate of St. Bonaventure University (#GoBonnies!) and a crafter who’s currently learning to knit — but also sews and crossstitches. I have cats and enjoy volunteering with my local community theater.

Follow me on Twitter or Bluesky. 

My first journalism job was in Mississippi, where I cut my teeth covering the minutiae of local government. There, I found a love for breaking down wonky, acronym-heavy documents into actionable information for the public. 
I come to the Capital-Star most recently from Indiana. I spent six years embedded in the state’s capital, reporting exclusively on statewide issues. I was part of the founding team that launched the Indiana Capital Chronicle, the Capital-Star’s sister publication under the States Newsroom umbrella. 
While there, I carved a niche for myself as a “Medicaid” reporter, mostly because I wanted to fill an information gap. But, also, because I love diving into any intersection between government and the people it serves. I reported extensively on state payments for children with complex medical diagnoses, a transition in home care services for elderly or disabled Hoosiers (and its waitlists), and the state’s Medicaid funding woes. 
Outside of health care, I was also the chief budget reporter and spearheaded our coverage in a highly contentious Republican primary.

Which is academically interesting, so long as you’re not the one in extreme pain. (Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)Pain comes with living. We all know that, and grow up with it. Sometimes pain is our quick warning to stop, sometimes a nagging caution to go easy and protect an injured part of the body. And as such, pain is a necessary part of healthy living. This feels good, this hurts … pay attention.
Pain also comes from accident, and disease. Unavoidable. And sometimes intractable. Screamingly so. Ruling the reality of a moment like a despot. And removing all the cultural graces and intelligence from human life in a heartbeat.
I have had three such incidents in my adult life, when pain dominated reality so forcefully. Once was when I wound up, a distance from home, beneath a horse. Left femur broken. Hours before I was found. Let’s just say the sound of sirens was sweet that day. And then, maybe a decade later, kidney stones appeared out of nowhere and rang that bell when they ask you to number your pain on a scale of 1 to 10. No doubt about it. Ten just got a huge promotion.
The third event was just recently, when I lifted something heavy on the farm. Suddenly too much for a back with 75 years of wear and tear. The pain getting worse by the day until finally an MRI provided the view of a chipped disc, bearing down on the sciatic nerve. Again ringing the bell, on some days at least, of a heavy 12 on the 10-scale for pain. 
The main pain-treatment difference this time has a lot to do with the Sacklers and the opioid epidemic they launched in their modern pursuit of uncountable wealth. Seriously felt in our region with more than a reasonable share of addicts and overdose fatalities. Such that we are now self-conscious, as a nation, about prescribed pain relief. Which is academically interesting, so long as you’re not the one in extreme pain. Because there’s apparently a lot of folks trying to get such prescriptions and faking the pain to achieve that end. Especially back pain, because it is pretty endemic to working humans, and hard to disprove. So, the common medical response seems to have defaulted to “He must be faking.”
In my first two events, opioid painkillers were readily prescribed. Because they are a CIVILIZED response to that rising crescendo of pain. But in this last instance, plodding NSAIDs were the limit. There were some days they were grudgingly sufficient, and some days they were savagely insufficient. I got through those days by falling back on some long-expired Tramadols we dug up in the downstairs medicine cabinet, residue from that ancient horse wreck. And Tramadol by my research is the weakest of the common opioids, by a long shot. One-tenth the strength of morphine. But it was enough to stop that impinged nerve root from its constant screaming into my ear. And bring some purpose and sanity back to my day. Relief, I believe, is the appropriate word.
But on that day I revisited the Spine Center and got the verdict of a chipped disc. I mentioned the inadequacy of NSAIDs and that my store of old Tramadols was about used up. And they were unwilling to prescribe an opioid of any type. Even with the strength of x-rays and an MRI testifying on my behalf. They did suggest that perhaps my family doctor could step in and do it in their stead. (He was gone on a medical mission to South America.) Instead they scheduled me for an epidural injection into the spine that would help with the pain, but due to great demand the earliest they could work me in was three weeks distant. O boy!
Luckily for me, there was also a chance my body would absorb the chip and the pain would eventually dissipate on its own. Which in my case occurred before the appointed epidural came about, which I canceled.
But my point is this: Since the billionaire Sacklers monetized a certain naivete in the narcotic Rx system, the pendulum for pain treatment has swung the other way. Wildly so. So that doctors are afraid of the consequences (and regulatory bother) of prescribing opioids. And genuine patients are constantly (and conveniently) being profiled as drug seekers. Even when the demographics don’t fit. And the medical evidence doesn’t fit. Such that pain too often reigns in individual lives, when much more civilized solutions exist. And normal folks are forced into very abnormal, and painful, outcomes. (Dare I say savage?) Largely because a certain percentage of the population can’t control themselves, and doctors can’t or won’t parse the difference. 
(A possible apology to doctors: because I never saw one at the Spine Center. My entire experience there relied on “go-between” PAs, which is fast becoming the norm in American health care. And PAs can’t write narcotic prescriptions. But they DO have doctors above and around them who can. And they certainly could have made the necessary introductions.
Until I know differently, I am sorely tempted to characterize those out-of-sight doctors as cowardly. And inclined to advise all you normal non-addicts out there to think twice before disposing of those unused portions of your old-fashioned opioid prescriptions. Your rainy day may be closer than you realize.)",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2214163374-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-17 05:57:03.754485

(Photo by Pixabay/Creative Commons license)After four years of stalled efforts and repeated vetoes from outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Virginia lawmakers now see a clear path to finally standing up a legal adult-use cannabis market.
During her campaign, Democrat Abigail Spanberger, elected governor two weeks ago, pledged to sign legislation establishing a regulated retail system — reversing the impasse that kept marijuana sales in limbo since Virginia legalized possession and home cultivation in 2021. 
Lawmakers and advocates say the absence of a retail structure has fueled an unregulated market increasingly dominated by illicit operators.
At its next meeting on Dec. 2, the Joint Commission on the Future of Cannabis Sales, which the legislature created earlier this year, will roll out its finalized proposal for a retail framework it hopes the General Assembly will pass during the 2026 session. If lawmakers send the bill to Spanberger’s desk early next year, sales could begin as early as fall 2026.
The legislation will be carried by Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, the commission’s chair, and Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg.
Krizek told The Mercury in an interview last week that Spanberger’s election removed the biggest roadblock lawmakers had faced to date. 
He said the outcome was “a good day for public safety and for communities disproportionately affected by cannabis prohibition,” and a chance to finally direct tax revenue toward priorities such as job training and education. By contrast, he said, “It was a bad day for organized crime in the illicit cannabis market.” 
After years of pushing a bill under a governor “that was unwilling to discuss it at all and just vetoed our bill,” he said lawmakers now have the opportunity they have been waiting for.
“We’ve got to stand up this legal marketplace sooner rather than later,” Krizek said.
 Final proposal pending

At the December meeting, Krizek said, the commission will present a proposal that incorporates months of stakeholder testimony and adjustments intended to strengthen equity provisions and improve opportunities for small growers.
He described the legislation as one that “addresses the historical injustice” and adds new programs to earlier drafts, including guaranteed shelf space at medical cannabis dispensaries for micro-enterprise farmers once adult-use sales begin. 
“There’s going to be a lot of new and interesting programs and good stuff in there that will help create a well-regulated market that’s going to be good for everybody,” he said.
Joint cannabis commission holds first meeting amid push for regulated market

Krizek expects meaningful but not sweeping revisions to earlier proposals — changes “around the edges” based on feedback from stakeholders and the public. 
The extra time created by Youngkin’s opposition, he added, allowed lawmakers to refine the legislation. “The only good thing that the current governor has done for us is he has given us more time to perfect this bill,” Krizek said. 
But organized crime, Krizek said, “has had time to get a stranglehold on sales,” making it essential for the state to move quickly while still giving the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority enough time to roll out the marketplace. 
He noted that the strong election results and lessons learned from the commission’s hearings will shape the bill, and he expects those hearings to continue for at least the next two years.
Spanberger said in an interview with The Mercury in August that she would sign the commission’s proposal. 
“I support a legal marketplace for cannabis,” she said at the time. “I want to ensure that it is fully regulated, people know what they’re buying, and revenues go towards education.”
The commission’s summer hearings — its first round of work since its creation — included presentations on public safety, market structure, licensing and regulatory models. 
 A long path to legalization

Virginia legalized simple possession and home cultivation in 2021 under Democratic control and then-Gov. Ralph Northam. But creating a retail market required a second vote under the state’s reenactment clause. 
When Republicans took the House in 2022 and Youngkin expressed opposition to commercial marijuana sales, the process stalled. Still, lawmakers sent multiple versions of a retail bill to Youngkin, who vetoed every proposal, including the one he received earlier this year.
With no legal retail option, unregulated storefronts and delivery services proliferated. Local officials have raised concerns about public safety and product testing, and law enforcement agencies have struggled to distinguish legal CBD products from illegal THC imports. But the refined proposal aims to create a regulated, equitable market after years of uncertainty.

 CCA launches new medical cannabis portal

As lawmakers prepare for a broader retail system, the CCA last week rolled out a new online portal to streamline medical cannabis certification.
“The new CCA Portal was designed with practitioners and patients in mind,” the agency said in a news release. The platform, which is mobile-friendly, “offers stronger protection for personal information, safeguards against fraud, and provides a simpler process,” while maintaining clear records of every change.
Jamie Patten, the CCA’s acting head and chief administrative officer, called the upgrade “a major step forward for Virginia’s medical cannabis program. It’s safer, faster, and easier to use, and it helps us better protect patient information while supporting the integrity of the program.”
Patients will now receive email instructions to view, save or print their certification for dispensary visits. Practitioners can print certifications as needed.
 Federal hemp restrictions unlikely to affect Virginia’s plans

A continuing resolution passed by Congress last week included an agriculture appropriations bill that effectively shut down much of the U.S. hemp industry by reinstating stricter federal enforcement — a move that analysts say reverses the flexibility created under the 2018 Farm Bill.
But Krizek said the federal action does not affect Virginia’s push for adult-use marijuana sales.
“Our legislation is not a hemp bill,” he said. “This is creating a formalized and legal adult marijuana marketplace.”
Cannabis equity advocates say Spanberger’s victory opens the door for stronger protections against market consolidation and more robust investments in communities disproportionately harmed by prohibition.
Chelsea Higgs Wise, co-founder of Marijuana Justice, said the final bill should ensure fair competition by sequencing applications and limiting canopy size for pharmaceutical processors so they cannot dominate the market at launch. 
The legislation should set a uniform Jan. 1, 2027 start date, Wise said, so Virginia entrepreneurs can compete on equal footing, rather than allowing medical operators an early-sales advantage. 
She also urged lawmakers to clearly define what “equal and meaningful opportunity” means in licensing and ensure patient access is protected as the adult-use market comes online.
Wise also called for stronger equity provisions, including updated language that explicitly acknowledges the harm of past prohibition and commits to repairing it through impact licenses, reinvestment programs and measurable small-business ownership goals. 
Lawmakers should include micro-licenses, delivery options, nursery and craft licenses, event permits, and direct-to-consumer sales opportunities for small cultivators, Wise further suggested. She supports a 10,000-plant cap to prevent consolidation by major operators and says half of the Cannabis Equity Reinvestment Fund should go to the Equity Business Loan Fund.
With Spanberger set to take office in January and Democrats maintaining the legislature, lawmakers say Virginia is finally positioned to finish the work that began in 2021.
“We’re going to make some real positive progress,” Krizek said. “This is the opportunity we’ve been waiting for.”

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)State senators are considering asking representatives from the University of Virginia to meet with lawmakers in Richmond after school leaders signed an agreement with the federal government to suspend multiple civil rights investigations, sparking opposition from legislators, alumni and faculty. 
The news comes days after Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger asked the university’s board to wait until she’s in office before selecting a new president, and after former President Jim Ryan’s account of the process that led to his resignation was published Friday. Ryan wrote that his ouster, amid downward pressure from federal officials, “still feels surreal and bewildering.”
Ryan said Rector Rachel Sheridan and Vice Rector Porter Wilkinson worked with the Department of Justice and Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office in pressuring him to resign during the federal agency’s investigations. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to the claims.
 UVA issues may be on the agenda of senators’ meeting

During the spring, the U.S. Department of Justice initiated its investigation of the institution due to its concerns that UVA was violating federal civil rights laws in its admissions, hiring, diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and that its campus culture was inhospitable to Jewish students; the school refuted all these allegations. 
The claims conflicted with President Donald Trump’s executive orders aimed at reforming universities to align with his administration’s views.
UVA, Department of Justice agree to pause civil rights investigations

The situation drew national scrutiny and criticism close to home, with Democratic lawmakers now considering calling the university’s board members to account in the near future. 
Last month, Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, asked Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Higher Education, to consider calling UVA leaders to Richmond. His district encompasses the institution.
During the same time, Del. Katrina Callsen, D-Albemarle, and Deeds wrote a letter to UVA Interim President Paul Mahoney and the Board of Visitors expressing their disappointment with the decision and calling for them to reverse “this surrender of institutional autonomy and reject further federal interference.”
“I’m not doing anything right now, but not that I won’t,” Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Higher Education, said to the Mercury in an interview last week. 
Locke said her colleagues will discuss higher education in Virginia and other subjects at a Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee retreat at Radford University beginning on Thursday. She said the discussion could help determine the Senate’s next steps.
The Mercury asked Sens. Chris Head, R-Botetourt, and Todd Pillion, R-Washington, who sit on the subcommittee, for comment. They did not immediately respond. 
The retreat will convene Thursday and Friday at Radford. 
 Incoming and outgoing governors weigh in

The institution is also navigating calls from Spanberger to suspend its search for a new president until vacant seats on the governing board are filled, likely not until this upcoming General Assembly Session. In her letter, Spanberger claimed the board members “severely undermined” the public’s confidence in their abilities.
Youngkin said Spanberger is attempting to interfere with the hiring process and jumping to conclusions.
“It’s dangerous to wrongfully disparage committed individuals who volunteer to serve on university boards and the serious work they do,” Youngkin wrote in a letter. “Further, the governor of the commonwealth should speak thoughtfully and honor the service of those individuals.” He recommended that the school not delay the process.

 DOJ investigations background

To suspend the DOJ investigations, UVA agreed to comply with civil rights laws and to provide quarterly reports to the government on its compliance efforts.
If UVA fails to make “sufficient progress” toward compliance with the DOJ, it will have 15 days to address the issues before the agreement is terminated and investigations resume.
Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, and Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, signed a letter to Rector Rachel Sheridan and Mahoney asking them to reconsider the agreement and to “defend the University’s autonomy, Virginia’s sovereignty, and the constitutional limits on federal power.” 
“Thomas Jefferson founded this University to be a beacon of enlightenment and independence,” the senators stated. “It should not become a cautionary tale of capitulation to federal overreach.”
In response, UVA leaders doubled down on their decision, saying the school suspended costly and disruptive investigations, avoided financial and operational risks, preserved institutional autonomy and academic freedom, and that compliance does not require major changes.
UVA leaders said they had “not given up any administrative, statutory, or constitutional protections” after signing the agreement, and said the agreement would allow UVA to litigate only if and when the DOJ’s interpretation of the law diverges from UVA’s policies.

(Photo by Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)Montgomery County, Maryland, is considering exporting its large volume of trash — and the resulting pollution — to a landfill in Virginia. In September, the County issued a request for proposals to long-haul and landfill the county’s approximately 600,000 tons of annually generated waste. County Executive Marc Elrich has long pushed to close the county’s trash incinerator. 
This crucial decision involves complicated environmental, public health, equity and cost tradeoffs, and Montgomery County lacks vital pieces of information. We have summarized what we know and what we don’t know in a report posted by Friends of Sligo Creek, an NGO based in Takoma Park, Maryland.
With respect to equity, a 1995 report from the Virginia General Assembly’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission showed that many of Virginia’s landfills—especially private regional ones—are located in marginalized communities that are disproportionately African American. By contrast, the rural area near Montgomery County’s incinerator is well-off and disproportionately white (75% white alone, as compared with 40% for the whole county). 
A recent, yearslong battle over siting a new mega-landfill in Cumberland County, which is 33% African American, underscores the vulnerability of Virginia’s Black Belt areas to the advances of landfill companies. A prime concern of Cumberland County’s residents was the landfill’s proximity to the historically Black Pine Grove School. Despite sustained citizen protests, this summer the Cumberland County Board of Supervisors approved a permit for a down-sized landfill footprint.
Cumberland County is among the Virginia localities that have agreed to site regional landfills because those jurisdictions are cash starved. Landfill companies pay them host fees and provide waste disposal.
Montgomery County, Maryland, is far from cash starved. But dueling estimates cloud the county’s waste management cost picture.
The county’s 2025 contractor report projects that, in the long term, even with needed upgrades, using the incinerator would be cheaper than landfilling. In 2024, the facility–also called a resource recovery facility, or RRF–generated $24 million in revenues from sales of electricity and recovered metals. Closing the incinerator would mean losing those revenues, generating that electricity from another source and burying metals that, when recycled, save energy and reduce greenhouse gas pollution relative to using virgin materials. 
However, county staff maintain that, in the short term, the landfill-plus-incinerator-closure option would be cheaper than continuing to operate the incinerator. They argue that the incinerator’s expenses would divert resources from efforts to decrease the county’s waste stream and that paying for landfilling on a per ton basis would incentivize waste reduction. But the county has not estimated closure costs for the incinerator.
On the environmental and public health side of the equation, the incinerator’s air pollution controls appear to be working well. The county’s solid waste plan says, “Several health-risk assessment studies have concluded that there are no measurable influences on ambient air concentrations attributable to RRF source emissions.” 
According to information provided by the Maryland Department of the Environment, the incinerator operates well within its permitted air pollution limits and, except for hydrogen chloride, within the Biden Administration’s proposed stricter standards for waste incinerators.
But the incinerator’s ash, a source of toxic metals, currently goes to a Richmond, Virginia, landfill whose surrounding community is 70% African American. County staff say the ash is stabilized so that it remains non-hazardous and that it is tested regularly.
Nearby jurisdictions have arrived at a different ash disposal option. Arlington County, Fairfax County, and the city of Alexandria use an ash monofill, a type of facility that’s designed to prevent the release of metals. That monofill is located in Lorton, Virginia.
In extending the life of their incinerator to 50 years, Arlington and Alexandria said, “it was found to be economically beneficial for both jurisdictions.” They also cited the “stellar” environmental record of the facility. Although incinerators can divert materials from recycling, Arlington and Alexandria report strong recycling rates (53% in 2023), as does Montgomery County (45% in 2022).
Incinerators kill pathogens, but they produce carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Still, our analysis indicates that landfilling the county’s waste could produce much higher amounts of greenhouse gases than the county’s waste incinerator. That’s because landfills emit methane, an especially potent greenhouse gas.
Landfills harbor pathogens. They produce copious amounts of air and water pollution, for decades. Landfill gases contain carcinogens like benzene and vinyl chloride. Landfill leachate (garbage “juice”) is contaminated with many chemicals, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency has said that even the best protected landfills will eventually leak. The Shoosmith mega-landfill in Chester, which has been identified as a potential recipient of Montgomery County’s trash, generates almost 400,000 gallons of leachate per week, according to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. That landfill is in bankruptcy proceedings.
Here are some important unknowns for Montgomery County: The likely substantial costs for closing the county’s incinerator and remediating its site; what it would cost to send the incinerator’s ash to a different disposal site; and, what it would cost to extend the life of the incinerator, because no proposal request has been issued to that end. For the landfill option, we don’t know what the impacts on the county’s transfer station might be or whether the county might be liable for landfill contamination problems. 
Montgomery County’s council members say we must keep all options open and express deep unease with — or outright opposition to — exporting our trash. The principles of proximity and self-sufficiency encourage the treatment of waste close to its point of origin. Maryland is already the leading out-of-state contributor to Virginia’s trash imports.
But the council has not scheduled a public hearing. 
Council members and the public deserve to see the full cost, environmental and public health picture, and the council must invite input from affected citizens in both Maryland and Virginia.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)November is National Family Caregivers Month, a time to honor the 63 million Americans who care for loved ones. I can’t think of anyone who deserves that recognition more than you, Mom. Do you remember when I was a child and I said I wanted to live with you forever? You swore I’d change my mind; you said I’d grow up and want to be with my friends. I thought you were crazy.

Truthfully, we were both right. I did eventually want to live independently. I longed to be a mom, making fun memories with my own kids, then dropping them off at their grandma’s house for even more excitement. Missing out on that experience has been a crushing blow. Nevertheless, I can’t imagine a happier, more peaceful home than the one we’ve shared for the past 42 years.

But preschool Nikki never thought “living together forever” would mean you’d be my lifelong caregiver. I never considered my capable, athletic body could fail at all, let alone require about 20 neurosurgeries. That fiercely independent child never envisioned being unable to work or carry out normal daily activities. I was merely picturing an eternity of quiet lunches followed by us hanging out together, just having a good time.

OK, maybe I did nail that part of the vision…

I’ve been thinking a lot about that childhood conversation lately. I bet you wished you could freeze time and keep me forever. Funny how the universe grants wishes with a twist of fate. I’ve been a permanent fixture in your household, but at quite a financial, physical, and emotional cost to you.

A caregiver’s work is tireless and thankless. You’re always there when I need you. Even when you’ve just sat down and I know you want to stay there, you never complain if I need a snack, water, medicine, or a hot pack. You’ve mastered the “Nikki handbook” so well you can anticipate my needs. I know how much brainpower that takes and how exhausting it gets when my condition throws you curveballs. You never stop trying, though.











I’ve been a permanent fixture in your household, but at quite a financial, physical, and emotional cost to you.



You play through the pain — literally — pushing your aching body to do chores it’s no longer built for and staying awake when fatigue is making your eyes heavy. I’ve seen you care for me through illnesses and injuries when I know all you really wanted was someone to take care of you. You’ve rescheduled your own medical appointments and taken hits to your mental health. But you do it willingly, frequently telling people you know my suffering is far worse than yours. Only you show me that level of consideration.

I’m so grateful for your amazing network of friends. But your already infrequent plans will be canceled on moment’s notice if something is wrong with me. I wish you all didn’t have to be so accommodating.

I have watched helplessly as you sacrificed your entire life to prolong and protect mine. You’ve stood by me through every surgery. But as impressive as the critical moments sound, the bigger demonstration of strength and loyalty has been your daily devotion — making good on your promise never to abandon me. You didn’t think twice about prioritizing my wellbeing over your financial security, so you now have none. Unlike many of your peers, you don’t own a home or take even modest vacations. You’re rarely able to spend a day at the beach.

You get frustrated, but not with me. I am so grateful for that. You’re instead exasperated with life and with those who don’t see or understand what you’re going through. This letter is my way of finally reassuring you, I see it all. I understand your struggles and frustrations. I appreciate everything you do, and I love you so much for it.

RICHMOND, Va. – Virginia became the 33rd state to elect a female governor, but the recent race was a rare instance where the two candidates were both women — just the 11th time in the U.S. since 1986.
Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger will be inaugurated in January after a decisive victory that was declared by the Associated Press within an hour of the polls closing. The lieutenant governor’s race also made history on at least two fronts: a woman succeeding another woman in the position and the first Muslim woman in the U.S. elected to a statewide seat.
The election also increased women’s representation in the Virginia House of Delegates.
Forty-two women were elected to House seats, which surpassed the current record of 34, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. Four Democratic women replaced a Republican male incumbent in districts that lean Republican.
Democrats sweep Virginia’s statewide races, reclaiming full control of executive branch

While more women now hold office, they still continue to fight against double standards and additional scrutiny that their male counterparts do not face, according to experts who study women and politics.
The increase in female leadership reflects a few things, according to Hollie Mann, an assistant professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University.
 Why more representation?

A huge influx of female candidates at all levels of government ran for office after Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential bid in 2016, according to Mann. More women are also activated to run for office by national issues such as a rollback on reproductive freedom, education concerns and rising gun violence.
Spanberger and her opponent Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears were not the first women to run for the governor’s office in Virginia.
Virginia had two very close opportunities to have a woman as governor before, according to J. Miles Coleman, media relations coordinator at The Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.
Emily Couric, sister of journalist Katie Couric, was a former state senator representing the Charlottesville area and former chair of the Virginia Democratic Party. She planned to run for lieutenant governor alongside Mark Warner in 2001, but dropped out of the race after a diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic cancer. She died in October of that same year.
“I could have easily seen her becoming governor at some point,” Coleman said.
Before Couric, two-term Attorney General Mary Sue Terry ran in 1993 as the Democratic nominee for governor. In the same year, Democratic president Bill Clinton had a very low approval rating, and federal issues can impact state elections, according to Coleman.
Terry had a more masculine appearance and there were rumors surrounding her sexuality that could also explain her loss, according to Mann.
Regardless of why Terry lost, it took over 30 years to have another woman on the ballot, although U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan ran in 2021 but lost the primary to former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe.
Spanberger in her victory speech thanked the women who came before her, and “Mary Sue Terry in particular.”
 Governance and gender 

Voters hold women to different standards the higher they climb politically, according to Mann. The expectations change for positions such as governor, attorney general and congresswoman, compared to city council or school board seats.
“They have to walk a finer line between conforming to our standards with respect to gender and conforming to our standards and expectations with respect to leadership, which are often at odds,” Mann said.
Both gubernatorial candidates leaned into their previous service records as a way to show their toughness. Earle-Sears, a Marine veteran, posed with an assault-style rifle during her campaign for lieutenant governor. Spanberger, the first former CIA officer to be elected as governor, was able to highlight her service record while assuring supporters she would sign gun safety measures.
A majority of people report that the gender of a government leader is irrelevant, according to Pew Research Center. However, of people who do acknowledge gender differences, 39% said a woman would be better at working out compromises and 37% said a woman would be better at maintaining a respectful tone in politics.
Women tend to have a relational style of politics that is less combative and antagonistic than their male counterparts, according to Mann.
“This is true for both Republican and Democratic senators and congresswomen and governors,” Mann said. “They tend to, not always, certainly not always, govern in a more cooperative fashion.”
Spanberger served as a congresswoman from 2019 to 2025, becoming the first Democrat to win Virginia’s 7th District in nearly 50 years. She was ranked the most bipartisan Virginia member of Congress in 2024.
Traits like assertiveness and leadership have historically been more associated with men than women according to Kelly Dittmar, the director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics. A female candidate has to prove she can meet those stereotypically masculine credentials in a way that men likely do not have to do.
But gendered expectations among women can differ even by race, according to Dittmar.
“So Black women are going to be evaluated differently than Latinas, who are going to be evaluated differently depending on if they’re Republicans or Democrats,” Dittmar said.
Historically, people have questioned women’s expertise in defense and national security issues, according to Dittmar. These issues were assumed to be an area of male strength. Spanberger leaned into her domestic and international counter-terrorism service record on the campaign trail.
On the flip side, women are expected to show compassion and empathy, Dittmar said. That can give them an advantage, because they do not have to work as hard to project those traits as a man might.
When women have more presence in local, state and federal government, they bring new perspectives to policy making, according to Dittmar. Women will hold 40% of seats in Virginia’s 140-seat state legislature in 2026, making it more representative than Congress.
Women also often bring other marginalized voices into political conversations, Dittmar said.
“It does actually make a difference that young girls see women in positions of leadership,” Dittmar said. “But not even just young girls — boys, men and women see a woman in this high-level executive decision-making position and hopefully see her doing it well.”
Voters at polling places throughout Central Virginia had reactions that ranged from Virginia was long overdue for a female governor, to “sex does not mean anything.”
Henrico County voter Kevin Cutro was excited to choose between two female gubernatorial candidates, especially since he has a daughter.
Emily Breeden thought it was “awesome” to have an election between two women, even though she strongly disagreed with one candidate.
“It’s so nice to know that no matter what happens … that there’s going to be a woman in office,” Breeden said.

(Getty Images)If you make a living telling stories, the narrative is never far from your focus. So when I read that members of the House of Representatives were “racing” back to Washington to vote on a measure that would reopen a shuttered U.S. government, I giggled.
Imagine: Nebraska’s House trio in a heated competition against the other 432 House members to get there first. Of course, after being adjourned for 53 days one wondered if they knew where to go.
As we know, the feds reopened for business per the Congress’s vote, but “racing” pols was not the lasting image that I took away from the the longest government shutdown on record, a sketchy achievement, which, given this body’s penchant for capitulation, may again be in play sometime after Jan. 30, 2026, the expiration date on the new continuing resolution, as oxymoronic as that sounds. The Senate was already in D.C, but, if we extend the metaphor, went nowhere for the longest time.
None of which was the most searing story from our latest stint in the monkey barrel that is sometimes Washington politics. Nor was it the shutdown’s impact on air travel, the furloughing of public servants who make the federal government work or even the Epstein sewage all the while bubbling beneath the surface .
For me, the lasting imprint will be the callous vigor with which this administration went after SNAP benefits, government assistance that feeds children, the elderly, the disabled and the working poor. That process included the White House appealing court decisions that would have forced it to use available funds to disburse SNAP payments.
The government has reopened, but the pause of benefits, which sent SNAP recipients scrambling to feed themselves and their children, added an extra layer of uncertainty to already food insecure households.
Perhaps the administration had a legal argument, but they sure as hell didn’t have a moral one.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
You’re right, the optics don’t always tell the story. This one did: A government fighting to avoid feeding its most vulnerable. Moreover, it’s time we finally bury for good the reliable and racist trope that Americans who need government assistance to eat are “welfare queens,” Ronald Reagan’s 1976 reference to a Black woman from Chicago who devised schemes to defraud the government. 
He used the stereotype to argue that welfare abuse was rampant, reasoning that continues today. If you’re keeping score at home, here are U.S. Department of Agriculture numbers reported by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities: Of the one in eight Americans, nearly 42 million people, who use SNAP benefits, more than 62 percent of program participants are in families with children.  
More than a third are in families with members who are older adults or are disabled. Thirty-eight  percent are in working families. And according to a number of studies, the vast majority of those who can, work, a new proof of citizenship and employment requirement — nods to “welfare queen” logic — as of October notwithstanding.
That breaks down to 1 in 13 Nebraskans using SNAP benefits, 155,000 of our neighbors. Sixty-eight percent of Nebraska SNAP participants are in families with children, 30 percent are in families with members who are older adults or are disabled, and, like the national average, 38 percent are in working families.
If you wonder how nearly four in 10 working families still require assistance to put food on the table, the answer has less to do with government benefits and more to do with what we consider a “living wage.” Obviously, each individual family’s budget varies, but just as “welfare queen” is a broad and wildly inaccurate brush, we need a better understanding of what exactly is a “living wage,” especially when astronomically wealthy corporations such as Walmart, McDonald’s and Amazon employ the highest numbers of SNAP recipients.
Some really smart people have been unable to bridge the gulf that seemingly divides us politically. That chasm has now, apparently, reached a depth that means we’d rather watch children go hungry than yield any leverage.
Perhaps one day we’ll tame such mulish intransigence. Perhaps not. None of it will matter, however, if our moral compasses are askew. One obvious plot line of this shutdown, this power play of politicians, was clearly food … and those who would go without it. When that happened, we ceded whatever humane high ground on which we believed to be standing. 
Not a good look for the richest nation on earth.

Dozens of people bundled up in coats gathered at the back of the High Street Congregational church in Auburn Thursday morning, forming lines for food boxes and browsing through folding tables of free clothes and books.

Half a dozen people who didn’t have numbers gathered around that table, including Stacey Bailey, who goes to the food pantry every week. 
Once a month, Bailey is one of the 65 people chosen to receive a box full of pantry items, produce and meat. But even when she’s not, she still shows up and stands around that circular table to supplement weekly meals for her family. On Thursday morning, Bailey was able to fill two Hannaford freezer totes full of food from the extras table.
Once her bags were full, Bailey passed around bread, chicken salad and squash to others standing around the leftover table until the food pantry started wrapping up for the week. 
“It’s the best thing around here,” she told another man who walked up to the table a few minutes before the pantry closed, passing him food as a church volunteer handed him bags to fill. “It feels friendly around this table.”
Bailey receives federal food assistance, but about a year ago, she started to notice her Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program money was not enough to feed her family, including her two children. That’s when she started her weekly trip to the pantry.
“SNAP is only so much a month, and it goes quick. I also have to use that for Thanksgiving this month,” she said, standing in the church parking lot. “This place is consistently helpful. I’d recommend anyone who needs help to show up.”
Marcel Turcotte, who volunteers at the food pantry and cooks the Sunday night meals, said he’s seen more and more people show up in recent weeks, including to try their luck at the leftover table. 
“That’s supposed to be a supplement, but for some of them, it is all they get,” he said.
The High Street church feeds about 70 people a week, in addition to offering a prepared dinner on the third Sunday of the month. But like most other food pantries in Maine, the uncertainty with SNAP benefits over the last month, increasing grocery prices and holidays coming up has meant an unprecedented demand. There are more than 500 people signed up to receive meals, according to Debbie Duval, the church’s pastor.
Food pantries report increase in donations
In an effort to meet the increased need, local businesses, restaurants and grocery stores have also stepped up to offer free meals or donations to the church in recent weeks, Duval said.
That’s also true for Preble Street, the Portland-based nonprofit that operates a homeless shelter and a food pantry and kitchen for prepared meals. The organization recently expanded its pantry and capacity for prepared meals with the opening of a Food Security Hub, days before demand skyrocketed.
In October, Preble Street sent out 1,066 food boxes to its partners throughout southern Maine, including homeless shelters, recovery centers, mental or behavioral health facilities like Spurwink Services and Opportunity Alliance, and wellness shelters such as Elena’s Way. The organization noticed the demand for boxes increasing each week throughout the month, and the total boxes distributed was 200 more than September, according to Danielle Smaha, senior director of communications for the nonprofit.
The organization has also dramatically increased the number of prepared meals they’re offering every day to 2,600, which are driven to shelters, recovery organizations and other partners who need them, Smaha said.
Corresponding with the increased demand, Preble Street has seen a sharp increase in community contributions, with people dropping off bags of pasta and bottled sauce outside the food hub in South Portland, or through food drives at political events, like U.S. senate candidate Graham Platner’s recent town hall, which collected 1,100 pounds of canned goods to donate to Preble Street, according to advocacy director Terence Miller.
“The crisis was politically created,” Miller said, walking through Preble Street’s food pantry while volunteers and employees assembled custom food boxes. “And it created this outpouring of the best of humanity. But it didn’t have to be like that.”
Food pantries accommodating for choice

Preble Street’s pantry is accessible to caseworkers who deliver boxes directly to their clients, and can accommodate a vast variety of food preferences or dietary restrictions, including gluten free, vegan, kosher or halal options, said Linda Hogan, a volunteer who assembled boxes on Thursday afternoon.
“Here we have great variety, and we’re able to respond to people with cultural needs, with diet needs or just give people what they want, like it might be a chocolate cake for a birthday,” she said.
“We have people that are in recovery from illness or trauma, and we have great variety to respond to their cultural needs or diet needs, and get them what they want.”
As Hogan was finishing up box assembly, Sabina Montminy was walking through wire racks of food with a list and a shopping cart. It was Montminy’s second consecutive day at the food pantry to supplement groceries for the families she represents as a caseworker for Spurwink.
Some families and people she works with regularly need assistance through the food pantry in addition to their SNAP benefits, but recently, almost everyone she works with has had to rely on the Preble Street pantry more, she said. 
That has meant two or three visits a week for Montminy to fill up shopping carts of canned goods, pantry items, dairy, and even pre-made sandwiches for her clients, she said. The Preble Street pantry’s size and variety means her clients’ needs — from including pre-made food for unhoused clients and snacks for families with kids — can be met.  
“This place is great, and it’s given a lot of my clients autonomy, because they’re allowed to have choices,” she said. “It’s really nice that people are allowed to sort of have their preferences because not everything works for everybody.”

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)A proposal to deregulate New Hampshire’s meat market could defy federal food safety laws and carry risks for farmers and consumers, lawmakers acknowledge. But members of the House Environment and Agriculture Committee voted to support it anyway, saying those risks are acceptable if the move helps alleviate a statewide slaughterhouse bottleneck taking a toll on smaller farms.
House Bill 396, as amended, would allow the in-state sale of certain meat, including beef, pork, sheep, and goat, that was slaughtered and processed without the U.S. Department of Agriculture inspection required under federal law. Farmers, it stipulates, must sign a form acknowledging the risks and add labels to the meat they sell specifying that it was not federally inspected. 
The proposal has divided stakeholders and ignited debate about how best to protect both consumers and New Hampshire’s local food system.
“This has to start somewhere, and if it has to start in New Hampshire, so be it,” said prime sponsor Rep. Barbara Comtois, a Barnstead Republican, just before the House Environment and Agriculture Committee voted, 9-3, on Nov. 12 to recommend the bill for passage in the upcoming session.
A seasonal crunch
Farmers and legislators backing the proposal characterized it as a bold approach to dealing with a shortage of USDA slaughterhouses they said is limiting New Hampshire farms. 
Federal food safety laws require that meat sold commercially in the United States is inspected and approved by the USDA or a state agency working in partnership with the department. In New Hampshire, with no dedicated state program, this means that meat destined for sale must be processed at a USDA-approved facility with a federal inspector present during the slaughter.
There are four qualifying slaughterhouses across the state, in Barnstead, Conway, Goffstown, and Haverhill. Some farmers said that was not enough to meet peak demand, especially in autumn, the busiest season for meat processing. 
One reason for the autumn rush on slaughterhouses is that most farms schedule calving for spring and slaughter about 16 to 18 months later. It is also common for smaller farms to cull animals in the fall to avoid overwintering a herd, sometimes because they lack the infrastructure necessary to keep the animals healthy and marketable through the season.
This is the case for Josh Pelletier, who raises cattle, swine, and poultry at Dreamers’ Farm in Litchfield. Though he hopes to someday maintain a year-round herd, he doesn’t currently have the facility to overwinter his animals, Pelletier said in an interview. This leads him to compete with other farmers to secure coveted autumn butchery appointments. 
“It’s an absolute bottleneck in the fall,” he said.
Like most New Hampshire farmers, Pelletier books slots a year or more in advance. This, he said, makes it difficult to respond to fluctuations in customer demand. Paul Gareau, of Arándano Farm in Belmont, agreed.
“I made my appointment a month ago for litters that won’t be born for four to five months in the future. It’s just a little crazy, because we need farms to be growing,” he said.
Being a smaller farm raises costs and makes it even more difficult to book a slot, Pelletier said. Slaughterhouses often give preferential treatment to farmers who consistently bring in dozens of cattle, putting the interests of smaller producers, who have less business to offer, second.
A former chef, Pelletier said he would be interested in setting up a butchery on his farm if the proposal passes. He hopes others would do the same.
“I know that would bring our prices down,” he said. 
Josh Pelletier, of Dreamers’ Farm in Litchfield, said he favors a proposal to loosen regulations on meat processing in New Hampshire. The four USDA slaughterhouses currently operational in the state are not enough, he said, though critics say the proposal would jeopardize food safety and put farmers at risk of federal prosecution.

Safety and reputation concerns
Critics said food safety and reputability were on the line and raised concerns about federal prosecution or other consequences for farmers defying the USDA.
“I am a bit horrified by what you’re attempting to do here,” said New Hampshire Department of Agriculture, Markets, and Food Commissioner Shawn Jasper, expressing opposition to the bill during a work session Nov. 5. “My department is largely about consumer protection, and I think this is a huge step in the wrong direction.”.
Jasper said experience had led him to believe that some form of oversight was necessary to ensure meat is processed safely. The bill, he noted, does not call for inspections or education about safe meat processing.
“If you believe that all people act in the best interest of sanitary conditions, I’d ask you to follow some of my inspectors around for a day or two,” Jasper said at the work session. 
The amendment the committee ultimately voted in favor of Nov. 12 called for a slaughter area on the farm to be “maintained in sanitary condition,” though it neither defined what that would entail nor called for inspections.
Comtois said USDA facilities were not always safer, saying she knew of one New Hampshire facility that had dealt with safety violations, though she later declined to identify the facility. Other proponents, including Fremont Republican Rep. Laurence Miner, said oversight was unnecessary because a desire to protect their reputation would motivate farmers to adhere to safe practices of slaughter and meat storage. 
Some farmers, including Pelletier and Gareau, echoed this. An exemption already exists for poultry, Gareau said. “Poultry is arguably more dangerous than beef and pork,” he said.
Others disagreed.
“I believe farmers are good by nature. I think most of them make a lot of good decisions, but it doesn’t mean they all do,” Scott Mason, of Northwinds Farm in Stratford, said in an interview. 
Farmers are under a lot of pressure, Mason said, and must make many decisions every day that affect animal health, food safety, and their bottom line.
“It’s great to talk about knowing your farmer … but you’re not there at 10 o’clock at night, when they’ve got to make the right decision,” he said. 
Assuming risk
HB 396 calls for farmers to sign a statement acknowledging that they are violating federal law and “could be subject to federal prosecution” if they intend to slaughter their own animals. 
Insurers would be unlikely to protect farmers who violate federal law, Jasper said at the work session. For those who make a living selling meat, taking on liability is a serious concern, said Tim Duval, who raises beef cattle at HT Farm in Belmont with his wife Heidi Loring. 
HT Farm processes more than 40 head of cattle a year. Duval said that though he favored the bill and hoped it would help smaller operations, he would not take on the risk of using a non-USDA butcher himself. The USDA takes liability for issues that arise with meat during processing, Duval said. After hiring a non-USDA butcher, he said, the farmer would be liable.
“For us, that risk is kind of high,” Duval said. “… To throw 48 of them out there a year that way, liability wise, I just can’t take that chance.”
Joyce Brady, president of the New Hampshire Farm Bureau and owner of CJEJ Farm in Stratford, said she believed the bill sought to solve a serious problem, referencing her own experience of losing an appointment she had scheduled a year in advance for Christmas meat orders when the slaughterhouse was overbooked. But the liability it would have farmers take on, she said, is unacceptable.
“Something has to change, but this is not the way to do it,” Brady said. “I am very much against putting farmers and processors at risk.”
In his Nov. 5 testimony, Jasper referred to fallout from the passage of similar legislation in Maine in 2017. That law sought to enable Maine municipalities to permit direct-to-consumer sale of certain farm products without state oversight. 
But because Maine’s state government is responsible for conducting inspections in partnership with the USDA to ensure meat processing meets federal standards, the agency argued its passage would prevent enforcement of federal food safety regulations. A letter from the USDA to the state said the department would recommend federal takeover of the state’s meat processors if the problem was not solved. To avoid that outcome, lawmakers called a special session to amend the law, adding language to require continued enforcement of meat and poultry processing regulations to USDA standards.
In a Nov. 10 email, a USDA spokesperson said HB 396 as proposed “would violate the law, by failing to meet federal food safety requirements under the Federal Meat Inspection Act.” The spokesperson did not address questions about whether or how the department would take enforcement actions for such a violation.
A persistent problem
“My family’s been selling meat longer than I’ve been alive … We’ve been doing it for probably 70 years. It’s not like this is a new phenomenon, right?” Mason said.
He believes the real issue the state should seek to address is the difficulty of sustaining a slaughterhouse business — and adding more slaughterhouses, USDA or not, would not help, he said.
Mason was not compelled by complaints about wait times. Timing slaughter right is important, because as animals get larger they become less efficient at converting grain into muscle. But farming, he said, is about planning ahead, and slaughter is not the only thing a farmer must consider far in advance: from breeding animals to overseeing their pregnancy and raising a calf, a farmer can plan years in advance to slaughter an animal, he said.
“What I’m concerned with is that this is really more about a political movement, you know, less government — or, I should say, no government. And I don’t support that, and I don’t see how that’s going to help my business any,” he said.
Mason said he would support a state partnership with the USDA, like those in place in Vermont and Maine, that would increase the spots available in slaughterhouses without preempting the USDA’s authority and standards.
“God bless the New Hampshire Legislature, they’ll do anything other than come up with a dollar. That, to me, is what we’re seeing here: An attempt to say they’ve done something without really doing something. And ‘really doing something’ means you’re going to invest money in state inspection,” Mason said.
At the Nov. 5 work session, Jasper said such a state program would be expensive. But like Mason, he also questioned whether there was enough year-round demand to justify expanding the slaughterhouse market. He called on organizations like the New Hampshire Farm Bureau to see if smaller farmers could organize together to forge more reliable relationships with slaughterhouses.
At a recent New Hampshire Farm Bureau meeting, members were divided on the issue, Brady said. Ultimately, the group voted down a motion that would have the organization come out in opposition to HB 396. “However, there was no vote to support (the bill),” she added. 
Brady said the New Hampshire Farm Bureau wants to see more action on the federal level to help address the issue without the need for farmers to go against federal law. One possibility is the PRIME Act, which was introduced by Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie in 2019 and would pave the way for states to allow intrastate sale of non-USDA-processed meat.
The PRIME Act stalled then, but Massie and Maine Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree reintroduced it this July. HB 396 supporters, including Environment and Agriculture Chair Judy Aron, said that was promising. But the federal government had stalled on the topic for too long for New Hampshire not to go ahead and take action now, she said.
“Nothing is being done. And so we’ve got to do something as a committee, and as a Legislature, to make a statement that, hey guys, you either fix this in the industry, or you fix this in the federal government, or we have to,” Aron said Nov. 12. “As an intrastate solution, I think this is a good place to start.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/beef0-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-17 05:57:03.754485

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderAhead of the momentous 2020 presidential election, Georgia’s state leaders faced a choice.
The state’s voting system prior to that year consisted of 27,000 electronic voting machines that had been in use since 2002, which were reaching the end of their life and needed to be replaced. 
The voting machines, officially called direct-recording electronic voting machines, worked by capturing an electronic record of voters’ selections. At their polling place, voters received an activated voter card, which they inserted into a machine and used to make their selections. Once the voter had finished casting their ballot, the card was returned to a poll worker and its memory was wiped clean to be used for the next voter. Voters’ selections were saved electronically to a memory card on the machine, which was later collected by a poll worker and sent to election headquarters to be counted.
Cybersecurity experts had long voiced concerns about the electronic voting machines, which were once used by more than 40% of American voters, but in Georgia, lacked any sort of paper trail that could be used to verify election results after the fact. Additionally, the memory cards were vulnerable to viruses and other computer malfunctions.
Will Georgia join a GOP-led state exodus from a multistate voter accuracy group?

Legislators at the time voted for Georgia’s new election system largely along party lines, with Democrats largely favoring hand-marked paper ballots that require voters to fill out ballots with pencils or pens, and Republicans supporting ballot-marking devices, which still required voters to make selections on a machine but produced a paper ballot that would be scanned to tabulate the results. The new machines, purchased for $107 million and manufactured by Dominion Voting Systems, were used statewide in Georgia for the first time during the 2020 election.
But nearly six years later, Democrats and Republicans have seemingly found themselves on opposite ends of a similar debate. Some GOP lawmakers are now leading a push to replace ballot-marking devices with hand-marked paper ballots, and there are Democrats who are cautioning against abandoning Georgia’s current ballot-marking device system before the end of the state’s 10-year contract in 2029.
Now, with the 2026 midterm elections looming, lawmakers are once again faced with the question of whether to switch voting systems ahead of key statewide races — and they are running out of time to decide.
‘A very expensive pen with a mind of its own’ 
In the landscape of America’s election technology, Georgia is an outlier in a few ways. Ballot-marking devices are available in most parts of the U.S. — even in places that rely primarily on hand-marked paper ballots, federal law stipulates that all precincts have voting machines that can accommodate voters with disabilities — but Georgia is one of the few places where voters primarily rely on ballot-marking devices. And while most states use a patchwork of different election systems, Georgia settled on one type of equipment to use statewide.


Georgia’s current ballot-marking devices work by having voters select their choices on an electronic touchscreen, which prompts them to print out a paper ballot when they are finished making their selections. Voters then feed the paper ballot into a separate machine that tabulates the election results based on a QR code.
Verified Voting, a nonprofit organization that tracks voting equipment across the U.S., recommends that most voters use hand-marked paper ballots counted by machines, which they see as having the fewest risks and ensure that election officials can verify the outcome of an election after the fact.
“A ballot-marking device is basically a very expensive pen with a mind of its own,” said Mark Lindeman, Verified Voting’s policy and strategy director. Though he said Georgia’s switch to ballot-marking devices in 2019 was an improvement, he added that the machines “will not necessarily do what you tell it to do, so that introduces some complexities and some opportunities for things to go wrong that we would advise minimizing.”
However, he acknowledged that there are times when it makes sense for voters to use ballot-marking devices, particularly when it comes to increasing accessibility.
“We firmly believe that ballot-marking devices should be available for voters who need or prefer to use them,” Lindeman said. “We’re not talking about banning the BMDs, but we’re talking about offering in-person voters the opportunity to hand-mark their paper ballots, and we think that’s a better choice for most voters.”
A partisan flip-flop
When Georgia lawmakers advanced a bill to switch from electronic voting machines to ballot-marking devices in 2019, the legislation, House Bill 316, passed through both chambers largely along party lines.
Former Rep. Barry Fleming. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“House Bill 316 will bring our state to the forefront of election technology,” state Rep. Barry Fleming, a Harlem Republican and lead sponsor of the bill, said at the time. “It builds on the successes of our old system and incorporates the best practices of the modern day.”
Democrats largely opposed the move, arguing that implementing the voting machines was estimated to be five times more expensive than a hand-marked paper ballot system, and would be more vulnerable to hacking and tampering, which could endanger election integrity across the state.
But partisan perceptions of voting equipment began to shift in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential race, when President Donald Trump falsely claimed that the ​​election was stolen from him in Georgia and several other swing states.
Dominion Voting Systems, which has since been acquired by Liberty Vote, became caught up in false claims about the validity of the 2020 election results, with conservative media outlets like Fox News, Newsmax and One America News Network accusing the company of rigging the election in favor of former President Joe Biden. Trump-aligned attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell also claimed that Liberty Vote had conspired to switch votes in Biden’s favor.
Liberty Vote has since received millions of dollars in settlements after filing a series of lawsuits against those who claimed the company conspired to rig the 2020 election.
But in Georgia, the claims have fueled distrust in ballot-marking devices among some voters. Groups of conservative election integrity activists have spent years urging lawmakers and the State Election Board to abandon ballot-marking devices in favor of hand-marked paper ballots. 
Other groups have been pushing for hand-marked ballots for even longer, with a group called the Coalition for Good Governance filing a lawsuit against the state in 2017 to try and force a switch to hand-marked paper ballots ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.
Marilyn Marks, the Coalition for Good Governance’s executive director, said that if a ballot-marking device were hacked during an election, it would be difficult to trace the breach back to its source.
“If you’ve got a problem with the ballot-marking devices, you have no real record of what the voter entered into the touchscreen, so you will never know what exactly went wrong,” she said, arguing that a hand-marked paper ballot system would eliminate that risk.
“Now [the voter] could have made a mistake, they could have voted for the wrong candidate, but that would have been their fault,” she added.
State Sen. Sam Watson, a Moultrie Republican who served as one of the cosponsors of the 2019 voting machine measure, said he has received requests from constituents to consider a hand-marked paper ballot system. 
Sen. Sam Watson. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Watson, who now leads the Senate committee that handles election bills, is also a cosponsor of Senate Bill 214, which would make hand-marked paper ballots the primary voting system across the state.
“Obviously there was a lot that we did not know then,” he said of the switch to ballot-marking devices. The 2020 election was also an unusual time in Georgia history, with record numbers of voters using absentee ballots due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It was a different day, a different time,” Watson added. “Everything’s changed since then.”
The bill, introduced earlier this year by state Sen. Max Burns, would require the state to purchase new equipment, including on-demand ballot printers to dispense the ballots to voters and optical scanning systems to tabulate them.
“You can’t hack a paper ballot,” said Burns, a Sylvania Republican, during a March committee meeting. “You can’t alter a paper ballot. At the end of the day, you have the physical document. You have the physical vote that was cast by the elector, and you can verify [the results].”
Burns’ bill passed through the Senate near the end of the 2025 legislative session with a party-line vote. It remains alive, and could be considered by the House when the Legislature reconvenes in January. Burns did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
But Democrats, who favored a hand-marked paper ballot system in 2019, have criticized Republicans’ push to switch voting systems again before the end of Georgia’s contract with Liberty Vote. The state is currently slated to begin bidding on new voting systems in 2028.
Sen. Sally Harrell, an Atlanta Democrat, said she would support a switch to paper ballots, but noted that the current ballot-marking devices were purchased on a 20-year bond, meaning that the Legislature will continue covering the cost of those machines until the 2040 fiscal year, regardless of what voting equipment is in use.
“We, unfortunately, are still paying for those machines,” she said. “That doesn’t seem fiscally responsible.”
Rep. Jasmine Clark. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
State Rep. Jasmine Clark, a Lilburn Democrat who is running for Congress in 2026, said she preferred paper ballots, but cautioned against switching voting systems right before a high-profile election like the 2026 midterms.
“Every time we change something, you now introduce another layer of insecurity,” Clark said, adding, “I think it’s tough to sell something super brand new in a major election, like the election for all of the statewide offices in Georgia.”
Travis Doss, the executive director of the Richmond County Board of Elections and former president of the Georgia Association of Voter Registration and Election Officials, expressed concern about how counties would pay for election changes implemented by the Legislature.
“Funding is a huge concern,” he said, adding that though the state is responsible for paying for voting equipment, the cost of ballot paper, printer ink and other consumables are shouldered by county elections offices. 
“That would be a huge expense on the counties,” he said.
Doss also worries about the feasibility of implementing new equipment on a short timeline. When Georgia switched to ballot-marking devices in 2019, he said, the transition was a difficult one for election officials.
“We had to be ready to go by March of 2020 — which, of course, we had the three weeks of advanced voting, so we really had to be ready to go by mid-February,” he said. “So there was a lot of hurrying and scrambling and whatnot to make sure that everything was ready for when we had to start voting.”
If Georgia were to completely switch systems again, he said, elections administrators would need a minimum of six months to comfortably implement the new technology. Under that timeline, any changes to Georgia’s voting equipment would need to be finalized by mid-April.
“Not only do we as the elections directors have to be trained on the equipment,” he said, “Then we have to turn around and be able to train staff and poll workers as well.”
2025 legislative updates
Regardless of whether Georgia switches voting systems this year, lawmakers may be forced to update certain recently enacted election laws before the end of the 2026 session.
Under Senate Bill 189, which was signed into law in 2024, QR codes can no longer be used to tabulate ballots after next July.  The QR codes have faced criticism from cybersecurity experts and proponents of hand-marked paper ballots, who say that ballots should be counted based on text that can be deciphered by humans.
“None of us can read the QR code,” Marks from the Coalition for Good Governance said. “The machines tabulate those QR code votes, so we have no way of actually knowing who we are voting for.”

During the 2025 legislative session, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger estimated that updating all the necessary equipment to implement that change will require roughly $66 million in state funds, more than double the $32.5 million estimate that was floated when lawmakers considered the proposal in 2023. The money would be used to fund the purchase of 33,000 new ballot printers, along with new optical scanners and updated memory cards needed to tabulate ballots with human-readable text.
However, lawmakers failed to appropriate the funds before the Legislature adjourned in April.
During the 2025 session, Raffensperger also urged state leaders to prioritize software upgrades in the short term, which he says are more cost-effective than spending millions of dollars in new equipment that may be replaced soon after the 2026 election. 
“In two years, this system’s contract with [Liberty Vote] is up,” he told House lawmakers during a committee meeting in February. “At that point you can then consider, what do we want to do? What does the future system look like?”
Secretary of state spokesperson Robert Sinners said the office would follow the laws put in place by the Legislature, but that Raffensperger maintains his confidence in Georgia’s current election equipment.
“The secretary has been firm on his commitment to Georgia’s voting system,” Sinners said.
And though a loyal contingent of activists has continued to lobby for an immediate switch to paper ballots, other Georgia residents are less convinced that changing voting equipment is necessary. 
A May poll by the Democracy Defense Project, a nonprofit aimed at countering election misinformation, found that nearly four in five Georgia voters who cast ballots in the 2024 general election had moderate or high levels of trust in the integrity of Georgia’s elections ahead of 2026. Additionally, only 27% of those surveyed said they support a switch to paper ballots, while 43% opposed the change.
Georgia voters also expressed skepticism about a switch to paper ballots. Laura Dunn, a 27-year-old Fulton County resident, said she had concerns about voter suppression under a hand-marked paper ballot system.
“If we have a system that’s working effectively for people, and counting votes and making it as easy as possible for everybody and transparent, we don’t need to go back to something like that,” she said. 
Daniel Harmon, a 54-year-old Gwinnett County voter, also expressed skepticism about changing Georgia’s voting equipment.
“That’s stupid,” he said when asked about a potential switch to hand-marked paper ballots. “I understand the concern about fraud, but there hasn’t really been any fraud, so it just slows down the process a lot.”
Raffensperger has also praised the accuracy of Georgia’s current system, which includes audits of all the human-readable text to ensure that it matches the QR-code tabulated votes for every race on the ballot. Out of 87 discrepancies found during the 2024 audit, he added, 86 were on hand-marked absentee ballots.
Republican Rep. Tim Fleming of Covington. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The issue of switching to hand-marked paper ballots has also been a central part of a House “blue-ribbon” committee dedicated to examining Georgia’s election policies. The committee, which is expected to provide policy recommendations ahead of the 2026 legislative session, is headed by Rep. Tim Fleming, a Covington Republican who is running for secretary of state.
Lindeman of Verified Voting, who provided testimony to the committee during a September meeting, said that the debate about changing voting equipment in Georgia may come down to a matter of timing.
“The question for Georgia or any state, is not whether to change voting systems, but when to change voting systems,” Lindeman said in an interview. “Because the systems age out, you need to replace them sooner or later. And Georgia is heading towards the end of its contract with Liberty Vote, so it naturally comes to a decision point.”

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)When local activist Frank Arcoleo found out over the summer that a data center was coming to his neighborhood in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, he said he was furious. There’d been no votes or public hearings.
The first phase of the data center project under development there only required administrative approval from a few city officials, based on the building permit application and state laws.
“So these data centers are going in, and guess what? The public gets nothing to say about it because the city’s already approved it,” Arcoleo said.
Now, Arcoleo is backing a zoning ordinance under consideration by the Lancaster City Council that aims to ensure residents have a say in the future. The ordinance would require data center projects to undergo a special exception hearing from the city’s zoning hearing board. It would also require data centers to adhere to the city’s noise ordinance and for developers to submit a report detailing the project’s planned electricity and water use for the city to review.
Similar efforts are underway across the country, as municipalities move quickly to enact ordinances about where and how data centers are built. A few communities have turned to ballot measures or lawsuits.
But at the same time, some state lawmakers are rushing to pass legislation that would accelerate the development of data center infrastructure.
Lawmakers fear AI data centers will drive up residents’ power bills

More data centers are being built nationwide to meet the demand for digital services, including power-hungry artificial intelligence systems. Data centers, which house thousands of servers, are able to store and transmit the data required for internet services to work.
The facilities support a digital society and can provide increased tax revenue. Data center advocates argue they also can bring new jobs and other benefits for states and local communities. But residents and local leaders in several localities across the country — including cities in Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, Tennessee, Virginia and other states — are concerned about how the facilities could drive up utility bills and harm the environment.
Lancaster’s residents, including Arcoleo, are worried about the amount of energy required to power data centers — which could drive up electricity rates for the entire city, he said.
“Data centers alone will cause dirty electricity sources — coal-fired plants, diesel-fired plants, natural gas-fired plants — that were due to come offline to stay online because we need every kilowatt of power that exists,” said Arcoleo, a member of the progressive advocacy group Lancaster Stands Up. “That affects me too because it ruins my environment.”
But Pennsylvania’s governor has been working to bring more data centers to the state. In June, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro announced that Amazon was planning to invest at least $20 billion to build data center campuses across Pennsylvania — the largest private sector investment in state history. He’s also pushing proposals to encourage more energy production in the state, which would supply data centers. But critics say parts of his plan would sideline local officials.
‘This is moving so quickly’
Data centers require a great deal of electricity to run, which some state officials worry will drive up electricity demand — and utility bills.
Many data centers also require significant amounts of water to cool their servers. Large data centers can consume up to 5 million gallons of water per day — equivalent to the water use of a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people, according to a report from the Environmental and Energy Study Institute, a nonprofit that provides educational resources to policymakers and the public.
Local leaders and advocates across the country are weighing the potential outcomes in their community. In August, Starwood Digital Ventures submitted plans to New Castle County, Delaware, for a data center project that could consume as much power as 875,000 to almost 1 million homes — nearly twice the 449,000 housing units that exist in the state, according to Spotlight Delaware.
Amazon pulls Louisa County data center proposal after strong resistance

The proposed data center sparked strong opposition from residents at a July town hall, including state House Speaker Melissa Minor-Brown, a Democrat, who organized the event. New Castle County Councilman David Carter was already working on an ordinance that would put up guardrails for data center development in the area.
Under the proposed ordinance, data centers could not be built within 1,000 feet of any residential zoning district. Developers would also be required to coordinate with state regulators to ensure enough water is available to cool the facility’s servers. The ordinance also outlines a decommissioning process for data centers that are no longer in use.
“Most of these concerns are things you can manage and plan for, but this is moving so quickly that I think across the country, most jurisdictions are playing catch-up for their codes to best manage these data centers,” Carter told Stateline.
Currently, Virginia leads the country in data center development. In the absence of state laws, Virginia’s localities began to make their own data center rules.
Earlier this year, local leaders in Loudoun County, Virginia, which has one of the highest concentrations of data centers in the world, amended the county’s zoning ordinance to require data center proposals to go through a public hearing process and get approval from the Board of Supervisors.
Loudoun County officials are looking forward to new data center bills coming out of next year’s legislative session, said Michael Turner, vice chair of the Board of Supervisors. But he added that decisions regarding data center development should ultimately be left to localities.
“The decision for how local communities can use their land has to be left to the local communities,” Turner said. “But there’s no question: There’s rising tension between local community government, and state and federal government, as this high demand for both data and energy is continually rising.”
Meanwhile, Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a bill in May that would have required data center developers and energy utilities to disclose information to local governments on noise and environmental impacts of a proposed project.
In DeKalb County, Georgia, in October, county leaders voted to extend a local ​moratorium on new data center applications until Dec. 16 while local leaders assess the impact of the incoming facilities, according to Decaturish. At the same time, county leadership is considering a zoning amendment that would regulate where data centers can be built, how they are designed and other standards.
Local advocates in other areas of the country are pursuing change through the ballot box or lawsuits. Residents in Augusta Charter Township, Michigan, collected enough signatures for a referendum that would let voters decide on rezoning for a proposed data center. Township leaders believe the new facility will generate tax revenue for the community, but residents are concerned about noise and light pollution and higher electric rates, according to Inside Climate News.
In Doña Ana County, New Mexico, residents and an environmental law group filed two lawsuits that allege county commissioners violated state law by approving a data center project that had an incomplete application. Local advocates and state lawmakers representing the county say the developers’ plan to build a natural gas generating station for the data center would exploit a loophole in a state law that requires utilities to use fully renewable energy resources by 2045, according to Source New Mexico.
Data centers’ demand for electricity brings unprecedented opportunity and challenges

Still, some local leaders welcome data centers in their area. In September, AVAIO Digital, a Connecticut-based data center developer, announced that it had broken ground on a $6 billion data center campus in Brandon, Mississippi, about 15 minutes outside of Jackson.
Shortly after the data center was announced, several concerned residents in Rankin County began a petition demanding that county representatives address concerns about utility bills and pollution.
But Brandon Republican Mayor Butch Lee said he sees the project as an opportunity. As more data centers are built, it will prompt more areas to expand and modernize their electrical grid, he said. Local leaders are also working to ensure that the data center uses recycled water for cooling its systems in an effort to promote conservation practices, he said.
“I don’t see any environmental problems,” Lee said. “I don’t see any water problems. I just see a changing national and global landscape of what the next 100 years is going to be like.”
And John Malone, a principal at AVAIO Digital, said the company wants to commit itself to being good neighbors.
“All of these things work better when you’re good neighbors. And so we get it — this is a big project coming into your community,” Malone said. “Of course, people are going to have questions.”
Pennsylvania pushes
Lancaster’s residents are not alone. Local leaders in two Pennsylvania townships, East Vincent and North Middleton, are considering similar rules that would restrict where data centers can be built and operated.
They would establish a special zoning designation for data centers and require developers to study how the structures could affect the local environment, water supply, traffic patterns and more.
And a new zoning ordinance adopted by West Pennsboro Township in August requires those studies and confirmation from developers that an electricity supplier in the area will be able to supply enough power for a data center to serve new data centers in the area.
In Pennsylvania, developers are advertising data centers as an economic opportunity for the state’s local communities, said Livia Garofalo, a researcher with Data & Society’s Trustworthy Infrastructures team. The nonprofit research institute studies the social implications of data-centric technologies.










For some of these communities who are experiencing economic difficulty … some of these townships are saying, ‘Well, why not?’


– Livia Garofalo, researcher with Data & Society’s Trustworthy Infrastructures team


She said that while some local leaders welcome the potential revenue, others are wary of the major changes data centers have brought to other communities like theirs. A lot of Pennsylvania towns have witnessed the rise and fall of other industries — such as steel and coal — that were said to be good opportunities. Now, they must decide if the data center industry is worth it.
“For some of these communities who are experiencing economic difficulty — especially with a federal shutdown — some of these townships are saying, ‘Well, why not?’” Garofalo said.
Lancaster residents are still trying to understand what the new data center means for the city.
But for Josh Nice, who lives in the city’s Stadium District neighborhood, there’s an “anticipatory grief” — the feeling of worry that comes with an impending loss or change.
“Things like this [data centers] are never designed to benefit communities and working people,” said Nice. “They’re only designed to exploit communities and enrich stakeholders and rich people.”
In Virginia, Turner said he hopes that local communities can work alongside state officials and the federal government in the future to make decisions together.
“All the counties are very concerned about the federal government or the state making broad brush decisions about local land use that can really negatively — and, I mean, negatively — affect local communities,” Turner said.

(Getty Images.)One measure used by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland says there’s a 24% chance that the U.S. economy was in recession last month. But the bank warns that the measure has become less reliable in recent years.
Even so, signs are mounting that if the economy isn’t already in recession, it could be soon, with major banks this fall indicating high odds of it.
The Cleveland Fed and 11 other regions conduct surveys on regional economic conditions eight times a year by questioning businesses, community organizations, economists, and other sources for its Beige Book.
The findings from all 12 regions are used by the Federal Open Market Committee as it sets monetary policy, in part by establishing key interest rates. 
The region represented by the Cleveland Fed includes all of Ohio and adjacent parts of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Kentucky.
In its Beige Book report published last month, respondents told the Cleveland Fed that President Donald Trump’s shifting array of tariffs are increasing their costs and forcing them to raise prices.
The reserve bank this week reported that a model using data from the Beige Book found that there was a nearly one-in-four chance that the national economy was already in recession as of last month.

However, it accompanied that with new research showing that the model’s track record had gotten significantly worse since 2021, after a global pandemic took hold.
“We attribute this to the historically unusual nature of the post-pandemic economic expansion and to changes in the drivers of regional economic sentiment,” the report said.
Even so, economic warning signs for Ohio appear to be piling up.
Ohioans’ credit card debt is rising faster than in all but four other states, WalletHub reports. 
And the Buckeye State again had the nation’s fifth-highest unemployment in August, despite years of spending billions on taxpayer-financed incentives to attract jobs.
Yahoo Finance this week reported that hiring across the country “has dramatically slowed.” 
And a Harris Poll conducted for Bloomberg News in late October found that 55% of Americans are worried about losing their jobs. 
That’s not a great sign for a consumer-driven economy as we head into the holiday shopping season.
The news organization Reuters last week reported that, amid the government shutdown, consumer sentiment hit a three-and-a-half year low. And inflation has been on the rise since April.
There are also concerns that the deregulatory zeal of the current administration could produce a result even worse than the meltdowns that paralyzed the economy in 2008 and created the Great Recession.
William A. Birdthistle, a top official at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under former President Joe Biden, last week published a column in the New York Times. It was titled “Trump is Pushing us Toward a Crash. It Could be 1929 All Over Again.” 
The reality might not be as bad as all that, but major banks in September predicted high odds of a recession. 
And some experts raised fears that the Trump tariffs could feed “stagflation” — a period of high inflation and weak economic growth.
As the Cleveland Fed report indicates, it can be devilishly hard to know if we’re currently in a recession, much less predict whether one is coming. 
But the New York Times last week reported that some members of the Trump administration are saying some parts of the economy are already in recession, as they pressure the Federal Reserve to again lower interest rates.

Republish photo only with original story.)People opposed to a bill that would require Ohio public schools show a video produced by an anti-abortion group about fetal development to students questioned the scientific accuracy of the video and criticized Ohio’s lack of sex education standards.
Ohio House Bill 485, also known as the “Enact Baby Olivia Act,” would require schools to show either the ‘Baby Olivia’ video or a similar video to students every year starting in fifth grade all the way up through twelfth grade beginning with the 2026-27 school year. 
The bill originally required viewing to start in third grade, but an amendment to the bill changed it to fifth grade. 
The three-minute “Meet Baby Olivia” video was produced by Live Action, which advocates against abortion, and it shows fertilization and fetal growth.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Live Action’s Meet ‘Baby Olivia’ video is not scientifically accurate,” Delia Sosa, a fourth-year medical student, said during her testimony during Thursday’s Ohio House Education Committee.
Seven people testified in person against the bill, which was introduced by Ohio State Rep. Melanie Miller, R–Ashland. Nearly 30 people submitted opponent testimony.
“The ‘Baby Olivia’ video does not accurately depict the timeline of growth and development in utero and there is inaccurate data scattered throughout the video, including that fetuses can survive outside the womb at 20 weeks,” Sosa said. 
“The earliest recorded gestational age to survive outside the womb was 22 weeks.”
Planned Parenthood calls the “Baby Olivia” video “inaccurate, misleading, and manipulative.” 
Planned Parenthood notes that the video counts the embryo’s age from conception, which doctors do not do; claims a fetal heartbeat can be detected at six weeks despite there not being a heart formed and this sound actually an electrical flutter where the heart will later form; and inaccurately displays the look of the embryo, mischaracterizes its activity, and leaves out critical information about at what point it can survive outside the womb. 
Fargo Public Schools in North Dakota reportedly stopped showing the “Baby Olivia” video last year after students discovered information in the video was misleading. 
“They also found that Live Action was unable to provide data regarding the effectiveness of the curriculum and I think that’s an incredibly important piece,” said Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio Public Policy Director Danielle Firsich.
Ohio is one of a handful of states without comprehensive sex education standards taught in schools. 
Ohio’s curriculum stresses abstinence as a general policy and requires some instruction about sexually transmitted infections, according to the Ohio Revised Code. 
“The bill does not require any actual, age-appropriate human growth and development curriculum that would give students the context for concepts related to pregnancy and fetal development,” Abortion Forward Deputy Director Jaime Miracle said. 
“It is most certainly not a substitute for comprehensive, age-appropriate health education that equips students with the information they need to make healthy decisions across their life span.” 
Dr. Nick Denton, an education researcher and teaching professor at the Ohio State University College of Pharmacy, offered some evidence-based alternatives to the bill.
“Provide students with medically accurate information on reproductive health, contraception, and maternal health as part of a family planning curriculum,” Denton said. 
“This empowers informed choices far more effectively than a single video.”
Abortion is legal in Ohio up until fetal viability as determined by a patient’s physician. Ohio voters passed an amendment to the Ohio Constitution in 2023 that added protections to abortion care and reproductive rights to the state’s constitution.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)This fall, Plymouth State University launched a flexible new option: a three-year bachelor’s degree.
Students interested in specific areas of study — including cybersecurity, robotics and automation engineering, small business administration, police studies, and outdoor adventure leadership — can now obtain 96 credits and leave with a full degree. 
“Plymouth State University makes it easier to earn your degree and start your career sooner with less student debt,” reads an announcement on the school’s website. 
It’s the kind of offering that some argue is necessary for New Hampshire colleges. As they battle long-term drops in enrollment, state colleges and universities are hoping closer collaboration with community colleges will increase interest and make obtaining degrees easier. 
But the university system is still reeling from a $35 million — 17.6% — two-year cut to state funds imposed by the Legislature last June in the latest two-year budget, says Catherine Provencher, chancellor of the University System of New Hampshire.
“I’m increasingly concerned about Fiscal Year 2027,” said Provencher, addressing lawmakers on the Public Higher Education Study Committee Wednesday and referring to the fiscal year that begins July 2026. 
“We are reducing the number of faculty. There are some early buyouts offered to faculty. We are reducing the size of our footprint, trying to think fast. Do we sell space? Do we lease space out? Do we demolish space?”
In August, the University of New Hampshire eliminated 36 positions, laying off 23 people, in direct response to the cuts. Next week, Keene State College plans to lay off 17 employees and hire five back at lower salaries, according to the Keene Sentinel.
And colleges across the university system increased tuition by between 2.5% and 4.9% this year, with community college tuition rising by 7%.
The funding crunch is not new: An August analysis by the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute found that New Hampshire continues to provide the lowest amount of state funding per student in the country to its public universities, with an average of $4,629 per student compared to the national average of $11,683. That means state higher education funding falls largely to students — 68% of USNH revenue comes from tuition compared to 39% nationally, according to NHFPI. 
But now, top community college and university system officials are under pressure to address the waning attendance rates and do it with fewer resources. And Provencher says there are no easy levers to get more funding. 
“The market will not bear a tuition increase to cover the difference in state support,” she said Wednesday. 
Enrollment challenges persist. A 2023 annual financial report from the University System of New Hampshire revealed a 13.6% drop in enrollment across all public four-year institutions since 2019, reflecting regional trends. That, Provencher says, is driven by fewer K-12 students in the state, the rising cost of tuition, and the large percentage of New Hampshire students who leave the state for higher education. 
Lawmakers have passed laws to require the two systems to collaborate. In 2022, Gov. Chris Sununu signed House Bill 1530, which established “curricular transfer pathways” to allow community college students direct pipelines to bachelor’s degree programs in state colleges and universities.
And last year, lawmakers passed House Bill 1450, which directed the systems to work together to find ways to increase educational opportunities, grow the workforce pipeline, and streamline costs. 
The goal: to push the systems to find ways to share students.
Responding to that directive, USNH and CCSNH have developed more than 100 such pathways, allowing students to spend two years at a community college and then transfer into a state college or university and spend two more years finishing their bachelor’s degree. 
In a briefing to a legislative oversight committee Wednesday, Provencher and Mark Rubinstein, chancellor of the Community College System of New Hampshire, said 44 additional pathways are in development.
Pursuing a pathway helps students save on tuition and is designed to allow them to advance their degree smoothly, they said.
The systems have launched a “direct admission program” that allows community college students to automatically transfer to certain university system programs if they meet GPA requirements. 
And so far, the closer collaboration appears to have made an impact. Between June 2024 and June 2025, the university system saw a 36% increase in the number of transfers from community college associate’s degree holders. 
The state universities and community colleges are also focused on improving the pipeline from high school to college, officials say, though the rollout is far from universal. 
About 40% of New Hampshire high school students have access to early college programs that allow them to enter community college with significant credits. The goal is to encourage more New Hampshire students to pursue higher education within the state, officials say. 
“However, to optimize these efforts, CCSNH would need to develop another mechanism with more comprehensive reach,” an Oct. 31 joint report from the CCSNH and USNH states. Officials have proposed working with individual school districts or the state Department of Education to improve that pipeline.
“What we’d like to try to do this year is get those communications out to students who have applied to graduate but haven’t necessarily graduated yet, to let them know that there is direct admission,” Rubinstein said. 
Meanwhile, CCSNH says 11,000 New Hampshire high school students took part in a high school dual enrollment course in 2024 to 2025, another way to earn college credits early. Those credits collectively amounted to $14 million in savings, according to the community college system .
Similar efforts are ongoing to help students in Career and Technical Education programs transfer into community college and university programs to more quickly obtain certificates and degrees. And Provencher and Rubinstein say they are working to establish credits for “demonstrated college-level learning competencies that can be accomplished outside of classroom settings.”
But those programs have faced their own funding challenges after the Trump administration cut more than $30 million in funding to two programs intended to make it easier for underprivileged children to attend college: the GEAR UP program and the TRIO program.
“We just had to eliminate those positions — those grants were canceled,” said Provencher. 
Looking to the long term, Rubinstein was optimistic about the institutions’ ability to adapt to continue to attract students.
“I expect that higher education — post-secondary education — will grow, but it’s not going to look like full-time undergraduate students between the ages of 18 and 22 who are on college campuses for that longer time,” he said, “It’s going to be working adults throughout their lifetimes who are coming back and cycling through educational opportunities.”
But for Provencher, the immediate task is to navigate the state funding cuts. 
“We are getting back to the core mission and making decisions necessary to ensure that our student success is not negatively impacted,” she said. “And it’s really hard work.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0850-1024x609.jpg,,,2025-11-17 04:58:46.281711

(Getty Images) An Ohio state lawmaker is trying to ensure people, businesses or developers are held accountable for what they do with artificial intelligence. In effect, his bill aims to outlaw “it wasn’t me, the AI did it” as a legal defense.
State Rep. Thaddeus Clagget, R-Licking County, gets there in part by barring artificial intelligence tools from any form of legal personhood.
Part of that is prohibiting Ohioans from marrying an AI partner, and that part earned Claggett some mockery on The Late Show last month. Host Stephen Colbert teased, “No wonder he’s against technology, his name is 200 years old.”

Claggett took the jokes in stride. But after a committee hearing Wednesday, he pulled out his phone to show a post on social media.
“Just yesterday, in Japan, we have a Japanese woman marries her AI boyfriend, the world’s first AI marriage,” he read. “It’s actually happened, okay?”
Claggett readily acknowledges that’s an “amusing” part of his legislation but says he’s trying to get his arms around something much bigger.
“So, the bill is, it’s trying to define what is sentient and what will forever and always be non-sentient,” Claggett said. “It makes no difference the ability of a donkey to speak, that does not make the donkey a human, okay?”


JUST IN: Japanese woman marries her AI boyfriend, the world’s first human x AI marriage.
— Polymarket (@Polymarket) November 12, 2025


‘Imago dei’
Claggett sees a collision in the not-too-distant future.
The western legal cannon is rooted in judging an individual’s responsibility before the court, but AI developers are busy creating tools that mimic an individual’s consciousness.
There’s a fundamental difference, he insists, between the “imago dei,” or in the image of God, nature of humanity and that of a synthetic intelligence — no matter how well developed.
And Claggett thinks Ohio law needs bright-line distinctions between the two before artificial intelligence is fully integrated into our daily lives.
“Our courts are not yet set up for the intrusion of fake systems that portray human activity,” he said. “We have to have the courts, in a clear (way) say it is the human who transgressed, not some machine that somebody hid behind.”
So yes, Ohio House Bill 469 bars AI systems from getting married, but it also prohibits them from holding a decision-making role within a company or owning property.
To ensure the courts can trace liability to a human actor, any direct or indirect harm caused by an AI tool is the responsibility of the user or the developer.
“Let’s be clear, however,” Claggett said, “we’re not gonna blame these companies, if they’re if their software is correct, we’re not gonna blame them for somebody misusing their software.”
“Again,” he added, “the human is responsible before the court.”
Changes coming
Perhaps unsurprisingly a group called TechNet, which counts several leading AI firms among its members, opposes the legislation.
TechNet says the bill’s definition of AI is too broad, potentially roping in “any data-driven or rules-based software,” and its liability provisions pose “an existential risk” for developers.
“Existing product liability law already covers negligent or defective design,” TechNet claimed. “And HB 469’s new, AI-specific liability structure would only increase uncertainty and litigation risk.”
But a different group, The Alliance for Secure AI, praised the measure.
CEO Brendan Steinhauser said the bill’s liability language “close(s) a dangerous loophole where a corporation could deploy an AI system, have it cause financial or physical harm, and then claim it is not responsible for the actions of its “AI agent.’”

And jokes aside, the bill’s marriage prohibitions serve an important purpose by preventing an AI tool from making financial or medical decision for a human spouse.
Still, others who think the bill is commendable see room for improvement. Cory Scott who heads up the Center for Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection at Cleveland State University highlighted four changes lawmakers should consider.
Like TechNet, Scott said the AI definition is too broad. Spellcheck and GPS navigation would fit within the current version, for instance.
He also said ordering developers to prioritize safety is too abstract. It would be better to require disclosures about how companies modeled risk during development.
Unlike Technet, Scott explained software generally isn’t covered by product liability laws because it’s not considered tangible personal property.
If lawmakers tweak the language to include software, he admits that scope of liability would present a “significant burden” for any software company.
But it could be truly prohibitive for open-source developers, and he urged lawmakers to provide an exemption.
Lastly, Scott said lawmakers should use ‘consciousness’ rather than ‘sentience’ as the term of art in the bill.

Animals are sentient, he reasoned, “but we would not consider them to be rational decision makers on matters of importance.”
Consciousness on the other hand, conveys “autonomy, reflective thought, self-awareness,” he said.
Scott noted AI companies themselves will likely tout the level of consciousness their tools display in promotional materials.
To protect users as those tools become more lifelike and more ubiquitous, he suggested Ohio lawmakers consider provisions from The GUARD Act in the U.S. Senate.
Among its requirements, AI systems would have to regularly disclose their non-human status, which Scott said, “can help break the illusion of consciousness that can be created by extended use of chatbots.”
Claggett said he’s heard the feedback and amendments are coming.
In particular, he’s planning to work on the definition of artificial intelligence — “to tighten up that language on what we mean, what we don’t mean.”

(Leon Neal/Getty Images).One member of Kansas’ U.S. House delegation has stepped up to demand government accountability in the Jeffrey Epstein case. The other three representatives? 
They’re missing in action.
Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat, has signed onto a discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing files about Epstein, his powerful friends and crimes against teenage girls. Reps. Derek Schmidt, Tracey Mann and Ron Estes, all Republicans, have declined to add their names. They will be on the record soon enough; a vote on the petition appears likely this week.
You don’t have to be a conspiracy theorist to believe that something has gone awry in the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein case.
The deceased financier committed sex crimes and boasted of famous pals, including President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton. Official and journalistic inquiries into his depravity have continued for decades, and documents have trickled out throughout that time. The current administration swept into office promising unprecedented disclosure of case files.
Then the administration abruptly declared there was no news there, with Trump dubbing the affair a “Democrat hoax.”
That sounds, well, suspicious.
The stories keep coming. Earlier this year, we learned about a birthday letter to Epstein bearing Trump’s name (the president denies the signature is his). A tranche of email messages to and from Epstein landed just last week. So forgive me, and folks from across the partisan divide, who believe there’s more to learn about case.
In the House, four Republicans have joined all Democrats  in demanding the government release everything it can. Party leadership has opposed the effort, and Trump has lobbied hard to shut it down. He’s denounced GOP supporters Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie online. Neither have been known for liberal views, to say the least. Administration bigwigs apparently lobbied Rep. Lauren Boebert inside the Situation Room.
One might assume our GOP representatives in Washington, D.C., would be front and center demanding answers and accountability. After all, they come from a party that supposedly highlights both family values and a tough on crime stance.
Yet Schmidt, Mann and Estes haven’t supported the petition. They haven’t spoken up. To me, that looks like a missed opportunity.
Estes’ office at least sent a statement: “Rep. Estes appreciates the good work that the House Oversight Committee has done to provide transparency about this despicable person, including the 20,000 pages of documents that were released this past week. He is reviewing the bill that will come before the House to ensure it provides sufficient transparency while protecting innocent victims.”
I’m sure all of these representatives detest Epstein and find his crimes appalling. I’m sure they all want justice for his victims and to understand how far the corruption went among American elites who curried Epstein’s favor. I’m sure that, given their druthers, they would support any and all efforts to seek the full release of information about the case.
How unfortunate that we live during a time when they face political risk for doing so. They know which way the wind blows, and they have seen Trump’s attacks on Greene and Massie. I’m sure they believe it’s safer to avoid the whole mess and stay in the good graces of their party leader — the same man who once stated Epstein was “a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”
(Trump himself has been accused by nearly 30 women of sexual impropriety. His 2016 campaign for president was nearly derailed by of a tape in which he talked about grabbing women by their genetilia. Diehard Trump supporters  have made their peace with all this, however, so let’s move along.)
The real question of the moment is how Schmidt, Mann and Estes justify their position in this moment, right now. They have to know that their votes, and the votes of their colleagues, will be recorded and reported across the nation.
I reached out repeatedly to the offices of all three men before writing this column. As noted above, I heard back from Estes. Good for him, and good for staff members who check their email messages. I didn’t hear back from Mann or Schmidt. That was especially disappointing given that Mann’s staff insisted three months ago that they were committed to communicating.
Apparently not when it comes to Jeffrey Epstein!
Anyway, I don’t want to think poorly of anyone. If Schmidt or Mann or their spokespeople want to send along a comment about the discharge petition — or the underlying bill — I will happily include it in an updated version of this column. I’ve done it before and will again. Their words and their stances matter.
Frankly, I haven’t written about Epstein or his crimes until now because I don’t see the controversy. Who would willingly block records about a rich and powerful sex offender? I don’t care about your party or political beliefs. 
Release the records, and let the chips fall where they may.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)With October finally coming to an end, last week I changed out my rotation of vampire books on tape for my old favorite podcast: Planet Money. 
Each time I spend an extended amount of time away from this podcast, I return wondering why I had. This time was no exception.
The episode I returned to was focused on a new class of remote workers, this time operating from prisons in Maine. 
During the COVID-19 recession, the rise of remote work led to new opportunities for inmates to take classes and work toward getting high school and college degrees. 
Naturally, the rise in remote opportunities and connections made through education also led to interest in having inmates engage in remote work.
Administrators saw remote work as an opportunity to reduce recidivism by helping reintegrate inmates easier and they also saw it as an opportunity for inmates to make money to pay court fees and restitution to victims and their families.
I should make clear: these are not prison workers making nominal amounts in order to qualify their work as employment. These are inmates making market-clearing wages. 
The compensation was so good that both the inmates asked in the story declined to say how much they made, though one software developer confirmed he was making upwards of $100,000.
These wages go toward taxes, court-ordered restitution, child support, room and board, and what is left after that can be kept by the inmate.
In an era when employers are wringing their hands about talent, Ohio’s incarcerated population is a group of people who do not currently have access to many employment opportunities. 
According to the state of Ohio, nearly 46,000 people are currently incarcerated in Ohio prisons, which equals nearly the entire population of Mansfield.
Of those 46,000 inmates, nearly three-quarters are in minimum- or medium-security prisons. 
But most do not have access to opportunities to work for market wages. 
Standard inmate wages as laid out in the Ohio Administrative Code cap at $24 per month. 
About 1,200 inmates (less than 3% of the total prison population) take part in the Ohio Penal Industries program, which is authorized to pay above the $24 per month limit for employment for workers. 
Of these, it is likely only a few hundred took part in the Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program, which pays market wages, and none took part in remote work.
A report from earlier this year says 40 Maine inmates took part in their Resident Remote Work program. 
That is a little over 2% of Maine’s 1,800 inmates. If a program in Ohio had a similar uptake, that would mean about 1,000 Ohio inmates would be taking part in remote work from prison.
Yes, there are some risks associated with remote work. 
But overall, this program has given an opportunity for inmates in Maine to contribute, develop their human capital, escape the recidivism cycle, at the same time that they earn resources that help pay child support, restitution, court fees and taxes, and for investments in the future and provide support for employers who need them. 
Why shouldn’t Ohio have this opportunity, too?

Falling for a scam can lead to losing money and putting your account and personal information at risk, which can be both time consuming and costly.
Here are some common seasonal scams and tips to help protect yourself:
            •           Missed packages or problems with delivery: Expecting a package? Be cautious of phishing messages through email or text impersonating delivery services like UPS or FedEx with links to view “missed deliveries.” These links may lead to fake sign-in pages or malware-infected sites. Do not respond to messages requesting personal or financial information, including money or cryptocurrency. Be wary of unexpected packages and avoid scanning QR codes, as they may be attempts to steal your information.
            •           Online deals that are too good to be true: When shopping online or on social media, buy only from trusted websites and vendors. If purchasing on a platform or marketplace, stay on the platform to complete transactions and communicate with sellers, as protections often only apply when you use the platform. Use payment methods that offer buyer protection, and never send money to strangers or use Zelle for purchases, especially when you can’t confirm the goods exist.
            •           Phony charities preying on your generosity: The holidays are also a season of giving. Before you donate money, double-check contact and payment information for your charity of choice and watch for text, email or phone call solicitations. Like any other unsolicited message, don’t click on links or open attachments that may contain malware or attempt to steal your information.
“Scammers do not discriminate and can target anyone during this festive season. Don’t let your guard down. Always remember that if something seems off, it likely is. By staying alert and informed, we can protect ourselves and our loved ones from falling victim during this holiday season,” said Darius Kingsley, Head of Consumer Banking Practices at Chase.
Tips to Avoid Scams:
            •           Don’t send money to unknown individuals or for goods or services that you can’t confirm exist.
            •           Be cautious of friendly messages from strangers on social apps. Scammers might try to build trust before asking for money.
            •           If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Watch out for deep discounts or low prices that may be scams.
            •           If you shop on social media marketplaces, never pay using Zelle—it is the same as cash and you may not get back if there is an issue.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)New College of Florida is on its intellectual deathbed.
Once an authority-challenging, free-thinking institution for students passionate about learning, a place where difference was celebrated and creativity encouraged.
Now, it is becoming a third-rate jock school with over-paid administrators and under-achieving freshmen, a casualty of Ron DeSantis’ culture wars.
NCF has announced it “will happily be the first college in America to formally embrace and sign President Trump’s vision for higher education,” a document called the “Compact for Academic Excellence.”
This compact has little to do with “excellence” and everything to do with coercion and control.
Universities must give up their First Amendment rights, as well as their right of free assembly. No more academic freedom: The government can assess the political viewpoints of every professor, administrator, librarian, student, and staff member, and mandate the “protection” of “conservative values.” 
Kind of reminds you of China, where universities are instruments of state communism.
In its legal analysis, the Knight First Amendment Institute says the compact allows the government to “‘transform or abolish’ academic departments” and police every aspect of university life, “empowering the government to determine the approved mix of faculty and student viewpoints and the permissible subjects of academic inquiry.”
If Trump or his minions decide they don’t want anyone teaching climate science or the history of Jim Crow, they can kill those subjects stone dead.
Knight says universities may “develop ‘models and values’ different from those of the Trump administration, but only if they ‘forego federal benefits.’”
Nice little college you got here. Be a shame if the Department of Education had to investigate you for criminal wokeness and snatch back your federal funding.
 ‘Ideological differences’
New College wasn’t on Trump’s initial list of nine (much larger, much more prestigious) universities, including Vanderbilt, Brown, MIT, Dartmouth, and the universities of Pennsylvania, Virginia, Southern California, Arizona, and Texas.
UT-Austin, where an administrator was recently fired for “ideological differences,” issued a statement saying it was “honored” to be on the list and was “enthusiastically” reviewing the compact, probably with a view to signing onto the administration’s demands.
Seven of the others have said a flat “no;” Vanderbilt is a probable “no.”
But New College can’t wait to officially obey in advance. It’s already done most of what Trump’s compact mandates.  
President Richard Corcoran has closed departments, shut down diversity initiatives, and attacked the college’s open, tolerant culture. 
Piles of books on LGBTQ+ issues, feminism, and the Holocaust ended up in a campus Dumpster.
The books were not imposed on students by pinko profs, they belonged to a library run by students.
Something like 40% of faculty have resigned; others have been fired or denied tenure.
Some long-serving teachers have even been insulted on their way out.
Amy Reid, a professor of French and founder of NCF’s now-canceled Gender Studies Program, was denied the title of “emerita” when she left after 30 years of teaching.
Emeritus status is honorary. You don’t get any money for it. It’s just a “thank you for your service.”
Reid was beloved by students and faculty but voted against Richard Corcoran becoming president. He vetoed the honor, citing her letter of resignation in which she wrote, “the New College where I once taught no longer exists.”
He sniffed, “She need not be burdened by further association with it.”
Professor of Music and Latin American Studies Hugo Viera-Vargas had the publications, the performance credits, and the support of distinguished scholars that should have assured tenure.
Yet NCF’s president and Board of Trustees refused to tenure him. Corcoran wouldn’t consider the qualitative data, the letters from grateful undergraduates Viera-Vargas helped publish their work in scholarly journals, or his interdisciplinary approach to the history of the Caribbean. 
 Seriously?
According to Corcoran, Viera-Vargas’ classes were too small, never mind that NCF advertises small class sizes as an educational plus. 
Viera-Vargas taught courses on the African diaspora and how race, gender, and music inform Caribbean society: mainstream academic pursuits in the 21st Century.
But Corcoran said he wants the college to move “toward a more traditional liberal arts institution.”
Ron DeSantis and Richard Corcoran’s hand-picked trustees include Trumpists, business people, lawyers, and academics associated with the rightist Claremont Institute, Hillsdale College  and The Heritage Foundation.
Christopher Rufo, the most notorious of the lot, takes credit for creating the moral panic over Critical Race Theory and perpetrated last year’s hysterical (in both senses) nonsense about Hatian immigrants barbecuing cats on their backyard grills.
Students and faculty are supposed to take this person seriously?
Then there’s the money.
You may recall that the governor, who loses no chance to trash higher education, has set up a Florida DOGE, a Mini-Me version of Elon Musk’s barbarian bros, which is supposed to eradicate what he calls the “ideological study stuff” in colleges and universities and ferret out that good old waste, fraud, and abuse.
You may also recall that Republicans have controlled this state for 30 years and DeSantis has been in office since 2019. 
Maybe he’s a little slow; maybe, as one critic said, it’s not so much “a serious policy effort and more like a bizarre attempt to stay relevant in national politics.”
The money
The governor’s attack-DOGEs found the cost of educating each undergraduate at NCF is close to $90,000 per year.
At the University of Florida, the state’s highest-ranking institution, the per-student cost is $45,000.
NCF’s president is one of the highest-paid in the state system, pulling in $1.3 million a year. 
The president of the University of Florida makes $2 million.
UF has 62,000 students; NCF has 881. 
What do New College students get for this lavish outlay of taxpayer money?
Sports! NCF is spending millions on athletic facilities and athletic scholarships for less-than-stellar students.
The SAT scores of the 2024 class are down 170 points from the pre-Corcoran era.
Here’s what else they get: a degree from a college tanking in the ratings.
Since 2023, NCF has plummeted 59 places.
It doesn’t exactly burnish the college’s reputation when it pulls stupid stunts like inviting actor, provocateur, and famous misogynist Russell Brand, soon to be tried on rape and sexual assault charges, to come and talk free speech.
NCF subsequently thought better of it, although it didn’t cancel him entirely.
He’s being “rescheduled.”
Nor does naming as 2024-25 presidential scholars the likes of Joseph Loconte, a Heritage Foundation fellow, and Bruce Gilley, a big fan of western imperialism.
Leconte is getting paid 165 grand for a year’s residency, while Gilley gets $130,000.
(See waste of money above).
When the Guardian newspaper asked Gilley to comment on his appointment at NCF, he responded in the finest tradition of classical scholarly decorum, saying, “F*** you, you ideological midwit.”
Gilley’s scholarship could be called “eccentric.” He argues colonialism was the best thing that ever happened to India, the Congo, and other benighted Third World hell holes.
Prof. Gilley might want to acquaint himself with the Amritsar Massacre of 1919, in which the British killed at least 1,000 Indians demonstrating in favor of independence.
Fringe academics
Or maybe take a look at the Congo under Belgian King Leopold II.
The place was a slave state, the king’s private rubber company.
At least 10 million died of starvation, disease, famine, and summary execution.
For the past two years, NCF has been pre-emptively dumbing itself down, embracing fringe academics, and suppressing speech it doesn’t like.
The college has even promised to erect a statue of Charlie Kirk.
Given all this, does it really matter if New College signs Trump’s compact?
Will anyone even notice? 
Maybe when the lawsuits begin.
Lawyers of all political stripes say the compact is unconstitutional.
Even the decidedly un-woke American Enterprise Institute is horrified: “For a university to bend to this pressure and sacrifice the academic freedom of its faculty is to abandon constitutive institutional commitments essential to both education and the pursuit of knowledge.”
Here’s the thing: Young people are not empty vessels to be filled up with what Florida’s governor calls “ideological stuff.” Not Marxism, not conservatism, not gender ideology, not historical propaganda.
They do not live in a bubble where everyone is white, Christian, and straight.
Sure, there are Kirk acolytes who want to pretend we can go back to the 1950s when men were men, women were housewives, and people of color knew their place.
But for most students, conservative indoctrination won’t work.
They’ve seen racism; they know the climate is in crisis; they are aware of homophobia and other forms of prejudice.
They live in the 21st Century, not the 19th.
New College will have been destroyed for nothing.

Invest in early-childhood education, equitable housing and providing a living wage.","The role of socioeconomic class on cardiovascular health outcome cannot be overemphasized. A child born to parents with college or advanced degrees will likely live an average of ten years longer than another child in the same city whose parents are without high school diplomas.
In Connecticut, adults with lower educational attainment are significantly more likely to be diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. In 2021, the state’s age-adjusted heart-disease death rate was 137.6 per 100,000 — a figure that underscores the structural gap in heart outcomes. Essentially, both hearts are on different trajectories largely due to the difference in socioeconomic status. 
The general school of thought in the United States is that cardiovascular problems are largely ascribed to dietary patterns, lifestyle and to some extent, family history. The unspoken truth however is that the prognosis of cardiovascular health is often set even before a patient’s first appearance in a clinic.
Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States. Despite advancements in treatment and medical innovation, it is surprising that there is still a rise in the burden of cardiovascular mortality as reported by the American Heart Association. Moreover, this burden is highest among individuals without college degrees. According to research, adults with less education are nearly two times more likely to die from heart disease than those with higher educational attainment. These outcomes represent the impact of social and economic status on health and life expectancy.
Social and economic factors influencing health outcomes have been described by public health researchers as “causes of causes.” As sociologists Bruce Link and Jo Phelan argued, diseases and social gradients are inseparable because resources like education, income, housing and power that significantly impact health are unevenly distributed. There is a direct correlation between socioeconomic status and health outcomes; the more advantages one has, the better access to opportunities to reduce cardiovascular risks. Those without these advantages are victims of food insecurity, unsafe neighborhoods, lack of insurance limiting access to preventive care.
Using blood pressure as a case study, an individual with a college degree is more likely to have health insurance and access to primary health care compared to an individual of the same age without a college degree. The individual with better access to health care benefits from regular screening and early detection of hypertension and other comorbidities. The prognosis of chronic diseases like hypertension is largely dependent on the stage of detection before the commencement of treatment. Another individual, for example, a single mother working two jobs without paid time off may be unwilling to take to take out time to see a doctor due to fear of losing wages or job termination. The longer her blood pressure goes untreated, the more likely she develops cardiovascular complications.
Educational disparities are not just a reflection of individual opportunity, they show how power and policy shape health. Environmental hazards, fast-food outlets and insecurity are more likely to be prevalent in communities with lower average education levels. These stressors play a role in contributing to the prevalence of cardiovascular problems like hypertension because disease processes are influenced by biological and environmental factors. Stressors cause the release of certain hormones like cortisol that play a role in the pathophysiology of hypertension.
The consequences of these disparities are evident here in Connecticut. In New Haven, there is a striking difference in neighborhoods a few miles apart not only in life expectancy but in cardiovascular outcomes. According to the Connecticut Department of Public Health, heart diseases are the top causes of death in the city however, this burden is highest in neighborhoods with lower household income and educational status. This difference is not due to chance, it is as a result of structural disparities, reflecting years of disinvestment and educational inequality—the true heart disease epidemic hiding in plain sight.
This is not to disregard the significant role of personal choices on health outcomes. Diet, exercise and smoking all influence cardiovascular risk and individuals have the responsibility of enforcing lifestyle modifications to improve their outcomes. However, these choices are not made in isolation, they are a reflection of environmental realities and health policies. A neighborhood with sidewalks encourages jogging as opposed to one with a high incidence of gun violence. It’s also easier to purchase and consume vegetables if the nearest grocery store isn’t three bus rides away. It’s easier to educate people about personal choices, however, we shouldn’t blame them for predictable outcomes if those personal choices are systematically limited by their environment.
Moving upstream is an effective strategy if the goal is to reduce the burden of heart disease. This involves investment in early-childhood education, equitable housing policies and guaranteeing living wage. These interventions may not be captured within the scope of preventive cardiology but in reality, offer the most effective heart disease prevention strategy. Further research has shown that for every additional year of education, the risk of heart disease and stroke is lower. This is a reflection of how impactful universal access to quality education can be on cardiovascular health.
Policies will drive the next major breakthrough in cardiovascular health. Expanding access to affordable housing, strengthening living wage laws, investing in early childhood education, and ensuring universal health coverage are the kinds of political reforms that can truly lower heart disease risk. 
We cannot stent our way out of structural inequality. Heart diseases may be measured using anatomical and physiological criteria but they are made in systems.

Wes Moore (D) has a difficult, but not insurmountable, path to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts — and it may hinge on the first-term Democratic executive’s ability to win votes in the Senate.
With the House of Delegates apparently on board with the governor, Moore needs to find 24 votes in the 47-member Senate to add Maryland to the list of states redrawing their congressional maps to gain partisan advantage ahead of the 2026 elections. But Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) put his 34-member caucus on record against redistricting on Oct. 28 with a three-page letter outlining a series of arguments against it.
The Moore administration has quietly cast doubt on how much support Ferguson has within his own caucus, and insists the field is constantly shifting. But for now at least, based on interviews with a number of Senate Democrats, Ferguson appears to be on solid footing with a majority of his caucus.
“I think that’s right,” said Sen. Cheryl C. Kagan (D-Montgomery County), vice chair of the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee, of the current state of affairs.
Kagan said she is generally supportive of the idea of drawing maps that eliminate the last Republican congressional district — the congressional map currently favors Democrats, who hold seven of the state’s eight U.S. House seats.
“If I had a magic wand, I would like an eight-to-zero map,” Kagan said.
But she said the state is “supremely unlikely” to contribute toward a national majority for her party, which has to be weighed against the threat of losing one or possibly two seats to Republicans, making Maryland “detrimental to the cause of winning a Democratic majority.”
“There’s an opportunity cost to this issue, because the time that we’re spending debating district lines should more wisely be spent on jobs, economic development, the climate crisis, civil rights, voting rights, health care, education and our budget challenges,” Kagan said. “There are so many public policy issues in front of us. At some point, this feels like a risky distraction.”

While the Republican Caucus also opposes midcycle redistricting, it is the Democratic caucus — which holds a 34-13 advantage in the Senate, and elected Ferguson to lead the body — that will determine the fate of the issue.
Maryland Matters sought interviews with more than 20 rank-and-file Senate Democrats — the bulk of the caucus. Roughly half agreed to an interview, though some asked to not be named. Others either declined an interview or did not respond to a request for comment.
Ferguson’s support — a broad term that includes senators who are merely deferential to their leader — appears to fall within a range of 20-25 of the Democratic Caucus’ 34 members,
A portion of that support comes from nearly a dozen lawmakers who make up his leadership team, including committee chairs and vice chairs.
“Clearly, the Senate does not have a strong desire to do redistricting,” said Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick), who described herself as leaning in support of Ferguson but “keeping an open mind.”
Even those who said they favor midcycle redistricting acknowledge Ferguson’s advantage.
“The caucus members were behind the Senate president with that [Oct. 28] letter,” said Sen. Arthur Ellis (D-Charles). “He didn’t do that on his own, lot of discussions before that.”
But Ellis said events nationally have changed since Ferguson sent that letter three weeks ago.
Democrats, and in many cases their constituents, want to oppose President Donald Trump. But that visceral desire is tempered, for some, by concerns that doing so could backfire and inadvertently give Republicans more congressional seats.
“We have to be very pragmatic and thoughtful as we pursue this,” said Sen. Ben Kramer (D-Montgomery). “I get the emotions that are in play. I understand that there’s a lot of desire to push back on the administration. I’m sure there are places where Maryland can participate in that. I’m just not sure that this issue is one of those where we’re ultimately going to be a player.”
Kramer said he opposes the effort because of the risk of losing seats to Republicans or the courts tossing out new maps.
Ferguson has clear opponents, including Sen. Clarence K. Lam (D-Howard and Anne Arundel), who filed a bill in August calling for midcycle redistricting. Lam declined to comment for this story, but he isn’t alone.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I’m hoping that we will call a special session to get this done right away,” said Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s). “We cannot let Trump continue to do what he’s doing and let Democrats look weak — as though we’re doing nothing.”
Ellis agreed with Muse.
“So to be honest, we’re taking it serious,” Ellis said. “We thought our one seat wasn’t important — our extra one Republican seat — but obviously it is to the national discussion. So a lot of talk, a lot of movement …. I’m not sure what the end result will be, but there’s a lot of discussion going on right now.”
Ellis said he’s hearing from constituents who are “reaching out to me, like: ‘Hey, join California, join the other states who are doing it.’”
“I have to listen to my constituents, and I believe most of my colleagues believe the same, and so we are able to change our mind,” he said. “And if enough members on the caucus, Democratic caucus, change our minds, then it will happen.”
Ellis said he would vote for redistricting if a bill comes to the floor, but he doubts the issue will reach the full Senate.
“If a bill comes on the floor of the Senate, yes, I’ll vote for it,” he said, before adding, “We don’t bring things on the floor, being a super majority, that’s going to fail.”
Moore could decide to call a special session before the legislature is scheduled to convene in mid-January. The governor convened a five-member redistricting advisory commission, led by U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), that held two meetings last week with a third scheduled Tuesday.
If called back into special session, lawmakers will first have to take up any overrides of Moore vetoes, including his veto of a bill creating a commission to study on reparations.

In his veto message, Moore said the reparations commission would be redundant — ironic, Ellis said, given Moore’s position on the creation of a redistricting panel.
“So why is the redistricting commission good for this thing that he wants to do now, but when we pass the reparations commission, he says it’s a waste of time?” Ellis asked.
Ellis said he looks forward to being able to work on a redistricting effort.
“I also look forward to override his veto of the reparations commission bill,” he said.
A spokesperson for the governor did not respond to a request for comment for this story. But supporters of redistricting have other levers to pull to bring senators to their side.
Moore last week announced the creation of a campaign slate that would focus on supporting and electing Democratic lawmakers supportive of his agenda. Redistricting was not specifically highlighted, but the timing of the announcement came as his redistricting advisory panel was holding its first meeting, angering Democrats in the House and Senate.
National Democrats are entering the fray, too. In a letter last Monday to the General Assembly, Reps. Steny Hoyer (D-4th) and Jamie Raskin (D-8th) lobbied hard for redistricting.
“We can redistrict to make Maryland House seats more competitive in a way that counters the Trump national steamroller, and we believe such an effort can survive any legal attack,” the Congressmen wrote.
Ellis said a call from Hoyer solidified his position.
“We’re not stiff, unyielding, people. I mean, we can be influenced, and we can change our minds, right?” Ellis said.

	Muse said he spoke with the governor’s office about redistricting, and got calls from Hoyer and from Rep. Jim Clyburn (D- S.C.). “I just said that: ‘I’m where you are,'” Muse said.
Ferguson’s letter made much of the potential legal challenges associated with drawing a new map.
A court-drawn map would be an extraordinary, but not without precedent. In 2002, the state’s highest court struck down the state’s legislative districts map with less than a month before the filing deadline for candidates, so the court drew its own map rather than send it back to lawmakers.
The congressional districts approved in 2022 followed a process prescribed by the Maryland Constitution. Because of that, it is not known if the court would feel the same sense of urgency if it struck down a new map.
Unspoken in Ferguson’s letter is the real concern that the court would not redraw the map but send it back to lawmakers with restrictions on how districts are drawn and what can and cannot be considered. Such an order could set an unwanted standard for future redistricting.
Hoyer and Raskin argue that the courts are limited in what they can do.
“While Senator Ferguson is obviously right that there is an element of uncertainty in all litigation, there are some well-established doctrines that courts follow out of deference to the legislature’s constitutional power over redistricting,” Hoyer and Raskin wrote. “Chief among these is the principle that, when a court strikes down a newly elected map as unlawful, the legislature must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to remedy the violation.”
Muse agreed, saying: “Whatever the judges do, we’re the Senate, and we write the laws.”

Moore’s redistricting push comes in response to President Donald Trump’s push to get Republican-led states to redistrict early, with the goal of drawing more GOP-friendly districts, easing the party’s effort to retain its hold on the House of Representatives in 2026.
Trump succeeded in Texas, where Gov. Greg Abbott signed a new map into law in August. But California voters this month approved a new map that has the potential to cancel any gains in Texas.
But Republicans have also redrawn maps in Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio. Notably, court challenges are still underway in many red states.
Maryland has only the one seat in GOP hands that it could try to flip, the Eastern Shore-based 1st District held by Republican Andy Harris. Some argue the 6th District, which encompasses part of Montgomery County and the Western Maryland panhandle, is a competitive district. That seat is held by Democratic Rep. April McClain Delaney.
Sen. Charles E. Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County) said that anger from registered Republicans, who are outnumbered 2-1 by registered Democrats in Maryland, would be justified, if the state were to redraw its maps so that all eight districts lean left.
Sydnor said he’s sympathetic because he fought gerrymandering in his own county, after the county council packed voters of color into two majority-Black districts, which a court later overturned, determining that the map diluted the Black vote.
“I’m particularly sensitive to the feeling of one attempting to disenfranchise you. So, I don’t think it’s the right answer,” Sydnor said of midcycle redistricting.
By comparison, Sen. Mary-Dulany James (D-Harford) said that if a redistricting bill reached the floor in the Senate, her vote would depend on the map in front of her. She believes her district in Harford County, District 34, would be better off in a congressional district of Western Shore counties around Baltimore, not lumped in with the Eastern Shore, as it is today.
“I want to protect Harford County,” James said. “Harford County has been thrown about, and District 34 has been thrown about, in various maps over the years.”
The 1st District, in yellow, is the only one currently held by a Republican in Maryland’s congressional delegation. (Screenshot)
Overall though, James said she thinks redistricting is risky, and “the president of the senate has put his finger on the really great challenges facing Maryland if we were to consider redistricting.”
Other Senate Democrats told Maryland Matters they have yet to make up their minds, including Sen. Ben Brooks (D- Baltimore County).
“Are we talking about something that’s going to make a major difference in Maryland? Or are we talking about something that’s going to make an impact statement nationwide? That’s the conundrum,” Brooks said.
Brooks said he hears varying opinions from his constituents, but plenty of people are in favor, largely because they see Trump’s policies as egregious.
“Because of what’s going on now nationally — the shutdown, even the tearing down of the East Wing. It’s got a lot of people exercised,” Brooks said. “The arresting people who are cutting grass, at Home Depot or at McDonald’s. … All of those things weigh heavily on fairness in the minds of people.”
As legislators weigh their decision, they also must consider the political leanings of their district.
In Anne Arundel County, Stephen A. Tillett, a minister, is challenging Senate Finance Chair Sen. Pamela Beidle in next year’s Democratic primary. Tillett was a featured speaker at a recent State House rally demanding Ferguson pass a redistricting bill.
Sen. Nick Charles (D-Prince George’s) said his constituents seem to broadly support redistricting, so he would feel comfortable voting for it. But he is also weighing the fact that the move could put Democrats in danger of losing a seat or two in the House.
“I can vote for it and the people in my district would love it,” Charles said. “But there’s possibilities that things could happen.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC06141-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-17 00:57:04.596138

(Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline) Immigrants and their allies gathered in downtown Raleigh Sunday afternoon to protest the federal Border Patrol’s deployment to Charlotte.
Protestors said it was important to mobilize rapidly and demand that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement leave the state while also standing in defense of immigrant families facing escalating threats.
Ariana Perez said she was marching in Raleigh because she was worried about what might happen to her own parents if a similar crackdown were to occur in the Triangle. She was troubled by social media posts claiming to show Border Patrol tactics in Charlotte.
“I don’t think it’s justified,” Perez said. “They are pushing them out of the cars [to the ground] rather than just talking to them.”
Video shared with WBTV show border agents smashing the driver’s side window of one motorist’s vehicle while allegedly searching for undocumented immigrants. The motorist, who was not arrested and says he is a U.S. citizen, said the federal agents were looking for Latino people, not criminals.
In a statement Saturday, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin said, “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed. There have been too many victims of criminal illegal aliens.”
The DHS statement listed several detainees the agency claims have criminal records that make them a threat to the Charlotte community. The agency said it made 81 arrests in Charlotte Saturday. No numbers for Sunday were available at the time of publication.
On Saturday, Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners Chair Mark Jerrell and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education Chair Stephanie Sneed issued a joint statement urging people wishing to demonstrate to do so without resorting to the violence witnessed in other cities.
“Our region has thrived and grown because our strength lies in our diversity and our collective commitment to each other and to this community,” they said in the statement. “Let us all — no matter our political allegiance – stand together for all hard working and law-abiding families.”
While Sunday’s gathering in Raleigh was peaceful, Coco Ferguson, who said she worries for immigrant friends and family, said she hopes that many more North Carolinians will  pay attention and raise their voice in the coming weeks.
“It takes every American citizen to fight ICE and to stop them from what they’re doing,” Ferguson said.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced Sunday that she would comply with what she described as “unlawful” court orders to reschedule two special elections for vacant legislative seats.
The announcement came four days after the Arkansas Supreme Court denied Sanders’ request to pause two Pulaski County Circuit Court orders to move the elections, originally scheduled for June 9, to an earlier date while she pursued appeals.
UPDATED: Arkansas Supreme Court rejects request to delay court orders in special election cases

Under the new election schedule, which Sanders wrote was being set “under duress and with objection to the unlawful court order,” both Senate District 26 and House District 70 will have special general elections on March 3, 2026, with the special primary newly set for Jan. 6.
“The court has ruled that I must set special election dates that would give overseas military members insufficient time to vote, violating Arkansas law and potentially invalidating the entire election,” Sanders said in the proclamations. 
“While I object to this ruling, I will comply with the court’s order and remain confident that on appeal, the law plainly giving me the authority to set special elections will be upheld, ensure our elections are free, fair, and secure, and protect the right to vote for our heroes who put their lives on the line to keep us free,” she wrote.
Sanders’ proclamations made no mention of the Supreme Court’s ruling against her request for a stay of those orders.
Sanders set special elections for the Senate District 26 and House District 70 seats for June 9, 2026, after the death of Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch and the resignation of Rep. Carlton Wing of North Little Rock to lead Arkansas PBS in September.
But the June date occurs after the Legislature’s fiscal session in April, which generated bipartisan criticism and lawsuits from SD 26 and HD 70 voters, who said it would deprive them of representation for important legislative deliberations on issues like education and prison funding.
The Democratic Party of Arkansas, which is a plaintiff in the HD 70 lawsuit, issued a statement Sunday night calling Sanders’ decision to move the special elections to March “a huge win for democracy and for representation in Arkansas.”
“This proclamation achieves the goal of our lawsuit — to ensure the 30,000 Arkansans in House District 70 have representation,” DPA Chair retired Col. Marcus Jones said in the statement.
“Pulaski County election officials have previously confirmed they are ready and can assure a secure and fair election,” Jones said.
What the law says
Under Arkansas law, the governor is required to schedule a special election date to fill a vacancy within 150 days unless she finds it “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so. Further, if the election can’t be held within 150 days, the law requires it to be held on the earliest practicable date after that statutory deadline.
A June 9 election would be 252 days after Wing’s Sept. 30 resignation — or 152 days after the 150-day mark. The summer election date would be 280 days  after Stubblefield’s seat became vacant. The average number of days a special election has been held after the 150-day mark since 2011 is about 25 days, according to an unpublished Senate memo.
Circuit judges in both lawsuits sided with the plaintiffs and ordered Sanders to schedule the elections earlier, finding that the June dates were impermissible under state law and the U.S. and Arkansas constitutions, though the reasoning varied between the cases. 
In the HD 70 case, Pulaski County Circuit Judge Shawn Johnson explicitly ordered Sanders to set the general special election for March 3, 2026. In the SD 26 case, Pulaski County Circuit Judge Patricia James said Sanders needed to set it “as soon as practicable” after the 150-day deadline, but did not specify when.
While Sanders said she is complying, she wrote in her proclamations that “the circuit court substituted judicially invented election policy for the General Assembly’s lawfully enacted statutes” and usurped her statutory authority.

Richard Blumenthal spoke at a press conference about permanent housing funding on Friday, Nov. 14, 2025, at the Legislative Office Building in Hartford. He was joined by legislators, service providers and individuals who had experienced homelessness. (Photo by Josie Reic /CT Mirror)Chris, a Connecticut resident, struggled with homelessness for years as he battled major depression and HIV.
He stayed at the Mercy Housing and Shelter Corporation and was eventually able to get a job and an apartment, which the organization subsidized. The shelter’s help is the “only reason” he is housed, safe, healthy and “living with dignity” today, he said, speaking at a press conference Friday.
But the Trump administration said late Thursday that it planned to cut federal funding for permanent housing programs like the one that helped Chris, who asked to be identified by only his first name.
In Connecticut, the policy change means long-term housing programs could lose as much as $69 million, risking the housing of 6,500 people, according to estimates from the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness and the CT CAN End Homelessness campaign.
A notice from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development posted Thursday announced changes to what’s known as the Continuum of Care program, which provides most federal homelessness relief funding. Having a disability is a condition to receive permanent housing through Continuum of Care.
According to the notice, the Trump administration plans to lower the cap on permanent housing spending from 90% to 30% of all homelessness relief funding. Instead, funding will flow to programs that provide temporary housing with work requirements, treatment mandates and other conditions.
At the Friday event, held by U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, service providers spoke out against the policy, saying that permanent housing is the most effective, proven method for supporting unhoused people.
For decades, U.S. policy has been guided by a theory, known as “Housing First,” that permanent shelter is a necessary first step for people, who can then — from a more stable living situation — move on to finding health care and steady work.
The Trump administration favors a different approach.
A U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said in a press release Thursday, “The failed ‘Housing First’ ideology… encourages dependence on endless government handouts while neglecting to address the root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.” The press release described the policy change as an effort to increase accountability for service providers by creating competition between them for grants.
Louis Gill, CEO of housing aid nonprofit Columbus House, said it’s hard for people to improve their lives without first having permanent housing. “When you destabilize housing, you destabilize everything built upon it: medical care, mental health, sobriety, income, employment, community, and safety,” he said.
Gill added that the Trump administration’s policy change will force people who have already become self sufficient to start over, especially those with disabilities.
“These cuts ask providers to look disabled, medically fragile residents in the eye and tell them that the stability they built, the stability our government promised them through this program, may no longer be within reach,” he said.
Sarah Fox, CEO of the CT Coalition to End Homelessness, said it’s not so simple to rework longstanding programs to comply with the new rules. Providers are set up to supply permanent housing and most grants will now be awarded for temporary housing with strings attached, she said. “It is a big separation from our morals.”
 What comes next

Critics of the new policy said they hope to stop it from going into effect — or find other funding.
Jennifer Paradis, executive director of the Beth-El Center shelter, said she believes the change is illegal. For one, she said, the policy directs funding to programs that help police clear homeless camps and mandate mental health or addiction treatment in exchange for housing.
“Nothing in the law authorizes HUD to require criminalization or treatment compliance as a condition of funding,” Paradis said. She also argued it discriminates against disabled people.
Sen. Blumenthal said he expects there to be lawsuits against the policy.
Blumenthal wants Congress to pass a budget appropriation of $4 billion that specifically requires permanent housing. “It’s on us,” he said.
Connecticut legislators said permanent housing could be funded with some of a $500 million emergency fund they approved on Thursday. Gov. Ned Lamont has discretion over how to use the money, though it’s intended generally to backfill federal funding losses for human services.
State Representative Eleni Kavros DeGraw, D-Avon, said she wants to “ensure that that $500 million gets spent, and that some of it gets spent on this.”
But she said that the emergency fund isn’t enough to support permanent housing along with other programs that have lost funding. “Do we honestly believe that that will be enough when we are hearing just the numbers for this one issue?” she said.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star)Anna Hill first started listening to Dr. Nirav Shah’s daily pandemic updates in 2020 when he was head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and would tune in every day. At the time, she had to live separately from her husband to take care of her aging mother and was overwhelmed with anxiety about COVID-19. Despite the grim news, those daily updates would soothe her. 
“The first day he came on, I felt like I’ve got a friend,” said the Wells resident. “Even when he was talking about deaths, he was still optimistic and reassuring.” 
That year, she bought a “Dr. Nirav Shah for President” shirt, and her daughter’s Christmas gift to her included a candy bar with Shah’s face on it. When Hill learned that Shah was throwing his hat in the ring for governor earlier this year, her decision of whom to vote for was already made. 
Hill attended Shah’s town hall in Portland on Sunday sporting her “Shah for President” shirt. She started crying when she got the chance to meet him after the event.
“He speaks to everyone in a language they can understand,” she said, explaining what makes him a good candidate. “And if they get scared, he has an answer.”

Shah’s first public town hall, which drew more than 100 people, emphasized his public health experience both in Maine and at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
He also discussed priorities for Maine’s future including housing, health care and affordability, and his criticism of President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — specifically what he described as the federal government’s agenda to withhold health care and food from people who need it the most.
“If Donald Trump wants to adversely affect the rights of any single person in Maine, I pledge to you he will have to go through me first,” Shah said to the room, which burst into prolonged applause.
The 48-year former CDC director told the audience they should ask “no easy questions.” He talked for over an hour about his views on the recent government shutdown, priorities for health care spending and his strategy to address rising marketplace insurance premiums, and thoughts on Maine’s affordability crisis. 
In a crowded Democratic field, Shah is facing several establishment politicians, including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, Former Speaker of the Maine House Hannah Pingree and former Senate President Troy Jackson.
Linda Austin, who attended the town hall, hosted Shah and a small group of people at her Topsham home before he announced his campaign to discuss what his candidacy might look like. 
“I worry he’s entering into a field which at this point in time is ugly, so it’ll be interesting to see how he navigates that,” she said.“Politics may not be his arena, but problem-solving is.”
That’s exactly what Shah emphasized Sunday when asked about his lack of political experience.
After serving in the Biden administration as principal deputy director at the U.S. CDC, Shah returned to Maine this year to teach at Colby College. 
His time leading several large public health agencies has taught him a lot about having tough conversations with people who don’t agree with him, he said. He also highlighted his experience managing large budgets and achieving goals, such as Maine’s high COVID-19 vaccination and booster rates.
“The work is running a really big thing, often in a time of crisis, stress and strain, and communicating with folks about it, and that is the work that I have done for the past 12 years in public service,” Shah said.
“We have lived way too long under the notion that bad things can’t happen in Maine,” Shah said, referring to floods, fires, health care crises and mass violence. “But they have all happened and unfortunately will continue to happen, so the next governor needs to be ready to go when the first crisis hits, and I am ready.”.
Supporters favor Shah’s fact-based approach 
Austin, who is an independent, was won over by Shah’s ideas during that exploratory conversation, and plans to vote for him. So does Falmouth-based physician Dr. James Kirsch. He asked Shah during the town hall about some congressional Democrats agreeing to end the shutdown without securing an extension of the tax credits that lower the cost of coverage purchased through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. 
“I thought the capitulation and the caving by the Democrats was unconscionable, Shah replied.
“They closed the government for 40 days and got nothing in return.”
He said that food and health care are being used as “political pawns.”
“Washington is broken and we here in Maine are going to have to fend for ourselves,” he said, adding that is “yet another reason why the governor’s race matters so much.”
Kirsch said Shah’s plan to prioritize health spending on primary care, vaccine education and reproductive health are part of the reason he is capable of leading the state in times of increasing costs and uncertainty. Shah has a “human approach,” he said.
Observing how Shah managed the pandemic, Kirsch, who is a physician, said he’s convinced that his lack of political experience won’t count against him. 
“I think that’s one of his strong suits; that he hasn’t been an elected politician,” he said. 
The crowded governor’s field doesn’t matter to Marisa Zalmanis and Erik Sulcs, who attended the event together. Nor does the fact that Shah is not from the state, as they are also both transplants to the state.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)President Donald Trump on Sunday called out two Indiana “RINO Senators,” as well as Gov. Mike Braun, for the state’s failure to move forward with redrawing congressional boundaries.
Braun worked behind the scenes for months to garner legislative support and eventually called a special session for a new map. Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray on Friday announced the caucus still doesn’t have the necessary votes and that his chamber would not convene Dec. 1, as planned.
“Very disappointed in Indiana State Senate Republicans, led by RINO Senators Rod Bray and Greg Goode, for not wanting to redistrict their State, allowing the United States Congress to perhaps gain two more Republican seats,” Trump posted to Truth Social on Sunday morning.
“The Democrats have done redistricting for years, often illegally, and all other appropriate Republican States have done it,” he continued. “Because of these two politically correct type ‘gentlemen,’ and a few others, they could be depriving Republicans of a Majority in the House, A VERY BIG DEAL!”
The president has been pushing GOP-led states to change their congressional maps to ensure a Republican U.S. House majority in 2026. Some Democratic-controlled states have responded in kind, moving to add more blue seats.
Trump said “no one” is calling out California, which passed a constitutional amendment in the recent election to pick up five seats, and blamed “weak ‘Republicans'” for causing problems — like “crazy Policies and Ideas that are so bad for America.”
Then, Trump turned his attention to Braun, who has been a vocal supporter of his.
“Also, a friend of mine, Governor Mike Braun, perhaps, is not working the way he should to get the necessary Votes. Considering that Mike wouldn’t be Governor without me (Not even close!), is disappointing!” Trump wrote.
He ended his lengthy post by saying any Republican voting against redistricting should face a primary opponent.
“Indiana is a State with strong, smart, and patriotic people. They want us to see our Country WIN, and want to, “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Senators Bray, Goode, and the others to be released to the public later this afternoon, should DO THEIR JOB, AND DO IT NOW! If not, let’s get them out of office, ASAP.”
Thirteen Senate Republicans have announced their support with eight publicly against.
Neither Bray nor Goode — along with 17 other Senate Republicans — have said where they stand on the redistricting proposal.
Bray has repeatedly reported a lack of supportive votes among the 40-member caucus, while Goode recently held a town hall to hear from constituents on redistricting. Not one person spoke in support.

For the past 30 years, it’s been clear: Native American children in Washington state are far more likely to be arrested and jailed than white kids. 
The state’s courts and Washington Department of Youth and Families have acknowledged the justice system continues to hold back Native American youth, funding committees and producing action plans to address racial inequities in the juvenile legal system. Advocates have called for fewer arrests, many of which are discretionary. Lawmakers have demanded more data on juvenile arrests.
Yet the gaps have continually worsened. Data from the nonprofit Sentencing Project and the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention from 2019-23, the most recent available, shows that Native American children in Washington are more than 4.5 times more likely to be incarcerated than their white peers on average, up from 2.7 times more in 2001.
“As long as we’ve looked at data for Washington state, Native youth are much, much more likely to be incarcerated than their white peers,” said Joshua Rovner, a senior research analyst and the former youth policy director for the Sentencing Project, which researches incarceration nationwide.
While all youth of color experience unequal treatment in Washington state’s legal system, the inequities among Native American youth are especially stark, exceeding national averages, particularly for nonviolent offenses.
Indigenous children are significantly more likely to be jailed than their white peers in Washington, especially on the lowest level offenses and nonviolent crimes, Rovner said. Even when youth exit the system, courts are more inclined to send them back if they slip up.
Though there aren’t disparities in arrests and referrals present in every county of the state, the gaps, where they do exist, are so great they have shaped the statewide numbers.
In rural counties like Whitman County, the problems are worse — Native American children there are nearly seven times more likely to be arrested than white children, the largest disparity in the state based on 2023 data.
In Okanogan County, near the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Native American children made up 52% of all juvenile arrests in 2022 despite only 8% of the county’s population being Native American. Colville citizens and lawyers representing those kids say many in the community feel that they are unfairly targeted by state law enforcement — pointing to high rates of discretionary searches of Native American drivers and traffic cameras directed at main roads on and off tribal land.
Even before they’re convicted of a crime, Native American children are 6.4 times more likely to be kept in detention than white children. After being tried in court, they’re 6.1 times more likely to be kept in custody rather than being given opportunities to serve their sentence in the community.
Advocates and those who work alongside young people in the state say the disparities are partly the result of structural racism in the criminal legal system rather than an intrinsic difference in behavior.
“I do not know what the solution is,” said Suzanne Hayden, an attorney with the Clallam County Public Defenders office and the sole attorney in the county who works with youth. “I don’t know how to make it different, unless I, you know, call the judge on his rulings afterwards and say, ‘Well, Your Honor, you were really racist.’”
Seattle lawyer Gabe Galanda, an Indigenous rights attorney, advocate and a citizen of the Round Valley Tribe, said Native Americans in Washington are also frequently unable to afford their own representation, and some Indigenous kids go through the system without the support of a parent or guardian.
“They’re going it alone,” Galanda said.
 Overpoliced

As a teenager, Derrick Belgarde was himself stuck in the revolving door of youth incarceration.
“I spent so much time in (detention), I was in and out, in and out, in and out for probation violations,” said Belgarde.
It took years of fighting the unrelenting beast of alcohol addiction — and the support of a rehab program that understood his culture and needs — for Belgarde to make his way to sobriety.
Now, in both his family and community, he sees how young people who lacked proper help and support during their formative years continue to struggle as adults to break that cycle.
“It was like a machine,” Belgarde said. “And it creates more harm than good.”
For kids trying to get on the right path, jail can start to feel like a never-ending cycle, according to Belgarde, a citizen of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians and executive director at the Chief Seattle Club, a Native American-led housing and support services organization.
Early court involvement is closely linked to broader social and health inequities, research shows. Children drawn into the justice system often face poverty, unstable housing and limited access to mental health support, creating a cycle of disadvantage that persists into adulthood.
Belgarde’s repeated arrests caused rifts between him and his mother, who at one point threatened to sue the court system for disruptions in the family.
“It was ruining the household,” Belgarde said.
Native American children are disproportionately more likely than white kids to get caught up in that system.
Though they’re 2.5 times more likely to be arrested for a violent crime, Indigenous children are seven times as likely to be charged for nonviolent property crimes, according to 2023 data from the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.
Inside a youth prison in Marion County, Oregon, harsh conditions intensified Belgarde’s feelings of isolation and despair.
“It was very traumatizing,” he said. “It was very horrendous, and I can see how other kids probably got very damaged from going in and out of that place.”
Advocates say Native American kids are also disproportionately arrested for charges where officers are not mandated by law to make an arrest, such as for obstruction of justice, which is when a person is accused of hindering or delaying a law enforcement officer in doing their duties. 
“Obstruction [of justice] especially is, I feel, the most abused,” said Allie Steinberg, the diversion workshop coordinator with CHOOSE 180, an organization that provides diversion services to young adults in Pierce and King counties.
She added that overpolicing of communities of color leads to more discretionary arrests.
“Maybe nothing illegal actually happened, but the police officer was like, ‘I don’t like the way that you’re talking to me’ or ‘I’ve had a bad day.’”
Washington’s Department of Children, Youth and Families, which oversees the state’s juvenile incarceration system, faces serious overcrowding and complaints of mistreatment at its juvenile rehabilitation facilities, particularly Green Hill School, the state’s only facility equipped to handle boys and young men between the ages of 16 and 25. In an effort to alleviate overcrowding, the child welfare agency has been regularly transferring some incarcerated young people to minimum-security adult prisons. 
 Higher standards

Indigenous children are not only more likely to enter the justice system than white kids, but data shows Indigenous children have less room for error, even after they’ve been released.
“There have been white kids who go in front of a judge for probation violations, and the kids are saying, ‘Just give me another chance, I can prove this to you,’ and those kinds of things,” Hayden said. “And to my amazement and surprise, the judge will say, ‘OK.’”
But Hayden said this summer she had a Native American client sent back to jail over a probation violation, despite the child writing a three-page letter explaining his situation and promising to improve, which the child’s probation officer refused to read. 
“He wouldn’t even give this kid the respect of reading an incredibly well written, well thought out letter, and just went through a litany of everything this kid has ever done wrong in his life,” she said.
Hayden asked for a week for the kid to demonstrate improvement, but the judge refused. The child was sent back to jail for 30 days.
“As far as I was concerned, the court system had just told this kid, ‘We don’t believe what you have to say. We don’t care how well you say it. We don’t have any hope for you. So go sit in detention,’” Hayden said. “I’m appalled that that just happened. … I was so incensed in court that this guy wouldn’t even read the letter.”
Hayden says the boy received “very little” help with community re-entry
According to 2023 data from the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Indigenous juveniles in Washington are nearly 30 times more likely to be sent back to detention over an administrative probation violation, like missing a check-in with their probation officer, than white children. 
Wanda Bertram, communications strategist for the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit research group that advocates against incarceration, said the fact that Washington is jailing children over these violations is striking.
“These aren’t even crimes, right?” Bertram said. “These aren’t reasons for kids to be locked up.”
For Hayden, the court failed to look at the full picture of the child’s case before sending him back to jail, she said. 
“I was very upset at the judge for not giving this kid just a one week bump,” Hayden said. “You know, let him show what he can do in one week — he did it for all the little blue-eyed blondes.”
Despite growing evidence that children, particularly those accused of nonviolent crimes, do better in the future when given alternatives to jail like therapy and anger management, Indigenous children are offered fewer opportunities to do so.
“There’s no outcome where formal court processing does better for these kids,” Rovner said. 
 Starting in schools 

School can be another entry point into the criminal legal system, and Native American students in Washington are suspended and expelled at rates significantly higher than their white peers. Despite reforms aimed at promoting equity, statewide discipline data show a continuing trend of exclusionary practices.
In some districts, like Okanogan County, the connection between truancy and juvenile court is particularly stark. Truancy involves long-term, frequent and unexcused absences from school, and if classroom interventions to improve attendance don’t work, a child can be sent to court for it, at the behest of the school district.
Nearly 41% of truancy cases in the county involve Native American youth, primarily from the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, many of whom face barriers like a lack of transportation to school or mental health support. 
Belgarde was assigned a truancy officer in high school, who checked in on his school attendance and saw he was home by a curfew.
It didn’t work, and he kept struggling with school, skipping classes and feeling isolated. These patterns contribute to higher dropout rates and place Native American youth on a trajectory for greater risk of incarceration later in life. According to Washington’s child welfare agency, dropping out of school triples the likelihood of future involvement in the criminal legal system.
Belgarde dropped out of school himself, started working and became a young father by 18.
“When they let me off, I left home, but I didn’t have nowhere to go,” he said.
Native American children make up 26% of the state’s truant children despite making up around 1% of the school population, and they have the highest rate of truancy cases sent to juvenile court in the state, at roughly 10%.
Many Indigenous families have a historical mistrust of school and state systems based on prior abuses of Indigenous children in residential boarding schools and forced separations of Indigenous families by the federal government. When families don’t appear in court for truancy allegations, children are at risk of being placed under state supervision or referred for formal court charges, deepening their contact with the legal system.
Natalie Welch, a citizen of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and the executive director of Rise Above, a Seattle-based nonprofit dedicated to empowering Native American youth, said that providing Native American children with increased support and community connections helps keep them out of the legal system.
“It’s a smart investment to put this money into helping kids upfront instead of trying to solve the problems on the backend,” Welch said.
Rise Above has partnered with school districts with high rates of truancy among Native American students to provide incentives for kids to show up to class. Her organization works with local businesses, schools and organizations to offer free sports clinics, mentorship and community involvement opportunities. Improving accessibility to such programs, particularly for middle school-aged students who are at a critical stage in their development, is important for avoiding bad behavior, she said.
“We’re trying to be there so they build that trust before anything bad happens,” Welch added.
 Left out of reforms

Advocates for Native Americans say Washington lawmakers should revisit a number of reforms, like considering tribal notifications for Indigenous youth involved in a juvenile court case or addressing specific statutes that youth of color are disproportionately charged with.
Still, data gaps exist that limit the understanding of the true scope of disparities involving Native American youth.
Tribal affiliation isn’t regularly recorded when youth are arrested, and courts aren’t required to alert tribes when their youth enter state court systems. That limits any potential cross-jurisdictional collaboration that could connect Native American youth to tribal resources for mental health, substance use or behavioral issues.
Hayden, the public defender, said that in her experience, tribes can step up to provide resources, like housing support or counseling, for kids in a tough spot.
Race data reported to the state and federal government to track youth in the system is typically collected through self-identification or through law enforcement officials’ estimates, which may undercount Native American youth or lump them into a “multiracial” category.
Washington has enacted broad juvenile justice reforms in recent years like allowing juvenile courts to retain jurisdiction until a person is aged 25 for crimes committed before they turned 18, expanding mandatory diversion for children accused of first-time, low-level offenses and ending the automatic use of juvenile “points” during sentencing, which can increase a child’s time in jail and impact sentencing decisions if they’re later charged as an adult.
But measures to explicitly address the disparities Native American children face in the justice system have been few — and recent efforts to address the inequities stemming from past use of juvenile points have died in the Washington Legislature, despite significant endorsement from advocates and groups representing tribes.
In the 2025 session, House Bill 1274 would have allowed for the resentencing of adults whose sentences were influenced by juvenile points, meaning crimes they committed as youths lengthened their sentence as an adult for a different crime. Tribal officials and advocates say Native American people in Washington are disproportionately impacted by the sentencing practice, which effectively punishes people a second time.
The Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, an organization representing the interests of 54 tribal governments in the Northwest, and the American Civil Liberties Union have repeatedly called on the Legislature to change this process, pointing to how Native Americans are disproportionally impacted.
“Overly long state prison sentences resulting from incorrect choices made by Indigenous persons when they were juveniles diminish their hope for forgiveness, redemption, rehabilitation, return to their families, and reentry into their communities,” according to a 2023 resolution by the group.
Although HB 1324 eliminated the automatic application of juvenile points in 2023,  the bill wasn’t retroactive — leaving around 420 Native American people in the state’s prisons whose sentences were lengthened because of points as of 2023, and later bills to make the law retroactive have failed. That’s unlikely to change anytime soon. Advocates like Galanda say there’s little appetite in Olympia to pass legislation in the coming session that would allow their resentencing due to budget constraints.
Some Washington lawyers who work with Native American clients say the state is missing a critical opportunity to notify tribal governments that their minor citizen is involved in a state court case, which could allow the tribe to intervene with meaningful assistance, like legal, financial or spiritual support. A similar mechanism exists under the Indian Child Welfare Act, but for child custody cases.
“There’s really no good news story here because youth of color are treated more harshly than their white peers whenever the system touches them,” Rovner said.

“The senses are very much intensified. And so too are the experiences between people magnified. I think people are more open,” said John Miller, a photographer who documented hunting camp culture in the Northeast Kingdom.

As a young boy, Ben Osha watched his dad and grandfather head off to the backwoods of Orange County, where his family has maintained property since the 1970s, in search of bucks. 
“I remember always seeing the Johnson Wool red checkered shirts heading out to deer camp and thinking ‘I want to do that,’” he said.  “Magically they come back and they have a racker, and you’re like, ‘Whoa!’”
When he got old enough, Osha, now 24, went from hunting the family farm to joining the men at camp. 
“Going from watching it happen to being included, it’s so much more meaningful,” he said. “Each year you’re granted a little more responsibility.”
In Vermont, where almost 1-in-8 people hunt, the 16-day rifle deer season is a collective experience on par with Town Meeting Day or the emergence of black flies in May. For many, the season is defined by a trip to camp. It’s a ritual and coming of age opportunity passed between generations, sacred to those who spend the weeks reconnecting with family and the mountains. 
Though hunters have had the opportunity to harvest deer with a bow for weeks, rifle season, running Nov. 15-30, is far and away the most popular hunting season of the year. Pickup trucks gather at general stores with deer draped on tailgates. Onlookers gawk at the wide-racked bucks hoisted in the air, guessing the final weight as the scales tick upward. 
For some Vermonters, rifle season is their one annual vacation. Families gather not just for the Thanksgiving holiday but in the woods, disconnected from the internet and inaccessible without four-wheel drive. To better find deer, many pray for snow — a wish Mother Nature seems to have granted this year.

Osha, director of workforce and training for the Vermont branch of the Associated General Contractors, said the joy of camp is in the family connection and the quiet of the woods. Those same qualities, far away from the overstimulation of a noisy job site, make the deer hunting tradition important to many contractors and tradespeople, he said. 
“When you look at the construction season, spring and summer is go go go,” Osha said.“Deer season for a lot of these contractors is a time to mentally recharge and kind of get themselves centered again, because you’re alone. The only person you have to talk to is yourself.”
At camp, that time away is heightened. 
“It’s very surreal: The ability to not only be in the wilderness all day but come back to camp and sleep in the wilderness,” Osha said. 
‘To be a child again’
Hunting culture in Vermont — and the Northeast more broadly — revolves around the tradition of deer camps, setting it apart from other regions of the country. 
The phenomenon has drawn anthropological interest from those interested in the unique annual bonding ritual. 
Growing up in Coventry in the 1950s, photographer John Miller remembers people heading out of villages and off to camp during November. They seemed to him to be drawn into the woods by an almost animal urge that accompanied the changing of the seasons.
In the 1980s and 90s, he returned to the area to photograph and study deer season and its people, transforming his observations into the book, Deer Camp: Last Light in the Northeast Kingdom.
“It’s a time of pause from everyday life, spending so much time in the woods by yourself, listening, observing,” Miller, who lives once again in the Northeast Kingdom, said. “The senses are very much intensified. And so too are the experiences between people magnified. I think people are more open.”
That openness earned Miller invitations into deer camps across the Northeast Kingdom, where he documented the families, the antlers and the outhouses of those two November weeks.

The images and accompanying narrative depicting the camps offered a rare window into these secretive backwoods fraternities of 30 years ago, where most would rather stay mum than tell a reporter which ridge holds the biggest bucks.
Explaining the draw of camp life in his book, Miller found himself enchanted by the same forces that attracted his subjects. 
“I am here for similar reasons: to enjoy companionship in a place and time removed from the everyday, repetitive monotony of home, with its responsibilities and stress. To be a child again, curious, open, frightened, and in good physical condition,” he wrote. 
The deer hunting tradition, Miller contended, is one of independence. 
“People here, hunters, (they) want their young people to learn how to survive and take responsibility for generating food,” he said. “Many of the people I’ve worked with, they hunt, they garden, they freeze, they dry, they fish.”
And even for those that didn’t hunt, the 16-day season did not pass unnoticed in 1980s and 90s, with corners of the state shutting down. Miller recalled having his roof replaced one fall, only to find the workers had covered the half-finished project in plastic and decamped to the woods until the Monday after Thanksgiving, when rifle season was over.   
Today, while some small businesses sign off for those two November weeks, others thrive. Deep in Essex County — the heart of deer camp country — David T. Leidy owns the Lake View Store. The shop sits near the Norton-Averill line, two towns with scarcely more than 100 permanent residents combined.
Between Labor Day and rifle season, Leidy might only see one or two people a day. But that will change starting Saturday.

“It’s almost like a county fair,” Leidy said of deer season and the winter months. “There aren’t many bad moods.”
The Lake View Store serves as a big game reporting station, and Leidy said people come to weigh their deer from as far west as Jay and as far south as Burke. The 16 days brings more company than business — snowmobile season is the real money maker, Leidy said — but he enjoys the tradition of November, as people head up to camp in search of deer. 
“Especially if it’s like a son or a grandson, everyone’s very excited,” Leidy said, describing the weighing process, which he might do 100 times a season.  “And I’m excited right there with them, I can’t help it.”
Central to all of it is snow, which many hunters rely on to track down a buck. 
Asked how important snow is to Essex County’s deer season and his business in the winter months, Leidy laughed: “That’s like saying how important is sunshine to the crops.”
Camp culture wanes — and changes, too 
Though many deer camps live on, Miller, the tradition’s chronicler, said the heritage has declined for a slew of reasons, not least a general decline in Vermonters who hunt. Land and property maintenance are expensive, he said, and some camp owners lost their land leases when thousands of acres of paper company land turned into the Silvio O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge in Essex County. In other cases, people’s interests changed, according to Miller, or the patriarch of a family died. 
Often, the camps were places for two or three generations of men — warmed by wool and woodstoves — to swap stories, cook and play cards.   
“The nurturing would often take place between a grandfather and a grandson, or an uncle and a nephew,” Miller recalled of the unique intimacy of deer season.  

The male-dominated camp culture is apparent to Cheryl Frank Sullivan, a research assistant professor and entomologist in the University of Vermont’s Department of Agriculture, Landscape, and Environment, who started hunting in college. 
“I’ve never been exposed to the camp culture of hunting, and I’m very envious of that traditional camp culture,” she said. “Historically, and even now, it’s always been very male dominated. I think it’d be really cool if there was a camp of women.”
But Sullivan said that history is changing, and she participates in programs that introduce women to hunting, like Doe Camp Nation.  
Camp or not, Sullivan has found joy and success in deer hunting, harvesting bucks in the Midwest and New England. Deer hunting — particularly bowhunting — is a rare opportunity for her to step away from a busy life. 
“I live, eat, breathe, sleep bowhunting for whitetails,” she said, noting the preparation and scouting that makes the hobby a year-round endeavor.  
Sullivan prefers the challenge of bowhunting, the steps needed to have a deer walk within 30 yards, but she walks the woods with a rifle, too. Already this fall she’s had successful hunts in Illinois and New York, and she plans to hunt Vermont’s rifle season this weekend.  
While coworkers take time off to head for warmer climes, for Sullivan, each fall is marked by multiple “hunt-cations.” 
“I can disconnect from my phone and my computer, and I can just go sit in the woods,“ she said. “It’s really the only place I can go and be left alone.”

The fiscal projections were discussed during an Assembly committee hearing Thursday and have sparked much debate behind the scenes, but the complete set of numbers have not previously been made available to the public.
A copy shared with the Nevada Current shows that expanding the availability of transferable tax credits for film productions to $120 million per year beginning in 2029 will create a $62.1 million structural deficit for the state in fiscal year 2030.
The state is required to maintain a 5% ending fund balance. Legislative Counsel Bureau analysts project the transferable tax credits would result in the state being $102.6 million short of that requirement in 2030.
Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch, a fierce opponent of the bill who forced a surprise vote that almost killed the film studio bill in the first few hours of the special session, said she believes lawmakers will wind up having to make painful budget cuts in a few short years.
Nevada Legislative Counsel Bureau fiscal projections
The Legislative Counsel Bureau is the nonpartisan staff of the Legislature. They do not advocate for or against bills, which lawmakers often see as lending them credence over lobbyists and paid consultants pitching the project.
A separate analysis commissioned by supporters of the film studio project found that for every $1 of transferable tax credits the state received just 22 cents back in direct revenue.
Such fiscal analyses are driving much of the opposition to the bill, which is expected to be voted on by the full Assembly on Sunday.
On Saturday, Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, the chamber’s majority leader and a sponsor of the studio bill, made a motion to declare AB5 an emergency measure. That would have allowed the chamber to immediately vote on the bill and send it to the state Senate for consideration. That motion needed to pass with a two-thirds majority and failed 26-16.
Despite the potential to majorly impact the state budget, the film studio bill only needs a simple majority to pass because it does not raise revenue.
A vote on a previous version of the film studio bill passed the Assembly 22-20 in the final days of the 2025 Legislative Session.
Getting and spending
The Legislative Counsel Bureau’s projection that the state is headed toward a fiscal cliff if it passes the film studio bill assumes that both state spending and state revenues increase by 3% every year.
If state revenues overperform, or if the state spends less, a fiscal cliff could be avoided. A table compiled by LCB shows that if state revenue grew by 4% and spending remained at 3%, there would be a $142.5 million surplus for the state.
Nevada Legislative Counsel Bureau state revenue and spending projections.
Without the massive expansion of the film tax credit program, the state is projected to have a $57.9 million structural surplus in 2030.
LCB staff told lawmakers during the Assembly committee hearing that over the past eight years state spending averaged 5.3%.
But that average includes the “unprecedented” cost of living adjustments for state employees made in 2024 and 2025. In those years, the expenditure growth rate was in the double digits.
With those fiscal years removed as outliers, the average expenditure growth rate was 2.9%.
Opponents of the bill argue that the state is facing additional expenditures as a result of federal policy changes, particularly to major programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
As for state revenue growth, LCB staff told lawmakers the eight-year average was 5.7%.
But that includes the post-pandemic fiscal year 2022, which had an expenditure growth rate of 22%. If you exclude that as an outlier, the average of the other seven most recent years is 3.4%.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC08352-scaled-e1763298711940-1024x602.jpg,,,2025-11-16 08:56:30.875796

Nevada lawmakers responded Saturday by unanimously passing legislation to create a state program that would temporarily support nearly 500,000 Nevadans who depend on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the event of another shutdown. 
The bill, SB 3, establishes the Silver State General Assistance Program under the Division of Social Services which would allow the state to quickly divert general funds to cover lapses in federally funded public assistance programs.
It was the first Senate bill to make it out of both chambers of the legislature during a jam-packed special session. The bill passed unanimously in both the Senate and the Assembly, and will now head to Gov. Joe Lombardo’s desk for final approval.
“Federal shutdowns and federal program disruptions are no longer hypothetical,” said Democratic Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro during a committee hearing on the bill. “I believe that this is not the first time that we will see this sort of political gamesmanship result in damage to Nevada’s families, and we have to be in a position where we can respond quickly and efficiently.”
Similar programs in other states allowed them to respond more quickly to the withholding of SNAP benefits by the Trump administration. 
“About half of U.S. states have general assistance programs. We did not have one. We had never needed one until this crisis hit,” said Robert Thompson, administrator for the Division of Social Services.
The program would only be triggered under strict conditions, including a gubernatorial declaration of an “extraordinary circumstance.” The state program would determine eligibility and distribute funds using data from existing means-tested public assistance programs like SNAP, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
Debbie Reynolds, deputy chief of staff to Gov. Lombardo, emphasized the program would only provide temporary aid to supplement lapses in federal funding for public assistance programs like the one created by the record-breaking federal shutdown. 
“The intent of this proposal is not to create a permanent entitlement program. It’s not to duplicate federal programs. It’s to ensure that it has a lawful and operational bridge when federal or other aid systems fail that can be implemented quickly,” Reynolds said. 
During the shutdown, the Trump administration refused to use available contingency funds set aside by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for emergencies to fund SNAP, even though those funds could have covered about half of the $8 billion needed for November benefits.
It was the first time in the program’s 60-year history that contingency funds were not used to ensure that SNAP benefits continue without interruption.
Congressional lawmakers sent a letter to Lombardo urging the governor to do more to ensure Nevadans received SNAP benefits during the prolonged government shutdown, including holding a special session to use state funding to hold up the program. 
The Trump administration told Nevada officials it was against federal regulations for the state to tap into the personal data from the SNAP program to provide substitute cash assistance because the state does not have an existing general cash assistance program at the state level.
“With this bill we will be able to access – for lack of a better term – our own data. We had the data, we just did not have a legal authorization to use the data,” Thompson said.
Without a dedicated general assistance program the governor and legislators responded to the lapse in SNAP funding by quickly funneling nearly $40 million in emergency aid to local food banks in hopes fewer Nevadans would go hungry.
Food bank operators warned lawmakers that the charitable food sector would not have the capacity to fill the hole left by disruptions to SNAP funding. For every meal that food banks provide, SNAP provides nine.
Full funding for SNAP only returned to states after the House voted to approve a funding bill that reopened the government after 43 days. President Donald Trump signed the bill later that afternoon.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC08093-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-16 08:56:30.875796

BESSEMER — When Yale biologist Thomas Near and members of his research team visited the Yellowhammer State in October, the state’s famous Dreamland BBQ wasn’t the only thing on the agenda, though it was high on the list.
During their trip, the researchers documented the existence of the Birmingham darter, a newly identified fish species, just downstream of the site of a proposed 4.5 million square foot hyperscale data center, the construction of which Near said would put the already imperiled species at risk of extinction.
On Thursday, based in part on Near’s research, the Center for Biological Diversity, a national environmental nonprofit, filed a petition with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service asking that the agency list the Birmingham darter as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act, providing the fish the legal protections experts have said its precarious existential position demands. The federal agency has 90 days to respond to the nonprofit’s petition and decide “whether the petition presents substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted.”

Developers of the proposed data center have previously asserted that the species is not present on its project site, though neither council members nor the project’s developers have publicly released any environmental assessments related to the project.
The Bessemer City Council is scheduled to vote on final approval of Project Marvel on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
A representative of the developer did not respond to a request for comment on this story.
The presence of the darter is not the only problem ahead for those behind the project. The director of the Alabama Department of Transportation has notified the engineers of the data center proposal, known as Project Marvel, that the current plans for the data center campus conflict with plans for the Northern Beltline, a multi-billion dollar highway project that state and federal officials have pushed for years.
These updates—on both the Birmingham darter and the Northern Beltline—present potential obstacles for Logistic Land Investment, LLC, the developer pushing the data center project, and provide a potential lifeline for nearby residents, who are almost universally opposed to the massive construction project slated for their backyards.

‘All fecal matter rolls downhill’

Near is no stranger to the Birmingham darter. He was part of theresearch team that first identified the small, colorful fish as a species distinct from other, similar species that live in the surrounding areas of north-central Alabama.
Now, Near said he and his colleagues have done the necessary field work to show that the fish, scientific name Etheostoma birminghamense, is present in Little Blue Creek, which flows through the site of the proposed hyperscale data center in Bessemer, a suburb just southwest of Birmingham.
“They’re there,” Near said of the Birmingham darter on Monday. “And anything that happens upstream is going to have an effect on them.”

Near and his colleagues were unable to visit the data center site itself, which is privately owned, but the biologist said there’s little doubt that if the development moves forward, it could put the newly identified species at risk of extinction.
“It’s a crude saying, but all fecal matter rolls downhill,” Near said. “Every impact on the headwaters of Little Blue Creek will have impacts downstream.”
Given what is known about data center construction and operations, Near said, those impacts could include increased turbidity from construction and thermal pollution—an increase in the temperature of the stream that could completely extirpate the population of darters the researchers have now documented in Little Blue Creek.
In a previous interview with Inside Climate News, Near said the data center’s construction would “nuke” Little Blue Creek. “My assessment remains the same,” he said Monday. “And now it’s bolstered by the validation that the species indeed occurs in the creek.”
It’s also possible, Near said, that construction of the data center campus, slated to include 18 buildings, each the size of a Walmart Supercenter, could also put species like the watercress darter, already listed as endangered under federal law, at risk. Part of that risk comes from the possibility that developers may “dewater” aquifers beneath the site in order to level and stabilize the land for construction, Near said.
There’s a lot we don’t know about the data center, Near added, given the lack of transparency from developers and public officials alike. Bessemer’s mayor and city attorney, as well as at least one taxpayer-funded economic development staffer, have signed non-disclosure agreements related to the project.
“It’s shocking,” Near said. “I never fathomed a public servant could be beholden to a non-disclosure agreement. It’s just distasteful.”
Near said he accepts that there are cases where development that “improves the human condition” can be put ahead of the goal of preserving biodiversity: “This just doesn’t seem to be one of those cases.”
The Center for Biological Diversity’s petition requesting endangered status for the Birmingham darter is based in part on Near’s findings and on Inside Climate News’ reporting. The fish currently lacks protection because it has only been identified as a distinct species in the last few years.
Will Harlan, Southeast director for the nonprofit, said that listing the fish as endangered under federal law is critical to preventing the darter’s extinction.
“These phenomenal fish will slide further toward extinction if this data center is built, so we have to act fast,” Harlan said. “They’ve been swimming in these creeks for millions of years, but without immediate protections, they’ll disappear forever.”
The petition outlines the threats to the darter, including the proposed data center, and also points to a 2025 draft assessment by Alabama officials placing the Birmingham darter in its P1 category of “highest conservation concern,” meaning the fish is “critically imperiled and at risk of extinction or extirpation.”

Charles Miller, policy director at the Alabama Rivers Alliance, a statewide environmental organization, said it’s unfortunate that a newly identified species like the darter is already facing a threat to its existence.
“The fact that this and several other rare darter species found only in Alabama, were first described this year is a stark reminder that we are still uncovering the depth of world-class aquatic biodiversity in our state,” he said. “Protecting this irreplicable natural legacy will benefit Alabamians for far longer than allowing out-of-state developers to make a quick buck.”
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did not respond to a request for comment on the petition.

A road to nowhere?

In a Nov. 4 letter to data center developer Brad Kaaber, ALDOT Director John Cooper said the data center project “appears to conflict with the planned alignment and interchange location for the Birmingham North Beltline and its connection to Interstate 459.”
Cooper said in the letter that ALDOT recognized the data center project “represents a major opportunity” for new jobs and tax revenue and believes the two projects could coexist if modifications were made.
“While proceeding with development on this site as proposed would create serious challenges for the eventual construction of the Beltline interchange, we believe your development can be planned in such a way as not to conflict with the Beltline,” Cooper wrote.

ALDOT also sent copies of the letter to several local and county officials and the text was widely circulated on social media.
A spokesman for ALDOT confirmed the authenticity of the letter, but said the department had no additional comment on whether it had begun discussions with the developers or whether ALDOT could or would stop the data center project if the conflicts could not be resolved.
The Birmingham Northern Beltline is a planned 52-mile semicircle through sparsely populated areas north and west of Birmingham. The project has been in the planning phase since the 1990s and has generated much controversy from people who call it a massively expensive “road to nowhere” that will do little to solve the area’s most pressing traffic problems.
The highway will also carry a huge environmental cost. The beltline, as currently designed, will cut through huge swaths of hilly, undeveloped forest land, including dozens of river or stream crossings. The first segment involved cutting through a forested hilltop and building massive bridge pilings over stream banks below.
“The entire beltline is 52 miles, and it’s going through some of the most scenic, beautiful mountains in Alabama,” Sarah Stokes, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said last year. “It is going to destroy over 3,000 football fields worth of forest and cross and permanently alter the Black Warrior and Cahaba River tributaries in 90 different places.”
The Birmingham area relies on those rivers for its drinking water, and environmental advocates say the woodlands surrounding the streams provide natural filtration for the city’s drinking water, as well as providing habitat for numerous endangered species.
The Project Marvel data center, a $14.5 billion project according to developers, would likely be completed decades before the Northern Beltline reached it, if at all. The beltline construction began in the northeast segment of the route and will wrap around counter-clockwise toward the Bessemer data center, slated to be located at its western endpoint.
Miller said that ultimately, both the data center and the Northern Beltline pose serious risks to the environment. The difference, he said, is simply their vastly different timelines.
“The lower Valley Creek watershed was already facing a threat decades in the future from the Northern Beltline, but this hyperscale data center poses an imminent threat to the Birmingham darter population in Little Blue Creek,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Birmingham-darter-fish-for-Nov-16-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-16 08:56:30.875796

(Photo courtesy of Blavatnik Awards)The son of a Yankton truck driver took the stage last month at the American Museum of Natural History in New York to accept a $250,000 award for his pioneering work in polymer chemistry.
Frank Leibfarth said his formative South Dakota years helped set him on the path to that stage.
The Blavatnik National Award is the world’s largest unrestricted monetary prize — meaning winners can spend the money on whatever they’d like — for the scientific community. The 41-year-old Leibfarth was chosen as a Blavatnik Chemical Sciences Laureate, one of three people 42 and younger awarded the title by an independent jury of scientists. The field of contenders began with 310 people, representing 161 academic institutions, 18 of whom were chosen as finalists.

Leibfarth is the Royce Murray distinguished term professor of chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He and his team have created technology that can turn the planet’s most commonly discarded plastics into high-value industrial materials. They’ve also created a more effective filter for trapping and removing Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances — PFAS, or “forever chemicals” — from municipal water supplies, and put it to use for one of North Carolina’s most polluted water sources.
In a recent interview with South Dakota Searchlight, the University of South Dakota graduate and former kicker for the Coyote football team talked about how his upbringing prepared him to step outside the cultural mores of Ivy League research and chase his curiosity as a top-tier scientist.
The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
How did you wind up in chemistry?
Neither of my parents have a four-year degree, so their goal was always for me just to go to college. I would say in high school I never found my passion. After my sophomore year in college, I took organic chemistry and really loved it. It answered a lot of the questions I had about biology, those molecular-level questions about why some things happen.
I ended up doing a research project at a National Science Foundation-funded program in New York City, at Columbia University. I feel like I was very presumptuous at the time. I said to my professor, “Hey, I really like this organic chemistry. I would love to do research in it, and I would also love to travel. But my family doesn’t have money to let me travel, so I need it to be paid for. Also, I’d like to go out of state.”
Luckily, the NSF had programs that allow you to do exactly that. I applied to 10 of them, got rejected by nine of them, but got into the best one.
So the Columbia experience opened the door for a kid from Yankton whose parents didn’t go to college to become a Ph.D. working on our PFAS problem?
Yeah, I would say that, but I’m also a product of USD. It’s a very good state institution. It allowed me to do lots of different things. I was on the varsity football team, but I also could participate in high-level science. There were people who identified my trajectory early on and gave me quite a bit of individual mentoring.
I contrast that with this world of people who have Ivy League educations, who I interact with now on a day-to-day basis. When you’re in that kind of situation early on, you develop a sense for what’s allowed and what’s not within the academic structure. In some ways, because I was not a part of that, I didn’t know what unwritten rules I was breaking along the way. It allowed me to have a little more creative freedom. I feel like I was able to follow my gut a little more than some of the people who’d grown up in that atmosphere.
What drew you to PFAS and microplastics, to making new things out of our waste?
I really liked the idea of making things, partially because of my dad. He was a truck driver, but he always had a second job where he would refinish basements and things, because he was also a carpenter. I always worked with him and I enjoyed making things with my hands.
Plastics were great, because I would make things and get to hold them after I was done. I could pull them and push them and see what properties they had. That’s what drew me early on. And once I started working in that area, it was very clear to me, and honestly to the whole field, that the sustainability crisis and plastics needed urgent solutions.
Tell us about your work in what you call ‘upcycling’ plastic.
The key challenge is we’re worst at recycling the plastics we make the most of, two related plastics called polyethylene and polypropylene. Polyethylene is like what your milk jug is made out of. Polypropylene is more like the outside of your car, your harder plastic. In two days, we can fill up a football stadium with the amount of these plastics we make in the world.
Q&A: Award-winning SDSU researcher calls his lab a ‘security checkpoint’ for animal diseases

The number and scale of the factories that are already installed to make this stuff is going to be effectively impossible to supplant. So I thought, could we create better recycling technology for that class of plastics? Our idea was to take all the plastic waste that is generated, and to be able to do this chemical process to it, which makes the products of that process more valuable than the original material was. That’s why we call it upcycling.
What gives it its higher value? What’s it used for?
We can take polyethylene, or a milk jug, and turn it into a really durable material that typically is used for high-end plumbing piping, or the outside of really high voltage wires. If you have a new home, it’s the piping that goes from your hot water heater around your house, because copper got too expensive.
We were also able to turn mixed plastic waste into a really tough material that’s typically used as the second layer in a golf ball. That material is pretty unique. So again, if you can make it from waste, there’s a lot of value there.
The key is to be a revenue stream for recycling centers, because currently, recycling plastic is an economically losing proposition.
What can you tell us about your work with PFAS?
That was born out of problems in North Carolina. It was found in 2017 that the Cape Fear River had really high levels of PFAs, and the Cape Fear River feeds the third largest town in our state, Wilmington, North Carolina. A senator from the state Legislature came to our faculty meeting — which is a very odd thing that never happens — and essentially said, “Hey, we recognize this problem.”
I had an idea about how we could remove it from water better than current technologies. I worked on it for two years in our lab, did a small research project, published a paper, and we kind of thought that was going to be the end of it. But when the results came out, we got a call from the state senator. That initiated discussions with a whole group of legislators, and in the 2021-2022 budget cycle, they allocated $10 million to start what we call the NC Pure Center. Our legislative remit was to develop new materials that remove PFAS from water, scale them up and test them in at least three municipal water treatment plants.
How does the technology work?
What we developed is like what’s used in a Brita filter that goes in your fridge. It’s a material that you pack in a column and flow water through it. The water going into that column has PFAS in it. Our material adsorbs or soaks up the PFAS, and the water coming out should be clean. You can have the same amount of material, and it’ll work 35% longer, compared to current technology.
The EPA set regulations for PFAS about a year and a half ago. It’s estimated that there’s over 6,000 treatment plants in the country that are going to have to implement treatment. So our technologies are one option.
What do you plan to do with the proceeds of your award?
The piece of the puzzle we haven’t yet put into place is to get what we make in our lab into the hands of real people to make them healthier and able to live more sustainably. I want to use the unrestricted funding to help push that forward, and in the process learn how to do it so I can repeat the process throughout my career and make the largest positive impact possible.
What do you want to see change as a result of what you’re doing in this area, 50 years from now? 
If my sole job was running a company, my goal would be to run that company well, to make money for the company. And hopefully a byproduct of that would be the sustainability aspect. But since my primary job is in education, my main output is education. If I can educate 50 people, 80 people who can do a similar type of work, that impact can be magnified many times.
Can you talk a little bit about the importance of federal funding for science from that point of view?
The federal government has in the past been really generous with science funding, but also it’s a drop in the bucket. A large pharma company spends more per year in research and development than the entire U.S. budget for science. But a lot of the initial ideas for the innovations that come out of the U.S. that support our economy, make better medicines, make our world more sustainable, those start in academia because of the funding provided by these federal organizations. We’re the ones who can think 10 years out, 20 years out. A pharma company or a chemical company has to think about their next quarter’s profit, their next year, their next two years.
That’s always been the balance that has really kept the U.S. at the forefront of innovation. If we compromise that funding on either end, we’re going to really compromise this delicate balance. Cutting science funding now is going to hurt our economy tremendously in five or 10 years. There’s no way to get around that.

,WyoFile,2025-11-16 13:00:00+00:00,WyoFile,What happens when wolves leave Yellowstone,"By Mike Koshmrl, WyoFile and Nick Mott, Mountain Journal",,,,,https://wyofile.com/what-happens-when-wolves-leave-yellowstone/,"

Crossing Yellowstone National Park's protective boundary, an apex predator becomes prey. These wolves don't last long in the modern Mountain West.
The post What happens when wolves leave Yellowstone appeared first on WyoFile .","If not for a series of tones broadcasting her location, no one would’ve known she had died.
Like dozens of other Yellowstone National Park wolves involved in a three-decade-long study, researchers collared wolf 1331F as a pup in 2021 to track her movements. Gray with ribbons of brown fur fading into her pale muzzle and legs, the young wolf lived with the Wapiti Lake Pack, one of the largest in Yellowstone. 
Wildlife photographer V.C. Wald watched 1331 supervise black wolf pups hunting a wounded bison on the shore of the Gibbon River in the winter of 2023-’24. Easily visible from the road, the pups tried to take the bison head-on, only to scatter as it bluff charged. Then, 1331 demonstrated how to approach the massive ungulate more safely from behind, nipping at its hind quarters, Wald recalls, “[she was] a teacher, of young wolves, and of me.”

The scene isn’t out of the ordinary for the Wapiti Lake Pack, whose territory encompasses Yellowstone’s sagebrush-covered Hayden Valley in the center of the park. They chase elk and bison. They play and sun themselves on cold winter days. Much of this activity occurs under the gaze of humans. But every now and then, pack members leave the park. 
In late 2024, Yellowstone Wolf Project telemetry data suggest 1331 started a journey away from her pack. She headed north. First, she spent time around Mammoth Hot Springs. Then she crossed the park’s boundary into Montana. While tourists often lined roads to watch 1331 and her packmates inside the park, wolf watchers are sparser in the rugged and mountainous mix of public and private land just north of Yellowstone. Wolf 1331 had no way of knowing, but she’d crossed an invisible line where the national park gives way to state rule. It’s a consequential threshold: Wolves are protected from hunting on one side, but can be legally killed by gun, trap or snare on the other. 
Park officials don’t know if 1331 was permanently leaving her pack or if she would have eventually returned to Wapiti Lake’s territory; it’s not uncommon for female wolves of her age to disperse for days or even weeks leading up to breeding season in February — sort of a lupine rumspringa. But they do know she’d left the pack far behind. On Jan. 24, 2025, staff with the Yellowstone Wolf Project drove north of the park, wielding bulky telemetry equipment to listen for collared elk and wolves. They heard 1331’s signal, indicating she’d moved farther into Montana than ever. But, the beeps suggested, she hadn’t budged in at least 12 hours. 
Park staff turned the information over to Montana’s fish and game agency. Wolf 1331 would ultimately be found dead in a trap set by a prolific wolf hunter who manages a large ranch about 10 miles north of Yellowstone. The man who trapped 1331 would receive a warning for violating state trap-check laws and no other punishment. Her journey had come to an end roughly a month after it began. 
The Yellowstone bubble
Wolf 1331F’s fate was unusual only in that she made it so far north. When wolves leave the park, they die — often, quickly.
Yellowstone’s roughly 100 wolves are among the most famous and beloved in the world, attracting throngs of wolf-admiring tourists who spend tens of millions of dollars in the region every year. However, protected by federal law and tolerant of their adoring fans, Yellowstone wolves are uniquely vulnerable to hunters and trappers in surrounding states where killing wolves is legal. Their destinies are often shaped by which of the three surrounding state boundaries they cross.

“When we look at the fate of collared wolves that leave Yellowstone, most commonly they don’t survive the next hunting season,” Yellowstone Wolf Project leader Dan Stahler said in a May 2024 interview.  
Heading into Wyoming, wolves encounter wilderness and tightly controlled hunts, but greater danger beyond. Step into Idaho and it’s a free-fire zone, though few wolves go that way. Journeys north into Montana are the most common and have proven the most deadly, despite some state efforts to take it easy on park wolves.    
Yellowstone’s wolves die from hunting and trapping outside the park every season, but things seem to be getting worse. From 2009-2020, about 4.3 wolves from Yellowstone were killed legally by hunters and trappers each year, according to National Park Service data. From 2021-2024, that number nearly tripled when an average of 12.75 wolves died annually, according to Yellowstone Wolf Project data. 
It was clear to Doug Smith, retired lead of the Yellowstone Wolf Project, that the park’s porous boundaries would be an issue almost immediately after wolves were reintroduced in 1995. “This is a long-term problem for wildlife management, and particularly wolves,” Smith said in an interview this fall. 
Inside Yellowstone, wolves are managed “for the benefit and enjoyment of the people,” the now-famous language adorning the top of Roosevelt Arch, a striking stone gateway often surrounded by selfie-taking tourists at the park’s North Entrance. The sentiment springs from the 1916 act creating the National Park Service and stops at the park’s border. Outside Yellowstone, the states take over wolf management. There, wolves can get into trouble. They kill livestock, the occasional pet, and lots and lots of elk. And they’re especially naive to the many dangers in the new world around them.

Even in the early days of reintroduction, Smith remembers phone calls urging him to do the impossible: keep wolves inside the park. Back then, wolves had federal protections both in and out of Yellowstone. Hunting them was illegal, whether in Montana, Wyoming or Idaho, or inside Yellowstone itself. But within a month of releasing the park’s first wolves from their enclosure, a hunter named Chad McKittrick illegally shot and killed a male wolf, numbered 10M, after it left the park and ventured onto private land near Red Lodge, Montana. 
Fast-forward nearly 30 years and death also awaited 1329M, a striking green-eyed black male wolf, when he left Yellowstone. Researchers captured and collared 1329, born into the Wapiti Lake Pack just like 1331F. He was caught and joined the ranks of research wolves in 2021, the same year they collared 1331F as a pup. A year later, park scientists documented the young male, with a touch of silver on his chin, getting into a scuffle with other males, which could have spurred a dispersal. His collar’s GPS data shows he left Yellowstone on May 14, 2022, heading south. “[1329] beelined it all the way down through the trophy game wolf area,” said Stahler, the current Yellowstone Wolf Project leader.

The state of Wyoming tightly regulates wolf hunting in an area where wolves are managed as “trophy game” adjacent to Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, with the area closed to hunting in the spring. But 1329 kept moving. GPS data shows his route, loping straight through the heart of Jackson Hole, then south, looping through the Wyoming and Salt River ranges. The black wolf headed into a valley where, three years later, Sublette County resident Cody Roberts would fight a felony animal cruelty charge for allegedly making a public spectacle of a wounded, juvenile wolf in a bar before the animal died. The incident made international news and divided the small Western Wyoming community. Wolves are fewer here. There’s a reason. 
Within two weeks of leaving Yellowstone, the roughly 2-year-old 1329 crossed another boundary and left Wyoming’s regulated wolf “trophy game” area for its “predator zone,” which covers 85% of the state and where there are virtually no regulations on how wolves can be killed. Running down and bludgeoning wolves with snowmobiles here is legal. The departure meant he could be killed any time of year, by almost any means, and without a license.
Toward the end of June 2022, wolf 1329 stopped moving in the mountains near Salt River Pass, near where the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem transitions into the Great Basin. He’d stepped into a steel-jawed leghold trap. “It had been in the trap about four days,” Stahler says, “based on the location and movement.” By June 26, the trapped wolf was dead. The Yellowstone biologist’s best guess is that 1329 was exposed to the elements and died of dehydration. States surrounding the park require trappers to frequently check their wolf traps to reduce animals’ suffering and minimize harm to non-target species. Negligence is illegal. 
‘Risky life choice’ 
Wolves in the Northern Rockies are no strangers to controversy. Indeed, politicians in all three states surrounding Yellowstone have long seized on wolves as a prime example of federal overreach. “I remain seriously concerned with the uncertainty that continues to surround Yellowstone wolf reintroduction as it moves forward,” former Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer wrote to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt in 1995, after wolves were already on the ground. Former Idaho Gov. Butch Otter said he’d be the first to bid on a wolf tag back in 2007. And Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte was issued a warning for killing a Yellowstone wolf without the proper trapper education in 2021. 
Death by hunting, trapping or wildlife management official is the most common fate for wolves that leave Yellowstone National Park. Even in a natural system, the act of dispersing is already a “risky life choice,” according to Stahler. Solo wolves end up in territories of other wolf packs, where they clash and get killed. In fact, within Yellowstone, wolves are the leading cause of wolf death.

While the number of wolves that spend the vast majority of their time inside Yellowstone has stayed relatively static for more than two decades, wolf populations outside the park have grown by leaps and bounds. That’s in part because some Yellowstone wolves successfully dispersed and survived. At the same time, other wolves reintroduced in Idaho’s Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness established and bred. And yet more wolves filtered down from the north, crossing the Canadian border into the U.S. Today, populations of animals as reclusive as wolves are tough to estimate, but the most recent figures for Montana and Idaho wolf populations are roughly 1,100 and 1,200, respectively. In Wyoming, which has less mountainous, treed habitat, there are fewer wolves — about 350 — and they’re counted with much greater precision.
While those wolf populations outside the park grew, the human population inside Yellowstone expanded, too. Park visitation hovered around 3 million annually at the time of wolf reintroduction in 1995. Today, that number is closer to 5 million, evidenced by the sprawl of souvenir shops in the Yellowstone gateway towns of Jackson, Wyoming and Gardiner, Montana where tourists snap up T-shirts, stuffed bison and elk toys, and art emblazoned with wolves. This increased visitation, wolf biologist Smith says, is the biggest issue facing Yellowstone National Park as a whole.
“It’s the best place in the world to view wild wolves,” says Smith, adding that in the early days of wolf reintroduction, finding wolves inside the park was exclusive, inside information. That’s changed nowadays, he says, with the influx of eager, wolf- and grizzly-watching tourists. “There’s no inside tips anymore. Just look for the traffic jam.”

Wolf-watching tourism alone contributes at least $82 million annually to communities bordering the park, the most recent data show. However, all those people lining the roads and hillsides of Yellowstone come at a cost. “[When wolves] leave the park,” Smith says, “they get shot because they stand there and look at a hunter.”
Some wolves become so accustomed to people that they become habituated, according to Smith, meaning they walk up to humans in search of food or become so bold that they run off with tripods. In rare instances, park officials have euthanized habituated wolves.
The Wapiti Lake Pack, a major draw for wolf watchers and tourists, has been susceptible to human conditioning. These Yellowstone interior wolves, considered bison-killing specialists, often use groomed park roads to get around in winter, at times walking right by snowmobilers buzzing down the road on their way to places like Old Faithful or Tower Junction. They’ve even been hazed with paintballs as a result.  
But the vast majority of park wolves aren’t habituated, Smith says. Rather, they’re tolerant of people. “A wild wolf is avoidant,” he says. “They flee, they run. They know what humans mean: death. That’s not a park wolf.” Tolerance is the curse that leaves them vulnerable outside the park.

Justin Webb, executive director of the Foundation for Wildlife Management, says Yellowstone should do more to instill its wolves with a healthy fear of people.
“Wolves in the park should be given the respect of space, and I think that those wolves shouldn’t be conditioned to people,” says Webb, whose nonprofit makes bounty-like payments to trappers who kill wolves.
On occasion, Yellowstone wolves face circumstances that make them especially prone to human conditioning. The Junction Butte Pack, for example, often dens within eyeshot of Slough Creek, a popular trailhead for hikers and anglers. Tourists and Yellowstone guides have learned about the highly visible location, potentially dooming those pups. 
“Why don’t they close the trailhead down?” Webb asked. 
Yellowstone wolves leave the park for all kinds of reasons. Some, like 1331F, might take a temporary solo hiatus from their pack, while 1329M was likely in the midst of a more permanent dispersal, searching for new territory or a mate. However, the vast majority of Yellowstone’s wolves spend about 96% of their time inside the park, collar data shows. With no time to learn a healthy fear of humans, the 4% of the time they unwittingly leave their protections behind proves deadly. Instead of other wolves, people — either hunters or poachers — become, by far, the leading cause of death for wolves that depart Yellowstone, Stahler said. 
No fear
For the first decade and a half after wolves returned to Yellowstone, the Endangered Species Act outlawed hunting wolves throughout the Lower 48. Protracted legal battles meant the first lawful hunt didn’t occur until 2009, and it revealed the risk facing wolves that spend most of their lives inside Yellowstone. 
“They aren’t showing any fear,” one Montana wolf hunter told the Los Angeles Times after a successful hunt that year. “But they will, I’m sure.” Another hunting guide told the outlet about a wolf his client killed: “He was no more afraid of [the hunter] than the man in the moon.”
In 2011, wolves were permanently “delisted,” or stripped of federal protections under the Endangered Species Act, in Montana, Idaho and portions of three other western states by an act of Congress. In Wyoming, the change came more slowly because of litigation. Wolves were most recently delisted there in 2017.

After years of hunts in surrounding states, the story hasn’t changed much. In late 2024, members of the 8 Mile Pack crossed the park boundary into Montana. Three hunters were waiting. They left with four dead wolves. A fifth was found days later, dead in nearby bushes. That many wolves dying at the same time rather than fleeing at the sound of a gunshot, Smith says, likely means they had no fear of people. “Killing multiple wolves at once is a sure sign of that.”
In this way, 1331 and 1329 are outliers. According to Yellowstone National Park data, over the last few years, approximately 81% of wolves that lived in Yellowstone and were killed by hunters died in Montana. That’s largely due to terrain. Think of the Gardiner Basin just north of Yellowstone like a funnel: Elk migrate to the lower-elevation, arid area in search of forage in winter. Wolves follow. Of all those wolves killed by hunters in Montana, nearly 9 in 10 died within just a mile of the park boundary. The forays of 1331 and 1329 outside Yellowstone — clocking about 10 miles and over 100, respectively — mean they traveled much farther than most of their kind before meeting the same end. 
The lives of long-distance travelers, like the two Wapiti Lake pack members that died in traps, are less understood. Smith attributes the dearth of data to a simple reason: They die. 
“A wolf dispersing has a higher mortality risk because it doesn’t know the landscape,” he says. “So that makes it more vulnerable to getting shot because they’re wandering around going, ‘I don’t know where I am; I don’t know where it’s safe and where it’s unsafe.’” 
Montana and Wyoming’s respective wildlife management agencies investigated the trappings of 1331 and 1329. Both were found only because of their collar mortality signals, and both trappers were found to have violated state “trap-check” laws. Wolf traps must be checked every 48 hours in Montana. Leghold traps must be checked every 72 hours in Wyoming’s predator zone, the only place in the Equality State where wolf trapping is allowed.
The Wyoming trapper, a Cokeville resident named Ezra Cluff, was cited and fined $250 on June 30, 2022. “Cluff stated that he had got busy and had indeed failed to do his trap checks on time,” the warden wrote in a citation slip. Cluff did not respond to an interview request. 
Nearly three years later and on the opposite end of the ecosystem, 1331 was found in a trap about 10 miles, as the crow flies, north of Yellowstone. The trap was registered to Matt Lumley, who was at the time president of the Montana Trappers Association and vice president of the National Trappers Association. Lumley also has close ties to political leadership in Montana. He helped Gov. Gianforte trap and kill another collared Yellowstone wolf in 2021. Gianforte later described Lumley as his wolf hunting “mentor” in an interview with Lee Enterprise’s Statehouse Bureau. In addition, Lumley is a founding member of the Outdoor Heritage Coalition, a group currently suing Montana, arguing that state wildlife managers aren’t setting policy aggressively enough to reduce the wolf population.
Lumley did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But his comments in the Helena Capitol building are in the public record. “I’ve killed a lot of wolves,” he testified at the Montana Legislature just days before Wolf Project staff heard 1331F’s mortality signal. “I’ve never killed a Yellowstone National Park wolf. I’m killing all my wolves in Montana.”

Yellowstone park officials estimate that 1331 died on Jan. 16, 2025. Park staff detected her mortality signal on Jan. 23, and her remains were recovered even later. Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks submitted a “request for prosecution” for a trap-check violation to Montana’s Park County Attorney’s Office. Despite the state’s 48-hour trap-check regulation for wolves, the county attorney declined to prosecute.

“After a careful review of the reports, supporting documents, and available evidence, we determined that the facts did not establish a criminal offense that could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,” Park County Attorney Chad Glenn said in an email to Mountain Journal and WyoFile. 
Glenn did not respond to follow-up questions or provide the documents he cited as the basis for his decision. Ultimately, Lumley walked away with a formal warning from FWP. Gianforte also walked away with a warning in 2021 after running afoul of trapping regulations while killing a wolf with Lumley on the same ranch, owned by Robert E. Smith, a co-director of Sinclair Broadcasting Group and contributor to Gianforte’s 2017 congressional campaign.
Elk, livestock and wolves
The saga of Wapiti Lake’s wandering wolves reflects the complexity of managing Yellowstone wolves when they leave protected areas like the park. Over the last few decades, the region has transitioned from an economy based on resource extraction to one heavily reliant on tourism and recreation. Outside the national park, wildlife managers are tasked with balancing hard-to-reconcile viewpoints in states where hunting and ranching have deep roots and large landowners hold sway. 
The overpopulated elk herds of Yellowstone’s Northern Range numbered around 15,000-20,000 in the years leading up to the 1995 wolf reintroduction. Counts are now closer to 5,000, much to the dismay of many a hunter who relied on the area’s abundance of ungulates for meat or trophies. 
“I’ve got an 18-year-old son that I want to get to experience elk camp in the backcountry,” Webb, the wolf-hunting advocate, told a Wyoming audience in 2022. “I want him to sit on a mountaintop on a ridge and listen to bulls bugle below him as the sun comes up, and I believe that if we don’t do something to control wolf populations, he won’t have that experience.”

Meanwhile, Lumley the trapper called the decline of southwest Montana elk “the greatest loss of hunting opportunity in the world” during the same legislative hearing he touted killing “a lot of wolves.” Decades before wolf reintroduction, elk were so numerous in the area that Yellowstone sometimes culled thousands of the animals in a single year. Later, the park took a more hands-off approach. Elk hunting outside the park became the primary management tool to deal with the overpopulated ungulates. Locals recall a “firing line” of hunters as elk moved toward winter range outside the park’s protections. 
Wolves were a factor — but not the only factor — in the region’s decline in elk numbers. Mountain lions and bears eat elk, too. And so do people. A long-running late-season elk hunt in the Gardiner area also played a role in the elk population’s shrinking size. Despite a drastic decrease in numbers from the days before wolves, elk populations north of Yellowstone still remain at or above the state-set goal for elk numbers. Access to elk is yet another important part of the hunting puzzle. Some hunters say the wary ungulates that remain in the area often take shelter from wolves and hunters alike on private land, making them next to impossible to pursue. 
Part of the tension around hunting both wolves and elk also centers on economics. While wolf-watching brings millions of tourist dollars into communities surrounding the park, outfitters north of Yellowstone have lost business as elk herds declined after reintroduction. The lawsuit filed by the Outdoor Heritage Coalition features outfitter Craig Neal, an outfitter in Townsend, Montana, as a plaintiff. Neal, the brief contends, “has been negatively impacted by restrictions on wolf hunting in Montana from a personal and economic perspective … his business opportunities are limited by the insufficient wolf quotas and reduced elk available for hunting.”

Elk aren’t the only hooved creatures wolves impact, either. Outside Yellowstone, they also occasionally kill livestock. Although wolf-killed cattle and sheep are a drop in the bucket among the many factors that kill domestic livestock, the impacts aren’t trivial for individual ranchers in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.   
In Wyoming and Montana each year, wolves typically kill at least a few dozen of the more than 3 million cows in the two states — though many ranchers argue that wolf kills can go unproven since remote carcasses are consumed before the kill can be documented. Depredation numbers in Wyoming notably spiked from 2014 to 2017, topping out at 121 wolf-killed cattle — a pulse of conflict that coincided with the three years Wyoming wolves were relisted under the Endangered Species Act. While those federal protections prohibited hunters from killing wolves at the time, wildlife managers trying to avert conflict could do just that. And they did, killing a record number. In Montana, complaints about wolves eating livestock peaked at 233 in 2009. Since then, in the wake of delisting, the number of reports has dropped off drastically, hovering at 100 or fewer annually from 2015 to 2024.
Pressure cooker 
To control the wolf population and mitigate their impact, hunting has become a fixture of wolf management in the Northern Rockies. Since legal seasons began earlier in the century, some animals that spend most of the year in Yellowstone are always lost to hunters’ bullets and traps outside park boundaries. 
In an attempt to resolve the tension between the park and surrounding states, Montana carved out small areas with more limited hunting called “wolf management units” directly north of the park. Wyoming tightly controls its hunts immediately adjacent to Yellowstone and Grand Teton, and has had minimal overall impact on Yellowstone populations. Idaho takes an aggressive, statewide approach to wolf hunting and trapping, but the topography and location of Yellowstone packs have limited its influence on park populations.

The vast majority of harvested Yellowstone wolves die in Montana, where tensions continue to flare over setting the state’s wolf season. In 2021, the Montana Legislature mandated a reduction in the state’s overall wolf population, numbering roughly 1,177 at the time. The new law simply set a minimum of 15 breeding pairs (corresponding to 450 wolves). In the years since, setting policy to reduce wolf numbers has fallen to the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission, a citizen board appointed by the governor, currently Gianforte. The commission has considered a slew of ways to meet the mandate: lengthening hunting and trapping seasons, instituting a statewide quota, night hunting on private land, and neck snaring, among other approaches. Some of those aggressive tactics have taken effect. Others haven’t. Yet today, four years after the legislative mandate took effect, Montana still hasn’t seen a meaningful reduction in its wolf population. 
In 2021, about six months after Gianforte trapped and killed a Yellowstone wolf north of the park, the commission also removed quotas in the wolf management units, or WMUs, just outside Yellowstone. That winter, hunters killed at least 25 wolves that spent the vast majority of their lives inside the park. Roughly 1 in 5 park wolves perished — more park wolves than in any hunting season before or since. Yellowstone biologists worried about the impact of the hunt on their three-decade-old research project — some packs dissolved due to the hunt, and others formed. Behavior and reproductive rates changed, too. Wildlife guides were furious, concerned they’d lose business or wolf-watching opportunities altogether. 
Ultimately, the quotas were restored. But over the next two years, outcomes for Yellowstone wolves only marginally improved. At least 13 park wolves were killed in the 2023-2024 hunting season. Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly voiced his concern to the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission in a 2024 letter. “Wolves that primarily live within Yellowstone are exceedingly valuable to a great number of people across Montana, the country, and the world,” he wrote. “The park generates hundreds of millions of dollars in additional economic activity to Montana economies and wolves and other wildlife rate as a top reason why people visit the park and region.”
The pressure cooker of hunting policy around Yellowstone hasn’t let off steam. At the January 2025 legislative hearing, Lumley complained that the Fish and Wildlife Commission was setting policy that was too protective of wolves and listening only to out-of-state interests, particularly Yellowstone. Just 3% of the national park lies in Montana. “That’s what you are elected to do, protect Montana’s interests,” Lumley testified. “Not Yellowstone National Park’s.” 
In a Fish and Wildlife Commission meeting months later, Chris Morgan, Lumley’s successor at the Montana Trappers Association, made similar claims. He alleged that policy safeguarding wolves in the region around Yellowstone is a “political ploy” and touted the state’s responsibility for wolf reduction rather than wolf watching.

“We don’t have any state mandate that requires us to make sure that ecotourism thrives,” Morgan said. “Our mandate is to reduce the state’s population of wolves. Plain and simple. Period.” 
Wolf advocates were just as fired up in the day-long meeting. Cara McGary, a Yellowstone guide and cofounder of Wild Livelihoods Business Coalition, argued that plenty of Yellowstone wolves — like 1331F— die even outside the protective boundaries of the wolf management units. Southwest Montana receives far more wolf hunting pressure than anywhere else in the state, despite a lower overall wolf density than Montana’s northwest corner, according to Montana FWP data. It’s also the only area in the Treasure State where the wolf population was already on the decline. In 2024 alone, at least six wolves from the park died legally in the Yellowstone-adjacent WMUs and another five outside their boundaries. “That’s almost 10% of the product that our businesses depend on,” she testified. 
At the time of publication, wolf hunting season in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho is well underway. The heat over wolf hunting regulations around Yellowstone in that August commission meeting led to something of a middle-ground approach. But already this year, a Montana hunter legally killed a Yellowstone wolf beloved to the wolf-watching community, which described the dark black 1479F as playful and tolerant of crowds.
“She was one of the few wolves in the park that would walk right through a crowd of people to reach her destination,” wildlife photographer Deby Dixon told Cowboy State Daily.
The National Park Service has two chief goals: preserving and protecting natural systems, and visitor enjoyment. Wolves figure into both, and the scientific gains from studying Yellowstone packs are unparalleled: They’re both uniquely visible and, at least in theory, uninfluenced by humans. But as wolves deal with such direct mortality when they set paw outside the park, Smith wonders: “Do you have a natural wolf population or not?”
Some data suggests not. A 2023 peer-reviewed study led by then-University of Montana PhD student Brenna Cassidy found that Montana’s wolf-hunting regime has a clear effect on the overall survival of Yellowstone wolves. Without hunting, park wolves have a nearly 90% chance of surviving any given year, but the rate falls to about 80% when hunting occurs with quotas. When there’s unlimited hunting outside the boundary, Yellowstone wolves’ chances of surviving a year dip closer to 70%. 
Smith, Yellowstone’s retired wolf biologist, wants to be clear: He’s a hunter as well, and a self-described “gun guy.” At times, though, he worries that all the focus on Yellowstone’s wolves has an overlooked downside. It sucks the air out of the room in wolf management conversations, leaving too little focus on the thousands more wolves in Montana and the rest of the Northern Rockies that don’t have the same vocal proponents as animals in and around the park. Those wolves die too — often very quickly or brutally. In Montana, hunters and trappers can take a total of 458 wolves this season, including six in the WMUs outside Yellowstone and 60 in the larger region where 1331 met her end. There are no limits in Idaho, and it’s a wolf hunting free-for-all in Wyoming’s predator zone, where 1329 died in an illegally monitored trap. 
Thinking about intense hunting pressure throughout the Northern Rockies, Smith thinks wildlife managers should consider a bigger question: “Where do wolves get to be wolves?”

Just as the state adopted an “all-in” approach to clean water, it is important for all Vermonters to be invested in the housing infrastructure solution.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Chris Campany and Devon Neary: Building the infrastructure necessary to keep Vermonters in Vermont.","This commentary is by Chris Campany, executive director of the Windham Regional Commission, and Devon Neary, chair of the Vermont Association of Planning and Development Agencies.


Vermont has made progress improving pathways to new housing, but an often-overlooked need is the wastewater and water infrastructure to support it. 
We need to create conditions to house Vermonters at all stages of life.  This includes young people moving out of the family home for the first time, couples having children, empty nesters downsizing, seniors and others seeking housing to fit their independent living abilities, and those who have lost their housing to disaster.  This means investing in infrastructure that supports building housing at scale to make it affordable.  
“Affordable” shouldn’t be a loaded term.  Here it means housing for which the household is paying no more than 30% of their monthly gross income for housing costs, be that an individual or a family.  “At scale” means the ability to build enough units at one time to harness economies of scale that minimize per housing unit costs. 
The housing solution does not lie with custom built houses on large lots along town roads.  Barring a collapse in home and land values ‚ and material, labor and construction costs — these homes are well beyond the reach of most Vermonters today and in the future.  
We need investment in existing buildings, development of vacant properties, multi-family housing, and clustered small home neighborhoods to create housing at scale, and it is nearly impossible to build housing that is affordable for Vermonters at scale in the absence of community wastewater systems and drinking water systems. 
For towns with zoning, making sure that zoning does not create unwise and unnecessary roadblocks to building housing, especially multi-family housing, can help.  But the underlying infrastructure is fundamental, especially in areas that have minimal flood risk.
Regional planning commissions play an essential role in supporting municipal land use planning, planning for the infrastructure to make action on those plans possible, and supporting engineering design and project construction, because most communities do not have the capacity to do it on their own. 
This support is necessary not only for the development of new systems, but improvements to the capacity of those that already exist.  We also recognize the challenges faced by municipalities that are already managing wastewater and water systems.  
Through collaboration with the Vermont Bond Bank, we are beginning work to support communities that are struggling to operate their existing drinking water systems.  Our goal is to make system management easier and more efficient and to ultimately identify operations and maintenance models that make more sense for Vermont’s small communities. 
It may be tempting to think that we shouldn’t consider new systems or improve the capacity of existing systems if we can’t handle the ones we already have.  That’s a false choice.  We need to develop effective operations and maintenance models even as we develop the systems we need now and for the future.  
Among Act 181’s reforms are improvements to regional future land use mapping.  The state’s 11 regional planning commissions are working with each of our municipalities to map our future growth areas.  This includes addressing flood adaptation needs. 
These areas should form the basis for a statewide infrastructure investment strategy that supports each step of infrastructure development — from the connection to land use planning to project construction.
Just as the state adopted an “all-in” approach to clean water, it is important for all Vermonters to be invested in the housing infrastructure solution.  We also need to make it easier to scale up operations and maintenance so that towns can more easily work together and towns aren’t left to figure out on their own what an intermunicipal, or regional, system could do more effectively.

Charcoal
Gretchen Wertlieb, 17, South Burlington
Charcoal
is our preferred method
with which to sketch our days:
thick, dark swaths of pigment
that smear and make their mark 
unapologetically,
abstract, flowing, influential,
or as gashes across the page
like wounds that won’t close.
And neither are ugly,
though we can’t erase them.
They are the foundations of your life,
but details make the picture –
the careful lines and smudges;
noticing a twinkling eye,
or smiling with all your teeth. 
And everyone you meet
is drawing their own
conclusions and beginnings,
unfinished works
marbled with messy, rushed greetings
and slow, agonizing goodbyes.
Strapped to our backs and worn on our sleeves are these masterpieces,
every day being dotted
with someone else’s charcoall.
Our sketches are never finished,
but always beautiful.
But we forget, somehow:
We are all art.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-16 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Trump’s concerns about big insurance  could be alleviated with universal health care,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/16/trump-insurance-universal-health-care/,President Trump expressed concern that big insurance companies are getting federal funds. Adopting universal health care would solve that problem.,"Based on their recent comments, perhaps President Donald Trump and some other Republicans are getting ready to embrace universal health care. 
Universal health care involves some form of the government ensuring everyone has medical coverage at little or no out-of-pocket cost, beyond what people pay in taxes. Many countries, including much of western Europe, have some form of universal health care. 
The United States does not, even though various Democrats, ranging from Harry Truman to Barack Obama, from Kamala Harris to Bernie Sanders, have embraced some form of universal health care at some point in time.
Republicans have portrayed universal health care as the bogeyman, as socialism, as the worst thing that could happen to the United States and would eventually lead to capitulation to Russia.
Yet, Trump and others seem to be warming up to the possibility.
In recent weeks, congressional Democrats have been fighting to extend enhanced subsidies for private insurance purchased on the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace exchange – a fight that was at the center of the 43-day federal government shutdown that ended last week. The federal subsidies pay a significant portion of the cost of the health insurance purchased on the exchange.

Trump recently posted on social media, as he is wont to do, that instead of providing these subsidies to big insurance companies, he would prefer to give the money for health care directly to the American people.
How would this work? He didn’t say, but that did not stop many Republicans from embracing the idea. And it does not appear many Republicans voiced concern about such a scheme.
But according to the Congressional Budget Office, as explained in an MSNBC article by Miranda Yaver, a University of Pittsburgh assistant professor of health policy and management, the health insurance companies received about $92 billion in federal ACA subsidies in 2023. During the same year, just the out-of-pocket costs – those not paid by the insurance companies – totaled $500 billion for Americans.
So, in short, if Trump diverts that $92 billion from insurance companies to individuals, there also must be a method to pay for the additional costs of health care Americans will incur.
The amount of the subsidies each individual would receive will not cover the cost of a serious illness or accident. Would the people facing major medical expenses be left to face the impossible-for-most task of paying those tens of thousands of dollars in health care costs by themselves? Or would they need some, gulp, insurance, to help pay for those additional costs?
Insurance, love it or hate it, exists to level the playing field. By having a large number of people on insurance, the costs paid by those with expensive medical needs are held down by those who have insurance but seldom or never have to use it.
So, all this begs the question: What is the answer for those, like President Trump, who don’t like subsidizing big insurance?
The obvious answer to that question is, drum roll please, universal health care coverage, often referred to as Medicaid and Medicare for all or a public option.
Universal health care could be fashioned a number of ways. People could be expected to provide, as Republicans like to say, some “skin in the game” by paying for some of the costs themselves.
It could be a program where, if you have private insurance and you like your private insurance, you can keep it just as long as it is not paid for with federal dollars.
President Trump and others have been obsessed with getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. The president seems upset that it is called Obamacare.
It is important to note that it was first labeled Obamacare by those who opposed the legislation that was passed way back in 2010. But now that polls show it is popular, Trump seems upset that it is called Obamacare.
As a matter of fact, he said that money for health care being sent directly to the American people “would be so exciting. Call it Trumpcare. Call it whatever you want.… Anything but Obamacare.”
Perhaps Democrats, many of whom always supported universal health care as the most logical way to deal with an often broken and complex American system, could achieve that goal by just agreeing to call it Trumpcare.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/14092304/AP25317126616807.jpg,,,2025-11-16 07:56:25.672375

It seems a minor miracle the story is being told at all. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Then Again: Vermont’s Chester Arthur is an unlikely star in a new Netflix series.","Chester Arthur became president through a sequence of unlikely events. Portrait via the National Archive
President Chester Arthur is back in the spotlight. It’s been a minute. 
Netflix’s hit new historical series “Death by Lightning” tells the story of the assassination in 1881 of President James Garfield, so it’s only natural that Garfield and his assassin, Charles Guiteau, take center stage. But Arthur is the one who gets the redemption arc. Plus (spoiler alert) he’s the only one of the three still breathing at the end.
Arthur was an extremely unlikely president. He didn’t seek the office and only attained it through a bizarre sequence of events. In the years since his single term, the native of Fairfield, Vermont, has been largely forgotten, so it feels strange to see him get serious screen time in a major production. But the story can’t be told without him.
It seems a minor miracle the story is being told at all. What was the pitch to Netflix like? How did anyone convince the streaming service that viewers today would love a story focusing on a group of 19th-century politicians who can vie with Arthur for the title of “most obscure.” In addition to Garfield, whose name is rarely mentioned today outside of trivia nights, viewers are introduced to such former political heavyweights as Roscoe Conkling and James Blaine. 
Yet somehow the show works. It has its share of ahistorical aspects, such as characters speaking like modern Americans and cursing liberally. But other details that could seem invented to make the show more relatable — Black men serving in positions of power in 1880s Washington, D.C., and Garfield’s intense focus on rooting out political corruption — are drawn from real life.
“Death by Lightning” has a surprising amount of humor, given the topic, which might have helped get the project green lighted. The barrel-chested, heavily sideburned Arthur is played by Nick Offerman and in his early scenes, he provides comic relief as a man of unquenchable appetites, particularly for liquor and sausages. 
His outsized cravings could be a stand-in for the greed that was at the heart of the era’s rampant graft, in which Arthur actively participated. Famously, Chester Arthur served as customs collector for the Port of New York. Seventy-five percent of American imports flowed through New York’s harbor and it was Arthur’s job to collect import duties on those goods. In an era before the federal income tax, those duties provided nearly half of U.S. government revenues. 
Arthur and other top Customs officers were entitled to a “moiety,” or share, of any fines on importers or any seizures his department made. As a result, Arthur’s total annual income was the equivalent of about $1.25 million today, making him the nation’s highest-paid politician, including the president.
Overseeing a workforce of about 1,300 gave Arthur substantial political power too. He used the patronage or spoils system (as in, “to the victor go the spoils”) to dole out well-paid positions to applicants based on their loyalty to the Republican Party, not their qualifications for the actual job. Jobholders were expected to kickback a share of their paychecks to help fund the party. Showing up for work was often optional.
Arthur wasn’t at the top of New York’s political pyramid, however. He owed his job to U.S. Sen. Roscoe Conkling, who enlisted Arthur as his loyal protégé. 
“Death by Lightning” begins with James Garfield, an Ohio representative, attending the Republican Convention in Chicago to nominate another Ohio politician, Sen. John Sherman, for president. This was in the days before political primaries; convention delegates chose who was on a party’s national ticket, not voters.

The delegates divided into factions. Many supported former President Ulysses Grant, who was seeking a third term; presidents weren’t yet term-limited by the Constitution. James Blaine was the other main contender. (Among the lesser candidates, U.S. Sen. George Edmunds of Vermont received a smattering of votes.)
But no one was able to get the required majority. With the convention deadlocked after 33 ballots, 16 Wisconsin delegates voted for a new candidate, James Garfield. Garfield protested, saying the votes for him shouldn’t be counted, because he wasn’t a candidate. The convention chairman disagreed. Two ballots later, a majority of delegates swung their voters to this compromise candidate and Garfield was named the Republican nominee.
New York acted as a kingmaker in those days. As the most populous state, it possessed the most electoral votes. So Republican Party leaders curried favor with New York Republicans, and other supporters of the patronage system nationally, by having one of their own, Chester Arthur, selected as the vice presidential nominee. It was a fraught marriage of convenience, pairing a politician who vowed to fight the spoils system with one who embodied it.
After the Garfield-Arthur ticket won the presidency, things went about as well as you might expect. Once in office, Garfield took aim at the patronage system by appointing a new collector for the Port of New York without first consulting New York’s two U.S. senators.
Seeing this as a direct challenge to his political machine, Conkling resigned his senate seat in a symbolic protest, as did New York’s other senator. The incident highlighted the schism within the Republican Party. When Arthur opted to remain loyal to Conkling, he showed that there was a divide within the White House as well.
Less than four months into his term in office, Garfield was shot by Charles Guiteau. Clearly suffering from some form of mental illness, Guiteau had expected to be the beneficiary of the spoils system by being handed a plum job for his supposedly invaluable support of Garfield during the campaign. In fact, Guiteau believed he deserved to be appointed U.S. consul to Paris, a job for which he was wholly unqualified. 
As he was being arrested, Guiteau said excitedly, “Arthur is president now!” When Guiteau’s comment was widely reported, many Americans suspected Arthur of being involved in the plot. Arthur received death threats and was deeply troubled by the accusation. 
But Garfield wasn’t dead yet. 
He survived for weeks with the bullet lodged in his abdomen. Doctors tried repeatedly to remove it. Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln, son of the late president, summoned Dr. Doctor Willard Bliss (yes, Doctor was his first name) to tend to the president. 
Dr. Charles Purvis, a Black physician who was among the doctors treating the president, urged Bliss to employ the relatively new practice of surgeons’ washing their hands and using sterilizing instruments, but Bliss brushed him off. Garfield suffered through multiple attempts to locate the bullet, all without anesthesia.
When he died 79 days after being shot, an autopsy determined that the bullet hadn’t damaged any major organs and could safely have been left in place. The president had died of a massive infection, sepsis, caused by the unsanitary conditions under which he was treated.
Arthur had taken no executive actions while Garfield lingered, not daring to feed the rumors of a power grab.
In fact, the assassination seems to have reawakened Arthur’s long-dormant political integrity. Once in office, Arthur set his mind to reform, both of the political system and of himself. He worked to fulfill Garfield’s mission of dismantling the patronage system, by successfully championing the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, which introduced competitive exams for many federal positions and made it illegal to fire federal employees for political reasons.  
People who had only known Arthur as a linchpin in the political machine might have thought these impulses came out of the blue. But as a younger man, Arthur had shown he could be highly principled. Like his Baptist preacher father, Arthur was an abolitionist. Early in his legal career, he represented a Black woman who had been accosted and thrown off a “whites only” New York City streetcar, winning a sizable judgement in her favor. 
As president, Arthur ultimately defied public expectations, running an administration free of major scandal.  
“No man ever entered the presidency so profoundly and widely distrusted,” Pennsylvania newspaper editor Alexander K. McClure noted at the time. “And no one ever retired more generally respected.”  
Or, as Mark Twain quipped: “I am but one of 55 million; still, in the opinion of this 1/55 millionth of the country’s population, it would be hard to better President Arthur’s administration. But don’t decide till you hear from the rest.”
While Arthur is the most significant Vermont appearing in “Death by Lightning,” alert viewers might note a couple other Vermont cameos. U.S. Rep. Levi Morton, born in Shoreham, appears in all four episodes, though as a minor character. In one scene, he tells Garfield he can’t accept the position of Secretary of the Navy (Conkling had pressured him to reject the position).
In real life, it was hardly the end of Morton’s career. Garfield soon appointed him U.S. minister to France. He was later elected governor of New York and, in 1888, vice president of the United States—along with Arthur and Calvin Coolidge, one of only three Vermonters ever to hold that position.  
Another Vermonter, John Humphrey Noyes, also appears briefly. Born and raised in Brattleboro, Noyes started a utopian commune in nearby Putney. His neighbors were outraged to learn of the commune’s belief in free love and he soon moved the community to Oneida, New York. 
Noyes appears in flashbacks with the future assassin Guiteau, who spent six years as a member of what people in series call a “sex cult.” Guiteau is depicted as getting on people’s nerves because he believes he is too good for the manual labor expected of all community members.
Despite the commune’s free-love edict, the women of Oneida want nothing to do with Guiteau, who they nickname “Charles Git Out.” That unlikely detail — like so many other startling aspects of “Death by Lightning”— is true.

This story by Patrick Billow was first published in News & Citizen on Nov. 13, 2025.
An 1850s Morristown home and barn, which raised a family and thousands of exotic plant species over the last four decades, will soon be wiped from the land — the home by an excavator and the barn by several eager members of the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps.
Don and Lela Avery met in Big Sur, California before they moved with their two sons to a 22-acre property on Duhamel Road in 1979. Leveraging fertile soil next to the Kenfield Brook, they started propagating famously stubborn plants with success, a hobby that blossomed into a renowned business, the Cadys Falls Nursery.
Customers from around the country visited Morristown to purchase rare plant species from Don and Lela. In elaborate gardens around their home, they planted more than 1,400 plant varieties — from showy Lady’s Slippers to dwarf conifers — complemented by paths, sculptures and rock walls that Don built over the years.
The Averys closed the nursery at the onset of the pandemic and opened their beloved gardens to the public. Don and Lela, unbothered and welcoming, would go about their day while guests, plant-savvy or simply seeking serenity, wandered the gardens freely.

But living at the confluence of the Kenfield Brook and Lamoille River has its disadvantages. In terms of 100-year floods— dramatic events that might occur once a century — the Averys have experienced eight in 40 years.
They hoped the flood of 1995 was the worst of it, and after initial concerns that they couldn’t live in the home, the flooding relaxed for decades, and the Averys decided to hunker down.
Then, the Flood of 2023 raised the water level to the first-floor windows of their home.
“We made a decision to stay there and get old there and die there, or whatever you can do,” Don Avery said. “But then 2023 came around and it just slammed us. We weren’t young anymore. We couldn’t really deal with it.”
After a two-year search for a new home, Don and Lela last week signed their property over to the State of Vermont. Vermont Emergency Management purchased the property through a flood-plain buyout for $850,000, and Vermont Fish and Wildlife will restore the land to its natural environment. That money covers the town’s assessed value of the property as well as the cost of removing the home and barn. Including the nursery, there are three active buyouts in Morristown and about 300 in the state.
While the home will be demolished and dragged away, the barn, with its historic features and towering timber frame, is getting a decidedly different treatment. Under the guidance of Huntington-based Building Heritage, volunteers with the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps are taking the structure apart piece by piece and rebuilding it at a different location.
By the end of the year, every structure and piece of material on the property will have been removed, down to bare soil, except for Don and Lela’s plants, which they have three years to relocate, a courtesy likewise granted to farms during a buyout.
The land will become public, rip rap in the river removed; beavers will move in, and the area will continue to flood, but that could improve flooding conditions downstream, according to Will Eldridge, an aquatic habitat biologist with Vermont Fish and Wildlife.
“This is really best for everybody, so I’m not as heartbroken as some people would think,” Don Avery said.
Built to last
Last Friday, volunteers with the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps climbed high into the barn’s rafters and used L-shaped metal rods to pry wooden pegs from timber-frame joints. Tyler Hadar, one volunteer, had devised a system for labeling the timbers with silver placards, so they’d know how to put the barn back together.

The volunteers work through different Conservation Corps programs, but they all have an appreciation for the structure they are disassembling. Hadar is with the timber framing program and other volunteers came from the farming and conservation program.
Working under the guidance of Building Heritage, a historic preservation company, the barn is the first project of its kind for several of the volunteers, and its new territory for the company as well. Interstate 89 travelers might recognize the massive red East Monitor barn off the highway near Richmond, one of the largest barns in the state, which the preservation company rehabilitated in 2023.
“We’ve renovated lots of old barns, but this is our first time taking one down,” Elliot Nathrop of Building Heritage said.
The barn should be disassembled and gone in five weeks, then rebuilt at Building Heritage’s headquarters in Huntington. Its next home has not been determined, but Nathrop said the company has a host of private and public connections for the structure.

As winter rolls in, the volunteers and three workers with Building Heritage are stripping the two-story barn down to the historic timber frame. Accessory structures attached to the barn, like greenhouses and out-barns, have been torn away and demolished, and the old clapboards and metal roofing thrown away, but the hand-hewn timbers and inside-facing boards will be repurposed.
For volunteers in the timber framing program, the project is a practical look at age-old building practices they’re learning about. For farming and conservation volunteers, it’s a lesson on how to deal with ancient structures that are common throughout Vermont’s landscape.
Jessie Gustafson, another volunteer with the timber framing program, is happy the barn is being saved, and she’s found a type of serenity among the hand-hewn timbers from 150 years ago.
“I feel like it’s a lot of respect for the trees that went into making this, and the people that took the time to make it,” Gustafson said. “It’s just such a beautiful barn, and it’s fun to be in here. It’s also fun just, like, ripping stuff up.”
Repurposing structures like the barn also cuts down on the amount of material deposited in a landfill, fulfilling a state mandate to reduce waste after a buyout. On Wednesday, King Construction knocked down the Avery’s home of 40 years with an excavator, and the remains will be thrown away.
Although it’s a historic structure with its own timber frame skeleton, layers of plaster and other material in the home rendered it too difficult and expensive to renovate.
Prior to the demolition, the Averys asked friends and neighbors to raid their home. Building material and appliances, including marble windows, a wood stove and hardwood went to seven surrounding counties in Vermont.
It was nice because it all went to people we knew, people who were building a house or renovating their house, so we knew it was all going to get used,” Lela Avery said.

Don’t whither away
With the structures slated for removal by the end of the year, the only thing remaining of the nursery will be Don and Avery’s gardens, but they have three years to remove them from the property.
Vermont Fish and Wildlife doesn’t want to manage the gardens, but the Averys wanted to break it up anyways. They’ve seen some private gardens wither once they become public.
“It’s too personal,” Don Avery said. “We always knew this wouldn’t be here forever, but we wanted someone who would take care of the plants after us.”
They don’t have a plan for all the species, but some of the rare conifers will return to Greg Williams, a Wolcott plant master who taught the Averys how to graft trees decades ago.
“It was a good long run,” Lela Avery said. “We really enjoyed it. We loved our little place there. We loved our business, and we loved our customers.”

The dealership arranged to have a limousine take her from their offices to get the bank check, she said, and when she got back, the salespeople had Champagne ready to pop.
Harvey, a construction contractor who now lives in New Britain, Connecticut, paid almost $135,000 in 2012 to buy her dream car. It had a handcrafted leather interior, walnut wood paneling and massaging seats with televisions built into the headrests.
But after the vehicle was towed from a public street in 2023, a tow truck company tried to sell it without her knowledge, writing on a form to the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles that it was worth only $1,475.
The value happened to be just under a $1,500 DMV threshold that allows towing companies to seek the agency’s permission to sell cars they tow after 15 days if the owner doesn’t claim it or says they can’t afford the fees.
Over the past year, The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica have reported on how Connecticut’s laws have come to favor towing companies over drivers, including the 15-day provision, which was one of the shortest windows in the country. A law that took effect in October says towers must wait at least 30 days to sell cars.
Connecticut towers have publicly insisted that most of the cars they sell are junk. To sell a car, towing companies need to get DMV approval by filling out a form estimating the value, which the agency is supposed to check against the book value.
But a new CT Mirror and ProPublica analysis of more than 6,000 forms processed by the DMV in 2022-23 and obtained in a public records request found patterns of low values listed by tow companies. And it highlights the DMV’s lack of oversight of the process.
To analyze the towers’ and DMV’s handling of the sales process, the news organizations spent more than a year building a database from the forms, some of which are handwritten. That involved sorting through thousands of scanned documents and manually entering DMV employees’ handwritten vehicle values. Together, the records allow the public to know for the first time what kinds of cars are being sold after tows, who’s towing them and what happens to the vehicles.
The data shows towing companies frequently take advantage of the provision to start the sales process for lower-value cars after just 15 days. About 60% of the forms requested these fast-track sales. By valuing cars under $1,500, towers can sell cars privately and avoid a more cumbersome process that requires them to wait 45 days and sell vehicles at a public auction.
One West Hartford towing company, Elmwood Automotive, valued about 90% of the 33 cars it tried to sell in the past few years at exactly $1,500, our analysis found. The next highest, Lone Star Repair Service and East Coast Towing, both of Stamford, listed around half their cars at exactly that amount. None of those companies responded to requests for comment.
Attorney Eric L. Foster, who specializes in repossession cases and sits on a DMV task force studying towing regulations, said the odds of 9 out of 10 cars being worth exactly $1,500 is “zero.” Foster said it’s on the DMV to call out such data discrepancies and reject the tow companies’ forms because “until you get slapped on the wrist, you just keep doing the behavior.”
Many large companies value their cars below $1,500 and move the vehicles fast, the data showed. Nine companies that submitted more than 50 forms sought permission to sell over 90% of those towed cars after 15 days, as opposed to the longer 45-day process.
Even when towing companies do value vehicles over $1,500 and wait the 45 days, undervaluing cars helps. Under the law, towers are supposed to hold onto proceeds for a year, then hand the money over to the state for owners or lenders to claim later. Using a lower value allows towers to claim they had no profits after subtracting their storage fees.
It’s impossible to know the conditions of all the cars. But CT Mirror and ProPublica found that in nearly half the cases, the tower’s value was less than or equal to 50% of the book value.
In one of the starkest examples, towers sought permission to sell about 150 luxury cars, including nearly 40 BMWs and 20 Mercedes, for less than a third of their book value despite the vehicles having no accident record in the state’s crash database.
DMV spokesperson Shaun Formica said that the agency has reviewed its process for tows. She added that “recent discussions along with legislative changes have reshaped our process” for evaluating the values of vehicles.
At a meeting late last month, DMV program director Johnnine Dominique said employees review forms and make a call about whether differences between the towers’ estimates and the book values are large enough to cause alarm. Sometimes, they ask towing companies to submit evidence supporting the lower value.
“It’s not a good system regardless,” Dominique said, noting that it relies on judgment calls.
In Harvey’s case, the tow company filed the form exactly 15 days after it was towed. The car was having engine trouble, and the DMV approved the tower’s value even though an agency document examiner listed the book value at $17,250. Used car listings show several Range Rover Autobiographies, with more mileage and fewer features than Harvey’s, for sale at higher prices.
Lack of Data
CT Mirror and ProPublica’s initial investigation of towing company practices prompted a legislative overhaul of the state’s law that makes it harder to tow vehicles from private property and easier for drivers to retrieve their vehicles after a tow. As part of the new law, the DMV also had to create a task force to discuss more measures to address how sales occur and what happens to the proceeds.
At the task force’s first meeting in September, Sal Sena, whose company was authorized to sell more towed cars than any other in Connecticut in 2022-23, said nearly half the vehicles he tows aren’t registered, and many of them never get picked up.
But when Raphael Podolsky, a consumer advocate and attorney, pressed for data, neither the DMV nor towers on the task force could provide any.
“The implication was there was no way we could find these things out,” he said.

In fact, Sena’s company, Sena Brothers, which operates as Cross Country Automotive, used the 15-day process for 98% of the towed cars it wanted to sell in 2022-23. Two other companies — Corona’s Auto Parts and Friendly Auto Body & Towing, both of Hartford — used the fast-track sales process 99% of the time.
Sena said he isn’t surprised that he’s the highest-volume company or that most of his forms are filed after 15 days because of the condition of the vehicles he tows. “The majority of the cars that we tow are unregistered and inoperable,” he said. “We do everything from city of Hartford towing to the housing authority towing in multiple towns, and we’re cleaning the parking lots all day long.”
Tom Amenta, owner of Friendly Auto Body, said that his company follows “the letter of the law,” and that low values are a result of towing cars in poor condition. “We can only apply” for the sale, Amenta added. “DMV is the ultimate judge.”
Corona’s did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment.
Of the 6,000 forms processed in 2022-23 that the newsrooms reviewed, more than 2,000 listed values between $500 and $600. In addition, there were 362 where towing companies estimated the car’s value to be exactly $1,500. Metro Auto Body & Towing of Hartford submitted the most forms at exactly $1,500, with 60. Many of those were cars they towed for parking meter violations for the Hartford Parking Authority and not for crashes, which could significantly reduce the value.
Metro also did not return calls or emails.
Bristol resident Jason Trelli wondered how his 2011 Jaguar got such a low value after it was towed in May 2023. He was moving out of his rental home and loaded his possessions into a U-Haul, planning to return to get his car in a few hours.
“So I go to get the Jaguar back, and it’s not there,” Trelli said.
Trelli called the police, who told him the car was towed by Nelcon, which is also registered with the DMV as Maple Avenue Repair Service. But he said the company’s Plainville office repeatedly told him it didn’t have his car.
After several weeks, Nelcon acknowledged it had the car, Trelli said. He spent several more weeks calling the company. But he said Nelcon refused to waive the storage fees, which eventually mounted to $1,900, according to a text message his sister sent him right after speaking to the company herself in August 2023.
In a written statement, Nelcon’s owner, Saleem Khan, disputed portions of Trelli’s account and said, “No employee told Mr. Trelli we did not tow his vehicle.” He said, “Our records show Mr. Trelli was quoted a total price of $665,” when he initially called about his car.
Nelcon submitted a form to the DMV in August 2023 to sell the Jaguar at a public auction. Khan wrote the car was worth $3,500 — about $3,000 less than the book value a DMV employee wrote on the form.
Khan said he used the National Automobile Dealers Association value for the car, adding that the company sold the car to a salvage yard last month.
If Nelcon had written the DMV’s book value and sold it for that, the company would have owed Trelli the profits.
“I never felt so helpless and angry,” Trelli said.

Over the Limit
In addition to some companies valuing high numbers of vehicles at $1,500, some towers submitted forms for 15-day sales even though they listed a value above the $1,500 limit for shorter sales. The CT Mirror and ProPublica found more than 200 forms that listed higher values than allowed.
Rather than rejecting those forms, Formica, the DMV spokesperson, said the agency typically just holds onto the forms until the 45-day mark has passed.
“We generally put them aside, and then once it’s time, we’ll process them,” Formica said, adding that “nothing is getting through.”
That’s what occurred in the cases of Saundra Magana and her niece Eloise Bennett this summer. They had been fighting with the New Britain Parking Ticket Department about payment for their spaces in a city garage for months when Magana went to get something out of her red 2008 Hummer H3 in early July and discovered her car was gone. Gone too were Bennett’s Chrysler PT Cruiser and Jeep Cherokee with a Dallas Cowboys star custom-painted on the hood.
New Britain police told Magana that the city had hired Skytop Motors to tow the vehicles because she and her niece owed thousands of dollars in parking tickets.
Skytop requested the DMV’s permission to sell Magana’s Hummer on July 22. On the form they wrote the car was worth $5,900, well over the $1,500 limit to sell a car after 15 days. But Skytop still checked the 15-day box.
Records show the DMV gave Skytop permission to sell the three cars in August — 47 days after the tows.
Magana said Skytop never notified her that her car would be sold. Both women said they never got an itemized towing bill, and Bennett said she never got any notice from Skytop that it had towed her vehicles. The form Skytop submitted to the DMV listed Bennett at an address that was on her registration but that she hadn’t lived at for several years.

Magana and Bennett filed complaints with the DMV, which closed their cases because it was a civil matter that needed to be handled in the courts, according to letters they received.
A Skytop official said in a statement that the company had been “cleared” by the DMV and the state Department of Consumer Protection. “All cases have been dropped and found out we did no wrong doing,” the company said, without addressing specific questions.
Under the law, towing companies are required to provide evidence that they notified the registered owner and any lienholders, but relying on registration isn’t foolproof.
Foster, the attorney, said the biggest problem with the system is that owners aren’t notified about tows and pending sales because towing companies rely on the address used for registration, which is sometimes out of date.
The result is drivers lose their cars, and “the penalty should not be punitive,” Foster said.
Properly notifying people their cars have been towed is also one of the biggest issues towers face, Sena told consumer advocates at the task force meeting in September.
“If we could create a system where they’re being notified and everybody is aware of the situation, then half the problems you guys are dealing with — and half the problems we are — are going to go away,” Sena said.
As of the last week of October, at least two of Magana’s and Bennett’s vehicles, the Hummer and the PT Cruiser, could be seen sitting in Skytop’s tow lot. It’s unclear what happened to the Jeep.

“This Freaking Car”
For Podolsky, the problem that remains, even after the revised law went into effect last month, is making sure that people who want to get their car back can do so.
Consumer advocates and towing companies remain far apart as they try to agree on solutions to recommend to the legislature by a February deadline.
At the October task force meeting, Podolsky recommended stopping the fees from accumulating once a person notifies the tower they want the car back. Minnesota, for example, allows extra time for vehicle owners who notify the tower to pay. Towers proposed getting rid of valuing cars altogether and holding all vehicles for 30 days, regardless of the value.
Other states don’t rely on towing companies to value vehicles, according to a survey the Connecticut DMV conducted this year. Florida considers the age of the vehicle, for example, while Oregon requires certified appraisers to value vehicles.
“The end result should be they get the car back because they need the car and they don’t abandon the car because they don’t have the money,” Podolsky said.
Harvey was lucky enough to get her luxury Range Rover back.
Her ordeal started in 2023 when the SUV had an engine problem. She took it to a mechanic an acquaintance recommended in Bloomfield. But town officials closed the repair shop because of building code violations.
Somehow, the car was moved to a street in Hartford, where police noticed it sitting for weeks and, assuming it was abandoned, had it towed by Modern Garage.
Exactly 15 days after towing it, Modern Garage submitted a form seeking to sell it. Modern Garage used the 15-day process in 85% of its sales requests in 2022-23. Harvey said she was never notified her car had been towed, but after finding out the repair shop had closed, she called the Hartford Police, who told her that her car was at Modern Garage.
Harvey said when she got there, a man who identified himself as co-owner acknowledged her Range Rover was still there but that it was “leaving today.”
“My partner’s gonna be very upset; he was keeping the car for himself,” Harvey said the man told her.
Modern Garage owner Michael Sardelli denied anyone was planning to keep the car. “Nobody would have told her that,” he said.
Sardelli said the $1,475 value on the form was accurate because “there was a massive puddle of oil under it. It was clearly disabled.”
“They’re a dime a dozen,” Sardelli said of Range Rovers on the marketplace. “They are just so expensive to maintain and once they get mileage on them, the repairs of the car supersede its value tenfold.”
Harvey ended up paying nearly $2,600 that same day to get her car back. Still inoperable, it sits in her garage needing expensive engine repairs.
“I worked my whole life for this freaking car,” Harvey said.

How We Analyzed the DMV’s Forms
To build our database of more than 6,000 forms processed by the Connecticut DMV in 2022-23, CT Mirror and ProPublica extracted and manually entered information from over 10,000 scanned documents obtained through public records requests.
The forms, known as H-100s, were difficult to read, with illegible handwriting and inconsistent redactions, making it difficult to sort through thousands of duplicates across 11 batches.
Reporters manually reviewed the forms, recording the DMV’s listed book value, towing company name, tower license number, tow date, if the tower was selling within 15 or 45 days, the tower’s estimated value and the date a DMV employee signed the form. The vehicle identification number is included on the form but was sometimes illegible or redacted.
We removed rows that were not unique. It is possible that we are undercounting a situation in which two cars were towed and submitted to the DMV for sale approval on the same days and were valued exactly the same by the tower and by the DMV. The inherent inaccuracy of manual transcription meant some duplicate rows were not identical because of human error. We rereviewed nearly 2,000 rows where all but one variable matched, dropping an additional 900 duplicates.
Sometimes, a towing company submitted a new form for the same vehicle. We removed the first form and kept the resubmission when the tow date and VIN matched. Sometimes, it was impossible to decipher a handwritten number. We used our best judgment, generally picking interpretations closest to other dates visible on the form.
To check if high-value luxury cars were in disrepair, we joined our database with the Connecticut Crash Data Repository. Because we could only join the data by tow date, make and year, our counts of cars that were not involved in crashes is an undercount.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from hesstongrocerystore.com)A grocery store like you’ve never seen.
Sometimes there’s a small-town voice in my head that wants to believe, that chides me for being too skeptical, that wants me to join the boosterism chorus. It’s me from another dimension. And it whispers things like this:
I mean, it was going to be a grocery store like the Ritz is a hotel. Yeah, it would be a place where you could buy milk and eggs and maybe some Hamburger Helper for dinner, but that’s like saying you go to Vegas to buy a lottery ticket. Know what I mean? The damn grocery store was going to be a certifiable work of art, a place — no, a destination! — that would draw people from all over just to say they shopped there.
You wouldn’t even have to park outside.
All underground parking, so you don’t have to get wet in the rain or cold in the snow. Lots of lighting and climate-controlled. Even parking and charging stations for your golf carts. No stairs to climb. An elevator would take you up to the store, just like you was going to heaven.
That was the pitch, right down to the parking. You can look it up yourself. Jobs for up to 50 people, a “Delicatessen-style restaurant,” a bakery and German food items in keeping with local heritage. The price tag was something like $20 million, and while there are cheaper ways to get a grocery store, they lacked the vision of this one rich guy.
It would be smack in the middle of this town in Kansas, a little place called Hesston that has 3,500 people tops, a nice town founded in 1886. It’s about 40 minutes north of Wichita. You know the kind of place, full of nice folks where you’d feel safe raising your kids. But like a lot of these burgs it’s been struggling lately, and the last grocery store went bust a few years ago.
That’s where the rich guy comes in.
His name is Brad Heppner. He’s 59 and lives in Texas, but he grew up at Hesston. There’s a video of him at a town meeting last year, and he talks about his connection to the town, about how he’s a sixth-generation Kansan and his people were one of the three founding families of the town way back when, and it’s like listening to somebody read all those begats from Genesis. It’s easy to understand why people trusted him.
He’s kind of a Sunflower Gatsby, see?
He made a lot of money in finance. Started a company and sold it to Lehman Brothers — yeah, the firm that went bust in 2008 — and he has a mansion in Dallas called “Sunfields Manor” where he has these big parties for his rich friends. He also has an estate named after himself out in the middle of nowhere Texas with its own heliport. Can you imagine that?
He founded this other company with a funny name — Beneficial or Beneficient or something, but Brad just calls it “Ben” — with this genius idea of creating a pawnshop for the rich. No, really. I guess the rich need pawnshops like the rest of us do, except instead of your dad’s Stratocaster they’re hocking their private equity or art treasures or vintage Duesenbergs for quick cash.
Brad came back to Kansas and set up a subsidiary for this pawnshop deal because his 80-something mom told him there wasn’t a grocery store in town anymore. He promised to build her one. That’s the story he told just about everyone. He told it to the town, to lawmakers, to the governor. You can look at this video of him saying it. He convinced just about everybody to get on board with the idea, and four years ago he convinced the state Legislature to let him launch the world’s first TEFFI — that’s the name for this kind of pawnshop, and it stands for technology and fiduciary and some other things, but it kind of makes my head hurt to think about it. See, the lawmakers were smart and ignored the Kansas bank commissioner who said there ought to be more regulation, because regulation just stifles business. It was all fine, because 2.5% of every transaction would be earmarked for economic development and, you know, the grocery store.
It would all go through a private nonprofit foundation run by Brad and his wife and their friends and associates, so you knew the money would be safe. Heck, the Heppners even gave $6.5 million to get it started. I mean, this was a great deal, and although nobody really understood how the pawnshop worked, everybody could see the potential. This is why there was such bipartisan support for it in Topeka.
What could go wrong?
Brad said Ben would be so successful there would be lots of TEFFIs popping up in Kansas, maybe 40 or 50 in a couple of years, and the money would roll in, all at no risk to Kansans. That money would come from rich people all over the world, maybe even people in Russia, he said. Imagine that! All those rubles helping to fund a grocery store in Kansas. Only in America!
There was going to be so much money to burn that the plan for the grocery store kept getting bigger and bigger. And it wasn’t just going to be a grocery store, it was going to be an entire shopping experience in downtown Hesston, with buildings made to look like they were straight out of 1886 and new spaces for the city offices. There would be child care and public transportation and all sorts of family-friendly fun.
Then Ben — the big company out of Texas — merged with an even bigger company and its stock went public and was being traded on the NASDAQ. That was a couple of years ago, and shares were going for more than $600. But you know, things have been tough since then, and last time I checked the price of a share was about 50 cents. That might sound bad, but it’s really a great opportunity to invest. Got a buck in your pocket? You could own a couple of shares of Ben.
And I hate to even mention this part, but the feds were looking into some of Brad’s past deals, right from the start. Then this summer some attorneys began asking questions about accounting procedures, and Brad was like, Hey, don’t you know all I’ve done for you? So he resigned rather than answer questions. Can you blame him? Talk about ingratitude. Brad even said it might be about time to shut down the company.
Even after Brad left, people wouldn’t leave him alone. You know how people are. Especially the government.
The feds arrested Brad on Nov. 4 and charged him with securities fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy, making false statements to auditors and falsification of records. Can you believe it?
The indictment alleges Brad misappropriated more than $150 million from a firm, GWG Holdings, forcing it into bankruptcy and causing $1 billion in losses to its investors. The feds claim the money was funneled through a shell company, and about $40 million was used to renovate the mansion in Dallas and his ranch estate. The feds also say he spent half a million bucks on jewelry.
Get this, here’s what the federal prosecutor, a guy named Jay Clayton, said:
“As alleged, Heppner abused his role as a public company executive to loot the company and to funnel money into his own pockets. When executives like Heppner lie and cheat to enrich themselves at the expense of everyday investors, they corrupt the integrity of our public markets.”
Whoa! Where does this guy get off? He just doesn’t get that Heppner is a job creator, somebody who gets things done, an individual who just wanted to help his hometown. I don’t see the feds rushing to build a grocery store for Hesston.
Now the foundation that’s in charge of building the grocery store says it’s going to have to scale back the plans. No climate-controlled underground parking.
For crying out loud, they’re going to ruin things for all of us.
Beneficient is run by different folks now, and they admit that Brad might have oversold the pawnshop idea. But, they said, the idea might still work and that they were committed to building “fundamental value,” whatever that is. They seem like nice folks. The interim CEO told lawmakers that the company was on the same side as law enforcement.
“You don’t have to be a Venezuelan drug cartel boat driver to know that you want to be on the government side of that,” he said, which I thought was kind of a weird thing to say, if you want to know the truth.
Brad entered a “not guilty” plea on Monday, Nov. 10, so I guess he’s going to fight. The feds arrested him in Texas but hauled him to New York, where the charges were filed. Figures. According to the indictment, they’re looking to take away Brad’s mansion and the ranch.
He’s presumed innocent until proven guilty.
Damn right!
This all reminds me somehow of a book I was made to read in high school about a guy named Gatsby. You know the story. Gatsby’s the hero, and he gets the girl and has this big house and has all these parties. I didn’t make it to the end of the book because it was so long, but I do remember something about a green light.
That’s what we all want out of life, right? A green light.
That’s not what it means. And Gatsby winds up dead.
Shut up!
When I was a kid, the highlight of my week was when I’d go with my mom to the local Piggly Wiggly and maybe be allowed to get a comic book from the rack near the front. Imagining the $20 million grocery store Brad was going to build, I had kind of the same feeling. You didn’t know if you were going to get a Fantastic Four or a Spider-Man, but you knew it was going to be good.
There won’t be any comic books for us now, just a lousy Bazooka Joe wrapper.
But the thing that bothers me most is thinking about Brad’s mom. She’s in her 80s, and everybody says she’s a great lady. It looks like she’ll never have the chance to go to the dream grocery store with Brad and park underground and go up the elevator. That makes me sad in the same way as when I think about when I learned there wasn’t a Santa Claus. I’ll bet it makes her sad, too.

But are they always honest  when flyers face delays?","You ever get the sense the airlines are lying to you?
Sure, the government shutdown wasn’t their fault. But are they always honest — in this instance and others — when flyers face delays?


How often has a promised 20-minute delay morphed into an hour?  And then another hour?  And maybe even a cancellation?
Because these most recent delays were beyond their control (they can blame Congress), airlines were not required to do much… aside from apologize.  Some did offer meal vouchers and hotel rooms, but for the most part travelers were on their own as schedules and staff were juggled.
Overall, the federal shutdown is estimated to have cost airlines, hotels, and car-rental companies about $1 billion a week.  And that’s not even counting the cost to travelers for their time and expenses.
But when the airlines say, “We apologize for the delay, but it’s not our fault,” there are some things they can and do control, especially as they drive for maximum revenue on every flight… like paid-for seat assignments, one of the so called “junk fees.”
A U.S. Senate report says one airline alone, United, raked in $1.3 billion just for letting passengers pick their seats… more than the $1.2 billion they earned for handling checked bags.
Assigned seats ease the boarding process and give fliers what they want… aisle access, that comfy middle seat or, my favorite, the window seat.  I want to see where I’m flying and I’ll pay to get it.
So imagine the outrage of passengers on several airlines who paid $15 – $30 for a window seat and found it had no window!
United and Delta airlines are now facing a class action suit potentially affecting more than a million passengers who were affected, paying for window seats with no windows.  It’s just the way the aircraft were built and the seats were laid out, so the airlines knew before offering those seat reservations.
If they knew the ‘window seats’ had no windows, why not warn passengers before they click?
(I encountered the same problem on Amtrak on its new NextGen Acela, choosing a window seat in advance only to board the new train and find a bulkhead and no window.) 
What’s the airline’s defense?  Well, they say that just because it’s called a window seat doesn’t mean you get a window… that the seat name refers more to its placement nearest the fuselage vs the aisle.
In its defense, United’s attorneys literally said “The use of the word ‘window’ in reference to a particular seat cannot reasonably be interpreted as a promise that the seat will have an exterior window view.”
Really. That’s what they said.

Duncan claimed 68% of the vote with all precincts reporting their results. Turnout for the election was 21.5%. 
The campaign between two Democrats saw Republican state Attorney General Liz Murrill challenge Duncan’s claim that he had been exonerated. She sent him a letter before the October primary election, saying he needed to “cease representing to the public that you were ‘exonerated’ to avoid further action from this office.” 
Court records confirm Duncan’s name was cleared in 2021.
Lombard also called into question Duncan’s criminal status during public debates and in a lawsuit that accused his opponent of making false claims in violation of state election laws. An Orleans Parish judge denied Lombard’s request for a temporary restraining order to halt Duncan’s campaign advertising. 
In addition to his own experience as a defendant, Duncan was a “jailhouse lawyer” while serving time at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, helping other incarcerated people with their post-conviction filings. 
After his release, Duncan earned a bachelor’s degree in paralegal studies from Tulane University and received his law degree from Lewis and Clark Law School. He founded the Light of Justice Program, which provides assistance to the incarcerated.
Duncan was given a life sentence for the shooting death of  David Yeager, 23, during an Aug. 7, 1981, armed robbery in the Tremé neighborhood. Yeager’s girlfriend, Kristi Emberling, was with him when he was shot and identified Duncan as his killer in March 1982. Police showed her a mugshot of Duncan, who was 18 at the time Yaeger was killed, taken when he was 14 years old.
The Innocence Project of New Orleans, now known as Innocence and Justice Louisiana, began representing Duncan in 2004. Its attorneys questioned the accuracy of Emberling’s identification, noting she said she was convinced that Duncan was the shooter only after she was him on television in handcuffs after being arrested. 
The defense team also compelled the release of withheld police documents in New Orleans in Portland, Oregon, where Duncan had moved to join a Job Corps program and was arrested. 
The documents revealed discrepancies in the investigation, which was led in Clackemas County by a detective who would later be convicted of illegal wire tapping in a separate case. The same detective had told Duncan he has been identified by his two prominent gold front teeth, which wasn’t true.
Mounting issues with the case led then Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro to vacate Duncan’s murder conviction in 2011 and allow him to plead guilty to manslaughter and attempted armed robbery. Duncan was resentenced to 49 years in prison but released for the time he had served. Cannizzaro, who now leads the criminal division in Murrill’s office, was an assistant DA involved in Duncan’s prosecution in 1985.
In 2021, the Louisiana Legislature approved a law to allow defendants who’ve pleaded guilty to challenge their convictions if evidence of their innocence was withheld from court. Duncan sought such relief and after a judge vacated his 2011 conviction, current Orleans District Attorney Jason Williams dropped the charges against him. 
The clerk’s post puts Duncan in charge of record keeping for Orleans Parish Criminal Court, and he’ll oversee all elections in the city. 
Lombard will leave office after one term, having won the citywide post in 2021 after serving as clerk of the city court in Algiers since 2012. 
The incumbent’s chances to stay office in took a hit over the summer when it was discovered that several boxes of criminal court records, some dating back to the 1950s, were mistaken taken to a city landfill. Lombard blamed Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration for trashing the documents without his approval. The city had provided space to store records for the clerk’s office, which had run out of room for storage. Lombard said he and his staff scoured the landfill and recovered a significant portion of the paperwork.
Williams has been critical of Lombard’s financial management, claiming the clerk is responsible for failing to secure $500,000 in bail revenue intended for the court and the district attorney. Lombard said he has worked with Williams to resolve the fiscal issues, according to a report from Verite.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20250926_CZB_CalvinDuncan_05-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-16 00:56:54.109721

RANDOLPH — Vermont’s state chapter of the Democratic Party has a new leader — and he’s taking the helm at a challenging moment for the party in Vermont and across the country. 
Lachlan Francis, a political consultant from Westminster and former chair of the Windham County Democratic committee, was elected state party chair on Saturday at Vermont Democrats’ biennial reorganization meeting. Francis beat out one other candidate for the job — Justin Willeau of Vershire, the former secretary of Orange County’s Democratic committee and owner of a coffee business — by 33 votes to 12.
The two candidates were vying to succeed outgoing party chair Jim Ramsey, who’d held the job on an interim basis since February but opted not to seek it again. Ramsey took on the role with less than a full, two-year term left after former chair David Glidden resigned.
Also on Saturday, the party reelected its current vice chair — Amanda Gustin of Barre City — to another two-year term, as well as a slate of other statewide officers who oversee the party’s electoral strategy and manage its finances.
Only the race for chair was contested. The roughly four dozen people who voted in Saturday’s election, held on the Vermont State University campus in Randolph, were largely members of county Democratic committees from across the state. 
Francis steps into the job a week after Vermont’s Republican Party also elected a slate of top officers for the next two years. A key focus for Democrats — who are likely to maintain control in the 2026 election of both the state House and Senate — will be winning back seats the party lost in 2024. That’s when the state GOP flipped a historic number of seats in both chambers, dismantling powerful Democratic supermajorities.
Many of those races were colored by voters’ concerns over the cost of living and how safe they feel in their communities. The extent of Democrats’ success in 2026 will hinge on the party’s ability to find messages that resonate with many of the voters who spurned its candidates — some of them incumbents — in races a year ago. 
Meanwhile, at the national level, Democrats are grappling with what flavor of left-wing politics could appeal to the most voters as they attempt to win back control of both houses of Congress next year and set the stage for a White House win in 2028. 
The national party has also been divided in recent days over decisions by some members of its Congressional caucuses to break ranks and join most Republicans on a spending deal that ended the federal government shutdown, but without a guaranteed extension of enhanced health insurance tax credits. (All three members of Vermont’s congressional delegation voted against the measure.)
“Obviously, we’ve got a lot on our plate — to say the least,” Francis said Saturday in brief remarks after the results of the vote were announced. He added in a press release issued later Saturday that, as chair, he would “strengthen our grassroots infrastructure across the state, support candidates who put people first, and ensure that we make Democratic values winning values in every election, in every community.”Francis previously managed now-U.S. Rep. Becca Balint’s first campaign for Vermont state Senate and worked on one of former Vermont Attorney General TJ Donovan’s campaigns for that office. More recently, he has worked as a researcher at Global Strategy Group, a national Democratic polling firm based in New York City.

At age 29, Francis also brings more youth to Vermont Democrats’ ranks. His election Saturday makes him one of the youngest state Democratic Party chairs in the country, according to May Hanlon, the Vermont Democrats’ executive director. Hanlon herself is 26, which makes her the youngest Democrat in her role in the country, she said. 
To be sure, much of the state GOP’s success in last year’s election was thanks to campaigning by Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who continues to be among the country’s most popular governors. In recent polling Scott also remains popular with Vermont Democratic voters who have a propensity to split their tickets on Election Day. 
A major question facing the state Democratic Party in the first half of 2026 is whether it will run a challenger to Scott, assuming he runs for reelection, who would make for substantial competition. In the last two election cycles, Scott trounced his Democratic opponents, both of whom had relatively little name recognition across the state. 
Two state Democratic heavyweights — Treasurer Mike Pieciak and Attorney General Charity Clark — have been rumored to be eyeing the Fifth Floor job though have not publicly said yet whether they’re running.
Both Pieciak and the state party have been especially critical of many of Scott’s responses to actions taken by President Donald Trump’s administration in recent months.
Willeau, in his pitch to the room on Saturday, suggested the party take a less offensive stance against Scott — whom he called “our favorite punching bag” — because of the five-term governor’s popularity with Democratic voters.
“I think the question is, does this committee represent Democratic voters the way they actually vote?” he asked. “And, if it doesn’t — how well do we know ourselves?”

GLACIER — For going on three decades, Patricia “Patty” Davis was a fixture in the Glacier post office.
Her son said she always had music playing as she worked and used to bring her black dog, Bear, with her behind the counter.
“She was just a pillar of the community,” co-worker Jennie Ablondi said. “She was like the second mom to everyone.”
Davis, 70, died of heart complications on Nov. 1. Her passing has left Glacier residents not only mourning her loss, but also fearing for the future of the post office.
Rumors that the United States Postal Service plans to shut it down completely caused alarm this week in the rural community that relies heavily on physical mail. Cell service in the town is poor, while landline phones and WiFi are cut off during frequent power outages.
Glacier’s post office was not accepting outgoing mail on Monday, Nov. 10. The next closest post offices are in Maple Falls, almost 8 miles away, and in Deming, almost 20 miles away. Many locals do not get mail service to their homes.

Using the Maple Falls post office would present additional logistical challenges, in part because it is in a different zip code, said Glacier Water District Commissioner Deborah Ellen Baker. And she noted businesses having to change their address to another area would cause confusion. There are 215 mailboxes at the Glacier location, according to Baker.
“Currently, there is no updated information to provide” about plans for the Glacier post office, USPS spokesperson Janella Herron wrote in an email Wednesday, Nov. 12. She added she would respond again “as soon as I have any further feedback.”
In a Wednesday statement, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray wrote, “The post office in Glacier is not only an important part of the town’s history, but it’s essential to residents who visit every day to send and receive mail, get their medications, and so much else.”
“If this post office shuts down,” she added, “people in Glacier will be forced to travel much longer to get the basic mail services they rely on — I’m reaching out to USPS for more information and answers.”
On Monday, about 19 residents gathered in front of the post office entrance, some holding signs with messages like, “Save Glacier’s post office,” and “Deliver us from closure.”
Glacier Water District, which owns the building, doesn’t charge USPS for the space, Baker said. In fact, Davis paid a monthly $40 utility fee — the minimum the district could charge, Baker said — out of her own pocket.
Fay Catron, who joined the protest Monday, has lived in the area for almost 15 years. When her family first moved into their remote home, getting an address took some time, she said.
“Being out here, we don’t have a whole lot,” Catron said. “And so we — I — rely on this post office a lot.”
If the post office shuts down, Catron said, she may have to take time off work to get packages. She gets things by mail, she explained, because in this remote area it’s “an hour to anything.”
Some, like Diane Gilbraith, rely on the post office for prescriptions. Gilbraith, 80, said as she gets older, “I know my world is getting smaller. But the essentials are here.”
Getting medication by mail is “really important,” she said, “because I know it’s going to get to the point where I won’t be able to drive into town.”
There’s also a social aspect to the significance of the small office, which has a bulletin board for the town and a bookshelf that serves as a mini library.
“It’s our lifeline,” 50-year Glacier resident Jan Eskola said of the post office. “When the mail comes in, it’s a place where we can all gather and share information and ideas.”
After the protest dispersed, all was quiet again at the post office. Kodi Sortino stopped by to pick up her mail. The town has many elderly residents, Sortino said, for whom it would be hard to travel far for mail.
“Why make them go all that way and go through all the hassle of changing their town and all that nonsense?” she asked. Sortino, who’s lived in Glacier for 15 years, has most of her mail delivered to the post office.
Even if the post office stays open, locals will feel Davis’ absence. She took over running the post office in 1999 and had been there ever since.
“It’s just a small community,” Sortino said. “Everybody’s like family.”
Graham Davis said his mom was “my best friend since the day I was born.” She loved music, from The Beatles to Roy Orbison to Enya. Everybody knew Bear, her late dog and work companion.
Gilbraith said she never saw Davis lose her temper. “She just took care of people,” Gilbraith said. “That’s what she did.”
Sortino described Davis as a “free spirit,” someone who “just told you how it was.” It was always fun to chat with Davis on Ablondi on Sortino’s daily post office visits, she said.
“She was like — I don’t want to say a mom, more like an auntie to me,” Sortino said.
“I miss her,” she added. “It will be different without her.”
Graham Davis noted his mother “specifically requested that people celebrate her memory by listening to the song ‘Spirit in the Sky’ by Norman Greenbaum.”

It would abandon our 2030 emissions targets, gut our most effective programs, and lock Massachusetts into the very fossil fuel dependence that has driven today’s affordability crisis.","MASSACHUSETTS IS KNOWN as a leader in clean energy and climate action. Our policies have lowered emissions, created jobs, and helped families save money on energy. But a bill currently under consideration in the House of Representatives on Beacon Hill threatens to undo that progress and would be a damaging mistake for our state.  
This bill, proposed by Rep. Mark Cusack, the co-chair of the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, is essentially a fossil fuel industry wish list. It rolls back the Commonwealth’s enforceable 2030 climate targets, weakens the Mass Save energy efficiency program, eliminates efforts designed to make energy efficiency more affordable for working families, and even resurrects the disastrous “pipeline tax” that would allow utilities to charge residents for unnecessary gas infrastructure. In short, it hands fossil fuel companies a gift while leaving Massachusetts households to foot the bill.  
At a moment when President Trump is dismantling federal climate policy, this bill would do the work for him. It would abandon our 2030 emissions targets, gut our most effective programs, and lock Massachusetts into the very fossil fuel dependence that has driven today’s affordability crisis. It would cede our hard-earned reputation as a clean energy innovator and put our economy, our health, and our climate at risk.  
Our lawmakers must be clear on what’s really driving high energy costs: it’s not clean energy. It’s fossil fuels, gas infrastructure, and aging transmission systems.  
In 2023 alone, Massachusetts consumers spent $20 billion on energy in their homes and businesses. Programs like Mass Save delivered over $34 billion in savings between 2012 and 2023 and generated more than $3 for every $1 invested. The program is the only tool we have that actively reduces energy burden for all of us, including low- and moderate-income households that are hardest hit by rising energy costs. 
Mass Save has weatherized 350,000 homes (including 70,000 low-income homes), created nearly 76,000 jobs, and saved the equivalent output of five power plants. Even if you’ve never used it directly, you’ve benefited from lower wholesale energy prices because your neighbors did. These are real savings in people’s wallets.  
By rolling back these programs and weakening enforceable climate targets, House members would lock the state into an outdated, expensive fossil fuel system. Weakening the 2030 climate target removes enforceable benchmarks that ensure our government takes the action we demand.  
Without those benchmarks, Massachusetts risks falling behind while other states, and the world, invest in the clean energy technologies of the future. Communities that are already most vulnerable to pollution and climate impacts—low-income and environmental justice communities—will feel the consequences first.  
The House also risks undermining the thriving clean energy economy Massachusetts has built.  
Our clean energy sector supports more than 115,000 workers, there are over 7,500 energy businesses statewide, and the clean energy industry has added more than $15.9 billion to the state’s economy since 2012. Clean energy is not just good for our planet; it’s good for our wallets. Weakening climate laws now would send a chilling signal to investors, slow innovation, and damage our long-term economic growth, not to mention dirty the clean air and water we deserve.  
This bill tells the rest of the nation that when federal leadership falters, Massachusetts folds. It tells clean energy workers that their jobs don’t matter. It tells communities on the front lines of climate and pollution that their health is negotiable.  
But that’s not who we are. Massachusetts became a clean energy and climate leader by setting ambitious goals. We still have five years to hit our 2030 targets. Our legislators must reject this fossil fuel gift and recommit to a future built on affordability, innovation, and climate responsibility. A vote for this bill is a vote to cede our leadership to the Trump administration and the fossil fuel lobby. A vote against it is a vote for Massachusetts – to protect our progress, our economy, and our environment.  
The choice is simple: Massachusetts can lead, or we can go back. The people of Massachusetts deserve leadership.
