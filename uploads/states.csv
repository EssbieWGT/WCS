As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high. A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. [&#8230;]","A 3D graphic representation of a spherical-shaped, measles virus particle, that was studded with glycoprotein tubercles (Alissa Eckert/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).Cities and states fighting a historic measles outbreak find themselves undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation. As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.
Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.
The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota health commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”
 Alarm among experts

Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.
A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.
Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.
 State responses

The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.
Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

Nancy Mace publicly accused of being a sexual predator was arrested Tuesday on charges of stalking and sexual harassment, according to Charleston County jail records. Eric Bowman, 45, turned himself in to Sullivan&#8217;s Island Police and was booked into the jail at 6:15 a.m. Tuesday. Bowman, a Charleston [&#8230;]","Rep. Nancy Mace talks to reporters at a Richland County GOP event on Jan. 27, 2025. (Shaun Chornobroff/SC Daily Gazette)One of the four men U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace publicly accused of being a sexual predator was arrested Tuesday on charges of stalking and sexual harassment, according to Charleston County jail records.
Eric Bowman, 45, turned himself in to Sullivan’s Island Police and was booked into the jail at 6:15 a.m. Tuesday.
Bowman, a Charleston entrepreneur, denied the allegations in a post to his X account Monday night.
He said the charges came from his estranged wife, who he claimed he has not spoken to since November 2023.
A spokesperson for the jail did not immediately return messages from the SC Daily Gazette. The Sullivan’s Island chief told the Gazette the department is working on a release.
Stalking is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine, while first-degree harassment is a misdemeanor with a penalty of up to three years in jail and a $1,000 fine.
The charges come roughly two months after Mace’s stunning, hour-long speech Feb. 10 on the floor of the U.S. House, when she accused Bowman and three other men, including her ex-fiancé, of being sexual predators and committing “some of the most heinous crimes against women.”
All four men immediately and have repeatedly denied the claims.
Mace accuses 4 men, including ex-fiancé, of being sexual ‘predators.’ SLED is investigating.

The 1st District congresswoman posted Bowman’s mugshot on social media Tuesday morning — both her official House account and a separate account she uses for campaigning and personal posts.
“If you harm women and kids, you should face the full force of the law,” he wrote. “Eric Bowman, one of the men featured prominently in my floor speech, arrested this morning. I hope you get everything you deserve and more.”
She also re-tweeted an X post from the days following her floor speech, which mentions all four men, and added, “Just going to leave this right here.”
Brian Musgrave, one of the four men named in the speech, is suing Mace for libel and defamation and is using her social media as evidence.
The 37-page complaint against Mace, as well as several unnamed people accused of conspiring with her — identified only as “Jane/John Does” — will test the bounds of the “speech or debate” clause of the U.S. Constitution that shields members of Congress from lawsuits for what is said in either chamber.
Musgrave’s legal team argues that Mace’s protection does not extend outside the halls of Congress and especially not onto the internet.
“It does not transform the floor of Congress into a sanctuary for defamation, nor does it protect Congresswoman Mace’s extra-Congressional defamatory statements surrounding her speech,” reads the lawsuit.
Rep. Mace sued by 1 of the men she accused of being a sexual predator

Bowman said as recently as Monday on social media that likely won’t be the last lawsuit filed as a result of the House speech.
“The lawsuits will keep coming. Because eventually, the truth sues back,” he wrote on X.
No additional lawsuit had been filed against Mace as of Tuesday. And Mace has yet to file a response to Musgrave’s lawsuit.
Commenting on her own post about Bowman’s arrest, Mace said she hopes he “rots in hell.”
Mace has said she is considering a 2026 run for governor.
She has taken numerous jabs at Attorney General Alan Wilson, as well as Lt. Gov. Pam Evette, who have said they are considering a bid as well. U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, as well as state Sens. Sean Bennett and Josh Kimbrell have said they are mulling a run as well.
After Mace’s speech, the State Law Enforcement Division confirmed that her ex-fiancé is being investigated for assault, harassment and voyeurism. The investigation began in December 2023 after SLED was contacted by U.S. Capitol Police, SLED said in a statement Feb. 10, which made no mention of the other three men.
He has vehemently denied the allegations and said he is cooperating with the investigation to clear his name.
On Tuesday, a SLED spokeswoman said the case remains active and ongoing.
Last week, federal prosecutors dropped charges against James McIntyre, an Illinois man who Mace accused of physically assaulting her with a violent handshake in the Capitol in December as he advocated for transgender youth.
The Washington Post and The Imprint, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit news outlet focused on child welfare and juvenile justice, spoke to witnesses at the time who said they saw a normal handshake between McIntyre and the congresswoman. The Imprint first reported the charges being dropped.
Mace said she won’t back down.
“When a man can physically assault a woman in the halls of Congress, with impunity, it sends an appalling message to every woman in America,” Mace said in a statement April 2. “If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere. I was injured, intentionally, and I am still in pain.”

Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people [&#8230;]","A Medicaid sign at a U.S. Senate Democratic press conference on Feb. 19, 2025. (Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare. 
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state. 
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.
Lawmakers will ask SD voters for permission to end Medicaid expansion if federal support declines

States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets.
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state. 
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.

The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, eager for Congress to reclaim constitutional authority over unilateral tariffs imposed by executive branch.","U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, said he supports bipartisan Senate legislation to restore Congress' constitutional authority to review unilateral tariffs imposed by the executive branch. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from U.S. Senate's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — Republican U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas pushed back against President Donald Trump’s vision of a trade war by joining a dozen cosponsors of federal legislation restricting unilateral tariffs without consent of Congress.
Under a Senate bill, a U.S. president would be required to inform Congress within 48 hours of issuing a new or modified tariff. A duty levied by the executive branch would expire unless the House and Senate passed a joint resolution within 60 days endorsing a tariff.
Moran said he joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, supporting restoration of Congress’ constitutional role in setting U.S. trade policy.
“The Constitution gives Congress the authority to make decisions regarding foreign commerce, including tariffs,” Moran said. “This legislation allows the president to use tariffs to respond to emergencies while permitting Congress to weigh the appropriateness of any tariffs that are imposed.”
Trump indicated he would veto the trade legislation if adopted by the House and Senate.
Global financial markets were thrown into disarray as investors responded the Trump’s tariffs on imports from dozens of countries. The S&P 500 finished Monday almost 18% below its February peak. Anxiety remained high due to concern Trump’s trade war could undermine economic growth and trigger inflation.
Moran said in a statement unfair trading practices by foreign countries had harmed U.S. producers, workers and consumers. Congress and the Trump administration should work to prevent American jobs from being lost to other countries due to distorted trade policies, he said.
He said tariffs had in the past caused the loss of agricultural markets to other countries. He expressed hope Trump’s latest round of trade sanctions would serve a purpose “quickly and, where appropriate, be lowered or eliminated.”
“American tariffs are often met with reciprocal tariffs, which are frequently aimed at our farmers and ranchers,” Moran said.
The tariff bill attracted 13 cosponsors that included Republican U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Todd Young of Indiana and Susan Collins of Maine.
Moran wasn’t joined in support of the Trade Review Act of 2025 by his Kansas peer, GOP Sen. Roger Marshall. On NewsNation, Marshall said Trump’s tariffs would bring manufacturing jobs to the United States, but the process would involve “short-term pain.”
Meanwhile, Moran said he met with representatives of the Kansas Farm Bureau and associations representing the state’s corn, sorghum and soybean farmers to discuss challenges and opportunities posed by tariffs. Kansas grows more crops than the state could consume and international markets have been a substantial source of income to farmers.
“We discussed opportunities for Kansas farmers through bilateral trade agreements with new international trading partners that Kansas commodities have not historically had as customers or where there is opportunity for increased demand,” the senator said.
Moran said trade conflict emerged as the agriculture economy endured high input costs, low commodity prices, record land values and extreme weather. He promised to advocate for legislation designed to “ensure the survival of family farms in Kansas.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Jerry-Moran-ukraine-senate.png,,,2025-04-08 10:07:10.051741

StebbinsThe Republican attorneys general for Iowa and South Carolina are leading a coalition of 11 states in seeking to overturn Michigan’s ban on conversion therapy for minors.
Contending that the law censors therapists’ speech, the coalition filed a brief Friday in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals requesting a reversal of a decision issued in January by U.S. District Judge Jane Beckering. Beckering, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, found the Michigan law does not govern free expression of religion or speech, but instead professional conduct, which she said the state has a “legitimate interest” in regulating.
Passed in 2023 by Michigan’s then Democratic-led Legislature, the law prohibits mental health professionals from seeking to alter a minor’s sexual orientation or gender identity, a practice known as conversion therapy, or risk facing disciplinary action that could result in the loss of their professional licenses.
However, the group of Republican attorneys general says the ruling sets up a “censorship regime” that forces mental health professionals to “choose between making a living in a licensed profession and retaining their right to speak freely.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The case stems from a lawsuit filed in July 2024 by Catholic Charities of Jackson, Lenawee and Hillsdale Counties on behalf of Emily McJones, a licensed therapist from Lansing, whose practice, Little Flower Counseling, provides “evidenced-based treatments from a perspective that is faithful to the teachings of the Catholic Church, while loving and caring for each client.”
However, the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry has determined that not only do conversion therapies “lack scientific credibility and clinical utility,” there is “evidence that such interventions are harmful.” That stance is shared by the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, as well as the American Psychological Association and the National Association of School Psychologists. 
Regardless, the Republican attorneys general argue  Michigan’s ban risks tainting medicine with politics. In addition to the attorneys general in Iowa and South Carolina, the brief is signed on by AGs in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, and North Dakota. 
“Free speech should protect the medical field from political pressure seeking to stifle scientific advancements. And it is far from clear that the ideological partisan bent embodied in Michigan’s law is ‘settled’ in any meaningful sense,” the brief said.
A similar law in Colorado is set to be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court later this fall.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_0496_2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-08 10:07:10.051741

(Photo courtesy of Alaska Department of Corrections)An Anchorage senator has proposed expanding the Alaska Board of Parole, and widening the range of experiences of its members, citing the board’s workload and importance of fairness and accountability in its work.
The parole board has granted far fewer people parole from state prisons in recent years. Since 2021, the board granted parole on average 25% of the time, with the other 75% denied or continued, according to a legislative audit last year.
According to the ACLU of Alaska, the board has released 79% fewer people and held 75% fewer hearings than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Advocates argue the high rate of denials is contributing to overcrowding and a sense of hopelessness, also contributing to higher rates of suicide. There have been at least 67 deaths in Alaska since 2020, with 17 reported as suicides. 
Senate Bill 62 expands the board of parole from five to seven members, “to help address a substantial workload” and “process parole applications in a fair and accountable manner,” according to a statement by the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage.

“This precipitous decline in successful parole applications has created this climate of hopelessness,” Tobin said in an interview. “It has created this dynamic where people don’t know why they should be involved in treatment, why they should be trying to rehabilitate. And that, to me, is very concerning.” 
Tobin said she frequently hears from concerned residents with family members who are incarcerated. “For every person who is behind bars, there are people outside who love them and who are concerned about their health and safety,” she said. Tobin said she wants to expand opportunities for parole, also because as a Christian she believes in redemption.
“Some folks have done terrible, terrible things, but that is not the whole of who they are,” she said. “There is an ability for them to be redeemed, and I believe that we should offer that path of redemption.”
The five-member parole board is appointed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, and reviews applications for parole, which totaled 181 applicants last year. That review process includes whether they’ve taken part in educational and rehabilitation programs, as well as the person’s suitability for release, the nature of their offense, and behavior while incarcerated. The board also takes into consideration statements from any victims or their family members. 
Parole can be granted for those who are elderly, or with a severe medical diagnosis, with some exceptions for serious crimes. The parole board sets conditions of release like terms for work, housing, and sometimes further behavioral health treatment.  
The legislation would create selection criteria for the expanded seven-member board, and limit members to two five-year terms. Four of the seats would require certain licenses or expertise: 

one for a licensed physician, psychologist or psychiatrist;
one for a victim of a crime, a family member of a victim, or member of a victim advocacy group;
one for someone with expertise in addiction recovery; and
one for a member of a federally recognized tribe.

The bill would remove the only current specific experience requirement for board membership: that at least one has experience in criminal justice. It would keep a provision that the governor appoint people “on the basis of their qualifications to make decisions that are compatible with the welfare of the community and of individual offenders” and who are able to consider “the character and background of offenders and the circumstances under which offenses were committed.”
The tribal affiliation requirement is aimed at addressing the disproportionately high number of Alaska Native people incarcerated — the largest ethnic group in state prisons, at 44% in 2024, Tobin said in the sponsor statement that accompanied the bill. 
The legislation would also require the board of parole to submit an annual report on parole decisions, and reasons for granting or denying parole. 
Advocates, including with the ACLU, have complained that the current board’s decision process for discretionary parole is opaque. A legislative audit last year found “the board was unable to provide specific reasons why its parole approval rate decreased.”
“It’s hard to know if you’re going to be a successful applicant for discretionary parole, if you don’t know how the board of parole makes their determinations and decisions and why someone might be denied parole,” Tobin said. 
Chair says board follows law, considers each case individually
Tobin questioned Leitoni Tupou, the board chair, directly about some of these issues at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 26. Tupou has worked in Alaska corrections starting in 2000, and was appointed to the board in 2020. He’s up for another five-year term. 
When asked about the decline in numbers of parole applications granted, Tupou rejected the premise of the question.
“Every hearing is an individual hearing,” he said, and noted higher approval rates for drug offenses and property crimes.
When asked about demographic data of parolees being removed from the parole board website, Tupou said that data was not required to be public under current law.
For medical or geriatric parole, there were no applications granted in 2024, according to state data.  
When asked about these rates, Tupou said the board is confined to follow current law. “If the law allows the parole board the discretion to apply the law of mercy, I believe we can do that,” he said. “So my recommendation is we look at the current law when it comes to medical parole. Because there are times we’d like to release these folks, but our hands are tied. They do not meet the criteria set by the law to allow them to be released.”
He cited a recent case of a 94-year-old applicant for parole that the board denied. 
“Can you imagine the kind of expenses that we spend to take care of this person?” he said. “At the same time we had to look at the seriousness of his offense. He committed one of the most heinous crimes. At the same time, what is he going to do? He’s 94 years old. But the laws basically tell us he’s not qualified. So as lawmakers, I think that is something that needs to be reviewed.”
Tupou told the committee more addiction treatment and rehabilitation programs would benefit people who are incarcerated, as there can be waitlists or lack of programs offered at certain facilities. In some cases, he says the parole board “continues” the application, to allow people time to get off waitlists and into those treatment programs. 
“Because it appears to us, the only way we can help these folks is (for them) to participate in some programs,” Tupou said. “We cannot just let them be released to the community and have the parole officer in the community supervise them, without them being part of some kind of a program. Jobs are great, but programs (like) substance abuse treatment programs, sex offender treatment programs, mental health programs — those are the programs that have to be available for these folks to go to. And looking at the risk of them reoffending, the possibility will be less.”
After the hearing, Tobin said it sounds like “double jeopardy” for the parole board to put so much weight on the original crime, when someone has already been to trial and sentenced. 
She also noted it costs the state to keep people incarcerated — at a cost of $202 per day — plus medical care, at the expense of other programs and services. 
“The average cost is $75,000 (per person) per year,” she said. “I’m not saying that this is about cost containment and cost savings, but it’s all part of the conversation …. As we give money to our Department of Corrections to keep people incarcerated, we are making choices to not invest in other places, like pre-K (education).”
Tobin introduced similar legislation last year that failed to move out of committee. She said the bill this year scaled back some requirements for board seats, with feedback from other legislators. Those included requirements like a required seat for someone with a felony conviction that has been dismissed or sentence served, and limiting seats of former correctional employees. 
Advocates argue more transparency will help avoid recidivism
The Reentry Coalitions of Juneau, Anchorage and Fairbanks support the bill, as well as the ACLU of Alaska. 
Megan Edge, director of an ACLU project focused on prisons said the move to make the parole board process more transparent, and share decision making processes would also help better ensure support services and lower the rates of people reoffending, known as recidivism.  
“Why are they recidivating? Because most people that are making parole, they’re excited to go home,” she said. “Did they have a substance use issue? Did they have a mental health issue? Was it a housing problem? Was it an employment issue? And we just need better data to understand why our recidivism rate is where it is at and how we can improve it.”
Alaska rate of recidivism – defined as when someone is paroled and then violates the terms of parole or commits a crime again — was almost half, or 47% of discretionary parolees and 67% of mandatory parolees over the last three years.
Edge emphasized that more representation on the board of people with technical and career expertise — in behavioral health and rehabilitation in particular — can help improve conditions of release. “So I think a properly functioning parole board should be looking at an applicant’s ability to be successful once they’re released, and so when they’re not successful, we would all be served better on knowing why people are failing,” she said. “It’ll make our communities safer.”
Expanding opportunities for parole helps unite families, she added, and lessens negative impacts on children especially. She said cultivating hope can also improve prison safety and conditions for inmates, and for staff. 
“It’s sad. You hear the clink on the door, and you realize all these people are locked in there and like, it’s an impossible job,” Edge said, who also worked for the Department of Corrections under Gov. Walker’s administration. “So when you take that hope away from inmates, you’re making that a more toxic workplace for your staff. So there’s benefits for everybody when people have hope.”
SB 62 is being heard in the Senate State Affairs Committee with the next public hearing scheduled for Tuesday, April 8.

Legal groups that advocate for immigrant rights say the rise in detentions shows federal authorities are using Maine as a tool in its “mass deportation” goal, but caution that increased detentions don’t necessarily mean there is increased enforcement, as of now.
According to attorneys, while some of the people detained under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement orders in Maine were arrested in the state, the majority appear to be transferred from other states. And they’re quickly transferred out, too. 
“It’s more of using Maine as a place to move people,” said Carol Garvan, legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine. 
Immigration arrests are happening in Maine, though it’s unclear if such arrests have increased. So far nationally, arrests and deportations have been lower in recent months compared to the same period last year, although legal experts are alarmed by the ways in which federal agents are making such arrests. 
Local police enforcement around the state has been disjointed so far in the absence of formal federal partnerships, adding to confusion and fear. 
First Maine police department joins ICE partnership

Last week, ICE signed its first official partnership with a local law enforcement agency, which will allow officers to arrest people on immigration violations in the course of routine work, an authority previously reserved for federal agents. An application from another police department is pending.   
Detentions by the numbers  
Maine’s largest jail is seeing the highest number of detentions. Cumberland County Jail in Portland had 68 people detained under ICE orders as of March 28, with a total of 178 since Jan. 20, according to the sheriff’s office. 
The jail lifted a restriction on intake, largely due to staffing shortages, this summer. ICE detentions have increased since.  
In comparison, in 2024, the jail had 10 people detained under ICE orders in June, 20 in July, 27 in August, 47 in September, 49 in October, 54 in November and 50 in December. 
Anna Welch, the founding director of Maine Law’s Refugee and Human Rights Clinic and professor at University of Maine Law School, started a project in January to provide limited consultations for ICE detainees at Cumberland County Jail, in partnership with the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine and the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project. 
More than half of the over 100 people detained under ICE orders who she and her students have spoken with were transferred to the jail from other states, including Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New Jersey. 
Unlike many other states, Maine doesn’t have a dedicated ICE facility, which means local jails are relied on for detentions.

The Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office doesn’t have a direct contract with ICE but has had a contract with the U.S. Marshal Service since July 2010. Under this contract, the county jail is given a daily rate to house federal detainees, including people awaiting a hearing on their immigration status or deportation.
In the absence of a formal agreement, other county jails in Maine temporarily detain immigrants at the request of ICE. 
For example, at the end of March, Androscoggin County Jail had three people with immigration charges, however they are being held on state charges that must be adjudicated first before the federal detainer kicks in, said Major Lane Feldman, the jail administrator.
“We probably had 10 total since Jan. 20, but we do not hold long term, nor do we have an agreement with [Customs and Border Protection],” Feldman said of people detained under ICE orders. “They pick up and move within 24-48 hours of arrest.”
York County Jail is handling such cases similarly. Sheriff William King Jr. said, as of the end of March, they had four people being held on criminal charges who also had ICE detainers.
Androscoggin County Jail and York County Jail don’t have official contracts with federal authorities like Cumberland, Feldman and King confirmed. 
Two Bridges Regional Jail in Wiscasset is also holding people in immigration custody, anywhere from a dozen to 25 ICE detainees, according to legal advocacy groups that said they first began receiving communications from people detained under such orders there roughly a month ago, after not being aware of any cases prior.  
Two Bridges Regional Jail did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding whether the facility has an agreement with federal authorities or is housing immigration detainees. ICE also did not respond to questions about whether the agency has a contract with Two Bridges and how many people are detained there under ICE orders.
During an interview with Maine Morning Star, Welch paused to note she’d just received another intake sheet from someone calling her organization from Two Bridges. “So they definitely are detaining immigrants there,” she said. “I just don’t know the specifics about how many bed spaces they’ve made available.” 
Expanding operations in the region
Just as many of the people being detained under ICE orders in the state weren’t arrested in Maine, they aren’t staying here long. 
Movement during immigration detention is common. As local sheriffs and jail administrators clarified, holds are often 24-72 hours before people are picked up by federal authorities. 
“We were just speaking with someone who was at Cumberland County Jail about issues and then when we went to talk with them again, they were in Texas,” said Garvan from the ACLU of Maine. 










It's certainly a money maker, and that obviously raises large red flags in terms of the human costs.


– Anna Welch, the founding director of Maine Law’s Refugee and Human Rights Clinic and professor at University of Maine Law Schoo


ICE may move people for any number of reasons — space, staffing — but Garvan and Welch said regardless of intent, this movement creates chaos and makes it more difficult for both legal counsel to advocate for their clients and for families to keep in touch. 
“I think that the open secret is that this is used as a way to move people farther away from where their communities are, where their lawyers are, where there are resources for them to maybe be able to better defend their immigration case,” Welch said. 
Just over the state border in New Hampshire, ICE started using the medium-security Federal Correctional Institution in Berlin to detain immigrants, according to the ACLU of New Hampshire.
In February, the LA Times obtained an email from FCI Sheridan — a medium-security facility in Oregon — to its staff asking for volunteers willing to work at the New Hampshire facility that the email said is expected to receive at least 500 migrants from ICE.
While the UMaine Law group hasn’t heard of anyone being transferred from Cumberland to FCI Berlin yet, Welch said she thinks it’s only a matter of time.
“I think this is a reflection of the larger goal of this administration to expand space for immigration detention,” Welch said.  
Prisons and jails have financial incentives to assist with that expansion, Welch said. Like many across the U.S., jails in Maine have concerns about being underresourced and are seeking additional funding in the state budget.
A key reason the Cumberland County Jail had a moratorium on housing people incarcerated on federal charges was because the federal government found its staffing to be insufficient. When the moratorium was lifted this summer, Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce told the Portland Press Herald that the U.S. Marshal Service contract is a crucial part of the jail’s funding model. 
“It’s certainly a money maker,” Welch said, “and that obviously raises large red flags in terms of the human costs.”

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Monday signed five dozen bills on topics running the gamut from emergency services and elections to public safety and psychedelic mushroom therapy. 
She signed Senate Bill 41, mandating New Mexico establish an alert system for missing Indigenous people, a move praised by the Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women.
“Today, we celebrate a victory for Native communities across New Mexico and beyond,” CSVANW Executive Director  Tiffany Jiron said in a statement.  “The signing of SB41 is not just a policy achievement, it’s a victory for every Native mother, daughter, sister, and aunt who has ever been impacted by the violence that continues to ravage our communities…The Turquoise Alert System is a powerful tool that will help law enforcement act quickly when a Native person goes missing, providing the necessary resources to respond with urgency and care.”
Senate Bill 16, which allows independent voters to participate in primary elections without changing voter registration (Lujan Grisham signaled at the end of the session she liked this proposal). 
Other important legislation the governor signed includes: House Bill 458, which establishes the Energy, Minerals, and Natural Resources Department’s authority to regulate carbon sequestration — pumping carbon dioxide into the ground. The bill collects fees for injection and establishes a fund to cover the costs of liability for ensuring carbon stays stored underground. HB458 passed on a 26-11 vote after contentious debate in the Senate’s final late-night session. 
The governor also signed off on Senate Bill 57, which creates an exemption in the state’s public records laws for any records that contain “personal identifying information or sensitive information,” of public sector abortion providers. 
Senate Bill 219, which establishes a program for medicinal use of psilocybin mushrooms.
Senate Bill 364, which allows immigrants authorized to work by the federal government to become police officers in New Mexico.
While the governor vetoed a more comprehensive set of reforms to the state’s parole system, she did sign Senate Bill 375, which allows early discharge for people who comply with probation and removes payment of court and parole costs as a condition of parole eligibility.

The governor has until April 11 to act on legislation, such as signing into law or vetoing legislation. If a bill goes unsigned after the deadline, it is not enacted — called a pocket veto.
Effective immediately
Four bills contain “emergency clauses,” meaning they went into effect as soon as the governor signed them.
House Bill 206 authorizes the New Mexico Finance Authority to loan money to 62 public entities for water infrastructure projects, and Senate Bill 115 authorizes loans for up to $1 million to an additional 200 public entities, such as schools, cities and local governments.
Senate Bill 33 creates a Wildfire Prepared Program in the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department’s Forestry Division to provide technical assistance and training to help structures and properties in high-risk areas survive wildfire.
Senate Bill 66 exempts the Early Childhood Education and Care Department; the Children, Youth, and Families Department; the Public Education Department; and other agencies considering people applying for caregiver roles from the Criminal Offender Employment Act, which prohibits employers from automatically barring people from job opportunities because of their criminal history.

Cashing in on an invitation from Republican Utah Sen. John Curtis, who Duffy said approached him about plans for FrontRunner as soon as he was nominated for the post, the secretary boarded the southbound train at Salt Lake Central Station on Monday afternoon for a jaunt to the next station, where the entire contingent crossed the platform to a second train waiting to take them back.
Riding first on the ground level and then upstairs on the double-decker cars, Duffy’s fellow passengers pointed out the windows to Utah’s mountains, new housing developments along the line, and Intermountain Health’s massive Murray hospital, complete with its own TRAX stop.

Speaking quickly in the few minutes they had, they shared stories of adult children living in parents’ basements in the wake of a housing affordability and supply crisis, while praising the transit system’s access to key locations on the Wasatch Front, like the University of Utah, and free fares for students, some of whom can now choose not to own cars.
“Isn’t that a different conversation? What kids don’t want licenses and cars these days?” Duffy quipped back.
Flanked by Curtis and Rep. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, who noted she was representing all of Utah’s U.S. House representatives, Duffy took a moment after returning to the station to praise Utah’s transit as “doing it the right way.” 
“From my perspective at the Department of Transportation, I want to invest in great transit projects, the ones that are on budget, that are clean, that are safe, that move people, that actually have projections on ridership and actually meet those projections or exceed those projections, not give me projections, and then come in with lower ridership, and they cost more money,” Duffy said. “You may be an example for other communities to look at as a case study on how they could do it and do it better.”

The sunny review of transit in Utah — the state with the third-highest rate of car ownership, at 96% of households — was starkly different from Duffy’s comments last week during a brief ride on the New York City subway with Mayor Eric Adams, where the secretary bemoaned crime, blasted the city’s congestion pricing plan as forcing New Yorkers onto trains because it’s too expensive to drive, and repeated threats to withhold federal funding.
Curtis told reporters that during Duffy’s Utah visit he had explained to the secretary about the state’s distinctive population distribution, with “80 or 85% of our population in this narrow little corridor, and then we have a vast rural part of the state.”
“We’re trying to provide transportation for all of them, and it’s key to be able to have an effective FrontRunner, TRAX, bus system, in addition to our hard surface road area, all that comes together to be able to accommodate the massive growth,” Curtis said.
When asked how President Donald Trump’s tariff strategy, which has tanked global markets while stoking fears of rising prices and economic recession, could impact federal investments in transit, Duffy was quick to stand by the president with an optimistic endorsement of tariffs as “a massive revenue driver into the federal coffers” that can then be invested across the country, including in projects like roads and bridges.
In a follow-up about tariffs’ impacts on Americans’ personal finances, Curtis was more reserved, saying “we’ve all seen this before, right?”
“This is a long-term investment we’re making as a country. I’m very, very sympathetic, particularly with small businesses that are dealing with tariffs, and we’ll see where this goes,” Curtis said. “But we’re clearly on this path that we’re committed to, and I think we in the Senate need to do all we can to get a good runway for our small businesses and bring predictability into this as well.”
UTA expects these transit projects to be ready before the 2034 SLC-UT Olympics

Utah Department of Transportation executive director Carlos Braceras said following the event he believed Duffy had heard Utah’s message that as the state grows, it will need to build up infrastructure — which means roads and bridges, as well as transit.
“They like Utah, because they see Utah as a place that’s innovative. We’re very cost effective, and we move fast,” Braceras said of the state’s federal partners.
As federal funds are slashed in Washington, D.C., Braceras said he isn’t nervous about any Utah transportation projects. Long-term formula funding for transportation doesn’t appear to be in jeopardy, he said, while any discretionary grant funding that does — or doesn’t — come through for the state “is kind of that sugar on top.”
Looking at not just the state’s current transit needs and projected growth, but at Salt Lake City and Utah hosting the 2034 Winter Olympics, Duffy emphasized the need for a positive partnership between Utah’s state and federal leaders and the Trump administration.
“This is not just Utah. This is America that presents itself at the Winter Olympics, and making sure we make the right investments and we have the right partnership amongst your federal delegation, your state representatives, but also the administration is key to make sure we get it right,” Duffy said.

The Senate Judiciary Committee delayed action last week on SB 167, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, would require such support to be paid until the child turns 19.
“The premise is to make sure we take care of the minor children that are left behind if the breadwinner is killed,” Orr said.

He told the committee that the idea from the bill originated from Texas. Orr said he thought to himself, “Well, if it will prevent DUIs (driving under the influence), to know how serious we are about it.”
The penalty would be in addition to other restitution that an individual who is convicted of the crime would owe.
A death resulting from a person operating a motor vehicle or vessel while intoxicated is considered criminally negligent homicide under Alabama law, a Class C felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
Language in the bill states that the court may consider the financial needs and resources of the surviving children as well as the parent or guardian, or the state of Alabama if no one else is available to care for the children.
Other factors the court could consider include the standard of living of the family, the physical and emotional needs of the children as well as educational considerations.
“The reasonable work-related child care expenses of the surviving parent or guardian,” the bill states.
Orr also proposed an amendment to the legislation stating that the penalty is separate from any civil penalties that a court may impose in the case because of wrongful death, which could add to the financial burden of those who are convicted.
Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, had concerns that the penalty could effectively require the person convicted of the parent’s death to have a relationship with the family whose loved one was killed.
“I don’t know if we want to go that route,” he said to the committee. “I can see creative lawyers using that in that way.”
Albritton also said he was concerned about the broader impact the legislation has on the community.
“What about the guy who does this, and he has a family of his own?” Albritton said. “We are not only punishing the individual, but we are also taking, and affecting more people, for the act of an individual. I think we need to be cautious of this.”
Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, D-Mobile, asked the committee to consider the situation when a parent loses a child because a person is driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol.
“If we are going to do something like this, I think we need to consider all cases when things happen by someone,” she said.
After hearing all the arguments, Orr withdrew his proposed amendment and requested that a vote be delayed.

Assembly Bill 475, heard Friday in the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, would appropriate $18 million to Clark County and $7 million to Reno to continue their ongoing eviction diversion programs. Tenants who qualify for the program are able to get outstanding rents paid and avoid an eviction. 
Democratic Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno, the bill’s sponsor, anticipated more people could be at risk of financial insecurity and eviction since “the times we are living in are going to get more interesting.”
“There is a need for eviction support in our state, and I believe it’s only going to get greater,” Monroe-Moreno said. 
Monroe-Moreno’s concerns are shared throughout the nation and the world, as the trade war started by Donald Trump last week has led to historic nosedives in markets and increasing fears of a recession.
Both Clark and Washoe counties have benefited from rental assistance dollars to divert people from evictions, said Jonathan Norman, statewide advocacy, outreach and policy director for Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers. 
Since pandemic-era rental assistance has scaled back, eviction diversion has been exclusive to people living with disabilities or who are elderly with fixed incomes. 
The $25 million request is higher than $18 million approved in 2023.
“The reason the ask is higher is because we want to expand beyond seniors and adults with disabilities to families with young kids,” Norman said. “In Clark County, they identified about 1,600 families with a child under the age of one at risk for eviction. This would allow us to route those cases to eviction diversion as well.”
Reno Judge Kendra Bertschy told lawmakers the proposed financial allocation is a “crucial investment in community stability, public safety and responsible governance.” 
“The need for legislative support for rental assistance remains urgent,” she said. “Economic challenges, medical emergencies, and other unforeseen events continue to put renters at risk of eviction. Without continued funding, many will face housing insecurity, increasing the burden on emergency services, shelters and the judicial system ultimately costing taxpayers more.”  
Prior to the pandemic, the Las Vegas Justice Court averaged about 33,000 eviction cases filed each year, said Las Vegas Judge Jessica Goodey.
There have been “record high filings” and Las Vegas Justice Court had “43,030 evictions filed” in 2024,” she said. She didn’t note how many evictions were granted in 2024.
“To date in 2025, we have had 9,985 evictions and we are anticipating that number to continue to increase with the current state of affairs,” Goodey said. 
From the onset of the Covid pandemic in 2020, state and local governments have used federal relief dollars to help people at risk of eviction.
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed a bill in 2023 that would extend a modified version of an eviction protection passed by state lawmakers in 2021 that temporarily paused an eviction while rental assistance applications were pending.
However, Lombardo approved Assembly Bill 396 in 2023 that allocated $18 million in rental assistance dollars.
State lawmakers originally sought to approve $44 million for rental assistance in Clark and Washoe county with AB 396 in 2023. The amount was reduced to $12 million for Clark County and $3 million each for Reno and Sparks and Reno. 
The Las Vegas Justice Court used the funds to expand its existing eviction diversion program while Reno stood up a new eviction diversion program, Norman said.
Of the cases going through the Vegas court, “1,375 diverted cases in 2024 were households with an adult with a disability and 575 were seniors,” he said. 
While he said Reno has offered rental assistance since the pandemic, it only recently started a housing justice court that offers an eviction diversion program.
Since Reno’s eviction diversion court started in August, “94 households went through the eviction diversion program with 80% of them remained housed,” Norman said.
Without additional funds provided by the state, the program most likely won’t be able to continue, Bertschy said.
Republican Assemblymember P.K. O’Neill questioned if lawmakers were forgetting to allocate rental assistance support for rurals. 
When lawmakers were debating the 2023 allocations, rurals indicated they were still using ARPA dollars for rental support, Norman said. He said they indicated they wouldn’t need additional funds through the legislature.
Monroe-Moreno said she is looking into an amendment to include funding for rural areas.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A group representing midwives in the state has withdrawn its support for a bill intended to update their practice regulations after a Senate committee made significant changes to it. 
As originally filed, SB 87, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, would have allowed midwives to administer three parts of newborn screenings: heel stick, hearing screening, and Critical Congenital Heart Disease (CCHD) screening, which can provide early detection of genetic or metabolic conditions. 
These screenings should be completed within 24-48 hours of birth, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health. Midwives currently have to recommend their patients to a pediatrician’s office, often delaying the time-sensitive screenings. Alabama allows a birth attendant to administer them if a physician is absent but has not allowed midwives to acquire them.
Nancy Megginson, legislative chair with the Alabama Midwives Alliance (ALMA), said in a phone interview Monday that midwives have faced ambiguity regarding their ability to conduct newborn screenings. While existing law requires midwives to instruct clients about these screenings, it only explicitly allows them to order the tests. This has led to midwives being denied the screening kits, particularly the blood spot test cards collected via heel sticks.
“Our issue has been once we were licensed, we started ordering the newborn screening cards from the Department of Public Health, because our law says a midwife shall order the newborn screening. We were actually told to stop trying to order them, that they weren’t going to give them to us because they didn’t know who would be administering it,” Megginson said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The substitute version introduced and adopted in the committee would authorize licensed midwives to administer a heel stick but explicitly states that a midwife “is prohibited from interpreting any tests or screens under this subsection and shall cause any results to be referred to a physician of the mother choosing who is licensed to practice medicine in this state.”
Midwives say the new language in the bill is too restrictive, particularly concerning newborn care and screening.  
Sen. Larry Stutts, R-Tuscumbia, who introduced the substitute, said in an interview Monday that saying midwives “are not qualified” to interpret results. 
“They’re not pediatricians. They’re not qualified to interpret the results and provide newborn care,” Stutts said.
Under the substitute bill, Stutts said midwives “can collect the sample and then send it to somebody that is qualified” but that the bill “does not expand anything else that they can do.”
Megginson said that the new language stating midwives are prohibited from providing any newborn care was “hostile language that had never been discussed.”
Midwives are trained in newborn care for up to six months, Megginson said, but they are not trying to interpret test results or diagnose conditions. Restricting their ability to perform state-mandated screenings or assist with basic newborn needs is “absolutely absurd,” Megginson said.
She is now actively lobbying legislators to amend the bill on the Senate floor.
“We are encouraging anyone to place an amendment, to put it back on track, where all three screenings would be included, where no language about newborn care to be written. We’d like that to be completely struck through,” Megginson said.

Kay Ivey has signed into law a bill granting paid parental leave to state employees and public school K-12 teachers. This is a huge win for state employees, who will no longer need to scramble to cover the cost of unpaid leave in order to recover from birth and care for their newborn babies.
The lawmakers who championed the bill have spoken about benefits including increasing competitiveness with other states and the private sector, and reducing financial strain on covered parents and families while caring for a newborn. However, the benefits of paid parental leave stretch far beyond these.
Paid parental leave leads to lower infant and child mortality, fewer re-hospitalizations for infants and mothers, improved maternal mental health, higher breastfeeding rates and more extended duration, a decrease in intimate partner violence, and improved outcomes for children throughout their lifespan from improved infant attachment and child development, all the way to increased education and future wage growth as adults.

In a state that ranks third highest in maternal mortality and has a rising infant death rate that consistently exceeds the national average, any intervention that could improve the health of mothers and babies in our state should be a top priority.
The Legislature has signaled its interest in addressing Alabama’s abysmal infant and maternal mortality rates with other bills this session, including one approving presumptive Medicaid coverage for pregnant people to encourage early prenatal care and one focused on postpartum depression education and screening.
Paid maternity and paternity leave for state employees is an excellent next step in the fight to keep Alabama mothers and infants healthy, but the Legislature need not stop there.
Fourteen other states already have mandatory statewide paid family and medical leave laws, which typically provide six to 12 weeks of paid leave for new parents. If fears about negative effects on businesses are stopping our lawmakers from following suit, they can rest easy. Some of these policies have been in place for over a decade and have been found to be business-friendly, resulting in lower turnover and improved employee retention, higher productivity, and higher worker morale.
The majority of Fortune 500 companies,; over three-quarters of the top 20 hospitals in the nation,; tech giants like Google, and the military have already recognized what is slowly beginning to dawn on Alabama’s lawmakers: Ppaid parental leave is good for business, good for families, and good for society.
I applaud Gov. Ivey and the legislature for granting paid parental leave to Alabama’s teachers and state employees. But the next step — paid parental leave for all Alabama families — still awaits action.

(Air Canada press photo)Lost in the focus on President Donald Trump’s tariffs is the economic impact his war of words is having on international visitation to Las Vegas. When the President of the United States tells people they are not welcome, could be detained, or even end up in an El Salvadoran prison, they listen and decide to go elsewhere. The result will hit Las Vegas hard with empty hotel rooms, vacant tables at restaurants and empty seats at shows. The President may cause a recession in Las Vegas from his hanging up the “not welcome” sign to the rest of the world. 
International tourism is big business in Las Vegas, with over 5 million people estimated to have come last year. No country sends more people to Las Vegas than Canada. Canadians make up 30 percent of Las Vegas’s international travel. With domestic air travel to Harry Reid airport down almost 8% over the first two months of the year, Las Vegas can ill afford a sharp decline in international visitors. 
Trump’s repeated insults to Canada have Canadians saying no thanks to coming to America. Air travel bookings from Canada to America for this summer are already down by 70 percent from last year. If that holds for Las Vegas, it would mean 1 million fewer international tourists to Las Vegas from Canada alone. Canada, Mexico, and England combine for almost two-thirds of all international tourists to Las Vegas, and while those used to be three of our closest economic and political allies, Trump seems to be doing everything he can to change that. Canada and England have issued new formal travel advisories to their citizens about the dangers of travelling to America
Las Vegas is the 6th most visited city in America, and like Orlando, the city whose economy is most dependent on travel and tourism. Other cities who host more foreign visitors have other main industries. Los Angeles has entertainment, New York has finance. But in Las Vegas travel and tourism are the core industries. Research I conducted at UNLV’s Brookings Mountain West with Ember Smith detailed how cities like Las Vegas that rely on travel and tourism fared even worse during Covid than those with core industries less directly impacted by pandemic related travel shutdowns. More than 40 percent of Nevada’s entire state GDP comes from tourism. Start hammering away at that and it does not take much to trigger a recession. 
Trump’s trash talking of our allies is self-defeating in his attempt to reduce America’s trade deficit. Every dollar a foreign tourist spends in Las Vegas counts as an American export for purposes of counting our gross domestic product (GDP), and reduces our trade deficit. Economists think of it as America exporting the fun of Las Vegas to people living abroad. Promoting international visitation to the U.S. was part of President Obama’s successful campaign to double America’s exports and reduce our trade deficit. During my service on President Obama’s National Travel and Tourism Strategy we worked to make it easier for people to travel to America, creating jobs and growing our nation’s economy.
Trump campaigned with populist promises to win the votes of Nevadans like no taxes on tips and capping credit card interest rates at 10 percent. But he has governed as President quite differently, instigating a trade war, threatening Canada and Greenland with invasions, and praising Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. 
America’s odds of a recession have shot up since Trump took office. Trump’s trade war, punitive actions against his perceived enemies, and attacks on the rule of law, along with Elon Musk’s slash and burn of government agencies have generated widespread business uncertainty, and shrunk consumer confidence. 
The stock market’s crash on Trump’s tariffs last week could, in theory, be reversed should Trump walk back his tariffs. But the view that America is a great country to visit will be much harder to rebuild. More than one out of every ten tourists in Las Vegas comes from another country, with more from Canada than any other. When President Trump insults them, many will go somewhere else. That could push Las Vegas and all of Nevada into a recession more easily than people may realize, and it could last longer than whatever tariff rate is set today and changed tomorrow.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Boeing-787-5-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-08 08:04:52.709443

In an audio recording obtained by the Current, Mesquite City Manager Edward Owen Dickie tells several residents that he notified police union officials last year that if Chief MaQuade Chesley were fired, he’d replace him with a “6 foot 5 Black woman…”
“…Early on, I said ‘guys, I’m going down to Louisiana, I’m going back to the back parishes and I’m going to find me a 6 foot 5 Black woman chief…’” Dickie is heard saying in the recording from February. 
The statement echoes another by Dickie recorded in late 2024, according to sources, in which he repeats a similar assertion made to the Mesquite Police Officers Association, which was seeking Chesley’s ouster.  
“I told them I’d like to go down to Louisiana with the biggest Black Aunt Jemima. I was careful how I said it cuz…. But I said ‘(unintelligible) would love that and come back and just flippin’ whip you guys into shape,’” Dickie can be heard saying. “I brought this up. I’ve heard things and if the Chief doesn’t come back you guys, it’s not going to be, you’re probably going to hate the next Chief more than him.” 
Dickie goes on to say he’s “heard there’s racial issues” in the department.

Dickie, during a phone interview, called the statements “poor taste of humor. I didn’t know I was being recorded. I own it. I learned you just don’t say things that you really shouldn’t be saying. The City Council is aware and they’re going to hand down a reprimand.”
Dickie says the residents who recorded him were alleging racism against police officers and suggested he hire a Black chief. 
“‘Maybe what we need is diversity,’ I was telling them. ‘Maybe it’s an African-American woman, you know, that is qualified,’” Dickie said of the recorded conversations.
“Those comments are inappropriate for anybody to be using, especially in a work environment, especially in a position of power, where you’re picking the next police chief,” says Wes Boger, who was re-elected in November to serve on the city council, but resigned after a month, citing  a desire to spend more time with family.
“I don’t blame Wes for leaving, because this is not worth it,” Councilwoman Patti Gallo, the only member of four who voted against terminating Chesley, said at a special meeting in March that was called to investigate Chesley and ratify his termination.
Last month, Judge Nadia Krall ruled the city failed to comply with the law in its investigation of Chesley, and granted the former chief’s request for a restraining order and injunction, prohibiting the city from holding a public investigation into Chesley’s termination.
Dickie’s statements should preclude him from “any role in the recruitment and/or appointment of the next Chief of Police,” Mesquite resident Bob Muszar wrote in an emailed complaint last week to Mesquite Mayor Jesse Whipple. 
Federal law prohibits hiring based on race. Dickie says the city has scrapped its search and will stick with a successor from inside the department.
Whipple, in a reply to Muszar, defended Dickie, suggesting he “was trying to express to them that he would like to make sure that racism was not acceptable within our city or department,” and “was using that example as an illustration that our department could use some diversity within its leadership. I do not believe that he intended it literally.”
“At some point, the City Manager’s intended message becomes irrelevant,” Muszar wrote back. “Throwing race, gender, size and point of origin all into a single statement generates just too much fodder for anyone wanting to challenge the recruitment/appointment process.”
While Dickie’s recorded statements indicate he was defending Chesley, the relationship at some point became more antagonistic.
When Dickie’s statements prompted a flood of public record requests from residents seeking his text messages and emails, Chesley says he asked the city manager how he was coping with the requests. 
Dickie, in response, defended his earlier comments.
“I didn’t say anything like ‘I hate n——, I hate Mexicans,’” Dickie can be heard saying on the recording provided by Chesley.  
Dickie, asked to authenticate the recording, said he didn’t remember saying the ‘N’ word, adding he never uses it. “If I said it, it would be that I was saying ‘I didn’t say this.’” 
Chesley suggests Dickie could have conveyed the thought without using the actual word. 
Dickie alleges Chesley may have altered the recording. “I know he learned how to do that at the FBI academy.”

“I have the entire conversation and it is easy to prove it wasn’t doctored,” Chesley responded, adding he would sign a court affidavit stating as much. 
Dickie also suggests he was baited by residents Nick Alfonsetti and Mike Benham to repeat the assertion he made to the police union about finding a female Black chief. 
“It’s sad,” he said, adding he “didn’t know there are people really like that out there.” 
Alfonsetti and Benham say Dickie was not baited. The discussion, they say, was in response to Dickie’s earlier assurances that he would not fire Chesley.
“That’s when the whole thing came up about hiring somebody outside Mesquite, because the police didn’t like anybody that was in the department,” Alfonsetti said.  
Dickie said he is good friends with Chesley, though he acknowledges they never socialized together. Chesley says Dickie, who was hired by the city last summer, “is not my friend and never has been. I don’t associate with people who make racist comments or jokes. In the short time I’ve known Owen he has repeatedly done both.” 
Dickie, who initially cited a no-confidence vote by the Mesquite Police Officers’ Association as one of the factors to be considered in Chesley’s termination, was unable to say how many members voted or how many expressed no confidence in Chesley. 
The MPOA did not respond to the Current’s request for the information. 
“As a labor attorney who represents labor organizations, I would never recommend doing a vote of no confidence unless you can have almost 100% if not 100% of your members voting,” says Reno attorney Ronald Dreher, who is representing Chesley in a lawsuit against the city, adding “it’s odd not to put up the numbers.”  
The wrongful termination  lawsuit filed by Chesley against the city alleges the city violated Nevada law, which requires any investigation of a police officer be conducted by law enforcement. The city has commissioned several investigations, Dreher said, but none were conducted by law enforcement. 
Fall from grace
Mesquite, a small city about 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas, was founded by Mormon pioneers in the 1880s. The population was predominantly Mormon until a building boom in the last 15 years brought thousands of retirees to the Virgin Valley community. 
“Every police chief that’s ever been promoted in the City of Mesquite has been a white Mormon,” says Chesley. “I fit the bill in 2019 when I became the police chief.” 
A turning point came, Chesley says, when he began getting calls from individuals who expected favors, such as making traffic tickets disappear. “My response was always ‘we have court proceedings for that.’”   
His fall from grace with the Mormon community, he says, was cemented on the heels of rumors allegedly circulated by former City Attorney Bob Sweetin. Sweetin was appointed last year by Gov. Joe Lombardo to the Real Estate Division’s Common Interest Communities Commission, which regulates homeowners’ associations.
“Bob had spread rumors that I was having affairs and getting people pregnant and having sexual relationships with minor females, and so I filed a harassment complaint with Human Resources,” says Chesley. “I’ve been a police executive for the past 14 years. I’ve always held myself to a higher standard. I don’t have locker room talk. I don’t have sexual discussions like most guys do. No one will ever say ‘MaQuade is talking filth.’ I just don’t talk that way. I don’t like to be around it. To be accused of these things floored me. It destroyed me and my family.” 
Sweetin says an investigation cleared him of spreading rumors. He says his termination was purely political.
Sweetin also alleged financial crimes against Chesley. Attorney General Aaron Ford investigated and found no evidence of criminal violations, according to Chesley’s lawsuit against the city.
The final straw for Chesley may have been an internal investigation Mesquite Police initiated under Chesley’s watch into allegations leveled against Officer Ryan Hughes. 
“Ryan had applied multiple times for the police department, but he never passed any background checks,” says Chesley. As a police officer, Chesley assisted on Hughes’ background investigations and quickly learned Hughes had a reputation as a bully.  
Hughes was eventually hired by former Chief Troy Tanner. 
In June of 2024, Mesquite Police launched an internal investigation of Hughes. Chesley says the officer went on leave for twelve weeks, mounted a campaign against Chesley, and won assurances from two council members, Karen Fielding and Brian Wursten, that they’d vote to fire Chesley if the police union could deliver a vote of no confidence. 
Hughes, Fielding, and Wursten did not respond to requests for comment.
In January, Hughes was terminated because he never passed a background check, a psychological exam, or a polygraph examination, according to Chesley, but was rehired three days later by Dickie. 
“Ryan Hughes was terminated, through no fault of his own, due to the City’s discovery of an incomplete background investigation performed by a previous police administration,” Dickie told the Current via text. He says Hughes was rehired “due to the fact the discrepancy was not due to any action or inaction on his part.” 
“They wouldn’t allow me to be involved at all,” says Chesley, adding Hughes “painted a picture that I retaliated against him and placed him on administrative leave and investigated him” because he was vocal in his opposition to Chesley in union meetings.
At the January 14th city council meeting following Hughes’ rehiring, text messages from Hughes’ police department cell phone obtained through a public records request were read during public comment by a detractor, Daniel Miller. 
“Watching this battle between the Dallas little dicks and buff daddies feels like I’m watching two severely Down Syndrome kids see who can lick more windows on the short bus on their way to school,” read one text attributed to Hughes.
“I could not stop envisioning beating the shit out of both of those kids last night. I had to open the Corona app and do some breathing exercises,” says another text. 
In another text, Hughes decries a city law that prohibits drinking alcohol in the park. “The government can’t tell us when and where we can drink. I’ll bring an ice chest.”
In another text, Hughes writes he hasn’t “been very good about logging” his K9 training. “I may or may not be copying and pasting my logs from a different time period and just changing the dates.”
The revelation could prove perilous for the city should Hughes’ arrests involving a K9 be challenged in court, say experts.
Whipple, the mayor, said the text messages and K9 log falsification were investigated internally by Mesquite Police, who deemed Hughes could not lose his job for the offenses under the union contract.
“There were two officers who had an issue with the K9 logs,” Whipple said during a phone interview Monday. “Both were disciplined by loss of pay for that, and Hughes had more” sanctions as a result of the offensive texts.
Just weeks after Hughes’ termination and rapid rehiring, Chesley was summoned to a meeting with Dickie, the city manager, and the mayor. 
Chesley, who says he was at a doctor’s appointment at the time, informed the city that he was unable to go to work, based on his doctor’s order. 
Dickie says Chesley’s failure to attend the meeting amounted to insubordination and terminated him.
“It was just weird,” Dickie said of Chesley’s failure to make the meeting. He declined to say whether it’s city policy to terminate individuals who take leave on doctor’s orders. 
Chesley is suing the city for wrongful termination in both state and federal courts.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mesquite7_SM-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-08 08:04:52.709443

(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images).There is an urgent threat to some of the most valuable properties that the citizens of Missouri share: our history, culture and arts.
On March 31, billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, targeted the National Endowment for the Humanities with the aim of substantially reducing its staff by up to 80%, cutting the agency’s crucial grant programs and rescinding grants that have already been awarded.
This means that projects already in progress, with budgets previously decided and in some cases hires in place, are halting.
Over the last 10 years, Missouri received $19.4 million in grants from the NEH, an independent federal agency supporting the humanities in every state and U.S. jurisdiction. It is tasked by Congress to provide humanities access to all Americans, and Congress has appropriated funds for that purpose.
The recent actions by DOGE imperil the NEH’s ability to perform its essential functions as mandated by Congress and negatively affect all Missourians.
Some of the cuts impact Missouri’s institutions of higher learning, including a matching grant to renovate a part of Ellis Library at the University of Missouri-Columbia to create a safe and appropriate environment for the library’s vulnerable special collections. This grant has been cancelled as of April 3.
Other cuts affect institutions outside higher education that are central to the telling of Missouri’s history, provide access to information and knowledge for all and offer important programs for Missourians that honor their experiences and teach others about them.
At the national level, the NEH funds Dialogues on the Experience of War programs that offer veterans the opportunity to connect over their shared experiences and have helped bridge the divide between Veterans and civilians.
In Missouri, this program is funded through the Missouri Humanities Council, which sponsors numerous programs for veterans, including annual Veterans Writing Workshops providing veterans and their families with an outlet for self-expression through writing workshops that partner veterans with experienced professional authors. Humanities councils and other cultural institutions have now been defunded in all 50 states.
The NEH funded many of the public events and research projects celebrating Missouri’s bicentennial in 2020. NEH funding is essential for celebrating the nation’s upcoming 250th anniversary next year and Missouri’s place in our shared history.
Through NEH initiatives like A More Perfect Union: Exploring America’s Story and Celebrating Its 250 Years of Cultural Heritage, launched in 2019, teams have been collaborating to engage the public in America’s history. The NEH has already awarded more than $85 million to support these efforts in all 50 U.S. states and six jurisdictions that will be impacted by ongoing cuts to the agency.
The NEH reaches communities throughout the United States through humanities institutions such as libraries, museums and historic sites that offer lifelong learning opportunities to people of all ages in their communities, whether through museum exhibitions, lectures, tours, podcasts, documentary films or conversation programs.
NEH funds preservation activities, such as upgrades to storage facilities that are crucial for the preservation of cultural heritage yet rarely funded by others. Across Missouri, NEH funds workshops and programming for educators, students, scholars and genealogists.
Grants from the NEH have been awarded to institutions across the state including the National Blues Museum, The National World War I Museum, The Holocaust Museum & Learning Center of St. Louis, The Missouri Historical Society and the Missouri Botanical Garden.
NEH funding makes publicly available important archival collections, including the papers of our founders and other significant Americans — ranging from John and Abigail Adams to Eleanor Roosevelt, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. — and has been instrumental in the study of one of Missouri’s most famous writers, Mark Twain. It made the Hellen Keller Archive’s 160,000 materials available digitally to the public and accessible to blind, deaf, and deafblind audiences.
NEH-funded digital projects include The American Soldier in World War II and Civil War and Reconstruction Governors of Mississippi, which provide deep insights into the lives of everyday people experiencing extraordinary events. The NEH helps fund prize-winning books, documentary films, and radio shows that connect the public with national and regional histories and culture, such as the documentary The Vietnam War (2017) and radio shows and podcasts such as American Routes and Lost Highways, making insights into language, music and history to anyone with an internet connection or a radio.
Missourians deserve a thriving arts and humanities ecosystem that supports learning for all, including students, senior citizens and veterans. History belongs to everybody, and we want to ensure that Missouri’s history continues to be taught to the public and that other cultural opportunities remain accessible to all Missourians.
What better way to create community than by sharing our history and safeguarding our public libraries.

(Oregon Department of Transportation)Washington state lawmakers on Monday backed a huge increase in the amount of toll revenues they’ll count on to help pay for construction of a replacement bridge on Interstate 5 across the Columbia River. 
The House Transportation Committee amended then approved House Bill 1958, authorizing the sale of $2.5 billion in general obligation bonds. That’s $900 million more than assumed in the original bill. The legislation now goes to the Rules Committee and a likely floor vote in the coming days.
With significant cost increases on major highway and bridge projects in recent years, it made sense to recalibrate to a higher bonding capacity to avoid getting into a pinch, backers said. 
“The idea is that we have to have enough resources for construction. We think we have enough, but we want to make sure,” said Rep. Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, chair of the House Transportation Committee and the bill’s sponsor. 
Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, said, “We need to make sure this project is well-positioned to stay on schedule and get built as soon as possible.”
Project planners have estimated the price tag for replacing the bridge will range from $5 billion to $7.5 billion, with a likely figure of around $6 billion. Permits are anticipated by 2026. Once rolling, construction is expected to last until 2032.
Washington and Oregon have committed about $1 billion each and the states have snagged federal grants totaling $2.1 billion. 
Tolls were counted on to raise at least $1.2 billion of the current projected cost. They’ll be imposed in both directions on the existing bridge as early as spring of 2026.
Because Washington will be administering the tolling program, it is the one that needs to issue the bonds.
Bonds, a long-assumed source of financing for the new span linking Washington and Oregon, would pay for design and construction, as well as future maintenance and operation.
The borrowed money would be repaid with toll proceeds, gas taxes, and vehicle fees. Because the bonds would be backed by “the full faith and credit of the state,” the general fund could be tapped as a last-resort source of repayment.
Rep. John Ley, R-Vancouver, a vocal opponent of tolling, opposed the bill in committee on Monday. He said he’ll propose changes when it reaches the House floor for a vote.
Ley said he’ll offer an amendment to ensure Washington and Oregon share equally in the liability if there are not enough proceeds to repay the bonds. As written, responsibility would fall solely upon Washington, he argued.
More importantly, he said, with a new project cost estimate due out in summer, it’s too soon for this conversation.
“We shouldn’t be talking about bonding tolls until we have a price tag,” he said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/interstate5-bridge-1024x607.jpg,,,2025-04-08 08:04:52.709443

(Vailmont photo from her X account; Weil photo from the Weil congressional campaign)As reports of big fundraising numbers emerged leading into last week’s special congressional elections in Florida, Democratic political consultants from around the state took aim at the young man helping to bring in that bounty — 23-year-old St. Petersburg political strategist Jackson McMillan. 
The criticism was based on the fact that the seats in Florida Congressional District 1 and District 6 were considered unattainable for Democrats — Donald Trump and the then-incumbent Republicans who ran in those districts in November won by more than 30 percentage points.
  Political consultant Jackson McMillan (Photo from Key Lime Strategies website)
“Were these races ever winnable? My answer is absolutely,” McMillan told this reporter on WMNF-88.5 FM on Friday morning. 
“Our polling internally on the Josh Weil campaign matched the White House’s lead pollster that came out just a week before Election Day, so when my polling number that my firm ran matched Tony Fabrizio’s, I was like, I must be doing something right.”
An internal poll conducted by Trump pollster Fabrizio did show Democrat Josh Weil with a lead over Republican Randy Fine in CD 6. Another survey from St. Pete Polls in the week leading up to the election showed Fine up by just four points, 48%-44%.
Fine ended up defeating Weil by 14 points on Election Day. Republican Jimmy Patronis defeated Democrat Gay Valimont in CD 1 by 15 points.
The two Democrats raised more that $20 million in their campaigns, 90% of it from outside of Florida, McMillan says. Some fellow Democratic strategists contend that while McMillan and his firm Key Lime Strategies help raise a lot of awareness about the races, in the end his candidates still lost by double digits.
They question whether it was appropriate to tell Democratic donors that their contributions could help narrow the GOP’s numeric advantage in Congress.
“We had no business telling donors we were going to win those seats. That was a straight-up lie,” said Orlando based Democratic strategist Chris Mitchell with Statecraft Digital said last Friday on WMNF. 
“We’ve now heard the last three days the Florida Democratic Party and others take victory laps on losing by double-digits, and that is not how we build long, systemic infrastructure in the state, and that’s not how we produce long-term outcomes,” Mitchell said.
Campaign finance records from the Weil and Valimont campaigns in mid-March showed that they had paid Key Lime Strategies $4.7 million, more than one third their total spending.
McMillan says that “it costs money to make money,” with much of those funds going to pay for fund-raising ads.
He also noted that the campaigns received nothing from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and not that much from the Democratic National Committee. He appreciates what the Florida Democratic Party was able to contribute, but says “it was a drop in the bucket of the money that we pulled in from around the country, and it costs money to solicit that money. It costs money to text. It costs money to send emails.”
McMillan boasts about his transparency, saying that his fee structure is transparent on his firm’s website. But that transparency only goes so far, as he will not disclose how much profit his firm will ultimately make from working on the Weil and Valimont campaigns.
“It was certainly not millions of dollars,” he said in a phone conversation on Saturday. “I don’t want to give you a figure because it might be incorrect.”
‘I’m done dealing with these a—’
As Florida Democrats’ electoral hopes have deteriorated in recent election cycles, the consulting class has been subject to escalating attacks.
“People like Jackson McMillan are the exact type of consultants who people say are the problem in our party,” said Democratic National Committee Vice Chair David Hogg in a social media posting last month.
“I’m done dealing with these a— and it’s time they start being called out. Everyone says f— the consultants but won’t name names. Jackson is one of many.” [Elisions by the Phoenix.]
Hogg was responding to New York Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s comment that footage taken from a 92-minute Instagram Live presentation she gave on Feb. 3 for an ad boosting Valimont and Weil was being used without her consent. McMillan then took down the ad immediately.
Another incident that has rankled some is the contention that he worked for a candidate for St. Petersburg City Council last year who he knew didn’t live within the city limits. He denies that he knew that.
The candidate, Juan Lopez Estevez, was endorsed by former St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman and former Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn in the open District 3 race. Estevez finished fourth in the Aug. 20 primary election.
“To my knowledge, Juan was living at his mother’s house,” McMillan said over the weekend. “He told me he lived in St. Petersburg. At no point did I ever have any reason to believe that Juan didn’t live on Cherry street. It was only after accusations started flying after the campaign was over that I had any real inclination. I’ve heard the rumors, but I don’t have anything to substantiate that.”
However, the Rev. Andy Oliver, the pastor of the Allendale United Methodist Church in St. Petersburg, said that he spoke with McMillan on Friday as both left the radio station where they had just appeared as guests. Oliver was supporting another candidate in the race, Nick Carey, who he thought might have made the runoff if it hadn’t been for Estevez’s participation.
“I said listen, ‘I am still very angry with you … because you knowingly ran a candidate that did not live in the district,'” Oliver said.
“In that conversation, he admitted to me that he knew that Juan didn’t live in the district. He said, ‘He was there for two months,’ and that to me was even more telling.” The St. Petersburg charter states that a candidate for city council must be a resident of the declared district for at least 12 months as of the date of the primary election.
“At one point, he laughed and said, ‘Of course, he didn’t live there.’ And so Jackson admitted that he knew that Juan did not live in the district. His reasons for doing that are that he had a company to support and Gen Z people on his team that needed to be paid.”
“I’m not sure what the pastor is referring to,” McMillan said when told of Oliver’s recollection of their discussion. “I remember a piece of the conversation discussing the voter registration of Juan’s father who shares a name with him was originally used as ‘proof’ that Juan didn’t live in the district, because Juan’s father is registered in Tampa. I found that deeply comedic, because any amount of investigation would have revealed that it was Juan’s father. Perhaps a remark was misunderstood.”
For his part, Estevez insists the rumor that he didn’t reside in St. Petersburg “is 100% false.”
“If anyone had challenged my eligibility based on my residency, not only would they have been unsuccessful, but they would have been subjected to legal action as well,” he said in a text message.
Praise from the candidates
While he’s taking some licks, both Weil and Valimont are effusive in praising McMillan’s work in the special elections.
“Jackson McMillan took a teacher with no public profile and raised $15M in small dollars — unheard of for a Florida candidate, even for an elected official,” Weil told the Phoenix in email.
“The payments to Key Lime Strategies you see on our FEC report include all the costs of building and managing what would ultimately become one of the largest donor networks in the country, which includes all of the paid comms overhead for messaging via email, text, and social media over 4 months, all of our mailers, and all of our polling.
“We executed a plan built to deliver 90k votes that would be successful up to 40% voter turnout. Nobody outside of our team believed at any point along the way the turnout would even come close to that number, and ultimately it exceeded it. The work he did on this campaign should cement Jackson McMillan as the gold standard for Dem fundraising and political coordination in the state of Florida for years to come. There is nobody else in this state who could have produced anything close to what he did here in District 6 these last four months.”
Valimont also praised McMillan in a statement.
“Our campaign was powered by an average donation of just $32, proving that grassroots support can drive monumental change. For the first time in decades, we established a foundation for Democrats in the Panhandle, building infrastructure that will strengthen traditionally red areas for years to come.

“I want to recognize Jackson McMillan and the staff of Key Lime Strategies for their incredible work, which has laid the groundwork for continued progress in this area. The money invested in this race helped re-enroll thousands of Democrats in vote-by-mail and boosted voter registration efforts that would never have garnered any investment under normal circumstances. This campaign was always about more than just one race — it was about building a movement for lasting change.
“This race demonstrates that strategic investment in deep red districts, centered on fieldwork and direct voter engagement, can create meaningful shifts for Democrats as we head into the pivotal 2026 midterms. Our campaign is dedicated to sustaining this progress by allocating $170K to strengthen Democratic infrastructure in FL-01, ensuring the strides we’ve made continue to flourish. These organizations, including each county’s Democratic Executive Committee and Black Caucus, have championed Panhandle Democrats long before our campaign, stood with us for 20 months, and we’re excited to see the momentum they will build in the future.”
 ‘Jackson was a lifeline’


Among the winning candidates McMillan has worked are Tampa City Council members Lynn Hurtak and Bill Carlson. Hurtak declined to comment, while Carlson did not return a request for comment.

Kelly Johnson, who worked with McMillan on two unsuccessful campaigns for state House in Pinellas County over the past five years, praised his work.
“When I ran in 2020 against the incoming speaker of the House [Chris Sprawls], I was a new person in the political arena and Jackson was a lifeline for the entire campaign,” she said in a text message. “He was able to secure meetings and interviews and lead every single of our campaign meetings. At the time I did have a lot of television coverage and media coverage, which was amazing.”
While political analysts around the country continue to assess whether the margins of the two congressional races will ultimately mean anything in 2026, Mitchell fears that the tactics employed to raise so much campaign cash in districts that were so Republican leaning could hurt the Democrats in the future.
“Imagine if this was in CD-13 in Pinellas County in a special election where we could win that race, right?” he said, referring to the congressional district where Republican Anna Paulina Luna won by 10 points last fall. “They’re not likely to give as much or give next time, so I think that is the bigger thing we need to focus on.”

Photo by Getty Images.In early February, the news that many of us in the electric vehicle space had been bracing for came to pass: the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure grant program was paused. It had promised $5 billion to build a much-needed public, fast charging network. This freeze of federal EV charging infrastructure funds dismayed the auto industry and EV advocates alike. 
Automakers, charging companies and even gas stations have called for restoring the grant program, which would have provided Minnesota with $68 million for public charging stations.  
But amidst the disappointing news is a lesser known reality: this setback barely impacts the practicality of driving electric in Minnesota right now.  
The rising popularity of EVs in Minnesota is hard to deny. Walk or drive around, and you’re likely to spot several different electric models, whether it’s a Rivian pick-up, a Hyundai Ioniq SUV, or the ever-ubiquitous Tesla sedans. EV sales reached roughly 7.6% of all new passenger vehicles in Minnesota in 2024, and there are more than 65,000 EVs on Minnesota’s roads. Many Minnesotans are interested in making the switch to electric.  
Public charging stations, which make operating an EV more accessible and convenient, have been proliferating too. Since 2022, the number of fast-charging ports has more than doubled, while Level 2 charging increased over 60%. 
How is this possible? It’s not just federal dollars at work building out our public charging network. Much of this charging infrastructure growth comes from a mix of sources, including private investments, utilities and government. These funding sources will continue to invest in public charging in Minnesota. So while the loss of federal funding is a blow, it’s far from a death knell for EV charging. 
That’s also because juicing up an EV is much different than gassing up an internal combustion engine. 
Instead of driving to the gas station to fill up, most owners plug their EV in at home and let their vehicle charge overnight — just like a cell phone— and start each day with a full “tank.”
Plugging in at home like this is a much better experience than driving to a gas station. This simple reality also transforms the “range anxiety” concern that prospective buyers often have, since much of our charging will be done at home. Couple that with the fact that 97% of driving trips are under 50 miles — while new EVs average over 280 miles of range — and it’s no wonder that more Minnesotans are buying EVs. 
For two-car households, the solution is even simpler: Keep a gas vehicle for occasional long trips while enjoying the quieter, cheaper and lower-maintenance EV for daily driving. 
With over 100 new EV models available, in addition to more affordable used options and leasing terms, Minnesotans have now more choices.
We estimate there are over 60,000 home chargers in garages across the state, and there are about 2,300 public charging station ports available.  
While home charging is a cornerstone of easy EV ownership, we do recognize it’s not available for everyone. Renters or those in apartment or condo buildings face real barriers to installing EV charging where they live, making it harder and more expensive to use an EV. But state policymakers, electric utilities, charging infrastructure companies and EV advocates are actively working to solve this challenge through targeted programs. And our growing public charging network will help too. 
The bottom line: Don’t let federal funding headlines discourage you from switching to an EV. 
Minnesota’s charging infrastructure will continue to grow through private investment, utility programs, and state support. The EV transition is charging ahead.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/car-charging-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-08 08:04:52.709443

Senate Bill 5337, sponsored by Sen. Tina Orwall, D-Des Moines, would require the Department of Social and Health Services to create, manage and enforce a certification process for licensed assisted living facilities. 
“This bill is around supporting people as they age and supporting families and giving the Department of Social and Health Services the tools they need for that work,” Orwall said. 
In 2021, an informal study by the state’s Dementia Action Collaborative found there were about 237 assisted living facilities in Washington that advertised memory care or specialized dementia care, but their services varied. 
“Currently there are about 126,000 seniors in Washington with Alzheimer’s disease, which is about 10% of the population 65 and up and that number is growing every day,” said Brad Forbes from the Alzheimer’s Association. 
The lack of standardized care can make it difficult for individuals or families to understand the services and staffing that facilities offer. 
“The challenge exists when the individual gives their trust and significant payments, sometimes $10,000 a month, for what they think is comprehensive care designed for a person experiencing cognitive decline,” said Joanna Grist, a lobbyist for AARP. 
The bill would require these facilities to maintain staff onsite 24 hours a day, to have at least six hours of continuing education for workers per year related to dementia-related behaviors such as aggression, and provide to patients with individual and group activities. 
A memory care facility is defined as one that is devoted specifically to that type of care or that offers a special unit or wing for those with dementia. They help people with housekeeping, meals, snacks, laundry and activities. 
Under the bill, the department would have to maintain a publicly available list of certified assisted living facilities that specialize in memory care or have memory care units. They would also review facilities’ compliance with state law and conduct regular inspections. Facilities that are out of compliance could face civil penalties. 
The Senate passed the bill 49-0 last month, and it’s now moving along in the House. If approved, the bill would require assisted living facilities to be certified by July 1, 2026.

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Criticisms continued to mount Monday even after a sweeping committee amendment rolled back significant portions of a bill that seeks to limit diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in schools and state government.
Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee additionally spoke out after the Republican-dominated panel approved major additions to a separate proposal — weaving in contentious criminal penalties for “street camping” that seemingly died in an earlier bill — without taking public comments beforehand.
Among the original DEI-focused provisions removed from Senate Bill 289 were provisions concerning university diversity committees, as well as an extensive, four-pronged definition of DEI “effort(s)” that included a ban on “differential treatment” or “special benefits” on the basis of “race, sex, color or ethnicity.”

Instead, key language was largely rewritten to more specifically outlaw “discrimination” in state education, public employment and licensing settings that is “based on a personal characteristic of the person.”
Added, too, were revised civil penalties that could be imposed by the Indiana attorney general for violations: $50,000 for a first offense; and $100,000 for a second or subsequent offense.
Committee chairman Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers, said his goal was to “focus the bill a little bit” and “make it a little bit more workable for some of the folks that they’re going to have to abide by it.”
“I think it can be difficult to legislate words and acronyms, and so we really tried to hone in on the actions that we are trying to address,” said Jeter, who offered the amendment.
He said the bill, overall, “is an effort to sort of codify” and “be consistent” with executive orders issued by President Donald Trump and Gov. Mike Braun.
The governor’s order replaced DEI throughout state government policies and programming with “merit, excellence and innovation” (MEI). It also closed the Office of the Chief Equity, Inclusion and Opportunity Officer created by former Gov. Eric Holcomb.
The committee advanced the bill to the House floor in a 7-3 vote, along party lines. The measure must get the OK from the full chamber by April 15, the third-reading deadline.
It previously passed out of the Senate 34-13, with four Republicans unfavorable.
Before Monday’s vote, more than two hours of committee testimony was dominated by medical students and professors from Indiana University (IU) and other Hoosier colleges. Many said they appreciated elements of Monday’s amendment but remained opposed to the underlying bill and its implications.
“Opponents of DEI will have you believe that we are integrating a radical curriculum and training for health care professions that promotes racist and sexist ideas about some burden that falls chiefly on white male students to correct historical injustice. And I understand that’s a concerning possibility, but I’m here today to express that’s simply not true. We actually have a lot to agree on,” said IU medical student Amina Dalal.
“DEI actually protects a merit based system. I don’t believe that we need South Asian physicians like myself because of some diversity quota,” she continued. “I believe that we need diverse physicians because anyone that is qualified and passionate about medicine should have a fair opportunity to become a physician.”
Medical students push back
The latest draft expands certain carveouts, explicitly exempting “employment action(s) concerning participation in a public contract by a minority business enterprise, women’s business enterprise, or veteran business enterprise, if the employment action is authorized by law.”
Colleges and universities can also make decisions around grants, scholarships or fee remissions on the basis of “personal characteristic(s)” as long as those awards do not include any “state funds or resources.”

But state offices and universities would not be allowed to require employees to complete training — or licensing — “asserting that, or endorsing the theory that,” a person with a certain personal characteristic:

is inherently superior or inferior to a person with a different personal characteristic; 
should be blamed for actions committed in the past; 
or has a moral character that is determined by a personal characteristic of the person. 

Jeter said fines for violations “are significantly larger than we normally see in bills that we do — and that was by design.”
“We are not, in this bill, telling any school or anybody else that they have to close any offices or reorder the way that they’re doing things as far as what type of personnel they have doing what,” Jeter said. “We wanted to make sure that if some of these offices continued … there is a significant financial disincentive for them to try to do this in another way, or through another office, or through another program.”
While bill author Republican Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville, conceded that issues stemming from DEI “have not been rampant at the state level,” Byrne said his constituents “want to make sure that everyone is treated equally — they don’t want Indiana government to engage in discrimination, whatever the intentions may be.”
He pointed to prior Senate committee testimony from IU medical students about “problems they’ve seen in the university.”










I believe that we need diverse physicians because anyone that is qualified and passionate about medicine should have a fair opportunity to become a physician.


– Indiana University medical student Amina Dalal


Dr. Cindy Basinski, an adjunct OB-GYN clinical professor, contended that many medical students oppose DEI policies and instruction but are afraid to voice their opinions publicly.
“They’re forced to use pronouns. … There are also students who are not allowed to speak against minor-informed care. They’re also not allowed to speak against other politically divisive issues, like maybe there are some students who think there are only female and male as genders,” Basinski told the committee. “These are important topics that are important to discuss scientifically among students. And if students do not feel empowered by administrators or other students to speak up, then we are not going to have the most robust educational system that we can have in Indiana.”
Nearly a dozen medical students said they disagreed, however, and argued that Basinski’s testimony, in particular, was inaccurate. 
“Everybody at my school is allowed to express their opinions about different aspects of medical care. IUSM encourages students to actively discuss medicine with their peers. There are clubs of students who support the pro-life movement, various religious movements, and even Republican ideals,” said Laney Cordell, a fourth-year IU medical student. “Many, if not most, of the positions claimed about my school are completely unfounded.”
Homelessness amendment adopted — but no public comments
Also headed to the House floor is Senate Bill 197, originally a measure to address building safety laws.
But multiple GOP amendments reshaped the bill entirely, including revived language from House Bill 1662, which sought to tackle homelessness before dying mid-session in the House.
Tweaked provisions from that legislation were added to the Senate bill, stipulating that “a person may not camp, sleep, or use for long term shelter a public right-of-way or public land unless authorized for that use by the state or political subdivision, as appropriate.”
Those who have not moved from a public right-of-way within 24 hours of a law enforcement officer’s warning — or from public land within 72 hours — could be arrested and charged with a Class C misdemeanor. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 60 days in jail or a $500 fine.
Homeless advocates oppose Indiana bill to criminalize sidewalk camping

Before an arrest can be made, though, new bill language would require officers to first determine “if there are reasonable grounds for an emergency detention of the person.” Transportation would must offered to a shelter, mental health service or other housing facility within five miles, as long as one exists and has space available. “Crisis intervention teams” could be called to assist officers, too.
If an arrest is made, legal proceedings would be referred to a problem solving court “to make sure that these individuals are getting the necessary services to get them housing and treatment — and trying to be as humane as possible to make sure that they are getting the care that they deserve,” Jeter said.
Even so. Rep. Victoria Garcia Wilburn, D-Fishers, questioned the “germaneness of this bill and the time in which it dropped.”
“I just haven’t had enough time to digest it and even to put my hands around it,” she said before voting against the amendment.
Rep. Maureen Bauer, D-South Bend, took issue with the lack of public engagement on that change and others.
“I think some people would have liked to have testified on this,” Bauer said. “The amendment was added on a short notice, without stakeholders being able to provide input. I’m kind of disappointed that we won’t have the opportunity for public testimony on this.”
The House-version of the bill mirrored model legislation from the Cicero Institute, a Texas-based think tank which has lobbied in roughly a dozen states for homelessness policies that shift money away from housing initiatives and instead direct dollars toward substance abuse and mental health treatment.
Nearly all who testified spoke out against the earlier proposal, with advocates arguing that it “wrongly criminalizes homelessness.”

DonahueThe Montana Board of Regents announced Monday that Brock Tessman, former deputy commissioner in Montana and current president of Northern Michigan University, will serve as the next president of Montana State University in Bozeman.
Tessman has verbally accepted an offer and will take the reins on July 1, 2025, pending final negotiations and Board of Regents approval at its May meeting, according to a news release from the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education.
Clayton Christian, Commissioner of Higher Education and chairperson of the Presidential Search Advisory Committee, said the committee saw “intense interest” in the position.
“I’m confident the process has yielded an outstanding, visionary leader in Dr. Tessman,” Christian said in a statement. “We believe Dr. Tessman is exceptionally well positioned to guide MSU to new heights.”

MSU is the largest university in Montana, with enrollment that topped 17,000 in fall 2024, a record. It also saw a record $257 million in research expenditures in 2024.
Tessman, who visited the campus last month along with one other finalist, will serve as MSU’s 13th president if confirmed.
He’ll lead the flagship in a time of significant challenge for higher education, with cultural pressure from the Trump administration. MSU faces its own difficulties, with previous opened investigations by the federal Office for Civil Rights for numerous discrimination allegations.
Details of the offer to Tessman were not immediately available Monday morning.
Current MSU President Waded Cruzado is a top paid public official in Montana, with an estimated $576,300 in salary and other compensation as of last August.
The search for a new president started in August 2024 when Cruzado announced her plans to retire after 15 years. A news release from the Commissioner’s Office said “her administration has left an indelible mark on the university and the MSU community.”
However, Regent Dean Folkvord and member of the Search Advisory Committee said he knew the charge was not to replace Cruzado but to identify a successor who would lead with passion and dedication.
“I think we succeeded, and I look forward to working with Dr. Tessman as he takes the reins,” Folkvord said in a statement.
The news release said Tessman’s accomplishments at Northern Michigan include steady enrollment growth at both undergraduate and graduate levels, record retention rates (78%), financial stability with top-tier bond ratings, unprecedented levels of private giving, and the completion of major capital projects.
“Dr. Tessman’s stewardship has fostered positive momentum across all aspects of university operations,” the news release said.
Tessman previously served as deputy commissioner for academic affairs in the Montana University System and dean of the Davidson Honors College at the University of Montana. He earned his bachelor’s degree in international relations from Brown University and both his master’s and doctoral degrees in political science from the University of Colorado at Boulder.
The news release said Tessman is known for his energy, dedication to students, strong communication skills, and ability to deliver results — “qualities that make him uniquely suited to lead MSU into its next chapter.”
“Montana State University holds a special place in my heart given my previous work within the Montana University System,” Tessman said in a statement. “I am honored by this opportunity to serve as MSU’s next president and look forward to building on its incredible legacy.”

George Hruza speaks, a Republican from Huntleigh, speaks during House debate (Tim Bommel/House Communications).The Missouri House gave initial approval Monday to a bill that seeks to prevent antisemitism in public schools and colleges, with some raising concerns it could punish those who speak out against Israel.
The bill would require the state’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and Department of Higher Education to assign a staff member to monitor “antisemetic discrimination and harassment” and investigate whether schools have responsibility for incidents. It also encourages schools to teach pieces of Jewish-American heritage.
State Rep. George Hruza, a Republican from Huntleigh, said the bill was inspired by his mother, a Holocaust survivor who had frequent nightmares about her time in a concentration camp.
“It was not until we arrived in the United States that the nightmares went away and she started speaking about her experience and embraced her Jewish heritage,” Hruza said. “She felt safe in the United States. On Oct. 7, 2023, that all changed.”
That day, Hamas attacked Israel and started the ongoing war between Israel and Palestinian militant groups. The conflict spurred the highest number of antisemetic incidents in a year recorded by the Anti-Defamation League.
Hruza hopes the legislation can cut back on these incidents, citing a recent case in Affton where a man spray-painted Nazi and white supremecist graffiti on school buildings.
Dissent for the bill stems from the use of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s working definition of antisemitism. The definition has been adopted by a majority of U.S. states and included in orders at the federal level — though the lead drafter of the definition has spoken against its application “as a tool to target or chill speech on a college campus.”
Alongside the IHRA definition are examples of antisemitism, which the bill adopts. The list includes “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor” and applying double standards to Israel as discriminatory. Both Hruza’s bill and the IHRA say criticism of Israel is okay when it is “similar to criticism toward any other country.”
When a House committee debated the bill earlier this year, some argued the legislation was an “attempt to silence criticism of Israel on college campuses.”
State Rep. Stephanie Hein, a Springfield Democrat, voted “present” in committee on the bill and struggled to weigh the good pieces against controversial elements.
“There is a lot of emotion behind this subject…  and there are a lot of good things in this bill,” she said Monday. “The area of contention is the definition that is used.”
State Rep. Wick Thomas, a Kansas City Democrat, asked Hruza if the bill “might also be about ending critiques of Israel and the Palestinian conflict.”
“The bill is intended to keep the Jewish students safe on campus. It really is not taking sides or some kind of position on the conflict in the Middle East,” Hruza said.
Although the bulk of the bill’s pushback came from Democrats, positions were not clearly split by party lines.
State Rep. Ian Mackey, a Democrat from St. Louis, said he didn’t think the legislation would impede free-speech rights.
“The First Amendment has always confined speech to a reasonable time, place and manner,” he said. “You do not have the right to do that on a college campus in front of students who are simply trying to get to class.”
Republican Rep. Darin Chappell, of Rogersville, told Hruza he had concerns.
He has argued in the past against recognizing minority groups in state law, Chappell said, “to be lionized and set above on a pedestal.”
He can’t set those convictions aside, Chappell said, simply because  “it is one of my colleagues on this side of the aisle that is presenting (this bill).”
The House approved the bill with an amendment from Democratic state Rep. Raychel Proudie of Ferguson that bans schools from discriminating against textured hair and protective styles, like locks and braids. The legislation is often dubbed the CROWN Act and has been proposed by Missouri lawmakers since 2020.
The House must vote on the legislation again before sending it to the Senate.

(Photo courtesy of WEDC)The sweeping tariffs President Donald Trump put in place last week have left key Wisconsin business leaders as well as the state’s important trading partners confused and uncertain, the state’s top economic development official said Monday.
Missy Hughes, CEO of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., spoke to the Wisconsin Examiner from Germany, where she and Gov. Tony Evers are in the midst of a trade mission. Hughes left March 29 and returns to Wisconsin this week.
“The government officials, economic development officials, the businesses that we’ve been talking to are very confused about how we got here after over 75 years worth of partnering and working together,” Hughes said. “The folks here are really wondering what has happened and where this is going.”
Hughes said she’s hearing regularly from Wisconsin businesses that have integrated themselves into the global economy.
“I’ve been in touch with companies that are directly importing things like coffee [for which] there’s really no way to work around the tariffs,” she said. “And so they’re very concerned about just increased costs on their bottom line.”
Other businesses have connected with the supply chains that run between Canada and Mexico through the United States. They are “sending products back and forth across those borders, and are now very confused and concerned about how to make their supply chains work,” Hughes said.
For businesses that have had a good run for the last several years, “[there] is real frustration around instability and unpredictability,” she said. “They were experiencing growth, they were doing well, and now they’re concerned that that might be endangered.”
A ‘man-made crisis’
Hughes contrasted the crisis brought on by the tariffs and the responses to them with the COVID-19 pandemic’s disruption to the economy five years ago.
“This is a man-made crisis,” whereas the pandemic was “a crisis that was not man-made,” she said.
“For the average Wisconsinite the concern I have is the increased cost in their pocketbook,” Hughes said. “There’s going to be increased grocery prices, there might be inflation. It’s going to cost more to replace your dishwasher or your automobile.”
Those present “an impact [that] is difficult to predict,” she said. “This is really going to be an unfolding crisis as we see immediate impacts and then impacts that will evolve, due to changes that are being made on a daily basis.”
In addition to the volatility from the tariffs, Hughes said, there’s also uncertainty from unexpected and sweeping cuts across federal agencies, resulting in disruptions that range from university research programs cut short to social services delayed or ended.
Markets worldwide take another dive as Trump threatens higher tariffs on China

Farmers are losing grants they have been relying on, she said, but also are faced with losing the counsel they’ve relied on at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help them manage regulations.
Leaders of a biohealth company have expressed “their concern that the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] is no longer going to be the premier global agency that people rely on,” Hughes said.
“There’s things that are going to be immediately apparent and things that are going to be apparent as we see real expertise and institutional knowledge from our agencies disappear,” she added.
Maintaining relationships 
The trade mission took the Wisconsin delegation to France as well as Germany. It is aimed at encouraging businesses in Europe to buy Wisconsin exports and talking up the Badger State for companies interested in establishing or expanding their operations here.
A highlight of the visit was kicking off the 50th anniversary of Wisconsin’s sister-state relationship with the German state of Hesse (Hessen). The group also attended the Hannover Messe, a major worldwide advanced manufacturing trade show.
In the face of the startling reversal from longstanding relationships between the U.S. and the world, Hughes said, leaders the state delegation met with welcomed Wisconsin’s continued overtures.
“Obviously, things are still very volatile,” Hughes said. Despite that, she added, “people have been so happy that we are here extending a handshake and reminding everyone that there are opportunities for relationships beyond what’s happening in Washington, D.C.”
Joining the trip were four Wisconsin companies and representatives of New North, a Wisconsin regional economic development and business organization. The Wisconsin participants were looking at opportunities such as distribution deals in Europe for their products, Hughes said.
“They were by and large very happy with their visits and the opportunities to create relationships,” Hughes said.
The other principal aim of the trip was to connect with companies in Europe that have Wisconsin operations or are interested in establishing a presence in the state.
“While those conversations were positive, there was certainly also concern expressed about, what if there’s a slowdown, what if there’s a recession,” Hughes said. A recurring theme in those conversations, she added, was the “need to understand what the economy is doing, and we need things to not be as volatile as they are right now.”
The Wisconsin team is working “to remind folks that Wisconsin’s is a strong economy,” she said. “We have strong businesses that are interested in being and already participating in the global market and want that to continue. So I think, you know, we are a steady hand during this volatile time and I think that’s really beneficial.”
Business confidence at stake
In the face of the current economic turmoil, Hughes said she worries about the toll on business confidence.
“When you lose confidence you start to become risk averse, you hold off on making investments,” she said. That’s important in Wisconsin because of the state’s role making large, expensive machinery.
“We make CAT scans and MRIs and tractors and big industrial machinery,” Hughes said. “People need confidence before they make those purchases. And so if we lose confidence, it’s going to be harder to recover even if the tariffs were taken away next week, or next month.”
Confidence is hard to measure and not always easily predicted, she acknowledged. “My fear is that people will really start to become risk-averse, and that hinders the whole growth of the economy.”
Despite that fear, however, she said she’s found reasons to buoy her spirits in the conversations she’s had over the last two weeks.
“The desire for a relationship, the desire for connections, the long-term historic partnerships that we’ve had are still here,” Hughes said. She professed optimism that those connections can still be nurtured and survive the current gyrations of the stock market or the economy itself.
“I’m very confident that we have such strong ties that those will stand strong during these times,” she said. “But it is difficult.”

(Photo Credit: Sean Rayford/Getty Images)Three weeks after a hostile town hall in Asheville, U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards (NC-11) found himself before a more reserved audience of business owners in which he expressed support for President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
“I do not blindly support the idea of tariffs, but I do support the theory that the president has brought to us,” Rep. Edwards told his audience Friday at UNC-Asheville.
Edwards said the American people elected Trump to a second term knowing his position on imposing tariffs.
“President Trump is the master, he’s an author of the art of the deal. With everything that he does, he considers it a negotiation,” Edwards explained.
Edwards said in order to get bordering countries to do their part to secure the U.S.  border, or foreign countries to do their part to prevent drugs or human trafficking from coming across the border, the president needed leverage.
“And if you don’t have leverage, you create leverage.”
Edwards recounted a recent appearance on a Canadian television station in which he was asked to explain the U.S. position on tariffs.
“I explained to them that this was an opening move…to get Canada to do some things, to help both themselves and the United States, and create a stronger and better world.”
In the hour-long event streamed by WLOS, Edwards told members of the Council of Independent Business Owners (CIBO) that he believes Americans owe it to the president to give tariffs a chance.
“Someone asked me, ‘Well, how long do you give it?’ I can’t set a hard-firm rule. I believe that we need to closely look over the president’s shoulder, listen to the negotiations that are going on, and look at the results of tariffs, and then make up our minds.”
 Anxiety over market volatility 
On Monday, Trump threatened even steeper tariffs on China this week while denying his administration would place a 90 day pause on his tariff plan for further negotiations.
That erased the one positive gain in the stock market Monday, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to close down another 349 points. The Wall Street Journal pegged last week’s U.S. market losses at $6 trillion.
JPMorgan Chase chairman Jamie Dimon and billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman have also warned the Trump’s tariffs could lead to an economic downturn for consumers.
“We are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices,” Dimon said in an annual shareholder letter.
A new survey released Monday by WalletHub finds that nearly half of Americans are concerned that tariffs will make their credit card debt worse.
Still, Edwards said he has had success in getting the White House to provide relief on some textile tariffs.
“And if I need to go back to the president and say, I want you to rethink this, or rethink [that], then I’ll certainly do that.”

(Photo by Lauren Gill/Bolts)This article was originally published in Bolts, a nonprofit newsroom covering the nuts and bolts of power and political change, from the local up.
On a Saturday in March, approximately 60 teenagers sat in a movie theater at CityPlex12 in Newark, New Jersey eating popcorn and drinking fountain sodas. A DJ played songs by Mary J. Blige and André 3000. It wasn’t a typical Saturday at the movies—the teens were there for a youth-led forum with candidates for their school board. Over the next 90 minutes, the young people listened to candidates answer questions about their priorities, how they’d address disparities in resources, and their plans for strengthening the connection between schools and families.
Many of the teenagers were considering those questions for the first time. In 2024, Newark became the third city in the U.S., and first in New Jersey, to allow 16-and-17-year-olds to vote in school board elections. The change was spurred by a student-led campaign aimed at giving young people more power at the polls.
On April 15, eleven candidates are running for three seats on the nine-member board that governs the Newark School District, the first election in which 16- and 17-year-olds who live in the district can cast a ballot. As the election approaches, students are seizing on the opportunity to make their voices heard.
“It feels very good,” Collins Esubonteng, 16, told Bolts. Esubonteng and six other students coordinated the forum with the help of The Gem Project, a Newark organization that promotes youth leadership. “Now, they’re actually gonna have to listen to us and they have to make changes to cater to us or else they won’t get our vote.”
Newark is the largest city in New Jersey and home to the largest school district in the state. Roughly 40,000 students attend its 63 schools, and 90 percent of students are either Black or Hispanic. Under the new rules, approximately 6,500 teens were eligible to register. (Registration applied to all 16- and 17-year-olds in Newark, regardless of the type of school they attend). As of the March 25 deadline, 1,796 young people, or 28 percent, had registered to vote.
Newark’s elected school board members play a large role in influencing education in the city, from overseeing and approving the district’s yearly budget—$1.5 billion in 2024—to making decisions about wide-reaching policies such as curriculum and school lunches. Even with that responsibility, just a small number of adults vote in their elections. Last year’s Newark school board election saw just a three percent voter turnout,and no candidate received more than 3,000 votes.

By lowering the voting age, Newark joins Oakland and Berkeley on the opposite coast in becoming the only U.S. cities in which 16- and 17-year-olds have a say in who sits on their school boards. Two Bay Area cities, plus cities in Vermont and Maryland have also lowered the voting age by allowing kids to vote in local elections.
Countries including Austria and Nicaragua have lowered the national voting age to below 18 for all elections. Research on these countries shows that allowing young people to start voting earlier can increase voter turnout over time. The expansion of youth voting in Newark last year has inspired other New Jersey cities to follow by introducing similar ordinances. It’s also inspired legislation to lower the voting age for school board elections across the state.
“It’s just powerful to see how the students… can vote and actually have an impact on their education and things that they really feel like is pressing—they can actually have a voice,” said Nathaniel Esubonteng, an 18-year-old who helped lead Newark’s campaign.
The push to lower the vote age in Newark began in 2020 when Yenjay Hu and Anjali Krishnamurti, then freshmen and sophomores in high school, grew frustrated with how little say they had in shaping what went on in their schools. Hoping to change that, the pair formed Vote16NJ, the New Jersey branch of the national organization Vote 16 that campaigns to expand voting rights to 16- and 17-year-olds.
The Newark teenagers started with trying to enact sweeping statewide change but faced problems winning support, partly because the idea was new to policy circles. Eventually, Vote16NJ connected with the Institute for Social Justice, a racial and social advocacy organization in Newark that was interested in pursuing the reform. Strengthening their argument, Hu and Krishnamurti discovered that the New Jersey constitution permits local councils to change the voting age.
Krishnamurti says they soon saw other advantages to starting in Newark, the most populous city in New Jersey with the largest school district in the state. The low voter turnout in previous elections showed the necessity for including young people and the city was already home to a large contingent of civically involved students, said Krishnamurti. The pair of teen advocates also recognized that, because of its size, other cities have historically ended up adopting Newark ordinances.
“We hoped it would set a precedent for the entire state,” Hu, now a student at Yale University, told Bolts.
In January 2024, the Newark City Council voted to pass an ordinance lowering the voting age, noting that the move would strengthen democracy in the city.
Krishnamurti, now a student at Harvard University, called the upcoming Newark election “surreal.” “I think this is just the start of what is going to be a really, really long movement of young people advocating for their own rights,” she said.
The election is just the beginning, though, said Krishnamurti and Hu. They say VOTE16NJ started with school boards because city council members wanted to first see how expanded youth voting went in those elections before considering expanding it further. The group now hopes to eventually change the voting age for the rest of local government elections.
Newark organizers, schools, and students have taken the lead on registering the new swath of young voters. City youth-focused organizations have been working with schools to educate students about their newfound power by hosting registration events and forums. Last month, Governor Phil Murphy visited a Newark high school along with rapper A Boogie Wit da Hoodie to encourage students to vote. Students have also been canvassing to register their peers.

Assatta Mann, senior community organizer at the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, told Bolts that organizers faced challenges with making kids aware of their right to vote and getting them up to speed with how to register. Changing the voting age for this election required an overhaul of the New Jersey Division of Elections registration system and the agency wasn’t ready to open the rolls until February 1, leaving only two months for kids to register. “Those are some of the major challenges we’re facing, and that’s just around registration, let alone actually then making sure people get to the polls.”
The reform has also influenced how school board candidates are campaigning. One candidate, Jordy Nivar, told Bolts that he coaches youth baseball and he educated his team about youth voting at practices. All of the eligible students on his team are registered, said Nivar, and showed Bolts a video of them holding up his campaign flyers.
“I didn’t have to push it too much,” said Nivar. “They always figured, listen, if coach is doing this, we got to support him because he always supported us.”
Kanileah Anderson, the only incumbent running for the board, said that she’s made a point to talk in person with students about her platform. She’s seen a change with board meeting attendance, too—the previous week, about 20 students attended a budget meeting. “Parent participation is dismal,” she said. “If somebody’s going to participate, why not the kids, the consumer of the actual product?”
Nakyah Hepdema, a 16-year-old who registered to vote at the forum in March, told Bolts that she wanted the school board to provide more vocational opportunities. “I feel like what’s missing is stuff for careers,” she said.
Hepdema’s friend, Tarayah Shenck, also 16, wants better training for teachers. “Maybe it’s just me but I feel like teachers don’t break down stuff more,” she told Bolts. Newark’s reform follows efforts to lower the voting age in other U.S. cities. Teens in Oakland and Berkeley, California, voted in school board elections for the first time in 2024. Youth turnout was low, with just 600 out of 1,500 registered teens showing up to vote.
In 2013, the Washington D.C. suburb of Takoma Park, Maryland, became the first place in the U.S. to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in mayoral and city council elections as a way to increase voter turnout and youth interest in civic engagement. In subsequent elections, youths voted at higher rates than the rest of the population, according to a study by Generation Citizen, an advocacy group that boosts civics education.
Newark’s success has inspired two more New Jersey cities to lower the voting age to 16 for school board elections. An ordinance in Atlantic City cleared legal review while one in Jersey City is still undergoing evaluation.
Meanwhile, a bill to expand the right to vote throughout New Jersey is pending in the legislature. Governor Murphy, a Democrat, has voiced his support for the legislation. He also wants to provide financial incentives for the change and proposed allocating $1 million to places that lower the voting age for help with IT and voter education as part of his 2026 budget.
As election day approaches in Newark, students are gearing up to vote. Outside of the forum, young people told Bolts that voting had become a big topic of conversation in their friend circles and were optimistic that lowering the voting age will boost voter turnout.
“I really do feel empowered when I can vote,” said Gabrielly Ferreira, 16. “My ideas and what I want for my education are now being put out there. So I honestly do believe that the turnout will be much greater than last year’s. And then I also really hope for other students to recognize that in the coming years.”
Zoe Umchukwu, 17, put it plainly: “The power is actually being given to the people. Now it’s not just other people trying to decide what’s best for us, trying to decide what we need and what we want.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2203-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-08 07:01:54.216673

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)In the moments before the 2025 Idaho legislative session came to a close Friday, Republican legislative leaders called a press conference where they heralded the combined passage of more than $400 million worth of tax cuts this year.
The cuts reduce the income tax rates Idahoans and businesses pay, shift money to a state fund used to to reduce property taxes, shift money to another state fund to pay down public school bond issues and levies that are paid for by property taxes and increase the grocery tax credit that is used to offset $155 worth of sales tax Idahoans pay on food.
House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said the overall downward trend is good for the state.
But at the end of this year a different tax credit that has benefited Idaho families for seven years is set to expire with much less fanfare than the new cuts.

Before Jan. 1, the Idaho Child Tax Credit will expire. Passed by the 2018 Idaho Legislature – and co-sponsored by Moyle – the Idaho Child Tax Credit provides a $205 nonrefundable tax credit for each taxpayer’s child under age 17. 
The Idaho Child Tax Credit law was written so that it would be in effect from Jan. 1, 2018 to before Jan. 1, 2026, and the Idaho Legislature did not extend it before adjourning the 2025 legislative session for the year. 
Although the new 2025 tax cuts are making headlines this week, analysts with the nonpartisan Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy said many Idaho families who don’t own property won’t experience overall tax relief this year because of the expiration of the Idaho Child Tax Credit.
Dominated by a series of tax cuts, Idaho Legislature adjourns 2025 legislative session

When taken into consideration with House Bill 40 and House Bill 231, Idaho families earning between $31,100 and $146,000 annually won’t see any tax benefit, the Idaho Center For Fiscal Policy said in a report on its website. Idaho families making between $55,600 and $91,800 should expect to see an overall tax increase of about $100, the center wrote.
“Idaho lawmakers have made significant cuts to the state’s income tax to provide tax relief to Idahoans this year, but with the expiration of our state Child Tax Credit, most families won’t experience any tax relief,” May Roberts, a policy analyst at the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy, wrote in a statement. 
Roberts said Idaho legislators could have taken action to ensure low and middle class families aren’t left behind by renewing the Idaho Child Tax Credit, incorporating an income cap, and making the credit refundable. 
For Idaho homeowners and property owners, House Bill 304 provides an additional $100 million in state revenue meant to reduce property taxes and pay down school bonds and levies, which was not included in the Idaho Center For Fiscal Policy reports.
  Expiration of Idaho Child Tax Credit shows shifting priorities for Idaho legislators 

The 2018 Idaho Legislature created the Idaho Child Tax Credit through the income tax conformity bill House Bill 463, and then came back and expanded the amount of the credit to $205 per child through House Bill 675 that same year.

The Idaho House of Representatives voted unanimously to pass House Bill 675, which included legislative intent language spelling out the Idaho Legislature’s priorities. The language says that it is the Idaho Legislature’s intent to take an anticipated increase in sales tax revenues collections stemming from a new law collecting Idaho sales tax from out-of-state retailers, and apply toward income tax relief for Idaho families. 
But, now seven years later, the Idaho Legislature’s intent appears to have changed. 
During a press conference Friday, Moyle told the Sun legislators that the expiration of the Idaho Child Tax Credit was brought up this year, but legislators chose to focus on cutting taxes in other areas.
“I think we were more focused on tax relief for everybody with the income (tax) that covered everybody, the property (tax) that covered everybody and the schools and the sales tax,” Moyle said. “So we were more focused on those areas that touched everybody.”
House Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian, agreed with Moyle.
“We knew about it, it was coming up, but we had other priorities,” Monks said. “As the speaker mentioned, we were going to address those big issues that we’ve been hearing from our constituents and from the people of Idaho to address. They want property tax relief and they want tax relief, and that’s what we provided for them.”

Mike Braun will soon consider the vote center study, student ID voting ban and income tax cuts. And towing regulations survived an drawn-out, intra-party fight among House Republicans.","Sen. Mike Gaskill defends the election-related study legislation he is sponsoring on Monday, April 7, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Twenty-eight lines instructing embattled Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales to analyze vote center and municipal election year changes ensnarled the Senate for almost 40 minutes Monday — but, after a 35-13 vote, the bill heads to the Gov. Mike Braun’s desk.
So do measures disallowing student identification cards as proof of identity and cutting income taxes. Across the Statehouse, the House approved towing regulations after months of strife within the Republican supermajority.
“In the amount of time that we spent debating it, I could have read it word-for-word about 20 times. I’m just flabbergasted,” said Sen. Mike Gaskill of the bipartisan pushback to House Bill 1633. Gaskill, R-Pendleton, was the legislation’s sponsor.

It would direct Morales to estimate any cost savings reaped if Indiana were to require that all counties move from traditional precinct-based voting to a vote center model, which allows voters to cast ballots at any location within their county of residence on Election Day. He’d do the same for municipal election changes, comparing the current schedule — odd-numbered years before presidential elections — to even-numbered presidential and midterm years.
Morales would also have to study potential impacts on voter turnout, conduct at least one public meeting in each of the three specified regions and report the results to lawmakers by November. House Bill 1633 goes into effect upon passage.
At the microphone, Democrats and Republicans revealed distrust of Morales. Questionable spending and other missteps have prompted, in recent weeks, greater scrutiny of the state’s chief elections officer’s fiscal management. 
“I’m sorry. I just cannot give Secretary Morales any more after he has demonstrated — about catering meals, a Hungary trip, an India trip, no-bid contracts, hiring family, (spot) bonuses to his staff, a $90,000 car,” said Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis. “I just can’t support giving him any more of this.”
“I’m not opposed to studying elections … (but) I do have a problem with the secretary of state getting on a traveling road show … just like I object to gold whistles and notebooks and lanyards in an election year,” said Sen. Sue Glick, R-LaGrange. “We only have so much money in this state. I think this is a waste of time and money.”

Ford, Glick and others also took issue with the study’s format.
They noted that the Legislature usually studies desired public policy changes through interim study committees. Those bodies feature representation from both parties, both chambers and, sometimes, agencies or industry. 
 IDs, tax measures also cross finish line

The chamber additionally concurred with House edits to Senate bills.
Sen. Blake Doriot, R-Goshen, reported two sets of changes to his Senate Bill 10. The legislation would no longer allow students at Indiana’s public colleges and universities to use their institutional IDs as proof of identity at the polls.
One Republican-authored amendment altered voter list maintenance and data-sharing language — requiring county voter registration offices to perform voter list maintenance within just 48 hours of receiving certain information — while a Democratic one added consular reports of births abroad to a list of documents proving U.S. citizenship.
Democrats maintained strong opposition to the measure, which goes to the governor on a 39-9 vote.
“We are told that this bill is about election integrity, but let’s ask ourselves the hard question: where is the fraud? … Where is the abuse of student IDs in our elections?” Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, asked. 
Legislation paring down Indiana’s individual income tax also made the cut, on a 48-0 vote.
Senate Bill 451 would drop the rate by 0.05% beginning in 2030, if state general fund revenue collections exceed 3.5% growth in each of the four preceding fiscal years. The next year’s revenue forecast also must be at least 3.5%. The House bumped the baseline requirement up.
The reductions would continue in every even-numbered year through 2040.
Current law is already phasing Indiana’s flat income tax rate down from 3.05% in 2024 to: 3.0% in 2025, 2.95% in 2026, and 2.9% in 2027 and years thereafter.
Each 0.05 percentage point reduction of tax rate would result in a decline of income tax revenues between $150 million to $200 million annually, according to a fiscal analysis for the legislation.
 Towing, marijuana advertising clear House at least

After months of wrangling fellow Republicans, House lawmakers approved an overhauled utility trailer sales bill that now addresses “predatory” towing practices — and seeks to ban advertising of marijuana and other drugs. It advances back to the Senate for that chamber’s consent to the changes.

There was no discussion before the 75-13 tally on Senate Bill 73, but nearly all of the “no” votes came from members of the majority caucus: Reps. Beau Baird, R-Greencastle; Martin Carbaugh, R-Fort Wayne; Lori Goss-Reaves, R-Marion; Craig Haggard, R-Mooresville; Andrew Ireland, R-Indianapolis; Chris Jeter, R-Fishers; Chris Judy, R-Fort Wayne; Ethan Manning, R-Logansport; Bob Morris, R-Fort Wayne; Zach Payne R-Charlestown; Kyle Pierce, R-Anderson; and Jake Teshka, R-North Liberty. 
Rep. Kyle Miller, of Fort Wayne, was the only Democrat in opposition.
Under Rep. Jim Pressel’s watchful eye, a Senate committee last month inserted an outdoor marijuana advertising ban and towing provisions into an Indiana Department of Motor Vehicles agency bill. They came out last week, when Senate Appropriations Committee chair Sen. Ryan Mishler dubbed them non-germane. But Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, had already taken over Senate Bill 73 for the expanded advertising ban and towing changes.
Towing regulations previously tripped up House Republicans for more than two weeks during the first half of the legislative session, before meeting a deadline-induced death. Another take on the regulations died even earlier, in committee.

Merv Riepe, the Ralston lawmaker at the nexus of controversy the past three years since returning to the Nebraska Legislature, isn’t afraid to go against his Republican colleagues.
Riepe returned to the Legislature in January 2023 after losing a reelection bid to his predecessor in 2018. While his first term was more in line with the then-Nebraska Republican Party — which he notes was different, too — his return has positioned him differently, as more of an independent thinker and pivotal vote on many proposals, earning him the short-lived title of “Hot Merv Summer.”
From new abortion restrictions, Medicaid expansion and gender-related care to sports and bathrooms for transgender students, winner-take-all and criminal justice for teen offenders, the 82-year-old Riepe found a spotlight he says he never intended to seek.

“Hell no,” he says when asked whether he sought to often be the key “33rd vote” — the threshold to cut off debate on contentious measures. But he’s not bashful in doing so.
“If I’m the 33rd vote to kill something, then I say, ‘OK.’ If I feel strongly about it, I will do that, regardless of what the consequences are,” Riepe told the Nebraska Examiner during a two-hour interview in his office last month.
“The only rule I’ve ever had is anyone can say anything about me, just don’t say anything about my mom,” he continued. “I don’t want to be on the bench. I want to be in the game.”
Winner-take-all: ‘Today is a new day’
Nearly two years from when he killed a near-total abortion ban, and more than a year since he withheld a vote a sponsor needed to advance the “Sports and Spaces Act” to restrict K-12 bathrooms and sports to students’ sex at birth, Riepe’s more independent flame could burn bright again this week.
Tuesday marks a four-hour debate on Legislative Bill 3, which seeks to return Nebraska to “winner-take-all” for its five Electoral College votes. Currently, just Nebraska and Maine split two presidential votes for the statewide winner and one presidential vote for the winner of each congressional district. Nebraska has split its votes three times — 2008, 2020 and 2024.

Vice President Kamala Harris won Riepe’s Ralston and Omaha district in November by 2.3% over President Donald Trump. She also won the “blue dot” in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. Riepe is the only Republican in the Legislature representing a Harris-won legislative district.
Yet Tuesday won’t be the first time Riepe has voted on winner-take-all. He supported the change all four times it came up for a vote in 2015 and 2016. He also voted for it last year on a procedural attempt by former State Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar to attach the proposal to a different bill.
In an April 2024 floor speech on Slama’s efforts, Riepe said: “A vote for winner-take-all might be the one critical vote to keep Sleepy Joe from the White House.” Riepe is four months older than former President Joe Biden.
Last September, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., went to the Nebraska Governor’s Mansion to give Gov. Jim Pillen backup in the continued push, connecting Riepe and Trump on a brief call. 
Riepe said Trump praised the governor and added: “Senator Riepe, I’ve heard of you.”
“He never heard of me,” Riepe recalled last month with a laugh. “I’m not so vain that I think that he — it was just what you say when you’re schmoozing with someone.”

Riepe that day signed on to support winner-take-all that fall, but Riepe said Pillen “naively” took that signature as indicative of future support, which he called a “bad assumption.” Pillen and his team shared screenshots of Riepe’s past votes and the signature this weekend.
“It’s like an Etch A Sketch, you pull it and it’s gone, and we start over,” Riepe said. “I don’t consider that a flip-flop. I consider it a situational decision.”
‘A situational decision’
What was the difference in 2024? Harris and Biden.
Riepe felt strongly that Harris was not “even remotely qualified” and might be a “puppet for some behind-the-scene bureaucratic process.” He said he refused to live with the idea that Nebraska’s “blue dot” could decide the election.
Riepe gave Trump his vote, both in the pledged signature to Pillen and later at the ballot box. He said he wasn’t “head over heels” for Trump. But he was firmly against Harris.
“To keep her from coming in there if it meant my vote, I would throw myself on the fire to do that,” Riepe said.

Riepe said he feels that people in his district want to keep the district model. Civic Nebraska hosted a “community conversation” Monday night urging Nebraskans to share support for the current electoral method. Riepe said he had planned to attend that event in his district.
Maine leaders have vowed to follow Nebraska if winner-take-all is enacted, Riepe noted, which he argued would be a “sum-zero game.”
“So what have we done? We’ve just stirred the beehive for no honey,” Riepe said.
Defining ‘moderate’
Riepe described politics as a bell curve where most people fall in the center. He said he doesn’t “subscribe” to what he often considers “extreme positions” of the NEGOP platform.
State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, a farmer in his seventh year at the statehouse, said Riepe brings perspectives that he leans on. He calls Riepe a “fun guy” with a “thick hide.”
“He makes up his mind and he sticks with it, I really admire that about him,” Brandt said. “It would take some very solid logic to get him off of his position.”
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, who was elected alongside Riepe in 2022, described Riepe as a “fiscal hawk” and said that “for being the oldest senator, he has the strongest backbone.”
Riepe described his political position as “center, slightly right.” He has often said he’s a “compassionate conservative.” He considers himself moderate but isn’t a typical swing vote.

Brandt and others have similarly fallen into the “moderate” category, but he rejected the label.
“I see us as the Republicans,” Brandt said. “Maybe the other ones are out of step, and maybe we’re in step.”
Riepe has supported reducing unemployment benefits from 26 weeks to 16 weeks, and he’s advancing a criminal justice package backed by Pillen this year to lower the age at which juveniles can be detained or charged as adults.
He also helped with property tax negotiations in the summer of 2024 but criticized the fast-paced and ever-changing process as a “jump-and-the-net-will-appear” philosophy.
The health-focused ‘wildcat’
Riepe, a farm kid who joined the U.S. Navy hospital corpsmen at the age of 17 in 1960 and served until just before his 21st birthday, came back and worked his way through school. He said he always intended to be a hospital administrator, as he did until his retirement in 2008. He held top roles at Bergen Mercy Medical Center and what is now Children’s Nebraska.

Health care has dominated Riepe’s focus in the Legislature, such as:

Expanding options for direct primary care.


Adding blood testing options for pregnant women to fight syphilis.


Funding respite facilities for eligible homeless adults in Lincoln and Omaha.


Allowing emergency medical services to care for and transport injured Nebraska K-9s.

Riepe also takes a narrow view on expanding Medicaid, opposing an in-progress bill to cap the costs of epinephrine injectors for severe allergic reactions while having previously brought a measure to expand Medicaid coverage to include obesity for potential cost savings. He also opposed a 2023 bill to repeal the state’s helmet law for motorcyclists, citing potential Medicaid costs.
Partnering with Hughes, Riepe has defended a currently stalled partnership with Iowa for a prescription drug donation program, potentially for Medicaid savings. Riepe also predated Hughes in seeking to combat youth tobacco use and vaping.

State Sen. John Fredrickson, a progressive who like Riepe represents a more purple district in Omaha, described Riepe as a “wildcat” because it can be hard to know where he might land on certain topics. To some that might be “wishy-washy,” Fredrickson said, yet Riepe is the “exact opposite.”
“I think he’s someone who is curious. We joke that he’s Curious George, and he’s someone who I hope, when I’m Merv’s age, that I am still wanting to learn as much as he is,” said Fredrickson, who is 38.
Fredrickson, vice chair of the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, said he’s a better lawmaker because of Riepe and that the two help one another, especially on an all-male committee for the first time since 2004. 
Riepe chaired the HHS Committee in 2017 and 2018 and lost a bid to return on a 28-21 vote this January.
‘The straw that broke the camel’s back’
Riepe’s fascination with health also got him reading more about abortion in 2023, leading to his “change of heart” from LB 626, which sought to ban nearly all abortions after an ultrasound detected embryonic cardiac activity. He viewed that as a “total abortion ban” before most women know they’re pregnant.
He signaled his opposition early and pushed for a 12-week cutoff. He has said that if his 2022 election had gone just a few more weeks, citing headwinds after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, he might have lost.
During the second-round debate on LB 626 in April 2023, Riepe tried to force a vote on his 12-week amendment. Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly, instead of putting the motion to an immediate vote as he typically does, ruled there hadn’t been “full and fair debate.”
“I tell you what, I was mad,” Riepe said.
Reflecting on the vote last month, Riepe paused and walked over to grab a coffee mug from his office. It bore the German flag and read: “Never underestimate the power of a stubborn German.”

Riepe said his independent streak had started before that LB 626 debate, but the maneuvering around his amendment “was the straw that broke the camel’s back.”
“It made me so angry that they had maneuvered to not even give me a shot,” Riepe said. “They were that determined to not only kill my bill but in essence shut me up, and that really, that may have been the trigger that made me say, ‘Fine, you want to smack me, I’ll smack you back.’”
When the allotted four hours passed on former Thurston State Sen. Joni Albrecht’s LB 626, Riepe withheld his vote, and so entered “Hot Merv Summer,” a term used by abortion-rights advocates, including on T-shirts, praising Riepe for torpedoing the stricter measure. Riepe said he got one of the shirts and wore it once, to the end-of-session legislative party in 2023.
‘Hot Merv Summer’
Riepe’s non-vote and opposition to LB 626 earned him a censure from the NEGOP, a local billboard from Students for Life Action calling for his resignation, the loss of his Nebraska Right to Life endorsement and an open letter in the McCook Gazette from a southwestern Nebraska county party chair blasting Riepe for an “11th-hour bargain with the Devil.”
“Senator Riepe, you shall be remembered as a shadow of a man, who prized political expediency over integrity,” Bruce Desautels, then-chair of the Hitchcock County Republican Party, wrote in May 2023. “As went the legacy of Judas Iscariot and General Benedict Arnold, yours shall ever be synonymous with dishonor and betrayal.”
Riepe said he didn’t feel threatened after that vote but did have people show up at his house and church. Pillen, who supported LB 626, offered security if it became a problem, Riepe said.

One of the people that Riepe earned praise from was his son, who told his father: “It’s one of my proudest moments to be your son, that you had the guts to take that kind of a vote.”
With a laugh, Riepe said he replied: “Well, that’s good. So I can expect something nice for Father’s Day?”
Riepe said he wears the censure as a “badge of courage” that helps in his purple district, and he joked that at least the southwest Omaha billboard featured a nice picture of him.
“Being a stubborn German, give me an ultimatum, I’m just stubborn enough I’m likely to go the opposite way,” Riepe said.
Behind the scenes, Riepe continued working with conservatives to find a path forward for abortion restrictions, which became the current law: 12 weeks tied to gestational age. The abortion language was added to LB 574, which on its own prohibited gender transition surgeries for minors and restricted youths with gender dysphoria from accessing certain medications.
Riepe said his support for LB 574, beyond abortion, had come after meeting a family who said their two-year-old child was transgender, which he said left him speechless. He said he was concerned that age was too early to know.
The new amendment was filed May 8, ending “Hot Merv Summer” just 11 days later.
‘A great deal of growth’
Abortion and gender care restrictions were combined on May 16, 2023, in what State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha described as one of the worst days of her life. She warned Riepe against supporting the measures and said women and children would die.

She told supporters: “You will have buckets and buckets of blood on your hands.”
Cavanaugh said it was heartbreaking and “really, really, really difficult to move past,” yet Riepe reflected and said he regretted not pushing harder to include fatal fetal anomalies as an exception and not fighting to explicitly repeal criminal penalties against doctors for abortions.
Riepe tried to do so in 2024 but had few political allies to help move the measure forward.
“Obviously, I’m still upset. We can’t go back and undo it. But there is something in acknowledging our mistakes and trying to do better moving forward,” Cavanaugh said. “While it was a horrible moment, I think it also resulted in a great deal of growth for him.”
LB 574 passed May 19, cementing a summer of, as Riepe offered: “He’s not as hot as we thought.”.
Cavanaugh and Riepe both served on the HHS Committee in 2023, where the two had a relationship akin to Statler and Waldorf, two grouchy older Muppets often seen from the balcony of a theater, Cavanaugh said. It was a relationship similar to Fredrickson and Riepe now, rooted, they said, in good policy.
“He’s one of the rare animals in here who you can still actually engage in thoughtful policy discussion with and who will come to the table and have those conversations,” Fredrickson said.
‘Right to vote his conscience’
Legislation impacting transgender Nebraskans would again be debated in 2024, with Riepe placing himself at the center of that debate, too — LB 575, or the “Sports and Spaces Act” from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area.

While LB 574 and LB 626 were fought publicly, Riepe had privately raised caution in a March 2023 memo to Kauth, suggesting that they leave the fight up to the State Board of Education while quoting a Chinese general that “The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.”
The issue would wait until April 2024, after Riepe had spent months meeting with families and continuing to read. He remarked during the debate that trans students and families were seeking accommodations, not attention.
He asked how to know a child’s chromosomes by looking at them: “Are they like shirt sizes? Are they an ‘X’ and a double ‘X’ or triple ‘X,’ and what are they?”
Riepe and Brandt were the two Republican senators to be “present, not voting” on the bill, ending its chances for the year. Riepe maintains his “leaning” opposition to the latest version of Kauth’s bill, the “Stand With Women Act,” LB 89. It could come up for debate at any time.

Riepe has said he holds that position partly because of executive action by Trump forcing schools to restrict sports to students’ sex at birth or risk federal funding. Riepe said he wants a national solution, not a state-by-state patchwork.
Kauth, who succeeded Riepe as chair of the Business and Labor Committee, said she respects Riepe and “his right to vote his conscience, whether it’s the same worldview as mine or not.”
“We have more in common than we do apart and have worked together on important issues and will do so in the future,” she said in a text.
Riepe’s future
Riepe knows he is the oldest member of the Nebraska Legislature. But he walks in parades and goes door to door in part to prove he has the stamina, he says, and that he can still put two sentences together.
“I’m not some babbling old fool,” Riepe said. “I’m just an old fool.”

Whether Riepe runs for reelection in 2026 is still up in the air, largely depending on his health and whether his wife is agreeable, he says smiling. He feels good where he is at and has communicated to others, including the governor’s office, that they’re in a “tough spot” should they try to primary him.
“You can’t run someone to the right of me, really, and ever get elected,” Riepe said. “And you’re not going to run somebody on the left.”
Should Riepe run and win reelection, he would be 88 by the time he is term-limited at the end of 2030. But should he lose, or decide against running, he won’t “go home and cry.”
Instead, he said he’ll try to figure out which hardware store he can go to and “sort nuts and bolts.”
Asked how he wants to be remembered, Riepe said:
“He was a decent guy who appreciated some humor and, hopefully, was a reasonable individual who was a good parent, a good husband and things that are above and more important than the Legislature. I don’t want them at my funeral saying, ‘I know ol’ Riepe would have wished he would have spent another session stuck on the floor during some filibuster.’”

The deadline for applications is coming up on May 2 to apply for Sage Grouse Action Team grant funds from the Idaho Governor’s Office of Species Conservation. Funds for successful applications will be available by July 1, 2025. 
A number of Idaho soil and water conservation districts have applied for Sage Grouse Action Team grant funds in the past, including the Butte, Wood River and Bruneau districts, leading to successful conservation projects. 
Funding for individual grant projects ranges from $2,000 to $218,000 per year, said Josh Uriarte, project manager for the Office of Species Conservation. The agency receives $750,000 in general funds for work on sage grouse that includes restoration, wildfire rehabilitation, surveys, fire equipment and employee time each year, he said. 
About $550,000 to $600,000 is available for projects this year, Uriarte said. Fifteen projects were funded last year. 
“There is a lot of potential overlap between district goals, landowners’ objectives to improve or protect their range and livestock grazing, and balanced sage grouse habitat management,” said George Hitz, Soil and Water Conservation deputy director. 
“Idaho’s conservation districts take a lead role in helping landowners make timely effective land management decisions,” he said. “For conservation districts containing sage grouse management areas, I think this could be an excellent Idaho-sourced funding opportunity for conservation to support a diverse rangeland ecosystem and to help ranching thrive. I encourage districts to look into it along with any potential participants or partners and see if the opportunity fits.”
The types of projects that have been funded in the past include wet meadow habitat projects, re-seeding projects to restore the range post-fire or to eliminate invasive grasses, slash treatment projects in areas where juniper trees are being removed to enhance sage grouse habitat, fuel breaks projects and more. 
 Background from the Idaho Governor’s Office of Species Conservation website

 In May 2015, the state agencies charged with implementing the governor’s strategy – including the Office of Species Conservation, Idaho Department of Lands, and the Idaho Department of Fish and Game – established the Sage Grouse Actions Team, along with local federal agency partners including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management and and the National Resources Conservation Service. The Idaho Soil and Water Conservation Commission, Idaho Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Forest Service and The Nature Conservancy also are part of the group.
The team works collaboratively to prioritize and fund actions in accordance with the governor’s strategy. Priorities for funding include helping equip Rangeland Fire Protection Associations to improve fire suppression capabilities, build strategic fuel breaks to slow the spread of wildfire, restore areas that have been degraded by wildfire from encroached juniper trees and annual grasses, restore and improve brood rearing habitat, and enhance the monitoring of sage grouse activity.
In fiscal year 2024, 15 conservation projects were funded by the Sage Grouse Action Team, which on average leveraged $3.57 non-state dollars for every state dollar spent to implement projects, Uriarte said. 
These efforts resulted in more than $2.8 million in collaborative conservation. There were also 10 Rangeland Fire Protection Associations assisted with an offset to their insurance, wildland firefighting tools and protective equipment for over $52,000. Many times, the state general fund dollars are used as match to bring other funding sources to Idaho such as the Cheatgrass Challenge and grants through the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.
Here is a list of the fiscal year 2024 projects that were funded: 

2,538 acres – conifer treatment
3,122 acres – annual grass treatment
1,318 acres of post-fire rehabilitation
62 acres of wet meadow enhancement and 5 miles of stream work
393 acres of fuel breaks

 Conservation District projects 

Hammond Springs – Butte Soil and Water Conservation District – worked with a landowner and Natural Resources Conservation Service to install check dams in the fall of 2018 to trap sediment and help reconnect the creek with its flood plain. In addition, they removed cattle water troughs located in a riparian area, returned springflow to the creek, and moved the water troughs off-site to uplands, and installed a well, solar pump and pipeline to route water to them.  
In 2020, Butte SWCD received funding for a no-till drill and Wood River SWCD got funds for a rangeland drill for seeding projects.
Bruneau SWCD – beaver dam analogs on Hurry Up/Hurry Back creek with Bruneau rancher Chris Black on his private land in Owyhee County. The first BDAs were installed initially by a Utah Conservation Corps crew, who worked on the project in coordination with Utah State University. 
Conservation professionals with OSC, SWC, U.S. FWS, IDFG and NRCS were all interested in exploring the benefits of using beaver dam analogs to improve riparian habitat and store water. They assisted the landowner and Utah crews with project management and implementation.
Beaver dam analogs are woody structures made with local materials such as willow branches attached to vertical posts pounded into a creek-bottom that mimic the natural work of beavers. The beaver dam analogs create pond habitat, spread out the water table, and slow down runoff in the spring. 
They started with 10 beaver dam analogs on Chris Black’s property, and added more over the next several years. 
“They came in and put them in very successfully,” Black said in a story and video produced on the project by Life on the Range, a public education project sponsored by the Idaho Rangeland Resources Commission. “They’re backing water up, they’re creating habitat for spotted frogs, for sage grouse, for beaver.”
“It just benefits a whole host of wildlife species and that’s why Fish and Game is really interested in this,” says Chris Yarbrough, habitat biologist for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. “It’s a low-cost way to get a lot of bang for your conservation buck.”
“These meadows are like a sponge,” Black explains. “They take that water and they hold it, and release it slowly into the system. So we don’t get that big rush in the spring, when the springs are active, they run hard and then just dry up. Then you just have a dry meadow. With water being held back in the system, it releases slowly, and that benefits downstream users, too, so it’s a benefit for everything.”
Black has a healthy sage grouse population that live part of the year on his private ranchland and part of the year on public lands nearby that are benefitting from the project. 
 Invasive Species Rangeland Restoration Projects

Two conservation districts around the state and the Bruneau-Owyhee Sage-grouse Habitat, or BOSH, project have tapped into the Sage Grouse Action Team grant funds to restore native rangeland habitat by spraying invasive grasses with herbicide, which allows native grasses and forbs to “release” and grow back following the treatments.   
In the fall of 2021, Connor White, BOSH project manager, worked with two different private landowners to treat a total of 136 acres of land infested with medusahead wild rye, cheatgrass, ventenata and Japanese brome. Both sites were sprayed with the herbicide Rejuvra. 
The rangeland restoration project was done following the treatment for invasive juniper trees. The BOSH project has been removing juniper to open up historic sage grouse habitat areas. The birds are not able to safely use areas where predators like crows, ravens and birds of prey can perch nearby. Juniper trees also consume much of the available water from an area. Once they are removed, native grasses and forbs will increase in vigor, research shows. 
If invasive grasses are preventing the native vegetation from rebounding, rangeland projects are experimenting with the use of the herbicides Rejuvra and Plateau to allow the natives more space, water and nutrients to grow back, White said.
“We did those initial pilot projects and then in the fall of 2023, we treated 3,000 acres in two fields with similar results,” White said. 
More information about the science of using Rejuvra has been coming forth from the research community, he said. Rejuvra can take several years to show positive results, he said. It can be used in tandem with Plateau, which brings stronger results in the first year, White said.
Once the native grasses and forbs have space to thrive, they will release and grow. “My goodness, we were surprised how well things grew back,” he said. 
The Lemhi SWC and Cassia SWCD tried similar treatments to eliminate annual invasive grasses with similar results.

Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare. 
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state. 
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.
More than 5M could lose Medicaid coverage if feds impose work requirements

States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets. 
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state. 
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.
Idaho governor signs bill to privatize management, add work requirements to Medicaid program

The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.

6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

(Mario Tama | Getty Images)Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare.
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state.
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.
States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets.
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state.
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.
The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas House will consider a proposed amendment to the state’s enjoined social media age verification law after the legislation received Senate approval Monday.
Additionally, the Senate will vote Tuesday on a bill that would create a right for parents to sue social media platforms if their child develops eating disorders, self-harms, commits or attempts suicide, or becomes addicted to the platform’s feeds because of content the child was exposed to.
Sen. Tyler Dees, R-Siloam Springs, and Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, introduced both bills last week.
Senate Bill 611 would amend Act 689 of 2023, the Social Media Safety Act, which was the first of its kind in the nation and required social media platforms to verify the age of new account holders in Arkansas. Those under 18 could only access sites with parental permission.
A federal judge temporarily blocked Act 689 in August 2023, before it went into effect, and permanently blocked the law March 31 for violating the First Amendment and the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution.
The amendments to Act 689 in SB 611 more clearly define social media and apply the definition to more platforms, lower the age of minor users from under 18 to under 16 years old, prohibit social media algorithms from targeting minors, and add a penalty for companies that do not comply.
“There still is reasonable age-verification language, but it puts more emphasis on the social media company to make sure that they are not preying on the youth,” Dees said.
SB 611 passed the Senate with a bipartisan 21 votes. Four senators voted present and seven did not vote. Sens. Ricky Hill, R-Cabot; Jim Dotson, R-Bentonville; and Stephanie Flowers, D-Pine Bluff, voted against the bill.
Arkansas Legislature passes social media age verification bill over privacy, speech concerns

Hill expressed the same concerns he did in 2023 before he voted against Act 689.
“I know I’m not going to change any of y’all’s minds, but I do want you to think about the slippery slope we’re walking on,” Hill said. “…If you want to limit the freedom of speech, go ahead and continue to vote for this.”
Dees said SB 611 would not result in withholding content but instead would “protect our most vulnerable.”
“We’re trying to make sure that the profits of these social media companies don’t come before the protection of our children,” Dees said.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders made the Social Media Safety Act a priority during her first year in office. In January, she called on lawmakers to amend the law and to give parents the right to take legal action against technology companies if their children experience mental health crises, such as suicidal ideation, tied to social media consumption.
No members of the public spoke for or against Senate Bill 612, the private right of action bill, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which passed the bill with no audible dissent Monday.
Under SB 612, a social media platform could be held accountable for “placing content on the feed, screen, account, or other digital medium of the minor that causes the minor to view the content without explicitly searching for that specific content and includes algorithmic promotion of the content based on a previous search or engagement” if viewing the content leads to “significant bodily or cognitive harm.”
Dees told both the committee and the full Senate that technology companies have contacted him asking for the bills to be amended so it would not be applicable to them. He said he is open to amending the bill but does not want to accommodate billion-dollar companies that have “neglected our youth.”
SB 611 and SB 612 both establish a civil penalty of $10,000 per violation. The penalty for violating the Social Media Safety Act was originally $2,500 per violation.
Sens. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, and Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, both asked Dees during the committee meeting how a plaintiff would prove under SB 612 that a social media platform “knowingly” caused intangible harm to a minor.

Whether a platform leads a minor to “develop or sustain an addiction” to it, as SB 612 states, is “a little tougher to prove” than a suicide attempt or an eating disorder “without getting inside someone’s head,” Tucker said.
Dees said SB 612 is “the framework to have that discussion” and creates a process for the courts to decide “if there’s damaging aspects that have taken place as a result of an interaction with Big Tech.”
Dees and Eubanks also sponsored the Bell to Bell, No Cell Act, which Sanders signed in February, that bans personal electronic devices, including cell phones and smart watches, in schools.
In March, a bipartisan majority of House members approved two bills that mimic stalled federal legislation aimed at regulating companies’ online interactions with children. Lead sponsor Rep. Zack Gramlich, R-Fort Smith, told the Advocate he does not expect to proceed with one of them, the Arkansas Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA).
The other bill is House Bill 1717, the Arkansas Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act. Gramlich said he is amending the bill and hopes to present it to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.
HB 1717 would ban technology companies from collecting data from Arkansas minors except under specific circumstances, such as for financial transactions. They would also be barred from retaining that data and disclosing it to third parties that use the information in advertising targeted to children.

SILVERTHORNE, Colo. — When Adolfo Román García-Ramírez walks home in the evening from his shift at a grocery store in this central Colorado mountain town, sometimes he thinks back on his childhood in Nicaragua. Adults, he recollects, would scare the kids with tales of the “Mona Bruja,” or “Monkey Witch.” Step too far into the dark, they told him, and you might just get snatched up by the giant monstrous monkey who lives in the shadows.
Now, when García-Ramírez looks over his shoulder, it’s not monster monkeys he is afraid of. It’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.
“There’s this constant fear that you’ll be walking down the street and a vehicle rolls up,” García-Ramírez, 57, said in Spanish. “They tell you, ‘We’re from ICE; you’re arrested,’ or, ‘Show me your papers.’”

Silverthorne, a commuter town between the ski meccas of Breckenridge and Vail, has been García-Ramírez’s home for the past two years. He works as a cashier at the grocery and shares a two-bedroom apartment with four roommates.
The town of nearly 5,000 has proved a welcome haven for the political exile, who was released from prison in 2023 after Nicaragua’s authoritarian government brokered a deal with the U.S. government to transfer more than 200 political prisoners to the U.S. The exiles were offered temporary residency in the U.S. under a Biden administration humanitarian parole program.
García-Ramírez’s two-year humanitarian parole expired in February, just a few weeks after President Donald Trump issued an executive order to end the program that had permitted temporary legal residency in the U.S. for hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, putting him at risk of deportation. García-Ramírez was stripped of his Nicaraguan citizenship when he came to the U.S. Just over a year ago, he applied for political asylum. He is still waiting for an interview.
“I can’t safely say I’m calm, or I’m OK, right now,” García-Ramírez said. “You feel unsafe, but you also feel incapable of doing anything to make it better.”
Vail and Breckenridge are world famous for their ski slopes, which attract millions of people a year. But life for the tourism labor force that serves Colorado’s mountain resorts is less glamorous. Residents of Colorado’s mountain towns experience high rates of suicide and substance use disorders, fueled in part by seasonal fluctuations in income that can cause stress for many in the local workforce.

The Latino communities who make up significant proportions of year-round populations in Colorado’s mountain towns are particularly vulnerable. A recent poll found more than 4 in 5 Latino respondents in the Western Slope region, home to many of the state’s rural ski resort communities, expressed “extremely or very serious” concern about substance use. That’s significantly higher than in rural eastern Colorado’s Morgan County, which also has a sizable Latino population, and in Denver and Colorado Springs.
Statewide, concerns about mental health have surged among Latinos in recent years, rising from fewer than half calling it an extremely or very serious problem in 2020 to more than three-quarters in 2023. Health care workers, researchers, and community members all say factors such as language differences, cultural stigma, and socioeconomic barriers may exacerbate mental health issues and limit the ability to access care.
“You’re not getting regular medical care. You’re working long hours, which probably means that you can’t take care of your own health,” said Asad Asad, a Stanford University assistant professor of sociology. “All of these factors compound the stresses that we all might experience in daily life.”
Add sky-high costs of living and an inadequate supply of mental health facilities across Colorado’s rural tourist destinations, and the problem becomes acute.
Now, the Trump administration’s threats of immigration raids and imminent deportation of anyone without legal U.S. residency have caused stress levels to soar. In communities around Vail, advocates estimate, a vast majority of Latino residents do not have legal status. Communities near Vail and Breckenridge have not experienced immigration raids, but in neighboring Routt County, home to Steamboat Springs, at least three people with criminal records have been detained by ICE, according to news reports. Social media posts falsely claiming local ICE sightings have further fueled concerns.
Into the shadows
Yirka Díaz Platt, a bilingual social worker in Silverthorne originally from Peru, said a pervasive fear of deportation has caused many Latino workers and residents to retreat into the shadows. People have begun to cancel in-person meetings and avoid applying for government services that require submitting personal data, according to local health workers and advocates. In early February, some locals didn’t show up to work as part of a nationwide “day without immigrants” strike. Employers wonder whether they will lose valuable employees to deportation.
Some immigrants have stopped driving out of fear they will be pulled over by police. Paige Baker-Braxton, director of outpatient behavioral health at the Vail Health system, said she has seen a decline in visits from Spanish-speaking patients over the last few months.
“They’re really trying to keep to themselves. They are not really socializing much. If you go to the grocery stores, you don’t see much of our community out there anymore,” Platt said. “There’s that fear of, ‘No, I’m not trusting anyone right now.’”










If they deport me from here, I’d go directly to Nicaragua ... Honestly, I don’t think I would last even a day.


– Adolfo Román García-Ramírez


Juana Amaya is no stranger to digging in her heels to survive. Amaya immigrated to the Vail area from Honduras in 1983 as a single mother of a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. She has spent more than 40 years working as a house cleaner in luxury condos and homes around Vail, sometimes working up to 16 hours a day. With barely enough time to finish work and care for a family at home, she said, it is often hard for Latinos in her community to admit when the stress has become too much.
“We don’t like to talk about how we’re feeling,” she said in Spanish, “so we don’t realize that we’re dealing with a mental health problem.”
Support groups
The current political climate has only made things worse.
“It’s had a big impact,” she said. “There are people who have small children and wonder what they’ll do if they’re in school and they are taken away somewhere, but the children stay. What do you do?”
Asad has studied the mental health impacts of deportation rhetoric on Latino communities. He co-authored a study, published last year in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, that found escalated deportation rhetoric may cause heightened levels of psychological distress in Latino noncitizens and even in Latino citizens.
Asad found that both groups may experience increased stress levels, and research has borne out the negative consequences of a parent’s lack of documentation on the health and educational attainment of their children.
“The inequalities or the hardships we impose on their parents today are the hardships or inequalities their children inherit tomorrow,” Asad said.
Despite heightened levels of fear and anxiety, Latinos living and working near Vail still find ways to support one another and seek help. Support groups in Summit County, home to Breckenridge and less than an hour’s drive from Vail, have offered mental health workshops for new immigrants and Latina women. Building Hope Summit County and Olivia’s Fund in Eagle County, home to Vail, help those without insurance pay for a set number of therapy sessions.
Vail Health plans to open a regional inpatient psychiatric facility in May, and the Mobile Intercultural Resource Alliance provides wraparound services, including behavioral health resources, directly to communities near Vail.
Back in Silverthorne, García-Ramírez, the Nicaraguan exile, takes things one day at a time.
“If they deport me from here, I’d go directly to Nicaragua,” said García-Ramírez, who said he had received a verbal death threat from authorities in his native country. “Honestly, I don’t think I would last even a day.”
In the meantime, he continues to make the routine trek home from his cashier job, sometimes navigating slick snow and dark streets past 9 p.m. When nightmarish thoughts about his own fate in America surface, García-Ramírez focuses on the ground beneath his feet.
“Come rain, shine, or snow,” he said, “I walk.”

Debate over a bill to deny certain immigrant children the right to an education was disrupted Monday as two Lutheran pastors knelt in front of a House committee room and recited the Lord’s Prayer. Others in the audience soon joined from their seats. 
The bill (HB793/SB836) by Sen. Bo Watson of Hixson and House Majority Leader William Lamberth of Portland — both Republicans — would give public school districts the option of verifying student immigration status, charging tuition of students who cannot prove they are legal residents or barring enrollment entirely.
Legislative hearings about the bill have often drawn large audiences, including clergy who have previously interrupted debate to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and sung “Jesus Loves the Little Children.”

On Monday, as during previous disruptions, Republicans immediately called for a vote as the Christian prayer was recited, then exited the room. The measure passed 8-7. 
A companion bill in the Senate is headed to a floor vote. The two bills differ in one key respect: the Senate version requires schools to check immigration status. In the House version, public school districts have the option of checking status, rather than a legal mandate.
Rep. John Ray Clemmons, a Nashville Democrat, raised his voice and, at times, banged his hand on the dais, speaking out against the measure as a way to “discriminate against innocent children who have no idea whether they are undocumented or not.” 
“I’ve given up trying to compel people with empathy, heart, love, anything like that so I’m going to talk about money,” he said. Clemmons cited data showing the high costs of crime, healthcare, lifetime lowered earning potential and poverty associated with children not finishing high school. 
“All of these things cost the state of Tennessee money. And all are the direct results of kids not finishing high school,” he said. “This makes no sense.”
Lamberth has cited rising cost of English-language learner instruction in Tennessee public schools as one driver of the bill, while critics have noted English language learners include legal immigrants. Lamberth has also made clear that his goal for the legislation is to draw a legal challenge that ultimately lands before the Supreme Court in order to revisit its 1982 decision in Plyler v. Doe, which established the right to public school education for all children, regardless of immigration status.

Lamberth stressed Monday his version of the bill is permissive, giving ultimate authority on whether to check student immigration status, charge tuition or deny enrollment to individual school districts. 
The bill’s language contains no requirement that schools report students without legal status to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but Watson, the bill’s cosponsor, told lawmakers last week that was “something to be considered in the rules and regulations” the state Department of Education would develop should the bill become law.
Rep. Monty Fritts, a Republican from Kingston, praised Lamberth for bringing the bill, saying there is “no greater act of rebellion in these United States than illegally coming across that border.”

“We’re not talking about immigrants. We’re talking about illegals. There’s a big difference,” he said, drawing jeers from some in the audience. 
Fritts’s comments also drew pushback from TIRRC Votes, the political action arm of the Tennessee Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.
“Republicans like Rep. Fritts are scrambling to point their finger at immigrants in order to distract us from the real insurrection happening before our eyes,” said Judith Clerjeune, TIRRC Votes advocacy director. “An unelected billionaire is hijacking Tennesseans’ retirement accounts while a lawless president defies court orders and imposes shortsighted tariffs, raising the prices of everything from eggs to cars to homes.
Monday’s meeting drew about a dozen clergy members and pastors from Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, the United Methodist Church, Church of Christ and other denominations who were among more than 240 faith leaders who signed a letter to lawmakers urging them to vote against the bill.
“We are calling on you to consider the impact of your vote and steward the influence you have to create welcoming communities for the neighbors Christ commands us to love as ourselves,” the letter said.
The bill will next be heard in the House Finance committee next week.

Kennedy Jr.’s firing of public records staffers at federal health agencies undercuts his promise to deliver “radical transparency.” (Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)Public access to government records that document the handling of illnesses, faulty products, and safety lapses at health facilities will slow after mass firings at the federal Department of Health and Human Services swept out staff members responsible for releasing records, according to transparency advocates and health experts.
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s layoffs across health agencies in recent days eliminated workers who handled Freedom of Information Act requests at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cut FOIA staff at the FDA and the National Institutes of Health, said six current and former federal workers KFF Health News agreed not to name because they fear retaliation and are not authorized to speak to the press.
FOIA is a transparency law that guarantees public access to the inner workings of federal agencies by requiring officials to release government documents. The 1966 law is a crucial tool for law firms, advocates, businesses, journalists, and the general public. It has been used to hold officials accountable and uncover harm, corruption, and political meddling in policymaking.
At HHS, FOIA requests are used to obtain a litany of records, including detailed CDC information about large outbreaks of food and waterborne illnesses, and FDA inspection reports of facilities that make food, drugs, medical devices, and dental products.
Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the FOIA cuts would have “an enormous effect on patient safety” and are “antithetical” to Kennedy’s promise to bring “radical transparency” to federal health agencies.
“It is simply not possible to honorably make that claim while decimating the staff,” Lurie said. “Can we rely particularly on this government to be forthcoming about the number of cases in an outbreak? You need FOIA to be able to take the lid off of that.”
HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano declined to respond on the record to questions about the department’s plans for processing FOIA requests from the CDC, FDA, and NIH.
Gunita Singh, staff attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the FOIA layoffs were almost certain to further slow the release of public records, which often took months or years before the cuts.
“What we need to be doing is the opposite of what’s happening now: hiring more staff,” she said.
Many records are disclosed only in response to FOIA requests. For example, during the covid-19 pandemic, FOIA requests forced the FDA to release internal documents showing little evidence to support using hydroxychloroquine to treat covid, even though President Donald Trump heavily promoted the drug.
Scientific researchers have used the law to obtain clinical trial data to assess whether drugs are safe and effective, or to get more details about adverse events associated with drugs and medical devices. Lurie said obtaining more information about adverse events is particularly important in serving as a bulwark against cherry-picking data or manipulating what’s available online to spread disinformation about the safety of vaccines and other products.
All these efforts will be slowed by the purge of FOIA offices, said Michael Morisy, CEO of MuckRock, a nonprofit group that helps journalists and others file public records requests. Scientists will have less to study. Attorneys and advocates will struggle to build cases and fight for causes. Simply, Americans will know less about their government and the industries it regulates and be less able to hold them both to account.
“I think one thing we’ve learned is that if there’s less watchdogging over an issue, that issue gets worse,” Morisy said. “I really do think that we are going to see companies become more lax with food safety, companies become more lax with consumer safety.”
Thousands of pending FOIA requests are likely to be affected.
During fiscal 2024 — from October 2023 through September 2024 — the CDC, FDA, and NIH received more than 15,000 FOIA requests and provided at least some records in response to more than 10,000, according to HHS’ most recent annual FOIA report.
Those requests were submitted by university researchers, state governments, laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, animal rights groups, law firms, and news organizations, including KFF Health News. Records sought by law firms appear related to investigations of illnesses, outbreaks, drugs, medical devices, and products used by countless Americans.
Morisy and Singh said filling requests is more complicated than many realize, often requiring an in-depth understanding of complex agencies. That’s why it’s important to house FOIA staff within each agency rather than consolidate them.
“We are sacking the entire staff and sacking all of that knowledge,” Morisy said. “And I just don’t see how these things continue to function.”

Tennessee’s Senate passed legislation Monday that would force the state’s private-prison operator to lower the inmate population in facilities with high death rates.
Senators voted 30-0 in favor of Senate Bill 1115 sponsored by Republican Sen. Mark Pody of Lebanon, who wants to renew the legislature’s correction oversight board and take action if the private operator, CoreCivic, can’t bring down death rates. 
The bill would require the inmate population at CoreCivic-run prisons to be reduced by 10% if the death rate there is twice as high as the rate at a comparable state-run prison. It also requires the company to resolve problems causing high death rates.
The House version, HB114, backed by Republican Rep. Clark Boyd of Lebanon isn’t expected to be considered until House members approve a budget, likely within two weeks. Pody said he anticipates no problems getting the House version passed.

Lebanon resident Tim Leeper said after Monday’s vote he believes prison privatization has no benefits, except for CoreCivic shareholders. The Senate vote sends a message that lawmakers aren’t satisfied with private prisons, he added.
“It puts us on record and it puts legislators on record, now we have a problem. If we didn’t have a problem, we wouldn’t have legislation that has proceeded up to this point, unanimously,” said Leeper, whose son died of an overdose at Trousdale Turner prison, one of four the company runs in Tennessee.
State Comptroller audits show Trousdale Turner had a 146% employee turnover rate in 2023, making it more difficult to check on prisoners and avert murders and drug overdoses. Trousdale Turner, which is under a civil rights investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, has a correction officer vacancy rate of 33.7%, compared with 26% at state-run prisons, officials said earlier this year.
Still, the state is seeking a $6.8 million contract increase for the private prison operator despite penalizing the company $44.78 million since 2022 for contractual shortfalls, $15 million in the last half year. 
CoreCivic, which is paid based on the number of inmates it houses, doesn’t pay those penalties but simply forgoes state payments.
A spokesperson for CoreCivic said in a recent email statement that prisoner safety, health and well-being is “top priority” and that each facility has emergency response teams to handle medical care. All deaths are reported immediately to the state for investigation, he said.
Tennessee Correction Commissioner Frank Strada has called the company an important “partner.”

Jeff Landry’s direction and presented a proposed budget to lawmakers that would effectively keep their state funding at current levels. Lawmakers could choose to deviate from the governor’s proposed budget, but it is unlikely higher education will get a significant boost beyond the proposed funding.  Landry’s budget [&#8230;]","A. O. Williams Hall on the campus of the Southern University Agricultural Research and Extension Center in Baton Rouge. (Photo courtesy Southern University)Louisiana college and university leaders have followed Gov. Jeff Landry’s direction and presented a proposed budget to lawmakers that would effectively keep their state funding at current levels.
Lawmakers could choose to deviate from the governor’s proposed budget, but it is unlikely higher education will get a significant boost beyond the proposed funding. 
Landry’s budget would decrease state funding for higher education by about $68 million, largely the result of one-time expenses from the previous budget cycle. The proposal also acknowledges an increase in tuition and fee revenue, meaning the overall budget for higher education would increase just over $4 million. 
Lawmakers could have had more money to allocate if voters had supported Landry’s proposed Amendment Two in the March 29 election. It would have reworked the state’s tax structure and moved hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue from state savings accounts into Louisiana’s general fund, where it could have been more easily spent. 
Landry’s budget plans come amid uncertainty in federal funding for higher education and other state government entities. As President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to shrink government spending, universities are preparing for the possibility of substantially slashed federal research grants. 
Under the proposed budget, the Southern University System, the nation’s only system of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, would see a budget decrease of about $33 million, primarily from decreased tuition and fee revenue as well as a small dip in state appropriations. 
The LSU System would experience a budget increase of about $46 million, driven by a boost in self-generated revenue from record enrollments at its campuses. The University of Louisiana System, which enrolls more students than any other system, would also see a budget increase from raised revenue. Its overall budget would increase about $14 million. 
The Louisiana Community and Technical College System would also see a slight boost of $3 million. 
When the legislature convenes for its annual session next week, lawmakers will consider what changes they will make to the state budget. Both House and Senate members will get a chance to make adjustments. 
In addition to the primary state government operations bill, higher education receives money in the state construction budget and in a supplemental bill that covers a lesser amount of one-time money. Colleges and universities typically receive a substantial chunk of this funding.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare. 
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state. 
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.
More than 5M could lose Medicaid coverage if feds impose work requirements
States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets. 
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state. 
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.
The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

This [&#8230;]","Exposure to mixed coal mine dust that contains silica — a carcinogen — can lead to the development of pneumoconiosis, commonly known as black lung disease. (Getty Images)I’ve always thought the bumper sticker “Friends of Coal” was odd. Why be a friend to a fossil fuel? Especially one that’s caused so much disease, death and destruction in the state.
About 20% of coal miners in Central Appalachia are suffering from black lung, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is the highest rate of black lung detected in more than 25 years. 
Coal miners are also being diagnosed with the disease at younger ages because they have to dig through such large amounts of silica-rich sandstone to reach the coal, West Virginia Watch reporter Caity Coyne reported last summer.
We hear our politicians constantly talking about supporting coal, and how former President Joe Biden hurt coal production. They say they want to stand up for coal. In reality, they’re only standing up for the coal mine owners to have less regulations so they can make more money.
And let’s be honest  — coal mine owners in West Virginia show all the time they don’t care about coal miners.
For more than a decade the U.S. Department of Labor sent out monthly newsletters detailing impact inspections the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) performed at mines with histories of repeated safety and health violations. These reports started after the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in West Virginia killed 29 miners in April 2010.
Saturday marked the 15 year anniversary of the worst mining disaster in the United States since 1970.
A little background of the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster — MSHA’s final report concluded that 
“Massey’s corporate culture was the root cause of the tragedy.” MSHA issued Massey Energy Co., the owner of the mine, and its subsidiary, Performance Coal Co, 369 citations and orders, including for an “unprecedented 21 flagrant violations, which carry the most serious civil penalties available under the law.”
The former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship was convicted of conspiring to violate mine safety and health standards that led to the disaster. He served a year in prison.
The last MSHA newsletter was in January, before President Donald Trump took office. At the top of the final press release, it states, “Please note: As of 01/20/2025, information in some news releases may be out of date or not reflect current policies.”
You’re probably familiar with another man who owns coal mines — West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice.
Justice often said he didn’t want to go to Washington, D.C., and yet, he still ran for a U.S. Senate seat and he won. 
The Justice family owns nearly two dozen coal companies that owe more than $409,000 in delinquent mine safety fines to the federal government. Last month, the companies agreed to pay off that debt by May 1.
If West Virginia’s members of Congress care about coal and coal miners, then explain why not a single member of the state’s delegation is backing the Robert C. Byrd Mine Safety Protection Act that was introduced Thursday by Sen. Tim Kaine and Rep. Bobby Scott, who both represent Virginia.
Sens. Justice and Shelley Moore Capito, and Reps. Carol Miller and Riley Moore, why are you not on this bill — named for our former senator — that aims to help coal miners?
“Miners take incredible risks to power our nation. While we’ve made progress to support them — like extending the Black Lung Disability Trust excise tax at a higher rate and strengthening silica standards — the recent actions of the Trump Administration have undermined decades of work to enhance protections for coal miners,” Kaine said in a press release. “This legislation is critical to strengthening safety standards and holding mine operators accountable for unsafe working conditions.”
To be clear: While our leaders have remained silent, the health and safety of our coal miners is under direct threat at this very moment and right under their noses.
Just last week, a federal appeals court issued a temporary stay on the implementation of what advocates have called a long overdue industry rule that would have limited how much dangerous silica dust coal miners are exposed to while they work. The rule — which simply adds the same exposure limits to the mining industry that have existed in other industries for years through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration — was set to go into effect for coal mines next week.
Officials said last year that the rule would have likely saved thousands of lives by limiting exposure to silica dust, which is the leading cause of black lung disease. But with the decision from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the final fate of the rule remains unknown.
The Trump administration is closing 33 MSHA field offices. According to the Appalachian Citizens Law Center, these closures could significantly reduce the number of staff and inspections meant to prevent exposure to toxic dust, mining injuries and fatalities, and mining disasters.
“Closing these offices will, at a minimum, dramatically limit the ability for inspectors todo their job in a timely way by greatly expanding the territory they must cover from remaining offices,” according to the Appalachian Citizens Law Center. “At worst, staff and inspection numbers could be sharply reduced.”
The Department of Government Efficiency also eliminated hundreds of employees at Morgantown’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The office is expected to close completely, according to Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 3040.
NIOSH focuses on black lung research and screening.
“It’s devastating. People will die,” said Tinney-Zara. “There is no one else in the government that does occupational safety and health. There’s no one else in the U.S. We’re the only group, NIOSH, that does occupational safety and health. We do the research to make everyone’s job safer.”
To her credit, Capito did say she has “strong disagreements” with the Trump administration’s approach to cutting federal employees in West Virginia, and told reporters that she’d be talking to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about the NIOSH layoffs.
It’s about time Capito grew a backbone. Senator, please show the rest of your delegation how to stand up to Trump when he’s hurting your constituents. 
It’s time for our elected leaders to be friends of coal miners instead of “Friends of Coal.”

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Five years ago, the CEO of one of the largest pain clinic companies in the Southeast was sentenced to more than three years in prison after being convicted in a $4 million illegal kickback scheme.
But after just four months behind bars, John Estin Davis walked free. President Donald Trump commuted Davis’ sentence in the last days of his first term. In a statement explaining the decision, the White House said that “no one suffered financially” from Davis’ crime.
In court, however, the Trump administration was saying something very different. As the president let him go, the Department of Justice alleged in a civil lawsuit that Davis and his company defrauded taxpayers out of tens of millions of dollars with excessive urine drug testing. The DOJ alleged that Comprehensive Pain Specialists made such a “staggering” sum from cups of pee that employees had given the testing a profit-minded nickname: “liquid gold.”
Davis and the company denied all allegations in court filings and settled the DOJ’s fraud lawsuit without any determination of liability. Davis declined to comment for this article.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has said he will target fraud in Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and his Republican allies in Congress have made combating fraud a key argument in their plans to slash spending on Medicaid, which provides health care for millions of low-income and disabled Americans. During an address to Congress last month, Trump said his administration had found “hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud” without citing any specific examples of fraud.
“Taken back a lot of that money,” Trump said. “We got it just in time.”
But Trump’s history of showing leniency to convicted fraudsters contrasts with his present-day crackdown. In his first and second terms, Trump has granted pardons or commutations to at least 68 people convicted of fraud crimes or of interfering with fraud investigations, according to a KFF Health News review of court and clemency records, DOJ press releases, and news reports. At least 13 of those fraudsters were convicted in cases involving more than $1.6 billion of fraudulent claims filed with Medicare and Medicaid, according to the Department of Justice.
And as one of the first actions of his second term, Trump fired 17 independent inspectors general responsible for rooting out fraud and waste in government.
“It sends a really bad message and really hurts DOJ efforts at creating deterrence,” said Jacob Elberg, a former assistant U.S. attorney and law professor at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. “In order to reduce health care fraud, you need people both to be afraid of getting in trouble, but also for people to believe in the legitimacy of the system.”
Elberg said considerable fraud in Medicare and Medicaid exists largely because the programs’ “pay-and-chase models” prioritize paying for patient care first and tracking down stolen dollars second. To prevent more fraud, the programs would likely need to be redesigned in ways that would be slower and more cumbersome for all patients, Elberg said.
Regardless, Elberg said the president’s claimed focus on fraud appears to be a pretext for slashing spending that has been legally appropriated by Congress. Trump has empowered the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, which he established and named by executive order, to make deep cuts in federal budgets, halting some medical research and aid programs in addition to cutting spending on climate change, transgender health, and diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.
“What’s been the focal point to date of the administration is not what anybody has ever referred to as health care fraud,” Elberg said. “There is a real blurring — a seemingly intentional blurring — between what is actually fraud and what is just spending that they are not in favor of.”
Jerry Martin, who served as a U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee under President Barack Obama and now represents health care fraud whistleblowers, also said Trump’s focus on fraud appeared to be “just a platform to attack things that they don’t agree with” rather than “a genuine desire to root out and combat fraud.”
Even so, Martin said some of his whistleblower clients have been emboldened.
“I’ve had clients repeat back to me ‘President Trump says fraud is a priority,’” Martin said. “People are listening to it. But I don’t know that what he’s saying translates into what they believe.”
The White House did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
A billion-dollar fraud case and needless eye injections
Presidents enjoy the unique authority to erase federal convictions and prison sentences with pardons and commutations. In theory, the power is intended to be a final bulwark against injustice or overly harsh punishment. But many presidents have been accused of using the pardon power to reward powerful allies and close associates as they leave the White House.
Trump issued about 190 pardons and commutations in the final two months of his first term, including for some health care fraudsters convicted of schemes with astonishing costs.
For example, Trump granted a commutation to Philip Esformes, a Florida health care executive convicted in 2019 of a $1.3 billion Medicare and Medicaid fraud scheme. After he was sentenced, DOJ announced in a press release that “the man behind one of the biggest health care frauds in history will be spending 20 years in prison.” Trump freed him 14 months later.
Trump also granted a commutation to Salomon Melgen, a Florida eye doctor who was serving a 17-year prison sentence for defrauding Medicare of $42 million. Melgen falsely diagnosed patients with eye diseases, then gave them unnecessary care, including laser treatments and painful eye injections, according to DOJ and court documents.
“Salomon Melgen callously took advantage of patients who came to him fearing blindness,” said a DOJ news release after Melgen was sentenced in 2018. “They received medically unreasonable and unnecessary tests and procedures that victimized his patients and the American taxpayer.”
DOJ: $70 million spent on ‘excessive’ urine testing
Despite the flurry of pardons and commutations at the end of Trump’s first term, the leniency he showed Davis was unique. Davis was the only convicted health care fraudster to receive clemency while the Trump administration was simultaneously accusing him of more fraud.
As CEO of Comprehensive Pain Specialists from 2011 to 2017, Davis oversaw a rapid expansion to more than 60 locations across 12 states, according to federal court documents.
He was indicted in 2018 for using his CEO position to refer Medicare patients in need of medical equipment to a conspirator in return for kickbacks paid through a shell company, according to court documents. He was convicted at trial in April 2019 of defrauding Medicare.
Three months later, the DOJ filed a fraud lawsuit against Davis and CPS that piggybacked on the claims of seven whistleblowers. The lawsuit alleged that CPS collected more than $70 million from federal insurance programs for urine drug testing, most of which was “excessive,” and that an audit of a sampling of the tests had found at least 93% “lacked medical necessity.”

CPS denied all allegations and settled the lawsuit without admitting any liability.(Photo by Heidi de Marco/KFF Health News)
Typically, government insurance programs pay for urine testing so pain clinics can verify that patients are taking their prescriptions properly and not abusing any other drugs, which could contribute to an overdose. Patients could be tested as little as once a year or as often as monthly depending on their level of risk, according to the DOJ lawsuit.
But Comprehensive Pain Specialists performed “myriad urine drug testing on virtually every CPS patient on virtually every visit” then conducted “at least 16 different types of tests” on each sample, and sometimes as many as 51, according to the lawsuit.
Trump commuted Davis’ sentence for his criminal conviction in January 2021 as the DOJ was finalizing a settlement in the civil lawsuit. The commutation was supported by country music star Luke Bryan, according to a White House statement.
Months later, with President Joe Biden in office, CPS and its owners agreed to repay $4.1 million — less than 10% of the damages sought in the suit — and the case was closed.
In the settlement, Davis agreed not to take any job where he would ever again bill Medicare or other federal health care programs. He was not required to personally repay anything.
Martin, who represented one of the whistleblowers who first raised allegations against Davis and CPS, said the leniency that Trump showed to him and other health care fraudsters may discourage DOJ employees from pursuing similar investigations during his second term.
“There are a lot of rank-and-file people who are operating at the lowest point in their professional careers, where they’ve seen a lot of their work essentially be water under the bridge,” Martin said. “That’s got to be really demoralizing.”

Sears/Maryland Matters)The governor was disappointed, some of the biggest bills got put off to the last day, last-minute wrangling doomed some bills and saved some others, and it all ended at midnight with balloons and confetti raining down from the galleries to mark the end of 90 days of work.
In other words, just another Sine Die.
It was a final day that proceeded at the usual hectic pace but with little of the usual drama. When lawmakers convened on Jan. 8, the big issues were the state’s budget utility reform and possible changes to the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, the state’s sweeping education reform plan. When they adjourned Monday, those issues were still hanging around but passed with little fuss beyond Republican carping.
Scores of low-profile bills were pushed across the finish line, while scores more quietly died. Some of the biggest attention went toward some of the least-consequential bills, to make chromite the official state mineral and to make orange crush the official state cocktail.
And while adjourning “sine die” — literally, without day — means eight to nine months of peace, lawmakers could find themselves back in Annapolis in a matter of months coping with the impact of federal cuts on the state budget they just spent three months crafting.
Here, in no particular order, are the moments and the measures that made for Sine Die 2025.
Moore’s not mad , just disappointed
Balloons and confetti had barely settled on the floors of the House and Senate when Gov. Wes Moore (D) let it be known that he did not get everything he had hoped for this year, after two years of bragging about going “10 for 10” on his legislative agenda.
In a statement posted at 12:06 a.m., Moore praised efforts to reform the state tax code — an effort that looked very different from the one he proposed — and the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future (which the House remade in its image). But he pointed out that the Democratic majority just did not do enough.
“We also introduced legislation centered on addressing the issues that Marylanders tell me they care about the most — from housing to small business growth to energy rates,” Moore said in his statement. “Yet, the General Assembly did not pass our bill that confronted, head-on, the challenge of producing more affordable housing in our state. The General Assembly also missed an opportunity to make Maryland a more attractive destination for businesses. And the General Assembly failed to make nuclear energy a core part of the state’s clean energy strategy, so we could add more capacity to Maryland’s energy portfolio.”

The governor skipped the final-day visits to the House and Senate that he made in his first two years in office. In a mid-afternoon meeting with reporters, he gave no hint of his sour view of the General Assembly’s performance, saying instead that his administration focused on building strong relationships with lawmakers.
“I don’t think there’s anyone who could argue that this is the administration that doesn’t just believe in coalition building, but the way that we coalition-build, in comparison to what has happened before in the state of Maryland, that it’s been a night and day shift,” Moore told reporters Monday afternoon.
It remains to be seen how Moore will address his concerns. In recent weeks, he has hinted at the potential of using his veto pen. On Monday night, Moore repeated those nonspecific warnings.
“I wanted to make sure that we were making Maryland more economically competitive, making us more business friendly, and continue the trend that we’re seeing when new business starts,” Moore told reporters. “I was not going to deal with other things that I felt contradicted that, and we had to make sure we are investing in our people, and so that is going to be the lens that I started the session with.”
And, he said, that would be the lens through which he viewed each bill sent to him.
“If things violate or do not make sense with that in the context of what’s happening right now, especially what’s happened with the federal government, it will not get my signature,” Moore said.
Finally, medical parole done
It was never certain, but after several years of trying, lawmakers were able to push through reforms to the state’s parole system Monday for incarcerated individuals who are ill or aging.
Passage came after the House and Senate agreed to changes that make House Bill 1123, sponsored by Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), and Senate Bill 181, sponsored by Sen Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County), sync.
The amendments that would reform the medical and geriatric parole process include raising the age from 60 to 65 for incarcerated individuals to seek parole, and increasing the time served from minimum of 15 years to a minimum of 20. The final version of the bills also added a five-year pause between petitions for parole from those incarcerated. Minor technical amendments included changing the title from “medical and elder” to “medical and geriatric.”

“Sen. Shelly Hettleman deserves so many props on this. I just came in and carried the football,” said Bartlett, who served as the lead sponsor on this measure for the past two years. “This is going to help so many people.”
This was the fourth year Hettleman worked on legislation to reform the medical and geriatric parole process. She said the legislation could help hundreds of people.
“These are people really ill and people who are much older, who have served their time,” she said. “I do think it will make substantial, important reforms that are long overdue.”
The bills, if signed by the governor, would take effect Oct. 1.
Couldn’t put housing together again
The bill formerly known as the governor’s Housing for Jobs Act was amended to unrecognizability. But despite efforts from lawmakers, county officials and other interested parties to build a bill that would help expedite housing development in certain areas without stepping over local zoning authority, those challenges could not be surmounted before the clock struck midnithg Monday.
Upon introduction in January, House Bill 503 was framed as an expansion of Moore’s housing package from last year. The original version aimed to expedite housing development by requiring counties to automatically approve most qualifying housig project requests in areas where the state determined there was an imbalance between housing and jobs.
The House stripped that bill in its entirety and replaced it with all new language that would have prompted the Department of Housing and Community Development to set 10-year housing targets for the state, its counties and every municipality, and report on their progress annually.
But the House and Senate appeared to disagree on language that would have granted “vesting rights” so that a housing developer with an approved project proposal would retain the right to develop the property. The bill got stuck in the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee, where it stayed until time ran out, killing the bill for session.
‘Chaos’ at House Democrats press gaggle
What if House Democrats held a meeting with reporters and Republicans showed up?
It’s no longer a hypothetical question: It’s just what happened in the waning hours of the 2025 session when House Majority Leader David Moon (D-Montgomery) and House Majority Whip Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s) met with reporters outside a State House press room to talk about the 90-day legislative season.
During that conversation, Moon and Lewis were asked about criticisms leveled by Republicans that conservative voices were being minimized and cut off during debates by House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County).
  Del. Mark Fisher (R-Calvert) watches as Dels. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s) and David Moon (D-Montgomery) speak to reporters Monday.  (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
“I actually think it’s a mischaracterization to say that there’s been complaints from the Republicans about this,” Moon said. “I think there’s been complaints on the floor from the same very small handful of Republicans in the Maryland House that are specifically attempting to emulate their chaos-making friends down on Capitol Hill.”
Moon’s comments were a reference to the Freedom Caucus, a hard-right subgroup of congressional Republicans, that some have dubbed the “Chaos Caucus.” The moniker was adopted by some in Annapolis — a pejorative to describe the seven-member Republican House faction that was officially recognized earlier this year as the state-level version of the Freedom Caucus.
As if on cue, Del. Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County), vice chair of the House Freedom Caucus, arrived and staked out a position in a doorway near Lewis and Moon. Soon, three other members of the newly formed subgroup of the House Republican Caucus arrived and listened from a stairwell.
And when Lewis and Moon left, the Freedom Caucus swooped in to the cameras and microphones. Szeliga, with Dels. Matt Morgan (R-St. Mary’s), Mark N. Fisher (R-Calvert) and Brian Chisholm (R-Anne Arundel), used the opportunity to offer their views on the session.
“This is Maryland’s largest tax increase we’ve ever had in our state’s history,” Morgan, the caucus chair, said of the budget lawmakers passed earlier in the day. “Neighboring states are not in that position. These are Maryland’s policies coming home to roost.”
Members went on to offer opposing views on a number of other policies.
“We have the highest energy prices in the entire region. Did Annapolis Democrats solve that problem? No, they didn’t,” Fisher told reporters. “Did they solve the problem of making Maryland more business friendly? Did Gov. Moore’s policies get through to make Maryland more business friendly? No, they didn’t.”
Members of the caucus spoke to reporters for nearly 10 minutes. And apparently reporters do not have to wait for the next State House mash-up press conference.
“When we started this at the beginning of the session, we said we want to help you guys,” Morgan told reporters. “We want a good relationship and reboot our relationship with the media.”

Nuking the nuclear bill
A bill from the governor (House Bill 505) that would have allowed nuclear energy to count toward the state’s clean energy goals also failed to pass both chambers before midnight, after passing the House of Delegates in April.

Lawmakers stripped the bill for parts, however, adding provisions procuring new nuclear energy for Maryland into the larger Next Generation Energy Act, sponsored by House and Senate leadership. As amended, the bill would have raised the state’s renewable energy targets, but allowed nuclear to fulfill the goals.
In a statement Monday night, Moore bemoaned that the “General Assembly failed to make nuclear energy a core part of the state’s clean energy strategy, so we could add more capacity to Maryland’s energy portfolio.”
Prescription Drug Affordability Board expansion to governor
House Bill 424 and Senate Bill 357, which would expand the authority of a state board to lower prescription drug costs, is now officially on the way to the governor’s desk for his consideration. The board current has authority to look for ways to reduce the cost of certain drugs for people on the state’s health care plan, but the two bills would grant the board authority to place cost reduction efforts on purchasers for private insurance plans.
FAMLI delayed — again
The Senate gave final approval to another delay in the implementation of statewide a paid family and medical leave benefit for another 18 months. The program had been slated to start in July, after being delayed twice already.
House Bill 102 passed the Senate 42-5, pushing off the start date for the Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) program. Under the bill, benefits would not be available until 2028.
It’s been marked as one of the “tough decisions” the Moore administration had to make as the state grappled with a budget deficit and with the “uncertainty” and “instability” of federal policies, according to Maryland Department of Labor officials.
Recent polling suggests that more Marylanders would like to see the program go through on its original timeline, but with both chambers approving the measure, the governor will likely approve the delay his administration suggested.
GED English and Spanish
Maryland can now join the rest of the nation in allowing individuals take the General Educational Development test, also known as the GED, in English or Spanish.

House Bill 325 was sponsored by Del. Greg Wims (D-Montgomery), who said Maryland was the only state that did not offer the test in both languages. His bill received approval Thursday after the House concurred with a Senate amendment to have the bill go into effect July 1.
Senate Bill 451 sponsored by Sen. Nancy King (D-Montgomery) garnered approval Monday evening after the Senate unanimously accepted two technical amendments offered by the House Ways and Means Committee. The one sentence in the bill now reads: “Allow an individual to choose to take all components of the examination in either English or Spanish.”
The state Labor Department, which administers GED tests, said 9,131 people whose primary language was Spanish enrolled in programs it offered in 2023-24. Of those individuals, 4,177, or 46%, did not have a high school diploma.
“This is one of the most important bills of the session,” Wims said after the House adjourned Sine Die early Tuesday morning. “In my district, we have newcomers and immigrants. A lot of them, English is a second language, but they’re hard workers. This will help thousands of young people over the next decade or so.”
The 1980s want its legislature back
As the hour grew late on Sine Die, things devolved in the House of Delegates. All the way back to the 1980s, that is.
The episode began when Del. Lauren Arikan (R-Harford) rose to challenge Senate Bill 930, which allows local governments, as a pilot program, to purify their wastewater effluent and inject it into the groundwater aquifer to bolster water supply.
Arikan called the bill “nasty” and labeled it “crazy town.” Then Del. Matt Morgan (R-St. Mary’s) asked House Environment and Transportation Committee Chair Del. Marc Korman (D- Montgomery): “Do you have any concerns about this at all?”
“If I had concerns, I’d have to get in my DeLorean, because this bill — the House version — is already on the governor’s desk,” Korman said, referring to car that was a key part of the 1985 hit film “Back to the Future.”
Then Del. Robin Grammer (R-Baltimore County) piped up: “What’s a DeLorean?” he said, as laughter broke out in the chamber.
“All I know is: When it gets to 88 miles per hour, you’re going to see some serious stuff,” Korman replied.
A few minutes later, Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Middle Shore) kept the joke going, declaring with a grin that his amendment number was “867-5309,” referring to the 1981 song from Tommy Tutone.
Later on, Hutchinson had to change his vote on the bill (Senate Bill 979).
“I think Jenny confused me,” he said.
Chromite carries crushes to state symbol list
Chromite joins two dozen other official symbols of the state as the official state mineral.
Passage of the bill was an 8-year effort for 18-year-old David Shore. Shore’s irrepressible enthusiasm landed him bill sponsors and a pro bono lobbyist. Eight short years later, he got his bill.

“I’m glad chromite finally got the recognition it deserves as a key part of Maryland’s history, and I am grateful to Senator Zucker and Delegate Korman for seeing the bill through despite a long and rocky road,” Shore said. “The endeavor had fresh youth support this time around, and I hope the success of the chromite bill will inspire other Maryland kids to bring their ideas to the State House.”
The House and Senate last month unanimously passed identical bills designating the mineral, first discovered in Baltimore County in 1808, as the state mineral. More than two dozen states have an official mineral. Only Maryland has bestowed such a designation on chromite.
The official list of state symbols includes a state sport and team sport, dinosaur, dog and cat, and crustacean, among others.
The last state symbol added was rye whiskey in 2023. It was the first time in 15 years that a new state symbol made the list. In 2008, the legislature approved an official state exercise (walking) and official dessert (Smith Island cake).
In the waning hours, the House bootstrapped another state symbol into the Senate version of the chromite bill. The amendment designated the Orange Crush as the official state cocktail. The cocktail bill was headed toward defeat before its legislative resurrection as an amendment.
The governor now has the option of signing the clean version of the House chromite bill or the amended Senate version, with the cocktail. He could also sign or veto both. Neither bill is expected to land in front of Moore when he signs the first batch of bills Tuesday morning.
Two other proposals, one designating the persimmon as the official state fruit, and another that would name the Purple Pitcherplant the state’s carnivorous plant, died in committees.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0046-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-08 06:04:36.342856

(Getty Images)When presidents try to make big changes through executive orders, they often hit a roadblock: A single federal judge, whether located in Seattle or Miami or anywhere in between, can stop these policies across the entire country.
These court orders have increasingly become a political battleground, increasingly sought by both Republicans and Democrats to fight presidential policies they oppose.
This explains why the Trump administration recently asked the Supreme Court to limit judges’ power to issue what legal experts call “nationwide preliminary injunctions.” Congress also held hearings on curtailing judges’ ability to issue the injunctions.
But what exactly are these injunctions, and why do they matter to everyday Americans?
 Immediate, irreparable harm

When the government creates a policy that might violate the Constitution or federal law, affected people can sue in federal court to stop it. While these lawsuits work their way through the courts – a process that often takes years – judges can issue what are called “preliminary injunctions” to temporarily pause the policy if they determine it might cause immediate, irreparable harm.
A “nationwide” injunction – sometimes called a “universal” injunction – goes further by stopping the policy for everyone across the country, not just for the people who filed the lawsuit.
Importantly, these injunctions are designed to be temporary. They merely preserve the status quo until courts can fully examine the case’s merits. But in practice, litigation proceeds so slowly that executive actions blocked by the courts often expire when successor administrations abandon the policies.

 More executive orders, more injunctions

Nationwide injunctions aren’t new, but several things have made them more contentious recently.
First, since a closely divided and polarized Congress rarely passes major legislation anymore, presidents rely more on executive orders to get substantive things done. This creates more opportunities to challenge presidential actions in court.
Second, lawyers who want to challenge these orders have gotten better at “judge shopping” – filing cases in districts where they’re likely to get judges who agree with their client’s views.
Third, with growing political division, both parties aim to use these injunctions more aggressively whenever the other party controls the White House.
 Affecting real people

These legal fights have tangible consequences for millions of Americans.
Take DACA, the common name for the program formally called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protects about 500,000 young immigrants from deportation. For more than 10 years, these young immigrants, known as “Dreamers,” have faced constant uncertainty.
That’s because, when President Barack Obama created DACA in 2012 and sought to expand it via executive order in 2015, a Texas judge blocked the expansion with a nationwide injunction. When Trump tried to end DACA, judges in California, New York and Washington, D.C. blocked that move. The program, and the legal challenges to it, continued under President Joe Biden. Now, the second Trump administration faces continued legal challenges over the constitutionality of the DACA program.
More recently, judges have used nationwide injunctions to block several Donald Trump policies. Three different courts stopped the president’s attempt to deny citizenship to babies born to mothers who lack legal permanent residency in the United States. Judges have also temporarily blocked Trump’s efforts to ban transgender people from serving in the military and to freeze some federal funding for a variety of programs.
While much of the current debate focuses on presidential policies, nationwide injunctions have also blocked congressional legislation.
The Corporate Transparency Act, passed in 2021 and originally scheduled to go into effect in 2024, combats financial crimes by requiring businesses to disclose their true owners to the government. A Texas judge blocked this law in 2024 after gun stores challenged it.
In early 2025, the Supreme Court allowed the law to take effect, but the Trump administration announced it simply wouldn’t enforce it – showing how these legal battles can become political power struggles.
 Too much power or necessary protection?

Some critics say nationwide injunctions give too much power to a single judge. If lawyers can pick which judges hear their cases, this raises serious questions about fairness.
Supporters argue that these injunctions protect important rights. For example, without nationwide injunctions in the citizenship cases, babies born to mothers without legal permanent residency would be American citizens in some states but not others – an impossible situation.
Congress is considering legislation to limit judges’ ability to grant nationwide injunctions.
The Trump administration has also tried to make it expensive and difficult to challenge its policies in court. In March 2025, Trump ordered government lawyers to demand large cash deposits – called “security bonds” – from anyone seeking an injunction. Though these bonds are already part of existing court rules, judges usually set them at just a few hundred dollars or waive them entirely when people raise constitutional concerns.
Under the new policy, critics worry that “plaintiffs who sue the government could be forced to put up enormous sums of money in order to proceed with their cases.”
Another way to address the concerns about a single judge blocking government action would be to require a three-judge panel to hear cases involving nationwide injunctions, requiring at least two of them to agree. This is similar to how courts handled major civil rights cases in the 1950s and 1960s.
My research on this topic suggests that three judges working together would be less likely to make partisan decisions, while still being able to protect constitutional rights when necessary. Today’s technology also makes it easier for judges in different locations to work together than it was decades ago.
As the Supreme Court weighs in on this debate, the outcome will affect how presidents can implement policies and how much power individual judges have to stop them. Though it might seem like a technical legal issue, it will shape how government works for years to come – as well as the lives of those who live in the U.S.

Original publication - Illustrated London News - The Ejectment Of Irish Tenantry - pub. 16th December 1848  (Photo by Illustrated London News /Hulton Archive/Getty Images)North Carolina Republican lawmakers are advancing legislation that would impose work requirements on people enrolled in the Medicaid health insurance program.
It’s not a new idea.
As NC Newsline’s Lynn Bonner reported last week, North Carolina’s hard won 2023 Medicaid expansion law already includes a provision requiring the state Department of Health and Human Services to pursue work requirements — that is, to condition eligibility for benefits on enrollees having a job — if it can secure federal approval for such a plan. The Biden administration rejected this idea, but it’s expected that a federal HHS department under Trump would approve it (if, that is, there’s anyone left at the department after recent mass firings to review such a proposal).
But, of course, the idea of conditioning public assistance programs on a demonstration of “worthiness” by those in need goes back a lot further than 2023. Affluent people in positions of power – many of whom inherited their wealth and almost all of whom benefit greatly from tax breaks and subsidies designed to protect it — have long employed such a strategy to restrict aid programs.
Indeed, as author Padraic X. Scanlan documents in a powerful new book, one of the seminal examples in western history took place way back in the mid-19th Century. Scanlan’s book is entitled “Rot: An Imperial History of the Irish Famine,” and in it he details a series of terrible events and policy decisions that led to one of the great human disasters of recent centuries.
The Potato Famine – a calamity also often referred to as “The Great Hunger” – is an event of which many Americans (nearly 10% of whom claim some Irish ancestry) still have a general awareness. The massive blight affecting the main crop that sustained Irish peasants caused as many as two million people to die of starvation and disease or flee the tiny country – many of whom ended up migrating to the U.S. The carnage was so massive that the Irish population today has still yet to recover to the level it was at prior to the famine.
What most people have much less familiarity with, however, are the circumstances that turned a series of crop failures into a massive human catastrophe.
As Scanlan details (and journalist Fintan O’Toole neatly summarizes in a recent essay in The New Yorker entitled, “What made the Irish famine so deadly”), one of the chief contributors to the famine was the refusal of the British politicians and landowners who ruled Ireland to distribute relief because they thought it would violate rules of the free market and indulge the peasants.
Convinced that dispensing free food to starving people would make them slothful, British leaders instead established a kind of “workfare” program in which hungry people were forced to work – at below market wages – in hopes of staying alive.
O’Toole’s essay summarizes the situation this way:

        “The result was the grotesque spectacle of people increasingly debilitated by starvation and disease doing hard physical labor for wages that were not sufficient to keep their families alive. Meanwhile, many of the same people were evicted from their houses as landowners used the crisis to clear off these human encumbrances and free their fields for more profitable pasturage. Exposure joined hunger and sickness to complete the task of mass killing.”    
 
If this sounds familiar, it should, because the premise for Medicaid work requirements – that providing access to health care to people not gainfully employed enriches the undeserving and encourages harmful sloth and dependence — is precisely the same.
Of course, one of the ironies of the recent action in Raleigh is that the sponsors of Medicaid work requirements are, among Republicans anyway, the liberals in this discussion.
GOP state Rep. Donny Lambeth, a Forsyth County Republican who long championed Medicaid expansion and helped convince his GOP colleagues to accept it a decade after it became an option, has rightfully stated that plans under consideration among congressional Republicans to gut Medicaid with hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts would be “a disaster.” He’s actually pitching the enactment of work requirements as, in effect, a kind of human sacrifice to hard right politicians bent on vastly more devastating cuts to the program.
It’s a remarkable state of affairs. Like their pompous predecessors in the bygone British Empire, Republican leaders who control the federal government and the North Carolina legislature are callously and offensively debating two options for how best to deal with low-income people at risk of dying if they lose their health insurance: a) making them work or do community service to keep getting it, or b) simply cutting them loose altogether.
Talk about history repeating itself.
As O’Toole notes, “Above all, ‘Rot’ reminds us that the Great Hunger was a very modern event, and one shaped by a mind-set that is now again in the ascendant,” even if, as he adds ruefully, the chance of other countries taking in millions of starving migrants probably can’t happen today.
As he and Scanlan might have also added, Medicaid work requirements won’t kill as many people as the 19th Century pro-starvation policies of the British in Ireland, but many undoubtedly will die prematurely and the maddening arrogance of the policy makers in the two situations is essentially indistinguishable.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Potato-famine-Getty.jpg,,,2025-04-08 06:04:36.342856

(Bruce DePuyt/ Maryland Matters),"Midday traffic on the American Legion Bridge on June 14, 2022. (Bruce DePuyt/ Maryland Matters)The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) wants to hear citizens’ ideas on how it may update its rules to cut costs and boost efficiency while keeping the country’s transportation system safe. But some Virginia lawmakers caution that those recommendations should come from safety experts, not the public, and say “arbitrarily” loosening roadway regulations could be harmful to supply chains and the economy.
DOT’s request for information is one way the agency is complying with two executive orders signed by President Donald Trump aimed at maximizing effectiveness and reducing regulations. 
According to the request, DOT is seeking public feedback on existing regulations, guidance, paperwork requirements, and other regulatory obligations to assist the agency in identifying how its rules can be modified or repealed without breaking any laws.
As part of this effort, DOT must identify and report to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs on regulations in one or more specific areas. This includes regulations that “are based on unlawful delegations of legislative power” and “that raise serious constitutional difficulties,” as well as ones that impose significant costs on companies and businesses without providing benefits to the public that justify these costs. The agency did not provide examples of current regulations that match these descriptions.
It is unclear exactly how individual states’ transportation systems are involved in this effort. 
Marshall Herman, director of communications for the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), said in a statement to the Mercury that the department is aware of the DOT’s request. She said the collection and reviews of information that might be relevant to the request are currently underway.
Comments and information, with the identification of “Regulatory Reform RFI,” are due by May 5 and can be submitted through the Federal eRulemaking Portal, by email to transportation.regulatoryinfo@dot.gov with the subject line “Regulatory Reform RFI,” or by mail to U.S. Department of Transportation, Office of the General Counsel, 1200 New Jersey Ave. SE, Washington, DC 20590.
The agency offered a list of 12 questions to help guide commenters in completing its request. 
One of the dozen questions reads: “Are there regulations, guidance, or reporting requirements that have become outdated, and if so, how can they be modernized to better accomplish their objectives?”
Another question asks, “​​Does DOT currently collect information that it does not need or use effectively?”
Virginia House of Delegates Transportation Committee Chair Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, said her office is monitoring the agency’s proposal, but is “troubled” by the administration’s approach to regulation reform.
“There’s definitely room to reconsider rules that get in the way of timely completion of critical infrastructure, but those proposals should come from safety experts, not solicited through an online submission form,” Delaney said. 
Besides the safety concerns for drivers and pedestrians, Delaney said “arbitrarily deregulating our roadways will also burden our supply chain and economy beyond the damage we are beginning to see from this administration to trade.”
She said she hopes the White House will work with Congress to make any changes through the “regular process” in order to “properly weigh all considerations” of changing certain rules.



DOT will be required to identify and report to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs on regulations in one or more of the following categories:
– Unconstitutional regulations and regulations that raise serious constitutional difficulties, such as exceeding the scope of the power vested in the Federal Government by the Constitution;
– Regulations that are based on unlawful delegations of legislative power;
– Regulations that are based on anything other than the best reading of the underlying statutory authority or prohibition;
– Regulations that implicate matters of social, political, or economic significance that are not authorized by clear statutory authority;
– Regulations that impose significant costs upon private parties that are not outweighed by public benefits;
– Regulations that harm the national interest by significantly and unjustifiably impeding technological innovation, infrastructure development, disaster response, inflation reduction, research and development, economic development, energy production, land use, and foreign policy objectives
– Regulations that impose undue burdens on small businesses and impede private enterprise and entrepreneurship.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) The 2025 election season in Virginia is officially underway — and the landscape is coming into sharp focus after last week’s filing deadline for the June 17 primaries. With the top of the tickets now set and the full list of candidates for the House of Delegates finalized, both parties are preparing for what could be one of the most consequential election years in the commonwealth’s recent history.
Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears became the Republican nominee for governor by default after former state Sen. Amanda Chase and former Del. Dave LaRock failed to submit enough valid signatures to qualify for the primary ballot. 
The GOP now avoids a potentially divisive nomination fight and can direct all of its resources toward the general election, where Earle-Sears will face former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee who left Congress in 2024 to run for governor.
Spanberger enters the race with a clear financial advantage. Her campaign reported raising $9.6 million by the end of 2024, with $6.6 million in cash on hand. On Monday, her team announced an additional $6.7 million raised in the first quarter of 2025.
“Our campaign is tremendously grateful for this record-breaking show of support,” Campaign Manager Samson Signori said in an email. “We are proud to run a grassroots campaign with the strong support of thousands of volunteers across every corner of our commonwealth.”
Earle-Sears ended 2024 with $2.6 million raised and $2.1 million in cash. Last week, her campaign announced a $3.1 million haul for the first quarter — a figure she achieved despite being unable to raise money for much of the reporting period. As a sitting member of the legislature, Earle-Sears is barred from fundraising during the General Assembly session.
“Our campaign is proudly fueled by hardworking Virginians who want a leader who will cut taxes, defend parental rights, and keep our communities safe,” Earle-Sears said in a statement. “The threat of radical change that would turn our commonwealth in the wrong direction is real and demands we fight back directly and aggressively.”
Two independent candidates, Donna Charles and Andrew White, have also filed to run for governor. No campaign finance disclosures have been filed for either.
Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington, said the absence of a gubernatorial primary gives both major candidates a strategic edge heading into November.
“This is the best case scenario for both of the candidates,” Farnsworth said. He noted that primaries often force contenders to cater to their party’s ideological base — sometimes at the expense of their appeal in a general election.
“If you go through the primary process, you will have to say a number of things to win over the ideological extremists who vote in primaries, and the things that you say in the spring can come back to haunt you in November,” he explained. “And now they don’t have to deal with it.”
For Republicans especially, Farnsworth added, the early clarity in the race is a rare bright spot. 
“With no primary, you can focus on the general election,” he said. “It’s a rare bit of good news for Republicans, who have a lot of headwinds coming out of Washington going into this election.”
 Crowded fields down-ballot

The lieutenant governor’s race has drawn large and diverse fields on both sides. Three Republicans are seeking the nomination: U.S. Navy veteran John Curran, Pat Herrity — the last remaining Republican on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors — and conservative radio host John Reid.
The Democratic field is even more crowded, with six candidates vying for the nomination: attorney Alex Bastani; state Sens. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, and Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach; physician Babur Lateef; former U.S. Department of Justice counsel Victor Salgado; and former Richmond mayor Levar Stoney.
Marlow Jones, a member of the Petersburg City Council and a Republican, is also running for lieutenant governor — as an independent.
In the race for attorney general, Republican incumbent Jason Miyares is seeking a second term. Miyares, who made history in 2021 as the first Latino elected to statewide office in Virginia, is running unopposed in the GOP primary.
Two Democrats are competing for the nomination to challenge him in November. Former state Del. Jay Jones of Norfolk, who previously ran for attorney general in 2021 but lost the primary to then-incumbent Mark Herring, is back for another attempt. Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor, a veteran local prosecutor, is also seeking the Democratic nod.
 House races take shape

In the House of Delegates, all 100 seats are on the ballot this year. Democrats are fielding 114 candidates in 96 districts, while Republicans are running 76 candidates in 66 districts. Democrats have primaries in 14 districts, and Republicans have primary contests in 10.
The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) on Monday announced a seven-figure investment in the campaigns of four incumbents in what they view as winnable districts — Dels. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, Josh Cole, D-Fredericksburg, Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, and Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach. Each won their 2023 races by 3 to 6 percentage points.
DLCC pours money into Virginia races, citing ‘All eyes on 2025’

“The DLCC’s investment is a clear signal that the eyes of the nation are on Virginia — and for good reason,” said Amber Gantt, a spokeswoman for the Virginia House Democratic Caucus. “Our frontline delegates flipped some of the toughest districts in the state, and they’re already delivering real results for Virginians.”
The margin for control of the House couldn’t have been tighter in 2023, when just 975 votes statewide ultimately determined which party held the majority. That razor-thin outcome is a vivid reminder of how every district, and every ballot cast, could prove decisive in 2025.
Farnsworth, the political scientist, said that this year’s political landscape carries echoes of 2017, when Democratic enthusiasm surged in response to Donald Trump’s first presidency — a dynamic that appears to be resurfacing after Trump’s return to the White House.
“In a lot of ways this does look sort of like eight years ago, where you have a lot of motivated Democrats in part because of the energy within the party, but also because of the frustration with President Trump. Both of these dynamics seem to be present this year.”
Farnsworth cautioned that Republicans could face a turnout challenge if they fail to field candidates in enough down-ballot races — a challenge that hurt Democrats in the past.
“There is a potential problem, though, in a statewide election if you don’t have Republican candidates in a larger number of districts, because you may not be encouraging a Republican turnout,” Farnsworth said. 
“The more Republicans there are on the ballot in House of Delegates races, the more likely there’ll be people voting Republican up and down the ballot. That was one of the problems that the Democrats had four years ago were districts that didn’t have a Democratic name on the ballot, and that hurt (Democrat) Terry McAuliffe’s campaign.”
Only one GOP incumbent — Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt — faces a primary challenge this year, from Austen Schwend. 
On the Democratic side, several incumbents are being challenged from within their own party. 
Del. Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, faces Sean Epstein and Arjoon Srikanth in District 1. In Richmond’s District 81, Del. Delores McQuinn is up against Alicia Atkins, while in Virginia Beach, Del. Kelly Convirs-Fowler is being challenged by Brandon Hutchins in District 96.
Democrats are also making a concerted push into Republican-held territory, with candidates running in 43 GOP-leaning districts this year. 
Republicans, by contrast, are challenging Democratic incumbents in only 15 districts. The disparity is part of a broader Democratic strategy aimed at driving turnout — especially in areas that could also benefit Spanberger’s gubernatorial bid.

Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, who chairs the Democratic Party of Virginia, said the stakes in this year’s elections have galvanized Democratic voters — and now the focus is on sustaining that momentum through November by winning back the governor’s mansion and increasing Democrats’ narrow 51-49 majority in the House.
“There’s no question that folks are energized headed into this election cycle, we just need to make sure to keep the energy up,” Bagby said.
Framing the governor’s race as a pivotal moment for Virginia’s future, Bagby described the contrast between the candidates as sharper than anything he’s seen in recent memory.
“We’ve heard it time and time again, but in my lifetime I don’t think there’s ever been a clearer choice between the two candidates for governor,” he said.
With that clarity, he added, comes a responsibility to channel enthusiasm into organizing and outreach — while recognizing that serious challenges remain.
“We are working to make sure we are prepared to move that energy in the right direction,” Bagby said. “At the same time, we understand that there is a lot of work ahead, and some folks are committed to turn back the progress that we made related to health care and protecting families, we’ll just have to run through the tape.”
But Ken Nunnenkamp, executive director of the Republican Party of Virginia, downplayed the idea that more Democratic candidates equals more enthusiasm.
“I’m still not seeing an enthusiasm gap here. We’ve got a bunch of really good candidates,” Nunnenkamp said. “And at the end of the day, just because three or four people have filed in a Democratic primary, that doesn’t mean that there is any enthusiasm.”
Democrats seize on enthusiasm gap in 2025 Virginia House races

He also expressed skepticism that a broader Democratic field in rural districts would pay off for Spanberger in November.
“Four years ago, Terry McAuliffe went and worked his tail off trying to get votes in the rural districts, and he couldn’t do it because the Democratic message doesn’t resonate with a lot of people in those areas,” Nunnenkamp said. 
“I think (Spanberger) is going to spend as much time and money trying to turn out Democrats in those five districts where no Democrats are running, and I have a feeling just like last year, the Democratic message at the House of Delegates level is the same as it is on the statewide level. I think they’re going to have a horrible time.”
Still, Democrats are making history with their field. Of the 114 Democratic House candidates, 58 are women — including 27 incumbents — and at least seven are veterans. Eight veterans already serve in the chamber. By contrast, just five GOP incumbents are women, and a total of 17 Republican women are running for the House in 2025.
Independent candidates are rare this cycle, appearing in just four House districts. One of the most closely watched is District 50, where former Democrat Trudy Berry is now running as an independent after being denied ballot access last year due to an email error. 
Berry is up against Republican Del. Tommy Wright of Lunenburg and Democrat Earnadette Powell Farrar in a three-way contest that includes parts of Mecklenburg, Charlotte, Lunenburg, Prince Edward, and Halifax counties.

The Republican Party of Virginia announced on Saturday that former state Sen. Amanda Chase, a right-wing lightning rod who described herself as “Trump in heels,” had failed to gather enough signatures on qualifying petitions by that day’s deadline to appear on the Republican gubernatorial primary ballot.
That made Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears the party’s nominee, obviating the necessity for a Republican Primary in June. That created a direct, head-to-head general election match-up in November with former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who is unopposed for the Democratic nomination.
A poll gives Spanberger an early edge, but  Musk and Trump may be her surest allies

But for unforeseen, tragic circumstances, the boys’ club that has been the office of governor since Patrick Henry in 1776 (or 1610 if you count colonial governors) will finally lose its monopoly. The glass ceiling will be shattered in a million jagged, crystalline pieces, waiting to be swept up and rightfully dumped into the dustbin of history.
It’s about time. Fifty-four women have served as governors in 32 states and two U.S. territories beginning with Wyoming’s Nellie Tayloe Ross in 1925, according to the Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University. That includes 13 now serving as governors.
In Virginia, this is the first time both major parties will offer female nominees. One woman got within sight of the pinnacle without planting her flag on the summit.
In 1993, Democratic Attorney General Mary Sue Terry was considered an early shoo-in to succeed Gov. Doug Wilder, who had made history in 1989 as the nation’s first elected Black governor.
Terry, who had served in the House of Delegates, was the first woman to win statewide office with her election as attorney general in 1985. She easily won reelection in 1989, and was seen as the virtual incumbent after Democrats had held the Executive Mansion for the previous dozen years. One early poll showed Terry with a 29-percentage point advantage over her Republican foe, a former Virginia congressman known mostly as the namesake son of former Washington Redskins coach George Allen.
Terry was burdened by factors of her own making and those beyond her control. Her campaign often seemed adrift, going through the motions ahead of her inevitable coronation. But three consecutive Democratic administrations in Richmond and disappointment with first-year Democratic President Bill Clinton left voters feeling Virginia was on the wrong track. Wilder’s lingering, high-profile contretemps with Sen. Chuck Robb — a former Democratic governor and son-in-law of President Lyndon Johnson — did the party’s brand no favors, either.
By the closing weeks of the 1993 campaign, it was clear that the wheels had fallen off Terry’s campaign. Allen routed her by 18 percentage points, ending Terry’s political career and christening a Republican renaissance that reached its zenith in 2001 with the party holding every lever of elective government in Virginia for the first time in modern history.
No woman would win statewide office again until Earle-Sears was elected lieutenant governor in a 2021 GOP sweep of all three statewide offices plus a narrow House of Delegates majority. A former Marine who upset a longtime Democratic incumbent to win a House of Delegates seat in 2001, she is also the first African American woman to win statewide election.
Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears announces run for Virginia governor

I can’t help but wonder, though, about one of the most intriguing and promising candidates I’ve known.
Emily Couric was a Democratic member of the state senate serving Charlottesville, first elected in 1995 and re-elected in 1999.
She was smart and tireless, taking on the task of personally reading every piece of legislation on which she would vote, either in committee or on the floor. It paid off. She would find flaws in bills that would sometimes doom them or send patrons scurrying to make corrective amendments.
Emily was an unflinching Democrat, but she had many admirers on the other side of the aisle. She was a moderate who often found common ground with Republicans. She also had the “it” factor that made her a formidable contender in 2000 when she announced her candidacy for lieutenant governor the following year.
She was blessed with a lightning-quick wit that served her well in debates and could defuse tense, even acrimonious situations. And she had that unmistakable family smile that her kid sister, Katie, had made famous as a national television personality.
To this day, I wonder what if?
Emily had a clear shot at the nomination and, as it turned out, likely would have been elected lieutenant governor in 2001, a rebound year for Democrats with Mark Warner heading the ticket. Two weeks before that election, however, Emily was laid to rest after a determined fight with pancreatic cancer.
When she announced her diagnosis in July 2000, she dropped out of the race but remained in the Senate and, remarkably, signed on as co-chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia despite the toll her treatment exacted. Richmond’s little-known mayor, Tim Kaine, filled her vacancy on the ticket and the seat she might have had on an amazing political odyssey. He served as governor, a vice presidential running mate and is in his third U.S. Senate term.
Every candidate brings different skillsets and choices to each unique election and, if they win, to a subsequent term of office. Political fortunes rise and fall because of them. We will never know if there might have been a Governor Couric. We can only ponder what might have been.
Now, a woman will get that chance. I take comfort knowing that there will be a Governor Spanberger or a Governor Earle-Sears.
Either way, her time has come.

undercuts his promise to deliver “radical transparency.” (Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)Public access to government records that document the handling of illnesses, faulty products, and safety lapses at health facilities will slow after mass firings at the federal Department of Health and Human Services swept out staff members responsible for releasing records, according to transparency advocates and health experts.





HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s layoffs across health agencies in recent days eliminated workers who handled Freedom of Information Act requests at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cut FOIA staff at the FDA and the National Institutes of Health, said six current and former federal workers KFF Health News agreed not to name because they fear retaliation and are not authorized to speak to the press.
FOIA is a transparency law that guarantees public access to the inner workings of federal agencies by requiring officials to release government documents. The 1966 law is a crucial tool for law firms, advocates, businesses, journalists, and the general public. It has been used to hold officials accountable and uncover harm, corruption, and political meddling in policymaking.
At HHS, FOIA requests are used to obtain a litany of records, including detailed CDC information about large outbreaks of food and waterborne illnesses, and FDA inspection reports of facilities that make food, drugs, medical devices, and dental products.
Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the FOIA cuts would have “an enormous effect on patient safety” and are “antithetical” to Kennedy’s promise to bring “radical transparency” to federal health agencies.
“It is simply not possible to honorably make that claim while decimating the staff,” Lurie said. “Can we rely particularly on this government to be forthcoming about the number of cases in an outbreak? You need FOIA to be able to take the lid off of that.”
HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano declined to respond on the record to questions about the department’s plans for processing FOIA requests from the CDC, FDA, and NIH.
Gunica Singh, staff attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the FOIA layoffs were almost certain to further slow the release of public records, which often took months or years before the cuts.
“What we need to be doing is the opposite of what’s happening now: hiring more staff,” she said.
Many records are disclosed only in response to FOIA requests. For example, during the covid-19 pandemic, FOIA requests forced the FDA to release internal documents showing little evidence to support using hydroxychloroquine to treat covid, even though President Donald Trump heavily promoted the drug.
Scientific researchers have used the law to obtain clinical trial data to assess whether drugs are safe and effective, or to get more details about adverse events associated with drugs and medical devices. Lurie said obtaining more information about adverse events is particularly important in serving as a bulwark against cherry-picking data or manipulating what’s available online to spread disinformation about the safety of vaccines and other products.
All these efforts will be slowed by the purge of FOIA offices, said Michael Morisy, CEO of MuckRock, a nonprofit group that helps journalists and others file public records requests. Scientists will have less to study. Attorneys and advocates will struggle to build cases and fight for causes. Simply, Americans will know less about their government and the industries it regulates and be less able to hold them both to account.
“I think one thing we’ve learned is that if there’s less watchdogging over an issue, that issue gets worse,” Morisy said. “I really do think that we are going to see companies become more lax with food safety, companies become more lax with consumer safety.”
Thousands of pending FOIA requests are likely to be affected.
During fiscal 2024 — from October 2023 through September 2024 — the CDC, FDA, and NIH received more than 15,000 FOIA requests and provided at least some records in response to more than 10,000, according to HHS’ most recent annual FOIA report.
Those requests were submitted by university researchers, state governments, laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, animal rights groups, law firms, and news organizations, including KFF Health News. Records sought by law firms appear related to investigations of illnesses, outbreaks, drugs, medical devices, and products used by countless Americans.
Morisy and Singh said filling requests is more complicated than many realize, often requiring an in-depth understanding of complex agencies. That’s why it’s important to house FOIA staff within each agency rather than consolidate them.
“We are sacking the entire staff and sacking all of that knowledge,” Morisy said. “And I just don’t see how these things continue to function.”
David Rousseau, the publisher of KFF Health News, serves on the board of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) takes questions from reporters at a press conference marking the opening of his congressional office in Lansing, Mich. on Monday, Jan. 13, 2025. | Kyle DavidsonU.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) said Monday that he is “not ready to give up” on tariffs issued by President Donald Trump “at this point” after a third day of global markets plummeting.
The freshman member of Congress said during a telephone town hall that the stock market “isn’t the entire American economy.”
“It’s an indicator of how our economy is doing, but it’s not reflective of the entire economy as a whole,” Barrett said.
He pointed to the U.S. adding 228,000 jobs in March, exceeding expectations, as an example.
Barrett said he is monitoring the situation and will “make sure we are doing everything we can to stabilize the market and ensure consumers don’t experience long-term pain.”
More than 5,000 people joined the call, Barrett’s office said, and he took questions on topics ranging from his support of a bill that would require proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s use of a Signal group chat that unintentionally included the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic to communicate about plans to bomb Yemen.
While a constituent urged Barrett to vote against the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or SAVE, the congressman said that not requiring proof of citizenship “discounts your vote or my vote from counting as an effective tool.”
A review by the Michigan Secretary of State’s office identified 15 individuals who allegedly cast ballots in the November presidential election despite not being U.S. citizens, representing less than 0.0003% of the 5.7 million ballots cast.
But Barrett pointed to Rep. Marianne Miller-Meeks, an Iowa congresswoman who won her election in 2020 by six votes, to explain why it is problematic for even a small number of potentially illegal ballots to be cast.
“That can make or break an entire race for the U.S. Congress, and there have been multiple bills that have passed on the floor of Congress by one vote this term alone,” Barrett said. “So six votes in one district can affect the outcome of that election, and that one vote in the House of Representatives or the U.S. Senate could affect the entire trajectory of legislation in this country.”

But while another SAVE Plan – former President Joe Biden’s Saving on a Valuable Education repayment plan for student loan borrowers – makes its way through the courts, one caller expressed concern about whether the Trump administration could place limits on Public Service Loan Forgiveness, a program that promises student loan forgiveness for any borrower who spends 10 years working in the public sector.
Barrett said that any changes to the program would have to be implemented in such a way that anyone currently on their way to loan forgiveness under the plan, signed into law by former President George Bush, would be held harmless.
“We want to make sure that people who are in the midst of that program and have modified their decision making about a career field are not seeing that taken away midstream,” Barrett said. “Nor do we want to see it retroactively taken away from people whose loan was forgiven because, of course, they’ve now made financial decisions based upon that.”
Responding to a question about the federal deficit and plans to extend the 2017 tax cuts, Barrett said that “at the end of the day, we have to be prepared to make tough decisions to streamline our government agencies and hopefully save us money and deliver better government assistance to people who need it most by protecting programs that really are critical.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1131448-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-08 06:04:36.342856

The company’s winning bid includes almost a quarter million dollars upfront and 18% of the well’s future revenue.
The Oil and Gas Land Management Commission has signed off on drilling beneath four state wildlife areas and Ohio’s biggest state park since it began approving bids two years ago.
Environmentalist groups have consistently opposed to the process without much success. An explosion earlier this year just outside Salt Fork State Park has only heightened those concerns. As commissioners approve more bids, opponents worry the next accident will damage public land.
Salt Fork State Park
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Austin Warehime grew up just outside Salt Fork State Park. As a kid, his dad would take him hiking or fishing in the park. He learned to drive in a Salt Fork parking lot and bought a truck with money he earned working at the park’s golf course.
At more than 17,000 acres, it’s the state’s largest park, and it sits right in the middle of Eastern Ohio’s fracking boom.
Warehime eventually moved away, got a law degree, and then decided to come back after he and his wife had a kid. Now he works for a local law firm representing landowners in negotiations over their mineral rights.
“The views here are honestly as broad as the spectrum that you can devise,” he said during a recent visit.
Plenty of residents fit in the “drill, baby, drill” camp, Warehime acknowledged, but there are also those who steadfastly oppose fracking. In between, “there’s a large contingent of people here who are fine with fracking being here and existing on private lands, and with private landowners making their own decisions.”
He chalked that up to a strain of ‘mind your own business’ libertarianism running through Appalachian communities.
“But when it comes to fracking on public lands,” he added, “There’s a large group of people in that middle there that just aren’t entirely convinced that what’s going on at Salt Fork is the right thing to do with our public lands.”

Earlier this year, the park began to see the fruits of opening public land to drillers. The Ohio Controlling Board signed off on $9.6 million in improvements at Salt Fork including a new beach shelter and asphalt resurfacing this March. But even those projects leave a bitter taste for Warehime.
“Only 30% of the money is required to stay here at Salt Fork and stay here in in Guernsey County, in the Salt Fork region,” he said, referencing the state statute that divvies up royalties from drilling on public land.
“That means 70% of the money has no guarantees that it is going to be used for Guernsey County, Eastern Ohio, Salt Fork, any of that,” he said. “I mean 70% of the money is leaving our region, and that’s kind of the story of Appalachia history in a nutshell.”
The Groh well pad
On Jan. 2, an explosion at the Groh well pad closed down a stretch of U.S. Rt. 22, about five miles from the Salt Fork State Park entrance and just 3.5 miles from the park boundary. First responders determined the safest course of action was to let to storage tank burn itself out.
Warehime’s sister lives across the road.

“You can just see the remnants of two of the large barrel-looking structures that that are on the well pad that burned and exploded,” he described. “You can see how discolored they are. They’re black, they’re charred, and they’re still standing there.”
The well pad sits a few hundred yards from the driveway where he was speaking.
“You can see it very clearly with the naked eye,” Warehime said. “You don’t have to squint or anything. It’s close.”
Another home, on the same side of the road as the well pad, is even closer.
According to a fire department report, a tank holding drilling brine caught fire, and nearby tanks started heating up rapidly. First responders described the burning tank as “cherry red” but decided putting the fire out would be risky.
“It was determined that the application of water might cause the cherry red steel of the tank to tear,” the report reads.
The tank burned for about 16 hours before it “self-extinguished.”
In a statement not long after, Ohio Department of Natural Resources spokeswoman Karina Cheung said the agency was working with local fire officials to investigate what happened.
“All produced fluids have been safely removed,” she said. “There was no release of fluids into the environment and the well pad remains shut down and inactive. There were no reported injuries, no reported impacts to wildlife, and no reported impacts to water.”
The fire department’s report lists the cause of the explosion as “undetermined.”
After an incident, the company is supposed to produce a follow up report within 30 days providing more detail on what happened and why. The Ohio Capital Journal has requested a copy of that report, but ODNR did not make it immediately available. The agency did not respond to follow up questions about the delay.
The company that operates the well pad, Gulfport Energy, has been fined in the past for safety violations, but does not appear to have received any punishment for the explosion in January.
The Capital Journal requested comment from the company about steps it’s taken to improve safety, but didn’t receive a response.

Threats creep closer
In February 2024, the commission approved a pair of bids from Infinity Natural Resources Ohio to drill beneath Salt Fork State Park. Between the two offers, Infinity put up close to $60 million for access to the park in addition to pledging 20% of its drilling revenue.
Although its Gray well pad is the first to stretch into the park, the pad itself is located about two miles away. On a recent afternoon, workers had set up a massive tower to extend the drill bore three-plus miles into Salt Fork.
“I haven’t actually been out here to see that yet,” Warehime said, peering out the window. “It’s a little sobering to actually see it occurring.”
  Drilling companies post street signs to keep trucks from straying onto neighborhood roads. (Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)
The well pad sits on a well-paved but narrow road not far from U.S. Rt. 70. There are a handful of other wells in the vicinity, and every couple hundred feet there are signs posted to direct truck traffic.
“One of the protections,” Warehime said with air quotes, “is that all these producers have to have approval to drive on certain roads. There’s one now telling Ascent Resources where they can go to access a well.”
“It’s some protection,” he allowed, “but that means they’re still driving on these roads and tearing them up, and then the public is still paying the tax for that.”
Traffic near the Landman well underscored the issue. Big trucks passed in and out of the well site, less than a mile from the park entrance.
“There’s another dump truck,” Warehime said. “This is just a small county road, I mean, we’ve got to pull off to the side to let this go through.”
Environmentalists worry those close quarters aren’t just dangerous for drivers. If a truck hauling away drilling brine got in an accident, a spill could be toxic.
The Landman well sits in a nook with Salt Fork surrounding it on three sides. The park entrance is just shy of a mile away as the crow flies, but the closest boundary is less than half a mile.
“This well was not permitted to go underneath of the park,” Warehime explained, “so even though it’s very close, it’s going down, it’s going right up to the edge of the park, and then it’s shooting to the south.
“If you’re out hiking at the park, or you’re near the main entrance of the park, you’re not really gonna notice any effects from the Gray pad,” he said. “While they’re actively drilling at Landman, you may actually hear (it) or see the flare from that.”

Pressing forward
At the same meeting that the Oil and Gas Commission approved fracking beneath the Leesville Wildlife Area, they agreed to start accepting bids for two more parcels of state land. One covers a different part of the Leesville Wildlife Area and the other is land controlled by the Department of Transportation along State Road 149 in Belmont County.

Nominations for another wildlife area and state road right of way are teed up for the next meeting.
Continuing a longstanding pattern, public comments about the nominations were almost universally against them. But as the commission moved through its agenda, it took up one item after another, voting to advance them without discussion. Audience members interjected “what were the public comments?” and “what’s the environmental impact?”
But the commission’s motions and approvals marched forward undeterred. The whole effort took less than 14 minutes. Before Chairwoman Theresa White adjourned, Commissioner Jim McGregor attempted to defend their actions.
“ODNR, of course, has a number of scientific divisions that do review these and do make comments where they think its appropriate,” he said.
McGregor pointed to new limits on drilling operations to avoid interrupting hunting seasons and better protect water.
“It may seem like we’re approving these without a lot of discussion,” he said, “but there is a lot of discussion.”
The audience was unimpressed with the new lease terms.
One woman jeered, “What do you want a medal?”

Measles cases are on track to reach a 34-year high as vaccine hesitancy spreads and funding cuts imperil state responses. (Justin Rex for The Texas Tribune)Cities and states fighting a historic measles outbreak find themselves undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation. As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.
Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.
Measles outbreak mounts among children in one of Texas’ least vaccinated counties

The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota health commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”
Alarm among experts
Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.
Vaccination rates are declining. They might get worse as states relax rules.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.
A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.










Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to is to be vaccinated.


– Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health


Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.
State responses
The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.
Flu deaths rise as anti-vaccine disinformation takes root

Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

Bryan King, R-Green Forest, speaks against Senate Bill 354, the $750 million Franklin County prison appropriation, on the Senate floor on Monday, April 7, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Senate continued to block a $750 million prison appropriation bill Monday when it voted down the legislation for the fourth time in the last week. 
Senate Bill 354 would support construction of a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County, which proponents say is needed to address overcrowding in county jails. Several elected officials and local residents in the western Arkansas county have publicly opposed the estimated $825 million project since Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in October announced the state’s purchase of 815 acres near Charleston for the prison for nearly $3 million.
The bill’s lead sponsor, Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, told the Advocate Monday that he’ll keep running SB 354 until it receives the required 27 votes it needs to advance out of the Senate. While most bills require a simple majority, appropriation bills require a three-fourths majority vote.
SESSION SNAPSHOT: Arkansas lawmakers settle into longer days as session end draws near

Lawmakers have set April 16 as the final day to approve bills during the legislative session. The governor’s office, the Arkansas Board of Corrections and Joe Profiri, former corrections secretary and current senior adviser to Sanders, will continue answering lawmakers’ questions throughout the remaining days of the session, Dismang said. 
“We still have a good group of members, even though, who are voting no, who are saying they just need a couple pieces of additional information,” he said. “My goal right now is to keep making sure that everyone’s aware that there are some questions outstanding and try to get those questions answered.”
Sen. Alan Clark, R-Lonsdale, told guests of a legislative breakfast Friday in Benton that he expects the governor to call a special session to secure the prison funding if SB 354 doesn’t pass by next week, The Saline Courier reported. A similar situation happened last year when Sanders called a special session in June as a result of lawmakers’ failure to pass an appropriation bill for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission during the 2024 fiscal session. 
The Arkansas Legislature meets for regular legislative sessions in odd-numbered years and fiscal sessions in even-numbered years. In the interim, the governor may call legislators into special session and set the agenda. Lawmakers may consider legislation outside of the governor’s call with a supermajority vote, but that’s uncommon.
Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, continued to speak against SB 354 on the Senate floor Monday. King, a longtime critic of the prison, again challenged transparency with the project, noting that a social media post by Franklin County Judge Rickey Bowman disputes an assertion that the governor’s office has stayed in close contact with local leaders.
“JUST TO BE CLEAR, NO ONE FROM LITTLE ROCK HAS REACHED OUT TO ME!” Bowman wrote. “I wish they would and open their eyes to the fact that is [sic] is going to cost the taxpayers an ungodly amount of money. It will be the most expensive site to build on.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Arkansans opposed to the project have been critical of state officials not involving local officials in the process. They also have voiced concerns about how difficult it would be to build on the rocky terrain and to access the needed infrastructure to support a 3,000-bed facility. 
At the Arkansas Board of Corrections’ meeting Thursday, representatives with Vanir Construction Management, the company retained to oversee the firm selected to build the prison, discussed building pipelines to bring in drinking water and wastewater from Fort Smith, a city roughly 27 miles west of the construction site. 
“That is exactly what we talked about. When you build a facility, you should have already known about this on the front end,” King said. “This is inconceivable that we should come in here and all of a sudden be trying to figure out where you’re going to get water.”
King also called for the expansion of the Calico Rock prison on the Senate floor and in a letter addressed to the corrections board signed by the Green Forest Republican and Sen. Gary Stubblefield, a Branch Republican whose family owns land near the proposed prison site. 
“Arkansas cannot afford to spend millions more to build a mega prison when a considerably less expensive option is available at Calico Rock,” the letter reads. “Please do not let [Profiri’s] reckless behavior hurt Arkansans. Those millions can be put to better use providing tax relief, educating students, and assisting our elderly population.”
Former Gov. Asa Hutchinson proposed expanding the Calico Rock facility by roughly 500 beds using surplus funds, and state lawmakers approved $75 million in reserve funds for that project in December 2022. 
But the proposal was put on hold when Sanders threw her support behind the Protect Arkansas Act, a 2023 law that, among other things, removes the possibility of parole for the state’s most serious offenders. The law makes it more likely that the number of state prisoners will grow.
The Legislature set aside $330 million in 2023 to support the governor’s prison expansion efforts, but disputes between the executive branch and the corrections board, and among state lawmakers, have delayed the project.
Support in the Senate for SB 354 has fluctuated between 18 and 19 affirmative votes. On Monday, 19 senators again voted for the measure while 10 opposed it. Six voted present. 
Democrats Fred Love, Reginald Murdock and Jamie Scott have consistently voted present on the measure. On Monday they were joined by Republicans Scott Flippo, John Payton and Dan Sullivan. 
Flippo has voted three times in favor of the bill, while Payton has voted against SB 354 twice and voted present twice. Sullivan has cast votes for, against and present. 
The Senate will next meet at 1 p.m. Tuesday.

President Trump has imposed broad 25% tariffs on Canadian imports. It remains unclear whether these tariffs apply to electricity (the Trump administration issued no clarification), an intangible good that has never before been subject to import duties.
The Northeast has long been a leader in clean energy innovation, setting ambitious goals to transition to a more sustainable, affordable, and reliable power grid. Tariffs of this magnitude on clean Canadian electricity imports are a direct attack on affordability, burdening U.S. consumers with an estimated $400 million in additional costs annually.
These tariffs will be felt particularly during peak-demand periods, when the Northeast’s reliance on Canadian electricity is most acute. During these hours, tariffs could increase wholesale electricity prices by up to 30%. These costs disproportionately affect working families and small businesses that are already struggling with high energy costs.
At a time when states like Massachusetts and New York are working to expand clean energy infrastructure and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, the artificial price increases from tariffs will drive clean and affordable hydroelectricity from Canada out of energy markets. The result is the opposite effect of what our state policies seek and instead will drive up costs and push the region further into dependence on natural gas and oil.
Massachusetts alone is expected to see a $200 million increase in electricity if 25% tariffs are imposed on Canadian electricity imports.
Beyond the financial impact, tariffs will undermine the reliability of the Northeast’s power grid. Just this year, during the coldest periods of January and February, Canadian energy exports accounted for 10% of New York’s demand and 15% in New England, rising to 20% during peak-demand hours.
With the added tariff costs on imports, our region will inevitably rely more heavily on fossil fuel plants that are vulnerable to fuel supply shortages and price spikes during extreme weather events. The energy market works by selecting the least expensive form of energy available to provide the required amount of energy demanded by the market. If tariffs make otherwise affordable Canadian hydroelectricity more expensive than oil and gas, the market will choose those less costly sources.
Some parts of our region are especially vulnerable. Certain rural areas in Vermont and Northern Maine, which are directly linked to electric grids in Canada and have no viable alternative supply, could be hardest hit. Tariffs could lead to millions of dollars in increased costs annually, exacerbating energy insecurity for residents who already face higher-than-average electricity prices.
Imposing tariffs on Canadian hydroelectricity is not just bad economics—it’s bad climate policy. With the withdrawal of this affordable, clean energy source, the region will be forced to burn more natural gas and oil, leading to an estimated 10 million additional tons of carbon emissions annually — annual emissions equivalent to those emitted by every car registered in New York City.
This is a step backward at a time when we should be accelerating our clean energy transition. The Northeast has set aggressive goals to cut emissions and transition to 100% clean power, yet these tariffs will make clean energy less competitive, slowing progress toward a carbon-free grid.
Supporters of these tariffs argue that they will level the playing field for domestic energy producers but, in reality, they will undermine the market forces that are driving innovation and competition in the clean energy sector.
They completely ignore the interconnected nature of the U.S.-Canadian electricity system, which has historically provided economic, reliability, and environmental benefits to both countries. Just last week, New York State released a report assessing tariff impacts. State agencies conclude that “losing access to Canadian imports during the peak summer cooling months could create significant reliability challenges.”
New York and New England cannot afford to let anything but the public interest and cost dictate energy policy. These tariffs will raise prices, reduce reliability, and set back the clean energy transition at a time when we need to accelerate progress, not stall it.
Governors, legislators, and regulators in the Northeast must visibly stand together against these tariffs, advocating for continued access to affordable, clean electricity. Businesses, labor groups, and community organizations must also speak out, making it clear that these policies will harm local economies, cost jobs, and increase energy burdens for working families.

Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare.
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care, or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state.
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people, and people with disabilities.
States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets.
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state.
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.
The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits, or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah, and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work, and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, accounted for only 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status. And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

From changes to Medicaid to elimination of lead abatement funding, the Ohio House budget proposal concerns many who have championed child wellbeing and improvement of metrics with which Ohio struggles, like infant mortality, as important budget priorities.
“It just felt like they had taken a hacksaw to some of these line-items without real consideration to what they did,” said Kathryn Poe, budget and health researcher for the think tank Policy Matters Ohio.
Poe said it seems as though state legislators are taking cues from the federal government are trying to drastically cut spending, but that don’t improve the state in the process.
“These cuts at the federal level also feel really haphazard,” Poe said. “But the state doesn’t have the amount of money or time or influence to make these sort of haphazard cuts.”
Specifically, Poe sees the elimination of Ohio’s Medicaid expansion as a significant change that will create struggles for low-wage workers who count on Medicaid for their health insurance, and who will be prevented from planning for the future without the ability to count on proper health insurance.
As Poe put it, “what do you do when 700,000 people lose their insurance overnight?”
The House’s version of the budget absorbed a proposal by Gov. Mike DeWine in his executive budget that creates a trigger effect, eliminating Group VIII, or the Medicaid expansion eligibility group, “if the federal government sets the federal medical assistance percentage below (its current level of) 90%,” according to budget documents.
The federal medical assistance percentage (or FMAP) refers to the amount of federal funding the state receives for Medicaid, based on a state’s per capita income.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe expansion group is made up of Ohioans ages 19 to 64 who have household incomes of less than 138% of the federal poverty line and aren’t eligible in other Medicaid categories. According to the Health Policy Institute of Ohio, the Medicaid expansion “has been a major contributor to Ohio’s uninsured rate dropping by half from 14% in 2010 to 7% in 2022.”
The group said the expansion has also improved access to care, with data showing a 31% decrease in Ohioans who went without care due to cost from 2013 to 2023.
According to the state, the expansion population caseload is projected to be 779,000 Ohioans in fiscal year 2026, and 772,000 in 2027. That would account for more than $13.5 billion in expenditures over the two fiscal years.
Without the expansion, workers under the program would be less likely to have insurance, partly because many workers earning less than 138% of the federal poverty line are working jobs where they aren’t given enough hours to receive medical benefits, such as entry-level retail jobs or customer service.
Citing data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Health Policy Institute of Ohio said even workers in the skilled trades like electricians and medical assistants could lose benefits, considering the federal poverty level of 138% for a family of three represents an annual income of $36,777.
“It would be a devastating economic loss,” Poe said. “The answers (for Ohioans who would lose the coverage) are everything from going to the emergency room, to not getting care, to letting that pain in your abdomen go on so long that you have to go to the emergency room anyway.”
The budget proposal comes amid attempts by DeWine and the state to apply work requirements to that particular group of Medicaid participants.
Not only will it create expensive health decisions, but the ripple effects will extend to the ability to afford groceries or have reliable transportation, according to Poe.
Those effects would trickle all the way down to Ohio’s children as well, according to advocates. Groundwork Ohio criticized a House measure that would end a requirement that the Medicaid department “seek approval to provide continuous Medicaid enrollment for Medicaid-eligible children from birth through age three
Budget documents say the change could create “possible service cost savings.”
Groundwork called on the legislature to take back the changes, saying nearly 48% of all Ohio children under the age of 6 “depend on Medicaid for health coverage.”
“The program covers about half of all births in the state and thousands of Ohio women rely on Medicaid to ensure a healthy pregnancy and support postpartum recovery,” according to an analysis of budgetary proposals in the House draft.
The organization also criticized a provision of the budget that would limit Medicaid coverage for doulas, leaving the coverage for only the six counties with the highest infant mortality rates.
The House plan also cuts pediatric cancer research by $5 million and eliminates lead abatement programs within the Ohio Department of Health. Groundwork Ohio noted the lead abatement program as part of their analysis of the budget plan, saying Ohio has “nearly double the national rate of children with elevated blood lead levels.”
“Even small amounts of lead exposure in early childhood can harm the brain, delaying growth and development, and may cause learning, behavior, speech and other health problems,” the group stated.
Advocates have already been publicly critical of the House plan to slash public education funding and drop a child tax credit proposed by DeWine in his budget plan. But adding the Medicaid changes, along with reducing funding in the areas of child development and a $1.5 million cut to “infant vitality” programming just make things worse, advocates say.
“The House’s proposal represents a step backward at a time when we can least afford it,” said Lynanne Gutierrez, president and CEO of Groundwork Ohio, in a statement. “We urge lawmakers to fully restore these investments and prioritize Ohio’s future.”

As part of their ongoing effort to manipulate and capitalize on irrational white voter fears, state Republican lawmakers are advancing legislation this session that purports to attack quote “DEI” in public education.
Under the bill, state law would spell out a long list of supposedly “divisive concepts” that would be banned from public schools. For example, the bill says it will be illegal to teach that a quote “meritocracy” — whatever that is — is inherently “racist” or “sexist” — two words that are also not defined.
Of course, the purpose of this impossibly vague language is no mystery — it’s to discourage educators from discussions of America’s grim past on matters of race that might make white students uncomfortable.
And that would be a tragic mistake.
A simple amendment would help. Lawmakers should add a word to the bill to make clear that teaching divisive concepts is banned, but only if they are untrue.
The bottom line: Discussion of hard truths is an essential part of education that our kids can handle. Would that GOP lawmakers could as well.

(Getty Images)On Jan. 29, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order that “Ends Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling” that specifically emphasizes a “Patriotic education” that presents the history of America grounded in: “an accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling characterization of America’s founding and foundational principles” and “a clear examination of how the United States has admirably grown closer to its noble principles throughout its history.”
Trump’s view of a patriotic education portrays constant American excellence, but in truth, that is only one half of the story. Teaching the darkness of our past is not unpatriotic and highlights the change of where we as a country came from. Understanding both helps students develop their own sense of why this country is worth living in, why America is the home of liberty, and how we can uphold the values that are central to us.
In addition to these principles is the reestablishment of the 1776 Commission that started in 2020 to combat the conversation surrounding Nikole Hannah-Jones’ 1619 Project. Trump, along with many other conservatives, believe that the United States and its history education has built a curriculum on guilt rather than critical thinking. The order states that no one “should feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress because of … actions committed in the past.” Trump and his supporters are convinced that history is being rewritten in the classroom, and that we are living in a time where students are taught to hate their country.
As a history teacher, I know this to be false and a direct attack on educators and historians alike. What I teach is the truth — both sides of the coin in order to present to students the bright and dark moments of our nation’s past. This includes slavery, racism, sexism, war, and violence. But it also includes political unity, memory, and movements. 
With the 250th anniversary of the United States’ birth happening next year, conversations among historians, teachers, politicians, citizens, and anyone interested creates an in-depth analysis of every part of the Revolution. From the military battles, political animosity, and various perspectives of individual lives, the Revolution is viewed from so many angles. The Revolution in our American memory is in the fabric of every movement.
In New Hampshire, Revolutionary War veteran John Stark coined the term “Live Free or Die,” which is on every license plate in the state next to the Old Man of the Mountain. What is too often forgotten is the rest of his statement: “death is not the greatest of evils” — which means that in order to protect our Republic, we must be willing to discuss its past. 
Liberty is the fundamental right in America, but only if we can keep it. Part of an education is understanding how to be a civic leader, and New Hampshire knows this value. In February of this year, a state representative introduced House Bill 283, which would eliminate the requirements of what makes up an “adequate education” in the state. Civics, history, art, and other humanities and science courses were part of the list to be discarded. Thousands upon thousands (including myself) gave feedback against the bill. So many people showed up to the hearing that they needed to move to a bigger room. 
The point is that New Hampshire parents, teachers, and students showed up because they know the value that history education (and other subjects) holds. With humanities programs being cut all over the country, the necessity for them has never been more apparent. With the kind of harmful rhetoric that a “Patriotic education” promotes, it emphasizes a dissolution of our past and transforms a false reality of what happened. Teachers describe the history of the nation as it was in order to explain why it is. 
History teachers do not make students feel guilty; we explain the perspectives of African Americans being enslaved; Native Americans in boarding schools; women during World War II, etc., while also connecting it all together to the larger picture of the famous people who helped craft our Republic. 
History is all about perspective, and sharing those with students naturally gives them a sense of where our country came from to encourage how they celebrate patriotism. It is not just July 4, but a lifelong understanding of where we came from.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/americanhistorylessons-1024x686.jpeg,,,2025-04-08 05:03:50.973122

At least seven Ohio State students have had their visas revoked as of Monday. 
“At this time, we do not have any indication why this action was taken,” university spokesperson Ben Johnson said in an email. “The students remain in the United States. The students, their attorneys and Ohio State are considering next steps.”
The New York Times has reported that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered diplomats overseas to go through the social media of student visa applicants to identify those who have criticized the United States and Israel and potentially bar them from entering the country.
“The speech of people on student visas is still protected, but it doesn’t always protect their immigration status,” the Times reports on the legality of Trump’s immigration crackdown. “International students are especially vulnerable to deportation because of the temporary nature of their legal status.”
A Kent State international student and three recent graduates with Optional Practical Training post-graduate work permits have also had their visas revoked, according to a letter last week from university president Todd Diacon.
“We are working to connect with each of these individuals to ensure they are aware of this change in their status,” Diacon said in his letter. “Kent State was not given advanced notice nor specific reasons for these decisions.”
Federal authorities have revoked the visas of “a small number of international students here at UC,” according to a letter from University of Cincinnati President Neville G. Pinto. 
“UC representatives are in touch with each of our impacted students, and we are doing what we can to support them during this incredibly challenging time,” Pinto said. “While we are aware that this is happening at universities across the nation, we have not been contacted by authorities, nor have we been given specific reasons for these revocations.”
Two Akron students had their visas revoked, according to Signal Akron. The university did not respond to the questions from the Capital Journal. 
Many international students across the United States have had their visas revoked. The Trump administration issued an executive order on his first day in office ordering the State Department to review all visa programs and make sure foreign nationals do not pose a threat to national security. 
Bowling Green State University said it was not aware of any international students who have had their visas revoked.
Central State University, Cleveland State University, Miami University, Ohio University, Shawnee State University, the University of Toledo, Wright State University, and Youngstown University did not respond to the Capital Journal’s questions by deadline.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine visited a public school Monday morning, hearing from teachers and kids about literacy efforts. But schools like Hamilton Elementary School in Columbus may have to undergo massive cuts under the proposed state budget.
The governor was asked about the possible elimination of the Fair School Funding Plan in the budget and whether he’s heard the concerns of teachers, students, and parents.
“Sure, look, I received communication from parents, communication from school superintendents,” the governor responded. “What I tell them is they’re doing the right thing. They should make their point of view available to the governor, but they also should do it to their legislators.”
Parents such as Kia Woodward are stressing about school funding for their kids.
“It’s disheartening to see that people are trying to shut (public school) doors and just trying to shut it with funding,” Woodward said.
While Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, and Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, say the state doesn’t have enough money to fully fund public education — slashing its expected budget by hundreds of millions — the same leaders have given even more money to the private school voucher system, which funnels taxpayer dollars to nonpublic schools.
In the Ohio House Republican proposed budget, public schools would get about a $220 million increase, while private schools are set to receive double that — $500 million.
Huffman and Stewart argue that what they are doing is actually giving more over the biennium than in FY25 to public schools, just not as much as they had hoped — or were expecting due under the Full School Funding Plan.
“Well, when you see the proposal, which was, ‘We’ll just increase the inputs to FY ’24,’ that was the ask — it cost $1.8 billion to the taxpayer,” Stewart responded. “We simply don’t have it.”
That is misleading, Democrats argue.
“What is being produced is likely one of the lowest state shares in our state’s history… meaning that it’s even less state money going into our schools than when this was deemed unconstitutional,” Finance Ranking Member Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Cleveland, said.
“You have the privilege to send your kid wherever you want to, and you’re gonna use my tax dollars to do it, and I don’t have the right for my kids to go to school and be in a safe building,” Woodward said.
Parent and conservative activist Greg Lawson is on the other side of the debate — arguing that dollars are best served following each individual child to the best school of choice.
“I spend a lot of tax money, my tax money… I want a little bit of that back so that I am able to put my student where I think it’s the right thing,” Lawson said.
Some Republicans argue that poor-performing school districts may not be spending money wisely. Woodward responded that public schools face audits, while nonpublic schools don’t have to follow transparency guidelines.
“I think that we could have some further conversation about that,” he said. “I think we want to be very careful on how we do it because what we don’t wanna see happen is a heavy hand of the government coming in and then dictating certain things from a curriculum standpoint.”
The governor sits in the middle of this debate, saying he wants to protect public schools — despite cutting $100 million from what they were expecting, as well — while also providing choice for families.
“We are still early on this process,” DeWine said.
The budget will likely be passed out of the House this week, but it still has to go through the Senate.

As the Cleveland Browns inch closer to getting $600 million in bonds from Ohio taxpayers, one Democratic lawmaker has introduced a bill prohibiting state dollars from going to teams with losing records.
The Browns went 3-14 last season.
The franchise wants to leave Cleveland for a new entertainment district and dome in Brook Park. This would cost $2.4 billion. The team says it will pay $1.2 billion, and the public would foot the rest of the bill — $600 million from local jurisdictions such as — a reluctant — Cuyahoga County, and the remaining $600 million from the state.
State Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, doesn’t think the team is worth the money.
“If a team wants to get taxpayer money, then the least they can do is have a winning season, and if they decide that they want to move, then the people of Ohio deserve their money back,” DeMora said.
The bill would require teams to have winning records for three of the five past seasons. The Bengals, who have their own stadium finance needs and who were left out the House’s budget proposal, have had a winning record in four of the last five seasons.
The Browns’ plans are now being debated in the court of public opinion. Last week, Browns officials appeared at a town hall in Hudson at the request of a Democratic state lawmaker. Some attendees used the opportunity to make their voices heard.
It is unlikely this bill will move in the GOP-controlled legislature, but DeMora said it sends a message.

The company has met with community resistance. (Allison Kite/Kansas Reflector)





It’s been said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Apparently, private prison company CoreCivic never got the memo.
Earlier this year, CoreCivic announced plans to re-open its shuttered Leavenworth jail as an immigration detention facility. Until it was shut down in 2021, Leavenworth Detention Center was plagued by violence, abuse, and mismanagement. In 2021 alone, attorneys reported two suicides and at least 10 severe beatings and stabbings of incarcerated individuals and employees alike. Correctional officer vacancies reached as high as 23%, while incarcerated individuals frequently reported insufficient food, medical care and access to legal counsel. Other reports of serious harm remain hidden due to the lack of transparency in CoreCivic’s facilities.
A U.S. district court judge summarized it best: The prison was “an absolute hell hole.”
CoreCivic’s plan to re-open this notorious facility and target immigrants has been met with public outcry. Pushback was so significant that CoreCivic applied, then withdrew from Leavenworth’s special use permit application process and the required public hearings. The city swiftly passed a unanimous resolution requiring CoreCivic go through the permit approval process and has now filed a federal lawsuit. The rush to staff the facility is a slap in the face to the community by one of the largest companies profiting off of human suffering.
CoreCivic campaigns on promises of “compassionate” detention and “good, dependable jobs.” But Leavenworth residents and previously detained individuals have seen through the PR spin.
At a recent city commission meeting, a former employee tearfully recounted being attacked at the understaffed Leavenworth Detention Center — which left her permanently disabled. Immigrants like Angel Argueta, who came to the U.S. after a hurricane destroyed his home and livelihood, know there is no compassion to be found in CoreCivic ICE facilities. At a Mississippi ICE center, Angel was left in a dark, solitary cell for days on end and told by guards that “the only way you leave this facility is if you die here.”
CoreCivic’s failures aren’t limited to Leavenworth. It operates criminal and immigration facilities across the country, many of which have long, sordid records of abuse and mismanagement. As attorneys and advocates, we have witnessed the devastating human cost of CoreCivic’s operations — whether it’s the 24-hour-a-day solitary confinement and rampant physical and sexual abuse suffered by those trapped inside, or the anxiety and stress endured by small-town workers left to manage the fallout.
The company wins over local leaders in towns like Leavenworth with enticing promises of profit, but those dollars rarely materialize. While localities deal with understaffing and horrific prison conditions, CoreCivic’s CEO made close to $6 million in 2023 – 96 times its median employee’s pay.
CoreCivic has repeatedly shown that it is incapable of running a humane facility. Now, the company flouts city approval to move forward with an ICE center based on false promises. CoreCivic officials have pledged not to “release any inmates or detainees into the Leavenworth community.” That statement is not only morally reprehensible, as the majority of immigrants detained by ICE are not dangerous and have no history of violent crime — it’s also legally unenforceable. CoreCivic can’t promise to ignore court orders and basic due process by continuing to hold immigrants who have been granted release or legal status in the United States.
Leavenworth and Kansas residents have made their voices clear: They don’t want this. With CoreCivic’s history of lies, failures, and inhumanity, can you blame them?

The weather was miserable, but people kept coming. They braved the rain and cold to put Donald Trump and his shadow president Elon Musk on notice that they will not surrender to tyrants on an egomaniacal quest for prolonged power at the expense of the free.

Demonstrations ran through deep red Ohio counties, solid blue urban strongholds, and suburban tossup districts. Hundreds of protestors rallied in Urbana, Republican Jim Jordan’s base. More than 200 Middletown residents, in Vice President JD Vance’s hometown, wanted the world to know “we are not all like him” as they protested at a local park and listened to anti-DOGE speeches. 
In small Ohio cities that went overwhelmingly for Trump in 2024 and large metropolitan areas that went overwhelmingly for Harris, the organic deluge of ordinary citizens swelling enormous crowds or lining up on sidewalks and roads as far as the eye could see, was a faith-restoring sight. On a soggy Saturday afternoon, Americans from all walks of life came from seemingly nowhere to join each other for their country, for their freedoms.

They stood shoulder-to-shoulder with homemade signs and American flags. Grandmothers, young parents with kids, a generational spread of Ohioans finding common cause in a defining crisis like no other. These were people with the most to lose under sledgehammer DOGE cuts, under the chaos and cruelty of an increasingly authoritarian police state. But from seniors to students, they showed up en masse to push back.
In solidarity with citizens marching across the country, they demanded the felon-in-chief and his erratic hatchet man keep their “Hands Off” earned Social Security benefits, Medicare coverage and lower prescription costs, Medicaid spending cuts, voting rights, reproductive freedom, veterans, education, history, cancer research, and 401(k) retirement savings accounts being absolutely decimated by Trump’s unforced tariff disaster. 
The eruption of anti-Trump protests at over 50 locations throughout Ohio and thousands more nationwide, came after two days of heavy losses in the stock market directly tied to Trump’s sweeping, nonsensical tariffs on all imports. Over $6 trillion was wiped off the value of 401(k)s. That’s a staggering amount of money gone in a market crash entirely self-inflicted.
Financial markets indicate another rough week with staggering losses as Trump digs in for no good reason and fears of a global recession grow. In a Sunday post, the tax fraud who bankrupted six companies, called his pointless tariff plan wreaking widespread damage “a very beautiful thing.” As markets continue to convulse with massive sell-offs, the “very stable genius” remains unperturbed. 
“I don’t want anything to go down,” said Trump, “but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” Who cares if you put a sizable crack in the retirement nest egg of tens of millions of Americans after they spent a lifetime of saving in their 401(k)s or IRAs? Not the man who putted at Mar-a-Lago as markets crashed.

But the retirees who took to the streets in huge numbers recently are losing sleep over running out of money. Many no longer get paychecks and must withdraw from retirement accounts shrinking in real time. They don’t have years to recover from a stock market in free fall that keeps going down because of Trump’s insane tariff gambit. If lawmakers fail to put more checks and balances on his expansive trade war, countless older Americans could be collateral damage.

It is everyday Americans rising up and refusing to cede liberty and justice for all to a callous lawbreaker — backed by the entire Republican Party — who is hellbent on destroying two and a half centuries of a world-changing democratic experiment between rounds of golf. I suspect the Ohioans who showed up in a big way last weekend, and their counterparts in other states, won’t be the last. The torch has been picked up. Generations have sacrificed too much to preserve what is in grave danger of perishing today.  
But the gathering protests in Ohio and America give hope that the unfinished pursuit of a more perfect union is ongoing and still remarkably robust.

Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare.
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state.
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.
More than 5M could lose Medicaid coverage if feds impose work requirements

States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets.
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state.
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.

8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

(Stock photo by Marco Piunti/Getty Images)Protecting children from online harm is a goal we all share, and there is no question that more needs to be done to keep them safe.
However, approaches like a current proposal in the Nebraska Legislature, the Age-Appropriate Online Design Code Act, bring a host of significant privacy concerns and could further expand the size and role of government, placing the government between the rights of parents and their children.
Changes like requiring age verification, as LB 504 does, threaten our most fundamental rights to free expression, risk exposing our data to cyber-attacks, and could lead to dangerous government censorship.
Database challenges
Forcing platforms like ours to collect identifying personal information on every single user imposes undue barriers to users’ exercise of constitutionally protected speech online.
This isn’t just inconvenient for users but is actively harmful to tech start-ups like ours as it suddenly forces us to maintain a massive database of sensitive information all in one place. That sort of database is ripe for theft by cybercriminals.
Moreover, it holds enormous and potentially disastrous consequences for free expression online: overly broad duty of care provisions would require any online platforms hosting user-submitted content to know the ages of every single user or risk litigation.
It is not hard to envision how this could pressure some platforms to remove or cease hosting user-submitted content to avoid liability exposure, casting a broad chilling effect on online speech and reducing the outlets users have for free expression online.
Risk of government overreach
Current kids’ online safety proposals aren’t just harmful. The government is expressly forbidden from making speech determinations under the First Amendment, for example, yet under these proposals would be determining what is and isn’t child-appropriate, a job for parents, not government.
Inserting government into that conversation threatens parental autonomy by depriving parents of the opportunity to choose what’s best for children, overstepping current regulations.
This new legislation would be burdensome to small businesses like ours. Moreover, there is no solid implementation framework in LB 504 to adequately address privacy concerns previously shared.
These regulations would likely stifle Nebraska’s growing Silicon Prairie, discouraging innovation and encouraging our best and brightest to leave for states with more reasonable rules.
At a time when it’s harder than ever to start a new business and brain drain continues to be one of our most pressing issues, we should be fostering an environment that creates technological advancements, particularly in artificial intelligence and digital security, that could improve online safety.
Parents know best
The right approach to child safety online is to put parents at the heart of this process and empower them to make the best decisions for their children. Only through education and parental empowerment can we make meaningful strides without depriving kids of crucial opportunities to learn and grow through interaction with the broader world online.
We should scale back heavy-handed regulations and promote a forward-thinking tech environment that positions Nebraska as a hub for innovation, free expression and the responsible development of emerging technologies.

Will Smith (D-Montgomery) about a package of immigrant protection bills Monday. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)After it was stalled for most of the day, a watered-down package of protections for Maryland’s immigrant community was rushed through by lawmakers with just minutes to spare before the midnight end of the legislative session Monday.
The version of House Bill 1222 that passed the House and Senate on mostly party-line votes includes language to help “sensitive locations” like churches and schools decide how to respond if immigration agent show, and it includes some privacy protections for migrant data.
What it does not include is language from the original House version of the bill that would require counties to work with federal immigration agencies in some respects, but would prohibit participation in so-called 287(g) agreements, in which local police can essentially act as immigration agents.
Migrant groups, who were at the State House all day monitoring the progress of the bills, said the 287(g) prohibition was their primary goal in the face of increased immigration enforcement by President Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security.
“It was shameful the way it went down. We knew what Trump was doing on immigration since day one,” said Ninfa Amador-Hernandez, policy analyst with the immigrant advocacy group CASA. “We’re seeing Democrats not act in protecting immigrant families.”
But with the clock ticking toward midnight Monday, Del. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s) said the legislature was at risk of failing to pass any protections, so House members agreed to give in to the Senate and strike out the prohibitions on 287(g) agreements.
U.S. Supreme Court pauses order to return wrongly deported Maryland man

“Sometimes having a pressure cooker of a deadline to move things – we were unsure if we would get it done anyway,” Lewis said. “We think it (the amended bill) is balanced.”
HB1222 initially prohibited Maryland counties from entering into 287(g) agreements to work cooperatively with agents of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That was the bill’s only function when it was introduced back in early February.
In the last-minute amendment, the bill includes language from another bill called the Sensitive Locations Act, which would require the Attorney General to “provide guidance to state agencies and others to rules regarding immigration enforcement,” said Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City), the chair of the House Judiciary Committee. The bill also prevents the sale of personal records and other data to third parties, he said, though the amendment text is not yet publicly available.
But Cathryn Jackson, policy director for CASA, said the prohibition on 287(g) agreements would have had the “greatest impact” for Maryland’s immigrant population.
“287g is such a direct funnel into the deportation machine. It is the most direct way that we are carrying out Trump’s agenda in Maryland,” Jackson said.
“I think it is extremely heartbreaking that the immigration bills have not been prioritized,” she said. “That is leaving the lives of so many people up to chance right now.”
CASA members are blaming the failure of 287(g) on the Senate, even though Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) had said earlier Monday that “there is a limit” to what states can do when it comes to immigration enforcement with the federal government.
“We are doing whatever we can in this time frame. The challenge is – it is the federal government and there is a limit to which we have the ability to impact,” Ferguson told reporters.
“I can’t even fathom the fear that a number of our neighbors are feeling because of what’s happening with the Trump administration,” he said. “It is fundamentally unbelievable that we’ve created this toxic environment around people who are investing in our communities, who are part of our workforce, our kids are in school together.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that the state would always cooperate with federal law enforcement, but disagrees with how the Trump administration is overstepping due process for immigration enforcement.
“We are never not going to cooperate with our federal partners to get violent criminals off of the streets – period, full stop,” Moore told reporters. “We have to make sure our communities are safe … I believe very deeply that you can both make sure you’re keeping your streets safe and also make sure you’re honoring the Constitution at the same time.”

Kennedy Jr.’s firing of public records staffers at federal health agencies undercuts his promise to deliver “radical transparency.” Win McNamee/Getty ImagesPublic access to government records that document the handling of illnesses, faulty products, and safety lapses at health facilities will slow after mass firings at the federal Department of Health and Human Services swept out staff members responsible for releasing records, according to transparency advocates and health experts.
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s layoffs across health agencies in recent days eliminated workers who handled Freedom of Information Act requests at the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cut FOIA staff at the FDA and the National Institutes of Health, said six current and former federal workers KFF Health News agreed not to name because they fear retaliation and are not authorized to speak to the press.
FOIA is a transparency law that guarantees public access to the inner workings of federal agencies by requiring officials to release government documents. The 1966 law is a crucial tool for law firms, advocates, businesses, journalists, and the general public. It has been used to hold officials accountable and uncover harm, corruption, and political meddling in policymaking.
At HHS, FOIA requests are used to obtain a litany of records, including detailed CDC information about large outbreaks of food and waterborne illnesses, and FDA inspection reports of facilities that make food, drugs, medical devices, and dental products.
Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the FOIA cuts would have “an enormous effect on patient safety” and are “antithetical” to Kennedy’s promise to bring “radical transparency” to federal health agencies.
“It is simply not possible to honorably make that claim while decimating the staff,” Lurie said. “Can we rely particularly on this government to be forthcoming about the number of cases in an outbreak? You need FOIA to be able to take the lid off of that.”
HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano declined to respond on the record to questions about the department’s plans for processing FOIA requests from the CDC, FDA, and NIH.
Gunita Singh, staff attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the FOIA layoffs were almost certain to further slow the release of public records, which often took months or years before the cuts.
“What we need to be doing is the opposite of what’s happening now: hiring more staff,” she said.
Many records are disclosed only in response to FOIA requests. For example, during the covid-19 pandemic, FOIA requests forced the FDA to release internal documents showing little evidence to support using hydroxychloroquine to treat covid, even though President Donald Trump heavily promoted the drug.
Scientific researchers have used the law to obtain clinical trial data to assess whether drugs are safe and effective, or to get more details about adverse events associated with drugs and medical devices. Lurie said obtaining more information about adverse events is particularly important in serving as a bulwark against cherry-picking data or manipulating what’s available online to spread disinformation about the safety of vaccines and other products.
All these efforts will be slowed by the purge of FOIA offices, said Michael Morisy, CEO of MuckRock, a nonprofit group that helps journalists and others file public records requests. Scientists will have less to study. Attorneys and advocates will struggle to build cases and fight for causes. Simply, Americans will know less about their government and the industries it regulates and be less able to hold them both to account.
“I think one thing we’ve learned is that if there’s less watchdogging over an issue, that issue gets worse,” Morisy said. “I really do think that we are going to see companies become more lax with food safety, companies become more lax with consumer safety.”
Thousands of pending FOIA requests are likely to be affected.
During fiscal 2024 — from October 2023 through September 2024 — the CDC, FDA, and NIH received more than 15,000 FOIA requests and provided at least some records in response to more than 10,000, according to HHS’ most recent annual FOIA report.
Those requests were submitted by university researchers, state governments, laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, animal rights groups, law firms, and news organizations, including KFF Health News. Records sought by law firms appear related to investigations of illnesses, outbreaks, drugs, medical devices, and products used by countless Americans.
Morisy and Singh said filling requests is more complicated than many realize, often requiring an in-depth understanding of complex agencies. That’s why it’s important to house FOIA staff within each agency rather than consolidate them.
“We are sacking the entire staff and sacking all of that knowledge,” Morisy said. “And I just don’t see how these things continue to function.”

Ben Barnes (D-Prince George's and Anne Arundel), right, responds to a question from House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) Monday on the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)It was one of the first issues to surface this year, and one of the last to be resolved, but lawmakers Monday approved compromise legislation to trim the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future while keeping much of the multiyear plan intact.
The Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act passed Monday evening on largely party-line votes in the House and Senate. It delays implementation of “collaborative time,” preserves funding for community schools and protects students in poverty, those in special education and those in classes for non-English speakers from any potential per pupil funding cuts.
“These are the students who really need help with the Blueprint. There is no pause, cut in funding whatsoever,” said Del. Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), chair of the Appropriations Committee who helped navigate the agreement through a conference committee between chambers last week.
The House voted 101-38 for House Bill 504 on Monday afternoon, and the Senate give the bill final approval a few hours later, on a 34-13 vote.
The final product struck a balance between the plan put forth by Gov. Wes Moore (D) in January, when the state was in the first throes of its fight to close a $3 billion budget gap for fiscal 2026, and a less-severe package proposed by House.
One major part of the agreement Monday deals with the implementation of “collaborative time,” which provides teachers more out-of-classroom time to plan and work with each other on various subjects and also assess student achievement. School systems are supposed to start implementing collaborative time next year.
House, Senate ratify budget compromise on final day

The Moore administration had proposed a four-year delay in the start of collaborative time, both for the savings and for practical reasons. State school leaders have said that to fully implement collaborative time, the state would need at least 12,000 teachers at a time when the state faces a teacher shortage.
The House wanted to keep next year’s implementation date. The House and Senate ultimately agreed to pause the policy requirement for collaborative time for three years, but keep the funding amount at $163 per student for next fiscal year. It would stay at that level until fiscal 2029, when it would jump to $334 per student.
Barnes said Monday evening that keeping the collaborative time funding for next fiscal year but deferring implementation should help local school leaders as they work on budgets for next school year.
Local school officials have continuously sought more flexibility in the implementation of the Blueprint, now in its third year.
Another compromise deals with the Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports, a part of the Blueprint plan that deals with mental health, behavioral and other wraparound services for students.
The governor proposed $130 million for fiscal 2026, but the House proposed cutting it to $40 million a year. The Senate held out for $70 million next year and $100 million a year thereafter, which was approved in the final bill.
Another provision dealt with community schools, which are buildings that receive concentration-of-poverty grants based on students who receive free and reduced-price meals.
One key priority the House was able to secure deals with any funds retained at a school system’s central office, money “must be used solely to support implementation at the school level.”
Paul Lemle, president of the state Maryland State Education Association, released a statement after the passage of the bill that gave it a mixed review.
“While there is a delay to increased funding dedicated for collaborative time implementation, the final bill is a significant improvement over where this conversation began in January,” Lemle said
“We were able to avoid the near-immediate, outsized cuts to expected funding for students in poverty and multilingual learners, in particular, and we protected the critical expansion of community schools and supports for students in concentrated poverty,” his statement said.

House Joint Resolution 25-1023 would direct the Legislature’s legal arm to sue over the constitutionality of the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights. It passed the House Finance Committee on a 7-6 vote on Monday night.
“TABOR is not sacred. The constitution is. When a state law breaks a system of government that the constitution was built to project, we have a duty to challenge it,” said resolution sponsor Rep. Sean Camacho, a Denver Democrat.

The resolution is sponsored by Camacho, Rep. Lorena Garcia of Adams County, Sen. Lindsey Daugherty of Arvada and Sen. Iman Jodeh of Aurora, all Democrats. It has over three dozen other Democrats signed on in support, including members of leadership in both chambers.
The litigation considered in the resolution would challenge TABOR in state district court on the basis that it limits Colorado’s functioning as a republican form of government as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.
“Can a state call itself a republican form of government if its elected representatives of the people are constitutionally barred from governing?” Camacho said. “Under TABOR, this legislature is prohibited from making critical fiscal policies … without launching a costly campaign, raising money and rolling the dice in an election cycle.”
A 2011 constitutional challenge to TABOR was dismissed in 2021 in federal court on technical grounds because the court determined the lawsuit had the wrong plaintiffs. Sponsors say the resolution would allow the courts to finally settle the question.
“The courts could come back and say TABOR is 100% constitutional and that would be fine too. But I think we have an obligation to figure out whether or not it is,” Camacho said.
More fiscal flexibility
Colorado voters approved TABOR in 1992. Broadly, it sets an annual cap on state spending determined by population and inflation. If the state collects more revenue than that cap, it must refund the money to taxpayers through a variety of mechanisms, such as temporary income tax reduction or flat check sent to taxpayers.
A recent forecast from the nonpartisan Legislative Council Staff predicts that the state will collect about $618 million over the cap set by TABOR in the 2026 fiscal year.
TABOR also requires voter approval for tax increases in the state. In 2023, for example, voters rejected a proposition that would have let the state keep more money than allowed under TABOR in order to fund a property tax rate cut.
But as the cost of some state programs, such as Medicaid, grow faster than consumer inflation, TABOR limits how much the state has left over to pay for non-mandatory programs. Democrats say it’s partially why the state faced a $1.2 billion budget hole this year, which will likely be filled by an array of program repeals and agency cuts.
“The point of this is to be able to have a more flexible fiscal policy in this state that allows us to be responsive to the needs of the community,” Garcia said. “That doesn’t mean extraction of more taxes, but it would mean being flexible with how we use the revenue we have.”
Rep. Bob Marshall, a Highlands Ranch Democrat, during the committee hearing questioned whether allowing a lawsuit would open up every citizen-referred initiative to litigation, such as the recently approved constitutional amendment to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution and another measure directing lawmakers to spend $350 million on law enforcement and public safety. Witnesses responded that court cases all stand on their own, so there wouldn’t be such unintended consequences.
People representing educational associations, health care organizations, left-leaning economic groups, former lawmakers and lawyers from the previous TABOR challenge case testified in support of the resolution. They repeatedly pointed out the unique nature of TABOR in Colorado, as no other state has such a system.
“Although TABOR has had decades of significant negative impacts on Colorado’s finances, similar proposals have surfaced in other states in the past decade. However, not one of those proposals was approved,” said Maggie Gómez, the Colorado state director for the State Innovation Exchange.”It’s obvious that other states don’t believe TABOR is a risk worth taking.”
The opposition primarily comprised individual citizens who argued that TABOR set limits on a growing government and allows voters to have a say in state spending.
“TABOR ensures government lives within its means and gives people the final say on tax increases,” said Hope Scheppelman, the former vice chair of the state’s Republican Party.
Republicans will likely uniformly oppose the resolution. It needs a simple majority in both chambers to pass. Democrats control strong majorities in the state House and Senate.
“TABOR is the protection of the taxpayer. When the government overtaxes you, they have to return the money back to your pocket,” said Rep. Ron Weinberg, a Loveland Republican. “This bill looks to overrun and override a basic transparency between government and the taxpayer.”
The resolution now heads to the full House for consideration.

Brian J. Feldman (D-Montgomery) on the floor of the Senate Monday, the last day of the 2025 General Assembly session. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The General Assembly’s energy package didn’t quite come down to the wire, but it was close.
With about 10 hours remaining in the 90-day legislative session, lawmakers gave final passage to a trio of energy reform bills focused on increasing the state’s power generation and curbing electricity and gas rate increases with new regulations for utilities.
The measures, backed by House and Senate leaders, come amid rising electricity costs for Marylanders. Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said Monday he is “very confident” that Gov. Wes Moore (D) will sign the bills.
“It’s probably the biggest investment in the energy marketplace here in Maryland to protect ratepayers — to protect Marylanders — in probably a decade or so,” Ferguson said after the bills cleared their final hurdle.
Republican senators renewed arguments that the legislation doesn’t do enough to lower bills — or encourage new gas-powered generation.
“We were tasked with something this year,” said Sen. Stephen S. Hershey (R- Upper Shore). “The General Assembly fell woefully short in trying to protect Maryland ratepayers.”
One part of the package is the “Legislative Energy Relief Refund,” which will send the average Maryland household about $80 worth of refunds next year, with one payment in the summer and another in the winter. The size of the refund will depend on a customer’s energy use.
House, Senate ratify budget compromise on final day

Hershey called the two $40 rebates “paltry,” and argued that they represent “overpayments from the policies that we created.”
The money is coming from “alternative compliance payments” made by utilities in lieu of complying with the state’s renewable energy laws, money that typically goes to energy efficiency projects like lighting upgrades or solar panel installation.
The cornerstone bill of the package, the Next Generation Energy Act (HB1035/SB937), began with a focus on increasing energy generation in the state. It eventually became the vehicle for a number of provisions lifted from other energy bills, however, including canceling renewable energy subsidies for trash incineration, requiring utilities to justify spending on new natural gas pipelines and a state procurement process for new nuclear energy.
The final version of the bill also incorporated House amendments to require that utilities demonstrate “customer benefits” in order to earn a multiyear rate plan, which lets companies set rate increases for several years at once. The Senate had simply required that the plan be in the public interest.
“These groundbreaking changes to utility regulation are a massive victory for all Marylanders,” said Emily Scarr, senior adviser at Maryland PIRG. “By reining in wasteful spending by BGE and other Maryland utilities, these new consumer protections will save Marylanders hundreds of millions of dollars.”
Other bills in the package created uniform standards for solar energy projects (HB1036/SB931) which proved controversial with Republicans, and established a state office focused on energy planning (HB1037/SB909)
Some environmental and ratepayer advocacy groups applauded passage of the package Monday.
In a news release Monday, Brittany Baker, Maryland director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said the finalized Next Generation bill “is significantly improved from the bill as introduced.”
CCAN and other environmental groups had originally opposed the Next Generation bill, amid fears that its “fast track” for new Maryland-generated power would grease the skids for natural gas burning power plants instead of renewable energy. Baker said the final bill “gives new gas next to nothing while giving battery storage specific, time-bound financial support.”
The bill sets a goal of 150 megawatts of battery storage, and requires utilities to submit plans for reaching their share of that goal.
The package does include an expedited permitting process for up to 10 “dispatchable” energy projects, which must meet certain criteria for dispatching energy to the grid when called upon, and must have a lower greenhouse gas profile than coal or oil. The bill requires that zero-emissions projects get the fast track over others at a ratio of 4-to-1.

Hershey argued Monday that the bill should have taken further steps to incentivize gas plants.
“Did we go far enough to really incentivize somebody to come in and make that investment? And a number of us are hearing: No, we really didn’t. We might have expedited the process, but we really didn’t,” Hershey said.
House amendments also sought to address concerns from environmental groups about loosened power plant permitting requirements. Environmental groups had expressed particular concerns about the bill shortening a preapplication period to 45 days, during which the new facility’s operator notifies the surrounding community before it files an application with the Public Service Commission to build the power facility.
Under the amended bill, if the power project is bound for an “overburdened and underserved” community, the preapplication period will be 90 days. Susan Miller, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, said she believes the 90-day rule should apply no matter what.
“All Marylanders deserve the same procedural protections, particularly when the Commission will be considering projects which will pollute their neighborhoods for the next 30 years or more,” Miller said in a statement.
GOP senators took issue with changes to the bill that they argue opens the door for data centers and other commercial facilities to secure one-on-one agreements for energy that are harmful to ratepayers. Unlike the Senate bill, the House bill allowed those contracts. But it stated that if they shift extra costs “inappropriately” onto ratepayers, regulators can compel the commercial customer to pay it back.
“The largest provider of electricity in the state now is subject to being …  able to go to one customer, one private-sector customer, and say: ‘We’re going to sell directly to you.’ Isn’t that a concern for ratepayers?” Hershey asked.
Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s) said the direct-power agreements are “not monolithic,” and the new provisions would give more flexibility to the Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities.
“This is seeking to find more of a middle ground and some flexibility, but with the guardrails that are there,” Augustine said. “But you’re absolutely right: There have been concerns about taking off baseload power from our grid.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0102-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-08 00:01:52.490954

Wes Moore needed to close a $3 billion gap. The plan approved by lawmakers Monday includes $2 billion in budget cuts and deferrals and $1.6 billion in new taxes. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Passing a budget took longer than usual this year. This time, however, it was ongoing federal budget cuts and a congressional debate over spending that dragged on and had fiscal leaders making corrections in real time.
The House and then the Senate on Monday ratified a conference committee agreement on a $67 billion overall spending plan for fiscal 2026 over the objections of Republican members, who could do little to stop the package.
The plan includes what supporters frame as budget cuts — holding vacant positions open and shifting costs to the counties plus other moves — and $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees, including two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on IT and data services.
“From the poor to the middle class, to the upper middle class,” Minority Leader Del Jason C. Buckel (R-Allegany) said. “I’m telling you that at the end of the day, this will be one of the worst votes that almost any of you will ever have taken – but we’re going to do it anyway.”
The House passed the budget 101-39, and the companion reconciliation bill, which contains the tax increases, 94-46.
The Senate followed the House, passing both bills by votes of 33-14 and 29-18, respectively.
All votes fell mostly, if not entirely, along party lines.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLESenate Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) said that the budget agreement “puts Maryland in a strong fiscal position in the face of the challenges ahead, protecting our shared values and priorities.”
But Senate Minority Whip Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll) said there was a “difference of viewpoint” in how the state should handle taxpayer money.
“There’s a difference of viewpoint here … between the idea that people give us their money, and we’re supposed to try to be good stewards of it,” Ready said, “And then there’s this attitude of … where the money is really, the government’s, and we’re going to decide how much we’re going to let people keep and how much you’re going to have.”
The overall budget for fiscal 2026 is just over 1% larger than the current year’s. The general fund budget — the portion for which the state directly taxes Maryland residents — is about $400 million smaller.
Even so, the Democratic supermajority passed a spending plan that included $1.6 billion in taxes and fees.
In addition to two new higher income tax brackets, there is some small tax relief. Lawmakers said 92% of taxpayers will see a refund or at least no increase in their income taxes.
“We’ve got to make sure we are reforming the tax code and not on the backs of middle-class families,” Gov. Wes Moore (D) told reporters Monday afternoon. “I want middle-class families to get a tax cut. Period and full stop. Anything that was not going to adjust on that was not going to be acceptable.”
For those who see a tax break, it will run between $50 and $65 on average.
Moore’s plan, as proposed in January, included a plan that promised to cut or at least not increase taxes for 60% of Marylanders. The average tax break on that plan was about $173.
The governor has not said if the final plan passed by lawmakers provides the breathing room for which he hoped.
Democrats praised the budget for resolving a projected $3 billion structural budget deficit for fiscal 2026. The plan is also said to have reduced a similar sized fiscal 2027 structural deficit to a manageable $300 million.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_5221-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-07 23:00:57.736477

Shoshana Chatfield, the U.S. representative to NATO’s Military Committee, was fired over the weekend, the Associated Press reported Monday.
Chatfield served as president of the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, from 2019 to 2023 and was the first woman to lead the college. Her promotion from rear admiral to vice admiral and assignment to NATO in Brussels, Belgium, had been held up for most of 2023 by Alabama’s Republican U.S. in protest of the Pentagon’s abortion policy.
The Pentagon did not confirm that Chatfield had been relieved of her duties. Her firing was first reported by Reuters, which confirmed that allies had been notified that Chatfield had been removed from her job.
Chatfield is the third top female officer to be fired since President Donald Trump took office amid a push to erase DEI programs and online content. Trump fired Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan the day after he was sworn in. In February, Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced he was firing the chief of naval operations, Adm. Lisa Franchetti.
“I want to see members of this team offer each other respect for differences, for diversity, for the dialogue from which ideas and collaboration emerge,” Chatfield told staff and faculty when she arrived at the War College in August 2019. “I want to see academic excellence. I want to see integrity in academics and in research.”
In a post on X, Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, said he was “deeply disturbed” by the firing of Chatfield, who is a combat veteran and helicopter pilot.
“Trump’s relentless attacks on our alliances and his careless dismissal of decorated military officials make us less safe and weaken our position across the world,” Warner said.
The War College has removed a “small amount” of online content after conducting a review to comply with the Digital Content Refresh memorandum sent out by Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Sean Parnell, said Lt. Cmdr. Pete Pagano, the college’s public affairs officer.
“Examples include social media posts about DoD monthly observances and videos of lectures focused on immutable characteristics such as race, ethnicity or sex,” Pagano said in an email. “None of the affected content was part of or related to our core curriculum.”

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he’s proud of Utah’s push to eliminate fluoride from drinking water, telling reporters he hopes other states follow suit. 
Kennedy spoke to a crowded room of journalists, lawmakers and health officials on Monday, part of a tour of Western states to promote his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda, known as MAHA. 
“If we want to be a moral nation, if we want to maintain our moral authority around the world, our chief obligation is to our children. And we’re letting them down. And I’m very, very happy that Utah is taking the lead in so many ways,” Kennedy said on Monday. “It makes no sense to have fluoride in our water. The evidence against fluoride is overwhelming … we know that it causes I.Q. loss.”

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch)
Fluoride is a mineral that has been shown to strengthen teeth by replacing minerals that are lost from acid breakdown, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A recent report from the National Toxicology Program found that high levels of fluoride in drinking water can be associated with a lower I.Q. in children — but according to the report, those levels are twice as high as the current recommended amount of fluoride. 
Kennedy spoke to several bills that align with the MAHA agenda, mostly focusing on HB81, the fluoride bill. Sponsored by Rep. Stephanie Gricius, R-Eagle Mountain, the bill prohibits municipalities from adding fluoride to drinking water, while adding it to the list of drugs that pharmacists can prescribe. 
Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz said that’s a “win-win” situation. 
“We want to make sure those options are there” for Utahns who want more fluoride than what’s available in toothpaste or mouthwash, said Schultz, R-Hooper, who spoke during Monday’s press conference. 
The bill received pushback from dentists and other health professionals, who say adding fluoride to drinking water has resulted in less cavities among children. That includes Dr. Sarah Woolsey, a family physician who told lawmakers during a legislative committee meeting that she saw a decrease in referrals for cavity extractions under anesthesia after Salt Lake County started to add fluoride to its water.
“Despite my efforts in education, in prescribing fluoride and working with parents, the voluntary application does not always work for those that may be most vulnerable,” said Woolsey. “And I would like to say that since fluoride has been in the water, the number of kids I send (to have teeth extracted) is significantly less.” 
The bill passed mostly along party lines, with a handful of Republicans joining Democrats in opposition. It was signed by the governor on March 27, and takes effect on May 7.

After the press conference on Monday, Kennedy told the Associated Press he will instruct the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending state and local governments add fluoride to drinking water. He also told the Associated Press he will set up a task force to look into the issue. 
Lee Zeldin, a former GOP congressman and the current head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the agency is going to review all the fluoride-related studies that came out since the National Toxicology Program report in 2024.     
“We’re prepared to act based on this science,” said Zeldin, who also spoke during the event on Monday. “Both the National Toxicology Program study, as well as other peer-reviewed studies. If this is as important as it is to Secretary Kennedy, if it’s important as it is, clearly to so many people who are here in this room and at this press conference today, then it is top of the list for the Environmental Protection Agency.”

Kennedy suggested Gricius’ bill could be a model for other states. 
“I’m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban (fluoride). I hope many more will come,” he said on Monday, echoing the argument from Utah lawmakers this session — that it’s an issue of bodily autonomy and freedom of choice.
“We shouldn’t be demanding that parents accept something in their children and homes that is essentially a medication. They can go to a drug store and get toothpaste,” Kennedy said. “I think it’s a moral imperative that we all believe in freedom of choice in this country, it’s one of the bedrock principles of our democracy.” 
Utah becomes the first state to ban adding fluoride to drinking water

Kennedy also touted two other bills passed by the legislature and signed by the governor. 
HB402, sponsored by Rep. Kristen Chevrier, R-Highland, bans public schools from using certain food dyes and other preservatives and additives — including potassium bromate and propylparaben — in food preparation. 
And HB403, also sponsored by Chevrier, restricts Utahns who receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — a federal program that subsidizes food purchases for low-income individuals — from buying soda. 
“We anticipate that this is the beginning of a cultural shift that will extend throughout the nation, a shift towards proactively building health rather than treating disease,” said Chevrier during the news conference Monday. 
Kennedy, former presidential candidate, environmental attorney, son of former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former president John F. Kennedy, was nominated to lead the country’s Department of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump. 
Kennedy has long promoted public health reform, healthy diets and alternative treatments to chronic diseases — some of his stances have been controversial, including skepticism around certain vaccines, advocating against fluoride in drinking water, and claims that COVID-19 impacts certain ethnic groups differently.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Permanent Fund, the No. 1 source of general-purpose revenue for state services and the Permanent Fund dividend, suffered a multibillion-dollar loss during last week’s stock market crash.
According to preliminary figures published by the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp., which manages the fund, the fund’s assets declined from $81.7 billion on Tuesday to $79.7 billion at the end of the day on Friday. Figures for Monday were not immediately available.
From Wednesday through Friday, the S&P 500, a leading American stock market, declined 10.5% as markets reacted to President Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs on most imported goods.
Paulyn Swanson, a spokesperson for the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp., said the Permanent Fund’s value declined by 2.7% during the same period.
Speaking last Thursday, APFC executive director Deven Mitchell noted that the fund is invested in a variety of assets, including real estate, bonds, private equity and gold, as well as publicly traded stocks. 
That means the Permanent Fund hasn’t performed as well as the S&P 500 in recent years, but during a downturn, it doesn’t suffer as much.
“In our public equity portfolio, we’ve had a tilt away from growth stocks and the S&P 500, which we’ve suffered under over the last two years, but now we’re benefiting from that tilt towards value. So in some ways … we’ll be making up ground relative to our benchmark,” he said, referring to a mix of investments that the corporation measures its performance against.
Since 2018, an annual transfer from the Permanent Fund to the state treasury has been largest source of general-purpose revenue for services and the dividend.
In the fiscal year that starts July 1, that transfer will be worth $3.9 billion. All of the state’s oil revenue combined is expected to be worth less than half that — $1.6 billion.
For the moment, money for the transfer is kept in the earnings reserve, a spendable account within the fund. As of Feb. 28, Swanson said, the earnings reserve contained $9.8 billion — enough for the upcoming transfer, an inflation-proofing payment, and part of the upcoming fiscal year 2027.
At that time, the earnings reserve also held $1.8 billion in unrealized gains — much of which may have been lost in the market slide.

The 2025 wildfire season is off to an early start in Alaska's coastal region. (Bureau of Land Management photo)The record-low snow conditions south of the Alaska Range have had big impacts across the state, especially around wildfire potential. In early March, the Iditarod had to move the race to the northern route, while the Alaska Division of Forestry & Fire Protection, or DOF, declared an early wildland fire season in its Coastal Region, requiring burn permits starting March 17 instead of the usual April 1. This region includes Southeast, Southcentral and Southwest Alaska. Find a map of the area here.
Even before the DOF order took effect or Jessie Holmes’s dog team crossed the finish line in Nome, two fires had already spread in the snow-free grasses of the Kenai Peninsula and Mat-Su Valley, confirming the early fire danger in Alaska’s most populous areas. The risk of human-caused fires has become evident, with at least 17 requiring a response as of April 4. Most were the result of negligent burning, emphasizing the critical importance of ensuring that burn piles are monitored, keeping fire tools on hand, and never leaving a fire unattended. 
While local, state, and federal fire managers prepare for an already active fire season, it is critical that Alaskans exercise caution with anything that could ignite a fire. We encourage homeowners to reduce wildfire hazards around your home by following Firewise principals.
Burning yard waste in a pile or barrel is a common spring chore for many homeowners, and in these extreme conditions, it is important to follow safe burning practices as outlined on the DOF Learn Before You Burn website https://dnr.alaska.gov/burn/ and on burn permits. Unsafe burning is a major contributor to wildfires, especially this time of year because dry, dead vegetation is exposed to the sun, creating a landscape primed for ignition that could quickly spread and endanger lives and property.
For an even safer option, consider disposing of yard waste at designated woody debris disposal sites operated by local municipalities, boroughs or state DOF offices. You can find a web app showing the disposal sites in Alaska here. 
As we head into spring, Alaskans should take extra precautions:

Be mindful when recreating on dry, exposed vegetation — one spark from an ATV, snowmachine, or chainsaw can start a fire.
Follow all burn permit requirements and restrictions. Do not burn on a windy day. If conditions continue to deteriorate, burn suspensions or closures may be necessary to protect lives and property.
If you see smoke or fire, report it immediately by calling 911 or 1-800-237-3633. Early detection can mean the difference between a small fire and a large-scale emergency.
Stay informed through information from your local government fire departments, emergency services, and wildland fire agencies through social media and online sources such as the Alaska Wildland Fire Information — akfireinfo.com — or the Alaska Interagency Coordination Center website. 

Years like this one, where the snow melts early, are more likely to result in above-average fire seasons, according to new research from the University of Alaska Fairbanks. While early snow-off does not guarantee a big season, Alaska’s spring  snowmelt now occurs nearly two weeks earlier than it did in the 1990s, contributing to long-term wildfire trends. Both tundra and boreal forest regions are experiencing larger, more frequent fires, with statewide impacts. 
The new Alaska’s Changing Wildfire Environment report summarizes what is known about how wildland fire in Alaska is changing. The report was compiled by the UAF Alaska Fire Science Consortium, with contributions from the Alaska wildfire management community.
By staying informed and taking precautions now, Alaskans can help reduce the risk of dangerous wildfires. Just as mushers adapt to unpredictable trail conditions, we must also adjust to Alaska’s changing fire landscape. The same lack of snow that forced the Iditarod north is fueling early fire activity in the south. While the Iditarod’s route may shift year to year, our responsibility to prevent wildfires remains constant.

(YouTube | Office of the Special Counsel)Former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, who led a widely derided review of the 2020 presidential election,  searching for evidence for baseless accusations of fraud, will have his law license suspended for three years, according to a stipulated agreement between him and the state Office of Lawyer Regulation (OLR). 
Law Forward, the progressive voting rights focused firm, filed a grievance against Gableman with the OLR in 2023. The OLR filed a complaint against Gableman in November that alleged, among other counts, that he had failed to “provide competent representation” and to “abstain from all offensive personality” and of violating attorney-client privilege.
The allegations against Gableman stemmed from his treatment of the mayors of Green Bay and Madison, whom he threatened with jail time during his review, false statements he made during testimony to legislative committees, violating the state’s open records laws, breaching his contract with Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and, when OLR began investigating him, “making false statements” to the investigators in an affidavit. 
As part of the stipulated agreement, Gableman admitted that “he cannot successfully defend against the allegations of misconduct … and agrees that the allegations of the complaint provide an adequate factual basis in the record.” 
In a statement, Law Forward’s general counsel Jeff Mandel said that Gableman’s actions “were and continue to be a threat to our democracy and the rule of law.” 
“Our justice system can work only if everyone plays by the rules,” Mandell said. “Two years and one month after Law Forward first filed a grievance with the Office of Lawyer Regulation explaining how Gableman’s unethical behavior did lasting damage to the public’s faith in elections, we are glad to see consequences for those who plan and promote overturning the will of the people.”
“Gableman violated his sworn duty to uphold both the U.S. and the Wisconsin constitutions and his obligations as an attorney,” Mandell continued. “He broke more rules than he followed, acting with complete indifference to election law, procedural norms, and the ethical obligations that bind attorneys. With this deal, Gableman stipulates that he misled courts, lied in public meetings, and violated government transparency laws.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-2.07.50-PM-1024x501.png,,,2025-04-07 21:00:52.538877

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The House Finance Committee stripped $1.25 million in school safety funding, saying that counties have millions of dollars in excess funds to pay for things like weapon detection systems and secure front entries. 
School leaders have told lawmakers that they don’t have $258 million needed for school safety upgrades.
While there’s been an uptick in school threats in West Virginia, a state education department report last year showed 272 schools still don’t have safe school entries — also known as mantraps — that include two interlocking doors and a control system. 
“We’ve been blessed that we haven’t had an incident, but that doesn’t mean necessarily there won’t be,” said Mickey Blackwell, executive director of the Association of Elementary and Middle School Principals. “It’s very disappointing to think that at any time we would say we need less money for children’s safety.”
The House of Delegates and Senate have proposed millions of dollars in school safety funding in their respective budgets for fiscal year 2026, and the budget bills are currently in negotiations as the Legislature winds down in its final week.
The House Committee on Finance Monday morning removed an appropriation of $1.25 million in House Bill 3369 that was for school safety measures and to be used by the end of the current fiscal year, according to the original measure. The funding was requested by Gov. Patrick Morrisey. 
  Del. Clay Riley, R-Harrison
Del. Clay Riley, vice chairman of the committee, said lawmakers heard testimony that the county school board have unencumbered assets of $784 million. 
“Now, they need to keep some of that back for reserve, but I don’t think this modification … will impact the ability to provide safe schools. There’s money in the county, and therefore I’m going to support it,” said Riley, R-Harrison. 
Del. Joe Statler, R-Monongalia, said counties keep asking lawmakers for additional funds instead of taking care of their safety upgrades.
“I wanted it to be noted that if you look, they’ve got some pretty healthy war chests in some of these counties that could be addressing some of these safety concerns,” he said. “I just want that to be known out there that this is something that needs to be addressed.”
School finances are in trouble due to the state’s declining population and students exiting public schools to use the state’s education voucher program, the Hope Scholarship. Counties’ financial contributions to schools — levies, taxes and more — haven’t been able to cover the bulk of safety needs.
The state school board declined to comment.
A spokesperson for Morrisey told West Virginia Watch, “Budget negotiations are ongoing and Gov. Morrisey is ready to work with the House and Senate to pass a balanced budget that funds his priorities and supports the needs of West Virginians.”
Dale Lee, president of the West Virginia Education Association, said the number of school Reduction in Force notifications across the state show that counties don’t have excess funds. 
“Many of our counties face financial difficulties,” he said. “There may be a few counties that have some money for that, but I would venture to say a large majority of our counties don’t have the funds to sustain … You can’t put a price on our student safety.”
Blackwell added, “I’ve never heard anyone say that, ‘We have extra money to waste on school safety.’ Most of our counties are working very hard to break even.”
The bill now only appropriates nearly $600,000 in a surplus fund that counties or charter schools could access should student enrollment exceed estimates. 
Lawmakers are advancing other measures aimed at school safety, like House Bill 2164, sponsored by Statler, that would allow public and charter schools, along with private and religious schools, to employ school safety officers. The SSOs must be former law enforcement officers and may carry firearms; they could detain but not arrest a suspect, according to the legislation. 
Some researchers have said that an investment in student support services, including counselors and social workers, is what will ultimately increase school safety. A measure, House Bill 3209, also sponsored by Statler, would require counties to employ at least one school counselor for every 250-300 students in elementary school and 400-450 students in high schools. 
House Bill 2187, which would have allowed public school teachers to carry concealed firearms, remains parked in the House Judiciary Committee. The legislation was meant to bolster school safety.

,DC,2025-04-08 00:27:31+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Supreme Court permits Trump to use wartime law for deportations, for now and with limits",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/supreme-court-permits-trump-use-wartime-law-deportations-now-and-limits,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court Monday said the Trump administration could continue for now to use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to carry out rapid deportations of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members — but they must be given a chance to challenge their deportations in court.The 5-4 decision, which lifted a temporary restraining order by a District of Columbia federal judge, will allow the Trump administration to deport Venezuelans 14 and older who are suspected of Tren de Aragua gang ties, in a victory for the administration of President Donald Trump.But those immigrants who are subject to the wartime law must have ""reasonable notice” in order to challenge their deportation in court “before such removal occurs,” according to the order. The question is which court.The order argues that the venue of the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia is wrong, and that the challenge, which was originally brought by five men in Texas, should be made in the Lone Star State. The challenge is no longer brought by five men and is now a class action.“The detainees seek equitable relief against the implementation of the Proclamation and against their removal under the (Alien Enemies Act),” according to the Supreme Court. “They challenge the Government’s interpretation of the Act and assert that they do not fall within the category of removable alien enemies. But we do not reach those arguments.”The president praised the decision, which did not address the merits of the actual law, on social media.“The Supreme Court has upheld the Rule of Law in our Nation by allowing a President, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself,” Trump wrote. “A GREAT DAY FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA!”Dissenting justicesThe three liberal justices dissented: Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. The fourth dissent, in part, came from Amy Coney Barrett, who is considered a member of the court’s six-justice conservative majority.“The Court’s legal conclusion is suspect,” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.She added that the majority opinion did not note the harm that could come to the Venezuelans who could face deportation under the Alien Enemies Act. Already, 238 men have been subject to the proclamation and are currently in a brutal mega-prison in El Salvador, the Terrorist Confinement Center  or CECOT.“It does so without mention of the grave harm Plaintiffs will face if they are erroneously removed to El Salvador or regard for the Government’s attempts to subvert the judicial process throughout this litigation,” she said. “Because the Court should not reward the Government’s efforts to erode the rule of law with discretionary equitable relief, I respectfully dissent.”There is a preliminary injunction hearing against the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act Tuesday at 3 p.m. Eastern before U.S. District Court Judge James E. Boasberg. That hearing deals with the administration’s use of the law.This was the second decision from the high court Monday that sided with the Trump administration.Earlier, Chief Justice John Roberts decided to temporarily pause a lower court’s order to require the Trump administration to return to the United States a Maryland man wrongly deported to a prison in El Salvador.Appeal to the high courtThe Trump administration March 28 appealed to the Supreme Court after an appeals court declined to do away with the temporary restraining order placed by Boasberg.Boasberg had extended his temporary restraining order until April 12 to prevent any more deportations of Venezuelan nationals, invoked by Trump with a presidential proclamation on March 14.The American Civil Liberties Union brought the suit against the Trump administration’s use of the wartime law. The legal organization asked the Supreme Court to keep the temporary restraining order in place because “it is becoming increasingly clear that many (perhaps most) of the men” who were on the March 15 deportation flights to the prison in El Salvador “were not actually members of” the Tren de Aragua and were “erroneously listed” due to their tattoos.The same day that Boasberg issued his restraining order, on March 15, three deportation flights landed in El Salvador, where 261 men were taken to the mega-prison.Boasberg has vowed to determine if the Trump administration violated his restraining order by asking for flight details but the Department of Justice has invoked the so-called “state secrets privilege"" to block any information.",,,,2025-04-07 21:00:52.538877

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)For the 21 members of the Senate who voted against House Bill 655, Sen. Theresa Manzella had a very specific message.
“To those of you who are in opposition to it, I’m sorry,” Manzella, a Republican from Hamilton said. “I wish you knew the Jesus Christ that I know, because he would never abandon, or abuse, or hurt children.”
At the heart of a fiery debate on Monday was whether the state’s foster care system discounts families with strong religious beliefs. However, other lawmakers worried that foisting strong or different religious beliefs on foster children could create more trauma or instability.
The bill was brought by Rep. Greg Oblander, R-Billings, and carried by Manzella, and it seeks to change laws regarding foster care and adoption services. The bill passed a second reading, 29-21. The legislation’s stated intention is “prohibiting discriminatory action” to potential foster parents or those interested in adoption.
Proponents of the bill said it would open up more opportunities for children to be fostered or adopted, and the Montana Family Foundation testified some state-sponsored training for foster parents did not fit into some people’s religious beliefs. Opponents said it could impress religious beliefs onto adopted and foster children, with references to the country’s Native American boarding school era.
It drew lengthy and, at times, furious emotional debate. Multiple legislators — including Sens. Jonathan Windy Boy, D-Box Elder, and John Fuller, R-Kalispell — stood to speak on the bill and amendment several times.
Windy Boy, a member of the Rocky Boy’s Chippewa-Cree tribe,  stood three times on the bill itself after speaking during an amendment. Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvary, R-Billings, shut Windy Boy down when he tried to speak on the floor for a third time. Senate rules allowed two opportunities to stand and speak on an item.
“I’m not going to apologize for standing more than twice,” Windy Boy had said moments prior. “That’s what my constituents sent me here to do.”
Windy Boy’s opposition to the bill included references to religious run boarding schools, one of the darkest periods of American history. Thousands of Indigenous children were sent to Christian-run boarding schools to be “assimilated” in white culture. More than 3,000 children died at these schools, according to a 2024 report in the Washington Post. The federal government also commissioned a report released in 2024 on boarding schools. Some of those children were sexually abused, including in Montana.
“A lot of those kids had no choices,” Windy Boy said on the floor. “The parents had no choices. But yet, at the same time, those kids were spanked, they were abused, mental abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse. Is that the kind of system that we’re going to continue pushing into this era? I should hope not.”
An amendment from Sen. Cora Neumann, D-Bozeman, sought to take some of the teeth out of the legislation, removing foster care. Neumann presented it as strictly as a reunification ideal — essentially foster children should be placed in culturally appropriate situations.
“It’s taking foster care out just to make sure that birth parents and families, that their beliefs are able to be held intact in case of reunification,” Neumann said. “I believe everyone here supports reunification of families wherever possible.”
Some Senate Republicans appeared to view both the amendment as well as some statements made on the floor to be a full-throated attack on Christianity.
“It’s very clear what’s going on here,” Fuller said. “This is a secular attempt to deny people of faith, of any kind, of being involved in the foster care system.”
Sen. Dennis Lenz said there was “an illusion” religion had a “negative impact.” 
“If your car breaks down in the middle of the inner city in the dark of the night, and you have a mile back to home and a group of 20-year-olds is coming to you out of the dark, wouldn’t it make a difference if they’re coming from the Bible study?” said Lenz, a Republican from Billings. “Most likely.”
The Senate was under “pressure” to pass the bill, Sen. Ellie Boldman, D-Missoula said on the floor. Some of that pressure was from the Montana Family Foundation, Boldman said in a text message, and one of the organization’s lobbyists, Derek Oestreicher, was seated on a bench Monday in the Senate gallery.
Oestreicher also provided testimony during the bill’s Senate Judiciary hearing. He said during the bill’s hearing that his organization had heard from religious families they would choose their faith over fostering.
“Montana Family Foundation was contacted by two separate families over the past year related to some of the required training that the state requires for foster families to undergo, and it discussed LGBTQ issues and how to address those issues,” Oestreicher said. “And these families were concerned that this was a required training, and they weren’t necessarily required to say they were an ally or that they would take a certain action with regard to LGBT issues, but it trended toward that, and it made them feel very uncomfortable.”
Sen. Carl Glimm, R-Kila, said he supported the bill and that it was “academic” for him having gone through the process, though it wasn’t clear if he meant fostering or adoption.
But he then went on to say for him, there was no prejudice against his Lutheran faith.
“I’ve done it,” Glimm said, “In my process, I wasn’t discriminated against for my religious views.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BibleStockPhoto-1024x784.jpg,,,2025-04-07 21:00:52.538877

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Senators sent legislation on Iowa’s elections to Gov. Kim Reynolds’ desk Monday that included provisions on verifying Iowa voters’ citizenship status.
The Senate also passed bills addressing the governor’s math instruction proposal, vaccines for a sexually transmitted virus, fireworks and the minimum age for firearm possession.
House File 954, passed 32-15, was a bill proposed by Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate that would allow the Secretary of State’s office to contract with federal and state agencies, and with private entities, for voter roll verification and maintenance.
The bill also laid out steps for setting a voter’s registration status as “unconfirmed” in cases where the state registrar or a county commissioner “has received information from a reliable source indicating that the registered voter is not qualified.” A “unconfirmed” voter’s status would be changed to “active” after they provide proof that they are qualified to vote under the legislation.
The bill also allows for a voter to be challenged at the polls over their citizenship status. A challenged voter is allowed to present precinct election officials evidence or facts to prove they are qualified to vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn after this procedure, the voter would cast a provisional ballot.

While Pate and Republican lawmakers said these measures would prevent non-U.S. citizens from illegally participating in Iowa elections, Democrats said the measure could lead to discrimination at Iowa polls. Sen. Matt Blake, D-Urbandale, said he was concerned about allowing challenges on the basis of citizenship at the polls.
He said that these challenges can be brought by third-party poll watchers, who would have the ability to challenge the qualifications of any voter they feel could potentially be a noncitizen. Curing the ballot in these cases could be more difficult than other challenges allowed at the polls to a person’s age or residence, Blake said.
“The characteristics of trying to prove citizenship at the polls is different than residency and other factors that are currently questions that can be asked,” Blake said. “You may have a driver’s license that’s updated that proves where you live. You may have your bill in the car related to that you live in a particular spot. Adding the question of whether somebody is a citizen requires a whole set of documents that — I don’t know, I don’t carry around my birth certificate.”
These changes were proposed following Pate’s guidance to county auditors ahead of the 2024 general election to challenge the ballots of of 2,176 voters identified as “potential noncitizens” based on state information. In March, Pate said of the 2,176 individuals on the list, 277 were confirmed to not be U.S. citizens, and 35 noncitizens cast ballots in Iowa that were counted in Nov. 5, 2024 election.
Blake and other Democrats said the small number of people on Pate’s list of potential noncitizens — and a smaller percentage of the overall number of Iowans who participated in the 2024 general election — showed that the measure was unnecessarily making it more difficult for Iowans to vote while raising mistrust in the state’s elections.
But Sen. Ken Rozenboom, R-Oskaloosa, the bill’s floor manager, said the fact that there were any noncitizens who participated in Iowa’s elections showed the need for the measure.
“Do you hear yourself? Do you hear yourself?” Rozenboom said. “Only 40 noncitizens voted in last year’s election in Iowa, and only 35 of those were counted. As a state that has a long history of conducting elections that provide timely voting results that are widely trusted, in order to maintain the integrity of our system, it’s important that we update our election laws as conditions and challenges change. … We’ve had elections in Iowa for congressional races decided by seven votes and legislative races, recently have been very close. This bill provides more tools for our elections officials to use to maintain that long standing tradition of integrity of Iowa’s election process.”
The bill also included a ban on ranked choice voting. Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, introduced an amendment, which failed, to allow local governments to conduct elections using ranked choice voting. The voting method, also known as instant runoff voting, has voters order candidates on a ballot from their first to last choice, with a candidate winning if they receive the majority of first-choice voters. If there is not a clear winner, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, and voters who chose that candidate as their first choice have their votes redistributed to their second choice — a process which repeats until one candidate wins the majority of votes.
Other Senate action
The election bill was just one of several measures passed by lawmakers in the Senate on their first day of debate since the second funnel deadline. Other bills passed Monday include:
Mathematics instruction: Senators approved House File 784 in a 46-1 vote, sending it to Reynolds. The bill is the governor’s proposal seeking to improve Iowa students’ mathematics aptitude after the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) found mathematics scores decreased for both fourth and eighth graders. The legislation would require Iowa schools to assess K-6 students’ math skills at least three times a year. If students are deemed “persistently at risk,” schools would be required to implement a personalized mathematics plan for the student, alongside other intervention strategies, to help the child reach grade-standard proficiency.
The Iowa Department of Education would also be required by the bill to develop and distribute a comprehensive mathematics plan to Iowa schools to increase math proficiency, and provide mathematics instructional aid for teachers and parents.
Reynolds released a statement Monday celebrating the bill’s passage.
“One of the greatest predictors of future success in the classroom and workplace, along with early literacy, is mathematics competency,” Reynolds said in a statement. “At an early age we need to identify children who are not yet proficient in math and ensure they receive the personalized help they need to build a strong foundation. We will support our teachers with evidence-based professional development and ensure all students receive math instruction in the way we know it works.”
 Vaccination of minors for sexually transmitted diseases: Senate File 304 would remove a current exemption in Iowa law allowing minors to consent to receive vaccinations for sexually transmitted infections, like the HPV vaccine, without their parent’s permission. Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, said the bill would prevent children from accessing a vaccination that can prevent cancers caused by human papillomavirus infections. She also said the measure does not acknowledge the fact that minors who are seeking this vaccination may be the victims of child sex abuse.
“The truth is, more children in Iowa are survivors of child sex abuse than any one of us want to believe, and oftentimes, that abuse is occurring in the very house where they’re being raised,” Petersen said. “This legislation puts these kids at an increased risk by potentially putting the decision on whether or not they can do anything to protect their body … in the hands of someone who is raping them.”
Sen. Sandy Salmon, R-Janesville, said the bill only applies to vaccinations, and does not change other sections of Iowa law that allows minors to receive medical care related to the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of sexually transmitted diseases or infections without their parents or guardians’ consent.
Fireworks: Senate File 303, a bill passed 31-16 after it was deferred by lawmakers in March, would prohibit county boards of supervisors and city councils from placing restrictions on the use of fireworks on July 3, 4 and Dec. 31 outside of existing restrictions in Iowa Code on fireworks. Local governments would still be allowed to set restrictions on fireworks for other days.
“This is a simple bill about freedom in order to ensure that Iowans will be able to truly celebrate in the grand American tradition of fireworks on our holidays,” Sen. Cherielynn Westrich, R-Ottumwa, said.
Minimum age for acquiring firearms: House File 924, sent to the governor with a 33-14 vote, lowers the minimum age for possessing and carrying a firearm, and for permitting, from age 21 to age 18. The measure still sets the age limit at 21 and older for permits to acquire a handgun.
Sen. Scott Webster, R-Bettendorf, said the bill was prompted by the U.S. Eight Circuit Court of Appeals decision that found a Minnesota law limiting firearm permits to people age 21 and older was unconstitutional. He also said he supported the measure as a way to ensure Iowans between the ages of 18 to 20 have access to their constitutional rights.
“As a father of an 18-year-old … I believe that my daughter has the constitutional right to be able to defend herself, no different than anybody else,” Webster said. “She’s 18 years old. She’s an adult, she can vote. She has that right.”

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)With less than a week to go during the West Virginia Legislature’s regular session, a Senate committee on Monday resurrected legislation that would loosen the state’s strict school vaccination laws. 
The Senate Health Committee approved a version of House Bill 2776 that incorporates the language of Senate Bill 460 with slight changes. The House of Delegates narrowly voted down Senate Bill 460 last month. 
As it passed the House of Delegates, House Bill 2776 would have required that the state Department of Health report positive tests of Alpha-gal syndrome, an allergic condition related to tick bites, to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
HB 2776 S HHR S&I 4-7
The Senate Health Committee’s version of the bill now would add religious exemptions to the state’s vaccine requirements and allow a student’s health care provider to submit a medical exemption without needing approval from the state immunization officer, which would be eliminated under the bill. 
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, argued that the amendment is not germane to the original bill and could violate a constitutional rule that requires that bills have one subject. 
Committee Chair Laura Chapman, who had advocated for religious vaccine exemptions, ruled that the amendment is germane because the bill has to do with disease prevention and the state’s public health system.
Garcia opposed the amendment, saying that he had heard more negative opinions about Senate Bill 460 than anything else this legislative session. 
“After that 42 to 56 vote rejecting this bill in the West Virginia House of Delegates, my hope would be maybe the people around this table and the people in the Senate would take a second look,” Garcia said. “Because this is one of the most hugely unpopular and just honestly wrong things that we could be doing for the state of West Virginia.” 
Sen. Tom Takubo, R-Kanawha, a physician, also argued against the amendment, with comments about a growing measles outbreak in Texas that has so far been linked to the deaths of two children, and other preventable illnesses. 
“There’s an adage in medicine, ‘First, do no harm.’ There’s so much in today’s world that these kids have to worry about. Dying and struggling from these completely preventable childhood diseases shouldn’t be one of them,” Takubo said. “This Legislature is dead set on putting our kids in harm’s way. 
“If we do what this bill is trying to do, we’re going to go from one of the best [vaccinated] to one of the worst in just a matter of years,” he said. “We’re the worst vaccinated state in the country until it’s time to go to school. Then we become one of the best.”
Under the new version of the bill, parents and guardians or emancipated students could annually submit a notarized statement to their school or child care center administrator on a form created by the state department of health that says the person holds a religious belief that is opposed to vaccination and that they have reviewed information about vaccinations provided by the department. There’s also an exemption for full-time virtual students. 
Schools would be required to create and maintain reports including the number and percentage of students granted exemptions. 
The bill, in its current version, would not allow the state’s religious and private schools to set their own policies for vaccination requirements.  
All states require students to be vaccinated for a series of infectious diseases including measles, polio and chickenpox. Until this year, West Virginia was among five states that did not allow exemptions to those requirements based on religious or philosophical beliefs. The state’s laws have only allowed medical exemptions, which have required the approval of the state’s immunization officer. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January requiring the state to allow religious exemptions on his second day in office. 
According to the state Department of Health, the state approved 186 religious exemptions in the approximately two months after Morrisey’s executive order. 
The bill will next go to the full Senate for three readings and then a vote. The House of Delegates would next have to sign off on the bill, a version of which it’s already voted down. The regular session of the Legislature ends Saturday at midnight.

By a 27-6 vote, with the 10 Democrats evenly split and all but one Republican in favor, the bill now heads back to the House, where its sponsor, Republican state Rep. [&#8230;]","The Missouri Capitol in Jefferson City (Tessa Weinberg/Missouri Independent).The Missouri Senate approved a proposed tax cut Monday despite questions about whether official estimates truly reflect how much it would reduce state revenue.
By a 27-6 vote, with the 10 Democrats evenly split and all but one Republican in favor, the bill now heads back to the House, where its sponsor, Republican state Rep. Chad Perkins of Bowling Green, intends to bring it to a final vote.
Earlier in the afternoon, the cost estimate for the bill exempting long-term capital gains — profits from property held more than a year — was approved by a party-line vote in the Senate Fiscal Oversight Committee.
The bill would also increase income limits and credit amounts for the property tax relief program known as “circuit breaker” as well as exempt diapers and feminine hygiene products from sales tax. Overall, the fiscal note for the bill states it is expected to reduce state revenue by almost $430 million in the fiscal year that starts July 1 and about $350 million annually thereafter.
Democrats who voted against the bill said they were concerned about estimates from a left-leaning Washington tax institute, reported by The Independent, that the capital gains cut could reduce state general revenue by $600 million or more compared to the official estimate of $111 million.
Missouri lawmakers set to pass capital gains tax cut with questions about its total cost

The committee vote came after Democrats peppered state Department of Revenue economist Jean Hancock with questions about the wide difference in the estimates.
“My question would be how can we be off by half a billion dollars?” Senate Democratic Leader Doug Beck of Affton asked.
The institute’s estimate is based on IRS data from 2022 that showed $13.3 billion in long-term capital gains reported on returns from Missouri. Using the state’s top tax rate of 4.7%, applied to taxable income more than $8,911, the institute estimated the revenue from that much income would be about $625 million.
That is simple math that does not account for the other elements of Missouri’s tax code, Hancock told the committee.
“We actually pull every single person’s return in our model, and we run them and we pull out exactly what was claimed,” Hancock said.”So that’s where our numbers come from. Whoever has something else. I don’t know where they get them.”
In an interview after the hearing, Hancock said there are a number of deductions allowed in Missouri law that reduce income below the amounts reported on federal returns. All income from Social Security payments and much of the income from pension benefits is not taxed, she noted, and many high-income earners purchase tax credits that eliminate part or all of their tax liability.
Another reason the institute’s estimate is off, Hancock argued, is because not all capital gains reported on a return from Missouri are taxable in Missouri. A capital gain for property located in another state, for example, would not result in a Missouri tax payment.
“The capital gains numbers we’re providing are the ones that we believe are accurate,” Hancock said to the committee.
Beck voted against the bill in committee and for it when it reached the floor.
Under the bill, which Gov. Mike Kehoe has said is a priority for his first year in office, the capital gains exemption would take effect immediately for individual income tax filers and after revenue triggers are met for corporate income taxes. 
The circuit breaker is a refundable tax credit allowed for lower-income people over age 65 and those with disabilities to offset property taxes for their home. It is available to people who rent and people who own their own home.
Because it is refundable, people eligible for a credit that exceeds their tax liability receive a check for the difference.
The circuit breaker changes would increase the maximum credit for renters to $1,055. For homeowners, the maximum credit would be increased to $1,550. It would also increase the income limits for claiming the credit, to $38,200 for renters and $41,000 for homeowners, with slightly higher amounts allowed for married couples claiming the credit.
With revenues falling in the current year and a budget plan that uses about $1 billion of accumulated surpluses, some Democrats are opposing all tax cuts.
“I am just very, very concerned about how we continue to reduce state revenue,” said state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern of Kansas City, who voted against the bill, “and the impact that that’s going to have moving forward.”

Across the Ohio border, over a dozen people have contracted the highly infectious virus — including one most recently in Allen County, Ohio. Neighboring Kentucky has also reported a small number of cases.
As of April 3, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported a total of 607 confirmed cases in 22 jurisdictions across the United States, though the risk to the general public is low.
Because measles is so easily spread, a single case is considered an outbreak, the state health agency said. When infected people sneeze or cough, droplets spray into the air. Those droplets remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours.
More than 93% of people who receive a single dose of MMR will develop immunity to measles, and more than 97 percent will be protected after receiving a second dose. Two doses of the vaccine are needed to be fully protected. Individuals are encouraged to check with their healthcare providers to ensure vaccinations are up to date. Individuals born before 1957 are presumed to be immune to measles.
Children are routinely vaccinated for measles at 12-15 months, and again at 4-6 years of age before going to kindergarten. Children as young as 6 months old can receive the measles vaccine if they are at risk.
Symptoms
Measles begins with a fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes roughly seven to 14 days after exposure, though symptoms can emerge up to three weeks later. Fevers can reach up to 105 degrees but one of the earliest signs are Koplik spots, or tiny white bumps inside of the mouth.
Following that, a rash may form along the hairline and on the face before spreading down the back and torso and to the limbs. After about five days, the rash typically fades in the same order.
What you can do
The state health department urges Hoosiers experiencing symptoms to stay home and call their health provider before going to the doctor’s office. Those with the measles should stay home and away from others, especially vulnerable populations like unvaccinated infants, people who are immunocompromised and pregnant women.

Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, questions a bill that would abolish the State Library Board and the Educational Television Commission. Photographed Feb. 13, 2025. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)A bill that clarifies aspects of Arkansas’ public meetings law is heading to the governor’s desk after it again passed the Senate by a wide margin on Monday.
The bill specifies what members of city councils, quorum courts or school boards could discuss outside of a public meeting and would also allow a court to nullify any decisions made by a public body if it was in violation of open meetings laws.
Senate Bill 227, sponsored by Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, had already passed the Senate once, but the addition of co-sponsors when it was being considered in the House required another vote by the upper chamber. 
Senators voted 34-1 in favor of passage; more senators voted yes in the second vote, including Sen. Alan Clark, who voted against Tucker’s bill when it first passed the Senate last month. Clark introduced his own amendments to the state’s Freedom of Information Act that would have defined a public meeting as “more than two” members of a public body – a change from the current status quo. That bill, Senate Bill 376, has been waiting to be heard in the House State Agencies and Governmental Affairs committee, and Clark voted against Tucker’s bill the first time it went before the chamber.
Only Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, voted no during Monday’s vote.
The current FOIA does not define the number of people needed for a meeting to qualify as public, but has generally been interpreted to mean a meeting where at least two members of a governing body get together. Tucker’s bill, if signed into law, would make that more explicit.
Tucker’s bill has support from FOIA advocates around the state. The president of the Arkansas Press Association, Andrew Bagley, called Tucker’s bill “a very good piece of legislation” during a committee meeting March 12.
The Arkansas Freedom of Information Act gives Arkansans broad access to public records, such as emails sent between state officials and documents used in the course of government action. The law also establishes access to public meetings by members of the public, although the vague language governing this access has led to multiple instances of litigation as local governments ran afoul of the sunshine provisions.

Chris Brown, a Kansas City Republican, speaks in the House in February (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).The Missouri House passed a bill Monday that would establish a fund to pay for hyperbaric oxygen therapy for veterans with a traumatic brain injury and facing post-traumatic stress disorder to help prevent suicide and opioid addiction.
The House passed the bill with a 156 to 1 vote.
“The bottom line is, there are too many veterans that are taking their lives,”  said state Rep. Chris Brown, a Republican from Kansas City sponsoring the legislation. “They don’t see a way out. They can’t deal with it. And I think the oxygen therapy certainly will help and maybe even is the answer.”
The legislation will now head to the Senate, where lawmakers are considering a companion bill sponsored by state Sen. Rick Brattin, a Republican from Harrisonville.
According to the Mayo Clinic, the goal of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is to get more oxygen to tissues damaged by disease, injury or other factors. Patients enter a hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber, where the air pressure is increased up to three times higher than normal air pressure. The lungs can gather much more oxygen than would be possible breathing pure oxygen at normal air pressure.
The bill directs the Missouri Veterans Commission to compile an annual report with data about the treatment of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and its effectiveness.
“This is a great moment that the bill made it to the Senate,” said Dale Lutzen, a retired senior master sergeant from the U.S. Air Force and a legislative advocate for the non-profit TreatNOW. 
Lutzen told lawmakers in a committee hearing in January that veterans with traumatic brain injuries or PTSD are typically given prescription drugs that treat symptoms but don’t cure the brain injury.
“As an alternative to drugs, hyperbaric oxygen therapy stimulates brain wound healing and it can reverse soft tissue and neurocognitive damage,” Lutzen said. “This treatment allows patients to experience recovery of cognitive and neurological functioning without surgery or drugs.”
Despite numerous studies that prove its efficacy, the treatment is not on Medicare’s approved list, he said, and is not covered. 
“At its most basic level, HB262 gives veterans, who have been diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury or PTSD, the right to receive the treatment as prescribed by a doctor,” he said.
Lutzen has been pushing for the last four years to get the fund established, he said. Last year, the bill passed in the House but stalled in the Senate. Lutzen is hoping that Brattin’s companion legislation will be the key to getting the bill across the finish line. 
According to the bill’s fiscal analysis, the cost of reimbursing hyperbaric facilities for the necessary treatments could exceed $5 million annually. The funds will come from “any appropriations, gifts, bequests, or public or private donations,” the bill states.
State Rep. Stephanie Boykin, a Democrat from Florissant and a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, spoke in support of the bill on Monday. 
“We have veterans who are suffering,” Boykin said. “We have veterans who have already tried medicines. They’ve already tried just traditional therapy. So this alternative therapy is what’s needed, and we need to be there and standing for our veterans.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Brown-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-07 20:06:27.350473

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Despite Republican leaders’ pledge to reshape the judiciary in Montana, the Legislature doesn’t appear to have had the appetite to increase the partisanship of the state’s courts this session. 
On Monday, representatives voted down House Bill 838, a bill that would allow Montana Supreme Court candidates to indicate a political affiliation, on a 46-54 vote, with 12 Republicans joining all Democrats in repudiating the premise. 
Last week two similar bills — Senate Bill 42 and Senate Bill 543 stalled in the House and Senate respectively.
Urging his caucus to support his bill, HB 838, Speaker of the House Brandon Ler, R-Savage, said he too would like an independent judiciary, but that doesn’t happen. 
“The will of the voters was to send a strong conservative majority out here the past three sessions I’ve been in, and every good bill we run on the floor just seems to get shot down,” Ler said. “It’s time to make the judiciary reflect the will of the voters of Montana.” 
In early January, Ler along with Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, outlined a plan for reigning in the co-equal branch of government. 
A primary goal was to make judicial elections partisan. Many GOP lawmakers allege justices already have partisan leanings and the labels simply offer voters transparency. Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte echoed this desire, repeatedly calling on lawmakers to send such a bill to his desk. 
But with less than a month left in the 69th legislative session, lawmakers are 0-for-5 on passing bills aimed at removing the state’s nonpartisan elections for judges. 
Several adjacent bills — one to reduce the number of Supreme Court judges, one to allow judicial candidates to take part in partisan events or hold positions in political organizations — have also failed to garner majority support. 
So far, just one bill on the topic has made it to the governor’s desk. House Bill 39, now codified in Montana Code, allows political parties to contribute to the campaigns of judicial candidates. While HB 39 doesn’t attach a letter to a candidate’s name on the ballot, it opens the door for more money, and more clearly partisan money, to enter judicial races. 
  The final (for now) debate 


The state of the partisan judiciary
SB 42 — Requiring political affiliation in judicial races — Senate:✓ House: X 
SB 543 — MT Supreme Court can indicate political affiliation — Senate: X
HB 39 — Allow political parties to contribute to judicial candidates — House:✓  Senate:✓ Governor: ✓
HB 169 — Allow judicial candidates take part in partisan activities — House:✓  Senate: X
HB 295 — All judicial candidates can indicate political affiliation — House: X
HB 506 — Constitutional amendment to appoint judges — Committee: X
HB 751 — Requiring MT Supreme Court candidates indicate political party or be “undisclosed” — House: X
HB 838 — MT Supreme Court can indicate political affiliation —  House: X



Many lawmakers stood up on the debate for HB 838 Monday afternoon, with the longest speeches coming from those in opposition. 
Opponents cited the clear desire from representatives, as seen in previous votes, to keep the courts as nonpartisan as possible, despite massive increases in spending in recent elections and the perceived slant of recent state Supreme Court decisions. 
Others cited the slower turnover of the courts compared to other elected positions — state Supreme Court judges serve eight-year terms while representatives serve just two — and urged lawmakers to let the changes take their natural course. 
“Montana recently switched from a purple state to a red state,” said Rep. George Nikolakakos, R-Great Falls. “It takes time to lag behind and offer that counter balance. In many ways, that’s a feature of the system. As frustrating as it is, it’s not a bug. It ensures our courts are separated from the political passion of the day.”
But many Republicans backed the Speaker’s bill, using many of the same arguments made throughout this session-long debate. One of the primary cases made by proponents is that partisan affiliation is a voter-education tool. 
“We have people coming to us to say, who should we vote for the judge? Because I’m not spending time coming out and not looking at the cases they heard,” said Rep. Gary Parry, R-Colstrip. “If you think for a minute that the judges aren’t going with an ideology, I challenge that. I just don’t think that keeping the public uninformed about it is the way to go … (This bill) at least gives the voters an opportunity to make an informed choice.”
Several representatives said they would prefer to consider a different system altogether, namely letting the governor appoint justices with either Legislative confirmation or from a short list selected by a commission. More than half of states have some version of an appointment system for their highest courts. 
A bill heard earlier this session would have asked Montana voters to consider a constitutional amendment to allow the governor to appoint Supreme Court justices from a slate selected by a bipartisan commission, but that proposal never made it past a committee hearing. 
House Majority Leader Steve Fitzpatrick, R-Great Falls, said that as a lawyer, he looks for judges who are fair, follow the law and listen to attorneys. And during the last decade, he said he’s seen the system evolve further into partisanship and pushed his caucus to back the bill. 
He said the partisan judicial bills are “simply a response to what’s going on.”
“If we want these bills to go away, I think it’s time for the judiciary to step up and make them go away,” he said.
Rep. Jonathan Karlen, D-Missoula, said that while lawmakers ascribe to a partisan label in order to advocate for and push forward a party platform that they stand behind, judges have an altogether different job that doesn’t involve toeing a party line.  
Adding judges directly into the partisan mix would have candidates for court echoing party lines, chasing endorsements and campaigning purely on ideology, he said. 
“That’s not an impartial court,” Karlen said. “That’s legislators in red robes and blue robes.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Old_Supco2-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-04-07 20:06:27.350473

(Getty Images)After an April  election that broke national  records for spending, Wisconsin voters are eager to see measures to rein in money in politics, a campaign finance watchdog group leader said Monday.
“It is an environment where billionaires are running the show and everyday people like you and me are here watching,” said Nick Ramos, executive director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. “We will continue to see unprecedented spending unless something changes from our Legislature and our lawmakers.”
The numbers that the organization posted Monday haven’t yet pierced the predicted $100 million threshold in the Supreme Court race, but final data won’t be compiled until the end of June. The Democracy Campaign focuses on the money actually spent, as distinct from what was raised or what was budgeted, said research director Sam DeForest-Davis.
As of Monday morning, the campaign for Judge Susan Crawford, who won the Court race, spent $22 million compared with the campaign for Judge Brad Schimel, which spent just under $10 million.
While the campaigns spent a combined $32 million, independent groups supporting the campaigns spent a combined $51 million. Schimel was the larger beneficiary of independent spending, with $33.5 million in his favor or opposing Crawford. Independent spending that favored Crawford or opposed Schimel totaled $18 million.
In the race for state superintendent, the two candidates’ campaigns — for  incumbent Jill Underly, who won, and for her challenger, Brittany Kinser — were just about even in their spending, with $1.3 million for Underly and $1.1 million for Kinser.
Independent spending, however, heavily favored Underly at $1.9 million. Independent spending for Kinser totaled $160,000.
Research director DeForest-Davis said the organization will have a final report in July on spending data, including spending on issue ads that don’t include explicit messages to vote for or against a candidate but are slanted to clearly favor one or the other. That information won’t be available until the end of June. 
Along with the campaign finance data released Monday, the Democracy Campaign released results from an opinion poll of Wisconsin voters on campaign finance.
The survey, of 861 voters conducted from Feb. 11-14, found that 88% of participants were “very concerned” or “extremely concerned” about the influence of money in politics.
“I have a hard time thinking of an issue that has this kind of universal feedback across the state,” Ramos said. “After seeing the gaudy amount of money that was spent in this Supreme Court race, I can only imagine that this number and this percentage are going to increase.”
Nearly as many — more than 85% — said “no” when asked if individuals or groups should be able to spend “unlimited amounts of money” to support political campaigns.  And 83% said there should be limits on how much campaigns can spend.
Nearly 74% said they would support a ban on campaign spending “by outside political action committees (PACs) that are not directly affiliated with a candidate’s campaign.” About 53% ranked spending by “dark money PACS who do not have to disclose their donors” as their greatest concern where the influence of money on politics is concerned.
Another question showed that so far publicly financed campaigns haven’t gained support from a majority of voters. Almost 47% said they would “strongly” or “somewhat” support such a proposal. Just under 30% said they would “somewhat” or “strongly” oppose public financing, while 23.5% said they were unsure.

Senate File 608 would increase the minimum of the grain indemnity fund to $5 million and the maximum to $12 million. This is an increase from the current parameters, which are set at $3 million and $8 million, though it is not as great an increase as a bill proposed in the Iowa House of Representatives. The House bill would increase the fund’s range to $8 million and $16 million. 
SF 608 would also include “grain purchased under credit-sale contract” under the definition of “purchased grain” meaning grain purchased on a credit sale would be eligible for the same indemnity protections.
The House version of the bill would also include credit-sale contracts, but would reimburse those contracts at a rate of 70% of the grain purchased. 
Sen. Kerry Gruenhagen, R-Walcott, added a minor clarifying amendment to the bill, which passed. 
The bill advances after a vote of 39-8.

Multiple Standing Rock councilors asked Armstrong and Rhoden what the tribe can do to navigate these changes.
“We all know there’s gonna be more,” Alkire said.
Both governors said they share concerns about the cuts.
“We’re in the mode of monitoring, just like you are,” Rhoden said.
He defended the Trump administration’s actions as necessary to bring federal spending under control.
“It’s been many decades since I felt like we had a president that’s actually looking beyond the horizon on fixing what’s wrong with America,” he said.
Alkire said she supports streamlining federal programs if it means Native nations get greater autonomy over their own resources, but she worries tribal communities will suffer if their services are cut.
“We in Indian Country have always faced underfunding, so when you cut something for us, it’s drastic,” Alkire said.
She said Standing Rock is counting on the North Dakota and South Dakota governments and their congressional delegations to make sure the federal government honors its responsibility to Native nations.
Armstrong said he hopes tribal leaders alert their state counterparts as soon as they face issues.
“When disruption happens, we need to know,” he said.
Setting the funding cuts aside, Alkire said the federal government has long neglected to address a laundry list of tribal sovereignty issues. The tribe needs more funding and staff from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as fewer restrictions on access to federal land and the Missouri River, to name a few, she said.

“I told Secretary Burgum that he had his work cut out for him,” Alkire said, referring to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Armstrong’s predecessor as governor.
Development was another recurring theme of the meeting.
John Pretty Bear, a district representative, asked Rhoden if he would ask D.C. to fund water infrastructure development in western South Dakota.
“It’s 2025, and we still have people that haul water,” Pretty Bear said.
Rhoden said he’s aware of the issue.
“I live in the middle of Meade County, and if you look at a water map of South Dakota as far as rural water projects, it is a black hole in that area,” he said.
Councilors also asked the governors to help support economic development on the reservation so the tribe’s younger generation can find jobs
“We need more businesses,” District Representative Joe White Mountain Jr. said. “Our kids are growing up and they don’t really have a future.”
During a January address to North Dakota state lawmakers, Alkire called infrastructure a top priority for the tribe.
Standing Rock hopes to one day build a bridge over the Missouri River connecting the reservation to Emmons County. Currently, to cross the Missouri River, Fort Yates residents must drive roughly an hour north to Bismarck or an hour south to Mobridge.
The U.S. The Department of Transportation recently awarded the tribe a $14.5 million planning grant for the project, but more support will be needed to make the dream a reality, Akire said in the address.
A bill signed by Armstrong in March authorizes the North Dakota Department of Transportation to accept ownership of the bridge if it gets built.
Tribal officials said both states could do a better job of consulting with Standing Rock on a variety of issues, including education, transportation, gaming and land use.

Rhoden, formerly South Dakota’s lieutenant governor, assumed office at a low point for tribal relations in the state.
Leaders of all nine Native American reservations in South Dakota voted to ban Rhoden’s predecessor, Kristi Noem — now the U.S. secretary of Homeland Security — from their lands. The votes were in response to Noem’s rhetoric about Indigenous communities in the state, including an unsubstantiated accusation that tribal leaders were “personally benefiting” from Mexican drug cartels, and an assertion that Native American children “don’t have any hope.”
“I think this is an important day in our history and in the road to recovery, as far as rebuilding our relationships,” Rhoden said Monday.
Armstrong’s predecessor, Burgum, was widely regarded as an ally to the five federally recognized tribes that share land with North Dakota.
Armstrong said Burgum’s appointment to the Interior presents “unique opportunities” to the tribe, North Dakota and South Dakota, and he hopes the three governments can continue working toward their common interests.
“There’s not a lot of people that can get me out of Bismarck on less than a week’s notice when the Legislature’s meeting, but when the Chairwoman calls, we say yes,’” said Armstrong.

Beyond finding bloodied dogs, the officers who went to 10 homes in Dillon and Marion counties with arrest warrants last Wednesday and Thursday seized lots of drugs, cash and guns, according to a news release from the State Law Enforcement Division, which coordinated the bust. One of the 11 people arrested turned himself in Friday.

“If you are involved in dogfighting in South Carolina, we will find you, we will arrest you and we will hold you accountable,” SLED Chief Mark Keel said at a news conference Monday with Gov. Henry McMaster at the agency’s forensic lab.
In all, officers took $69,700 in cash, 55 guns and an assortment of drugs that included 17 pounds of marijuana, 11 grams of crack cocaine, one gram of cocaine, two grams of ketamine, 990 fentanyl pills and 2,266 ecstasy pills, according to the release.
Most of the 11 face charges of animal fighting, a felony that carries a penalty of up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine, and ill treatment of animals. On first offense, that charge is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine. Additional convictions are punishable by up to two years in prison and a $2,000 fine.
In one home, the drugs and guns were not secured away from children, leading to an additional charge of unlawfully placing a child at risk, Keel said.
Organizations involved in the takedown and rescue of the animals include drug task forces from both North and South Carolina and the sheriffs for Dillon and Marion counties.

“SLED is fortunate to partner with local law enforcement departments, sheriff’s offices, and our federal agencies and task forces,” Keel said.
Jennifer Bonovich, a forensic veterinarian at the announcement, described the trauma endured by the dogs as a “fate worse than death.”
The dogs made to fight are chained, battered, bruised and often malnourished as people sit to the side attempting to profit off that pain.
“Bones are crushed and fractured, all of this while members of your community are watching and cheering,” said Bonovich, who said she works with SLED and goes to the crime scenes to evaluate the animals.
SLED started a four-person dogfighting unit in 2023 and has rescued 492 dogs, leading to the arrest of 116 people, according to statistics from the agency.
That tally includes last week’s bust.
Marion and Dillon counties lead the state with the most dogs seized since Jan. 1, 2024, with 82 and 72 respectively, followed by Richland (45), Darlington (43) and Georgetown (40), according to a map of counties SLED provided Monday.
“This is an unspeakable thing that’s happening,” said McMaster, who began leading the fight against dogfighting in South Carolina long before his time in the Governor’s Mansion.

It was McMaster who started South Carolina’s anti-dogfighting task force with then-SLED Chief Robert Stewart in 2004.
In his January State of the State address, he again asked the Legislature to provide SLED more money to “end this unforgivable savagery.” He added that “most of the people participating in this barbaric activity have long criminal records.”
SLED asked legislators for $500,000 in the coming fiscal year to cover the veterinary bills and care of dogs it rescues from dogfighting ring. But the House didn’t include any additional money for the unit in the plan it passed last month. The Senate’s budget-writing committee is crafting its spending plan this week.
Last year, McMaster asked legislators to provide $566,286, which they did. In 2022, the Legislature sent SLED $181,148 for the salary and equipment of an agent dedicated to animal-fighting enforcement — again, matching McMaster’s request.
“We have to put a stop to it,” McMaster said Monday.
When SLED rescues the dogs, it partners with organizations like the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to find facilities where they can be nurtured and hopefully one day adopted, said Matthew Bershadker, president of the ASPCA, who was at the announcement.
SLED rescued more than 200 dogs last year. A new law allowed for their quicker adoption.

Once they are cared for, they often find homes and live out a normal life, McMaster said.
Until last year, the cost of prosecuting animal fighting rings and the long-term care of their victims allowed abusers to escape paying for their crimes. As these cases dragged on, potentially for years, the costs fell on taxpayers. The dogs couldn’t be adopted until the criminal charges were resolved.
That changed with a law dubbed the “cost of care” act, which McMaster signed last May after both chambers passed it unanimously.
It flipped the financial burden of care from the government to the accused — and allowed for the dog’s placement with new, loving owners much faster.
As long as a judge determines the seizure was justified, an accused owner must either pay for the dog’s care for the duration of the case or immediately forfeit ownership, allowing the dog to be adopted.
“This law is critically important for law enforcement to pursue animal cruelty investigations,” Bershadker said, “and it helps ensure that the animals get the treatment that they need and deserve.”

John James (R-Shelby Twp.) speaks at an Oct. 2 campaign event with Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance in Auburn Hills. | Kyle DavidsonAfter months of speculation, U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Twp.) announced on Monday he will join the race for Michigan governor rather than seeking another term in the House of Representatives. 
In an announcement on social media, James, who is serving his second term in Congress, said that Michigan is being held back by a lack of strong competent leadership, telling voters “It’s time to get Michigan’s government out of fantasyland and back to common sense.”
“President [Donald] Trump and I have been in each other’s corners through thick and thin for eight years — no reason that will end now. He’s doing his part to make America great again and I’ll do mine to bring prosperity and sanity back to Michigan,” James said.
James unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 2018 against now-retired Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Lansing), netting Trump’s endorsement during the Republican primary, where he faced businessman Sandy Pensler. He ran another unsuccessful campaign against Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) in 2020 before he was elected to represent Michigan’s 10th Congressional District in 2022, winning reelection in 2024. 
James joins state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Twp.) and truck driver Anthony Hudson in seeking the Republican nomination for governor. On the Democratic side, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson have each announced their campaigns for governor, while Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a longtime Democrat, is running as an independent.
Following James’ announcement, Curtis Hertel, chair of the Michigan Democratic Party released a statement, chiding the Congressman for declining to hold town hall meetings with constituents upset with proposed cuts to federal programs by the Trump administration.
“John James has spent his career failing in statewide elections and failing to show up for his own district, so why would we trust him to show up for Michiganders as governor? At a time when Donald Trump is tanking our economy, Michigan needs a leader who won’t just fight for billionaires, but will fight for everyone – John James is not that man,” said Hertel.

At a sparsely attended news conference Monday in Harrisburg, Reps. Jared Solomon (D-Philadelphia) and Jim Rigby (R-Cabria) spoke with optimism about the 38th try they’re spearheading. 
“This is the hard stuff, the egregious stuff, the headline making stuff … I’m talking the vacation homes, the cars, the jewelry,” Solomon said. “This tries to do something very simple, it says we’re not going to tolerate it.”
The legislation, co-sponsored by Solomon and Rigby, would bar elected officials, public employees and nominees or candidates for public office from taking or seeking gifts of cash or any item worth more than $50. 
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in Harrisburg have rejected claims that expensive gifts rarely influence policymakers’ decisions and that constituents should not be concerned. But for decades, the General Assembly has failed to pass legislation that would end what critics say amounts to legalized bribery.
Each of the dozens of bills introduced over the years has been an attempt to reach consensus on a commonsense gift ban, Michael Pollack, executive director of the government-reform group MarchOnHarrisburg, said.
“We can discuss the details of this bill and those other bills but this is going to be chopped to shreds and rewritten eight times,” he told the Capital-Star. “It’s not a matter of what the exact right policy prescription is, it’s a matter of political will.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Current law lets lawmakers accept gifts from anyone, if they disclose items more than $250 on annual interest forms. Legislation to clamp down on gifts, including bills that Solomon has co-sponsored with Republican colleagues in the last two sessions, has died without advancing beyond the House State Government Committee.
Solomon noted House Bill 744 includes reasonable exceptions, as the legislation has in the past.
“If you get a dinner in Harrisburg, I don’t think you’re susceptible to bribery. If you’re in your district and you accept cookies from a constituent who says, ‘Job well done,’ I think that’s okay,” Solomon said. Such exceptions, including donations to be passed on to help constituents, would allow lawmakers to continue doing their jobs.
The exceptions cover gifts, hospitality, transportation or lodging from family members and from lobbyists related to a celebration of a major life event, such as a wedding or the birth of a child, or when a lobbyist and a public official are involved in a personal romantic relationship.
Rigby said dinners and events offered to lawmakers are often educational, especially for those who are new to elected office. House Bill 744 would allow members of the General Assembly to continue interacting with constituents and advocates, and Rigby said those types of events aren’t the problem.
“I didn’t come to Harrisburg for the bennies, for the perks, for the big events, I don’t think any of us did,” Rigby said, adding that. “I thought this is a good place to start, and it certainly has its value.”

Pollack pinned the failure of gift ban legislation on leadership in both chambers, noting that its difficult for leaders to admit fault in the institutions they oversee and to recognize their own humanity.
“It shatters their own self image and that gets a response of arrogance and anger a lot of the time,” Pollack said.
Spokespeople for House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery), Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) and Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) did not respond to a request for comment.
Solomon, who made an unsuccessful bid for attorney general last year, agreed that reforming the legislature is particularly difficult for those who would be subject to the new rules.
“I’ve often thought, maybe if we make this bill effective 20 years from now … maybe we could get passage through the legislature,” Solomon said. 
In the 2022-23 legislative session, MarchOnHarrisburg recruited a lawmaker to force a vote on a bill that would ban legislators from accepting gifts, transportation, and recreation exceeding $250 from a single person each year.
The move would have directly defied Republican leadership, specifically then-Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff, R-Centre, who controlled the chamber’s voting calendar. Ultimately, no one made a move and the legislation remained stuck in committee.
MarchOnHarrisburg, which also advocates for campaign finance reform, the end of dark money campaign spending and other issues involving transparency and political accountability, has continued to push for the gift ban.
Last month, the group’s members spent a day “bird dogging” lawmakers for answers on their support or silence on a gift ban and plans to release them to constituents.
But the pressure not to rock the boat that individual lawmakers face from their caucus leaders, lobbyists and donors is real, Pollack said. He noted that rank-and-file lawmakers who stepped out of line in the past have been stripped of committee assignments, staff and even their Capitol offices.
It’s also legal for lawmakers to have side jobs, despite Pennsylvania having a full-time legislature, and to promote legislation to benefit industries with which they have business relationships.
“All of these things add up to a really deep culture of corruption,” Pollack said. “If we don’t do it, we just continue to be governed by smaller and smaller numbers of people with money and influence.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-13-at-1.20.02-PM-1024x756.png,,,2025-04-07 20:06:27.350473

(Screenshot/Google Maps)Over 25,000 patients will need to find new pediatricians and primary care doctors before Anchor Medical Associates closes all three of its offices by June 30.
The physician group’s Bald Hill Road location in Warwick will shutter on April 30. Warwick patients can continue seeing their provider at the medical group’s Commerce Street location in Lincoln. On June 30, both the Lincoln location and the adult medicine office on Corliss street in Providence will close. A closure notice was first sent to patients last week, WPRI-TV reported on Friday. 
“The decision to close our practices has been extremely difficult, particularly against the backdrop of a shortage of primary care physicians across the state,” the practice stated in its letter to patients, which was posted to its website Monday. “While our commitment to our patients remains strong, we just cannot continue to operate in this increasingly challenging healthcare environment.”
The practice was incorporated in 1999. There are currently 22 providers listed on Anchor’s website. Over the last decade, the practice said it has had great difficulty in hiring new doctors to replace retiring physicians. 
“While costs continue to rise, reimbursement rates make it extremely difficult to attract new physicians to our state,” the letter stated. 
Anchor stated that for patients who need to find new doctors, it wants to “make this as smooth a transition as possible,” and is encouraging patients to obtain copies of their medical records within the next 90 days.  
A records request form is available on the practice’s website. Records will continue to be available after June 30, according to the Anchor website.
The Rhode Island Department of Health posted an announcement about the closure on its website and is advising patients to do two things: begin searching for a new primary care provider, and request copies of medical records. The health department notes that while records can be obtained after the closure date, “it is best to obtain them beforehand.”  
More Medicaid, more reimbursement problems for Rhode Island providers
The Hospital Association of Rhode Island (HARI) called the closure is another blow to the already wounded state of primary care.
“These unfortunate events highlight how Rhode Island’s health care crisis is very real, and getting worse,” Howard Dulude, the trade group’s interim president, said in a statement released Monday.
Addressing subpar provider reimbursement rates has been a recurring motif at the State House. A sizable number of Rhode Islanders receive health care through public insurance like Medicaid, more so than in neighboring states, but Rhode Island’s Medicaid reimbursement rates lag behind other states. Hospitals blasted Gov. Dan McKee earlier this year when the governor’s budget made no room for higher reimbursements.
HARI has put its weight behind three bills this legislative session, each with a Senate and House version, and two of them focused on improving the Medicaid reimbursement rate problem. The Family Health Care Act is a joint resolution that would OK a $90,000 appropriation to the Executive Office of Health and Human Services to help the agency raise Medicaid reimbursement rates. Both versions have been introduced in their respective chambers but have not yet been scheduled for hearings. 
Another Medicaid bill that has been introduced in both chambers but not yet heard by committees would funnel money from hospital licensing fees toward increasing Medicaid reimbursements for hospitals. Starting in fiscal year 2026, which begins on July 1, hospitals would be organized into a new three-tier system, and with their size, services and patient population informing their tier placement.
Hospitals with higher proportions of Medicaid and uninsured patients would pay less in fees than bigger hospital systems. Once the state collects $90 million in these fees, any excess funds would be poured into Medicaid reimbursements. 
A third bill backed by HARI would make the state more competitive with Massachusetts and Connecticut and grant the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC) greater regulatory power over commercial health insurers’ payments to hospitals and providers. The commissioner would need to review and approve annual increases in hospital contracts and provider payment rates if the total cost of care exceeds the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers plus 3%.

Andy Beshear for vetoing a provision that would have helped private schools hire police. The proposal surfaced in the Senate on March 14, the last day before the veto break.  Conferring with Wise on the Senate floor March 14 are Senate President Robert Stivers, left, and Sen. Chris McDaniel. (LRC Public Information)Months after Kentucky voters rejected a constitutional amendment that would have allowed public funds to support nonpublic schools, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear applied the same logic in a line-item veto. 
Beshear’s veto spurred Senate Republicans to issue a news release Friday and again Monday headlined “Senator Max Wise rips governor’s veto of school safety provision,” asserting that the proposed public funding would have gone to law enforcement agencies not the private schools that could have used it to employ police as school resource officers.
The provision, which surfaced on the 28th day of the 30-day session and received little attention, directed the Kentucky Department of Education to provide up to $20,000 to help nonpublic schools employ a law enforcement officer on their campuses. 
The Senate added the provision to House Bill 622 which modified state contract and invoicing procedures. Public schools also were eligible for the assistance in hiring security personnel known as school resource officers. The Senate authorized spending $5 million a year over the current biennium.
When the legislature reconvened after the 10-day veto period, the House rejected the Senate version and the legislation went to a free conference committee, which also recommended the aid to put officers in private as well as public schools. Both chambers approved the conference committee’s proposal on March 28. That was the day the legislature adjourned meaning the Republican-controlled legislature had no chance to override a Beshear veto.
Beshear issued a line-item veto last week, striking the aid to private schools as well as some of the original bill’s contracting requirements.
In response, Wise, the Senate Republican floor leader, accused Beshear of politicizing school safety. 
Kentuckians say ‘no’ to public funding for private, charter schools

“Governor Beshear’s line-item veto sends an unmistakable and deeply disturbing message to families across the commonwealth: If your child attends a private school, their safety matters less,” Wise said. “As the primary sponsor of the 2019 School Safety and Resiliency Act, I’ve spent years working so that every Kentucky student, teacher, and staff member—regardless of ZIP code, income level, or school type—is protected from the threats facing our world today. The Governor’s decision doesn’t just fly in the face of a bipartisan mission — it politicizes it.” 
Wise, of Campbellsville, sponsored a 2019 school safety law in the aftermath of a shooting at Marshall County High School. Beshear signed that law. A 2022 update to the law, also signed by Beshear, requires a school resource officer (SRO), a type of sworn law enforcement officer, on each campus in Kentucky, although the legislature has never fully funded  that mandate. Last year Wise successfully sponsored legislation allowing volunteer “guardians” to fill vacant law enforcement positions at schools. 
In his recent veto message, Beshear pushed back on using public funds in nonpublic schools and cited a proposed constitutional amendment that voters rejected last fall that would have allowed the General Assembly to fund nonpublic schools, such as private or charter schools. 
“All Kentucky children deserve to be safe in their schools, but the Kentucky Constitution requires public funds be used for only public schools,” Beshear wrote. He added the Kentucky Supreme Court has ruled against supporting nonpublic schools with public funds.
In 2022, the state’s high court struck down a 2021 Kentucky law creating a generous tax credit to help families pay for tuition at private schools. The next year Franklin Circuit Judge Phillip Shepherd struck down a charter school law passed in 2022.
Wise accused Beshear of “appeasing special interests and institutions” and pointed out that parents who send their children to private schools pay taxes to support public schools and other local services such as law enforcement.
Wise also argued that Beshear “has chosen to punish Kentucky families for making a decision that was right for them,” as parents of nonpublic school students pay taxes for local services. The senator vowed that the Republican-controlled state legislature “will not be silent in the face of this reckless decision” and that student safety “is not negotiable.”
The final version of HB 622 that passed on the legislature’s last day also included $30 million to expand a sewage treatment plant in Elizabethtown; $20 million to help communities experiencing economic growth presumably from the electric-vehicle battery plant being built in Glendale, and $10 million for infrastructure in Grayson County. Beshear allowed those provisions to become law.

Now, with Florida Republicans already passing strong measures this year cracking down on illegal immigration to align with President Donald Trump’s goal of mass deportations, a proposal (HB 955) that would require all private employers in Florida to use the E-Verify system to check each employee’s legal status won approval by its second committee in the House on Monday, and now will go to the floor for a final vote.
“It builds upon what we’ve already done here in the state of Florida,” said Pinellas County Republican Rep. Berny Jacques, a co-sponsor along with Jacksonville Republican Kiyan Michael.
“Prior to two years ago, there was no requirement whatsoever for private employers, unless if you were contracting with the state government. We did a requirement for 25 or more employees, so that closes that gap to make sure that the workforce integrity is uplifted and we are making sure that every worker in this state is authorized to do so legally.”
The Legislature passed significant measures cracking down on illegal immigration in a special session in early February, including making it a misdemeanor for immigrants over the age of 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida and imposing the death penalty for immigrants lacking permanent legal status who are convicted of capital crimes such as murder or sexual abuse of minors under 12.
Thomas Kennedy with the Florida Immigrant Coalition said the expansion of E-Verify was a “bad deal for Floridians,” noting the state is already facing an acute worker shortage.
“At a time where we are basically touching all the ‘do not touch’ buttons in terms of wrecking our economy, including mass layoffs, increasing prices, undermining consumer and international confidence, why would we continue messing with our state, with our workforce?” he asked the House Commerce Committee.
Democratic support
However, both Republicans and some Democrats applauded the measure.
“Every job in Florida should go to someone who is legally authorized to work in this country. Period,” said Panhandle Republican Rep. Michelle Salzman. “We must prioritize American workers and Florida families who are here legally.”
Miami-Dade Republican David Borrero questioned why anyone on the committee could opposed E-Verify for all businesses. And he said it would encourage employers to pay higher wages for American workers.
“If you are opposed to this bill, then what you are saying is that you are okay creating an environment where people can break the law,” he said.
“You are okay with an environment where they can take away jobs from the American people. … [I]f this is truly creating a working shortage, then what that means is that we do not have reasonable-paying jobs in these industries. And so you know what happens is that when you take away these jobs from undocumented immigrants, maybe now we’re going to have jobs that pay reasonable rates — maybe now developers, contractors, farmers where they’re actually going to pay reasonable rates for the American people. That’s what’s going to happen.”
Florida is one of 23 states that use E-Verify in some fashion, although only a handful require all private companies to use the system.
The bill passed, 19-3, with three Democrats joining every Republican on the House Commerce Committee supporting it.
Whether the proposal makes it into law is in question, though, as the Legislature begins its sixth week in the nine-week session. None of the bills filed in the Senate that addresses E-Verify have been heard in any committee yet.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A bill that sought to clarify the start date for North Dakota’s legislative term limits failed in the House Monday on a 48-42 vote.
House Bill 1300, sponsored by Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, aimed to clear up confusion about the term limits initiative passed by North Dakota voters in 2022.
Under the bill, which was amended in the Senate, the clock would start on lawmaker term limits for appointments or elections after Jan. 1, 2023.
The original version of the bill had a Nov. 7, 2022, start date and would have given lawmakers elected in 2020 in even-numbered districts an additional two years in the Legislature. The Senate version also would have increased the terms for legislators in odd-numbered districts elected in 2022.
Term limits changes revived for possible statewide vote in North Dakota

Under the term limits section of the state constitution, each lawmaker is able to serve up to two, four-year terms in each chamber of the Legislature. The law also limits the members of the Legislature from amending or repealing the term limits section of the constitution, which can only be amended by an “initiative petition of the people.”
Senate Resolution 4008 passed both chambers of the Legislature and could be put on the 2026 general election ballot, if approved by the Secretary of State’s Office as a valid resolution. The resolution would allow lawmakers to serve four terms, up to 16 years, in a single legislative chamber.

Kelly Armstrong speaks during a press conference on banning student cellphone use in North Dakota on March 26, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers passed bills Monday that would prohibit student cellphone use during the school day, reviving one bill that had been defeated last week.
Senate Bill 2354 and House Bill 1160 differ on which schools would be affected and whether school districts would have the power to allow cellphone use during noninstructional time, such as in between classes or over the school lunch period. The bills are expected to have their differences ironed out in conference committees, each made up of three legislators from each chamber.
Senate Bill 2354 passed the House on a 61-29 vote.
The Senate bill, amended by the House Education Committee, would require all schools, public and private, to follow the statewide student cellphone ban. The House bill would only affect public school students. 
Under the Senate bill, students would be allowed to stow their phones in their lockers while turned off, or on silent, instead being secured in a lockbox or lockable pouch purchased by the school district.
School boards would also have the ability to create their own cellphone policies for student-use during noninstructional time under the Senate bill. The House bill would ban the use of the devices from “bell to bell.”
Rep. Anna Novak, R-Hazen, voted in favor of the Senate bill and said limiting cellphone use would have a positive impact on the mental health of students
“Each school district knows what’s best for their respective schools and should be allowed to tailor their own policy based on their school’s needs as long as it fits in the parameters of this bill,” Novak said.
Bill to ban student cellphone use fails in ND Senate; House expected to take up issue Monday

Rep. Daniel Johnston, R-Kathryn, said he voted against the bill because it regulates private schools the same as public schools.
“We should limit it to public school,” Johnston said. 
Both bills allow students access to their phones while traveling between learning sites, such as career and technical academies. 
The bills also require school districts to collect data on their cellphone policies to judge the impact on student behavior, mental health, disciplinary incidents, school attendance  and academic performance. The districts will report the data to the Department of Public Instruction, which will be compiled into an annual report.
Sen. Michelle Axtman, R-Bismarck, requested a revote in the Senate after missing Friday’s vote where the House bill failed. 
She said if local school districts had been more proactive on phone policies, the bill would not have been necessary. 
She said passing it would be “one of the most impactful things we do for teacher retention in North Dakota.” 
The bill passed the Senate on a 42-4 reconsidered vote.
Sen. Mark Enget, R-Powers Lake, was among those who switched their vote from no to yes. He said he felt school districts in his part of the state had done a good job managing phone use, but also learned that’s not the case statewide.

Photo provided by Stand with Trans.A Michigan-based organization dedicated to serving the transgender community will mark its 10th anniversary next month, a milestone its founder said she couldn’t envision when she began the organization.
“Oh my gosh, no. I mean, I really didn’t know what I was doing,” executive director Roz Gould Keith told the Michigan Advance as she laughed, recalling  founding Stand with Trans in 2015 after her trans son came out two years earlier.
The nonprofit will celebrate May 17 with the “Love Transcends Gala” at the Pistons Performance Center in Detroit.
Keith said the organization emerged from her experience with her son, trying to learn as much as she could to help him.
“My son needed a community and he needed to know that he wasn’t alone because his perspective was ‘I don’t know anyone like me.’ It was probably going into our second year of managing all of this for him that we started seeing the community. There was just this groundswell of families who were desperate to connect,” she said. 
Keith said that she quickly realized that parents were also struggling, as she did, to do what was best for their child, noting that 10 years ago the social and political climate surrounding trans issues was completely different than it is now.


Tickets for the May 17 Love Transcends Gala are available for $150 per person, with a VIP Experience available for $250, which includes a meet-and-greet with honorees, the keynote speaker, the performer, and a VIP gift bag. 
Tickets can be purchased at bit.ly/SWT10 


“There was no political climate conversation. There was no concern about bathrooms or community safety in the way we’re talking about it now. It wasn’t a conversation about rights. It was just a human need,’’ she said.
The organization, which now boasts a staff of 10, began with a single community education event, which was followed by a parents group and then an empowerment workshop. From that modest beginning, Stand with Trans now provides everything from a Therapy Assistance Program, which provides trans-affirming mental health care in Michigan and in other states through tele-health appointments, to corporate training events for employers to better provide an affirming workspace, to a Banned Book Club.
As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, Keith said there are limits to what they can do politically, but they can advocate for the community and also make sure that they provide education as well. Over the years, Keith says they’ve not only expanded their donor base, but also receive government and foundation grants.
“We just had a webinar on estate planning for LGBTQIA+ folks so whether they were in a marriage, long-term partnership, whatever the arrangement was, that they could better understand how to protect their rights,” said Keith. “We’re trying to stay on top of what’s going on and do the work that we do and run our programs and find funding.”
  Stand with Trans “Love Transcends Gala” will be held may 17, 2025 at the Detroit Pistons Training Center in Detroit.
Keeping all of that in mind, Keith said the anniversary gala is about celebrating their success through some trying times, including the COVID pandemic which forced them to cancel plans for their five-year anniversary.
“Ten years is a big milestone. Lots of businesses, lots of organizations, don’t make it this long. I’ve seen long-term nonprofits doing this work having to close their doors or lay off all their staff and we certainly don’t want to ever be in that situation and so we need to celebrate where we are today and all the accomplishments,” she said. 
The organization reached out to the Detroit Pistons, who offered up their training facility. 
“They are our venue sponsor. They provided the space to us, which is amazing. We’ve gotten some really great donations for a silent auction and you know it will be catered. There will be food, drinks, and a silent auction, with lots of opportunity for the community to connect,” she said.
The evening will feature a keynote address from bestselling author and nonbinary activist Jeffrey Marsh and singer, actress, and activist Mila Jam, as well as honoring champions of the trans community.
“We’re saying come dressed in gala glam. We want people to celebrate joy and come dressed ready to have a good time.”

The move comes several weeks after the agency canceled a Feb. 17 public hearing on the administrative process to remove that area from new mining for 20 years, which the Biden Administration had pursued in the final weeks in office. A temporary pause on mining had been in place since December.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that the Forest Service had cancelled two mineral leasing withdrawals in order to “help boost production of critical minerals” at the bottom of an April 4 news release announcing an increased domestic logging push.
A USDA spokesperson in an emailed statement identified those cancellations as the proposed Upper Pecos River watershed mining ban, as well as one in Nevada’s Ruby Mountains, and that the reversal stemmed from the January executive order titled “Unleashing American Energy.”
“Under President Trump’s leadership, USDA is removing the burdensome Biden-era regulations that have stifled energy and mineral development to revitalize rural communities and reaffirm America’s role as a global energy powerhouse,” the spokesperson wrote.
Other federal agencies that previously supported the mining ban under the past administration did not have further comment Monday.
The Bureau of Land Management acknowledged a Source NM request Monday, but did not provide comment before publication. The U.S. Department of the Interior, which oversees BLM, did not respond to emails for comment.
Ralph Vigil, an organizer for the nonprofit New Mexico Wilderness Alliance, told Source NM Monday he was unsurprised by the U.S. Forest Service’s decision under the new administration. Vigil said the Stop Terrero Mine Coalition — which includes agriculture, local and tribal governments, conservation and hunting groups opposing further development in the Upper Pecos — will need to consider its next steps.
“We’re going to continue our fight to do whatever we need to do to block this administration,” Vigil said.
Vigil, a parciante of the Acequia del Molino and local farmer living in Pecos, said much of the community opposition is rooted in the Terrero Mining disaster from 1991, during which floodwaters breached a defunct mine and sent mining tailing sludge downriver. The spill killed tens of thousands of fish and buried Willow Creek. Cleanup remains ongoing and has cost tens of millions of dollars, including state environment officials’ request for $5.7 million from the Legislature this year. An administrative ban can last for decades, but does not create a permanent ban on mining development, which requires full Congressional approval. Members of the New Mexico delegation introduced a bill to permanently ban mining development in the Upper Pecos
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) called the decision a “betrayal of trust,” in a written statement Monday, and said he’d move forward with similar legislation to ban mining in the area.
“The Trump administration’s decision is a betrayal of trust.  Not only does it reverse what the Pecos community has worked toward for years, it’s also incredibly out of touch. This kind of top-down decision-making — with zero attempt to discuss or even listen to the communities impacted — is exactly what’s wrong with this administration,” Heinrich said. “New Mexicans deserve clean water free from heavy metals. I will continue to push for permanent protection through my Pecos Watershed Protection Act. The Trump administration won’t stand with the people of New Mexico, but I always will.”
New Mexico Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard in March signed an executive order banning mineral mining on approximately 2,500 acres of state trust land in the Upper Pecos Watershed that will remain in place through 2045.
Vigil said any economic benefits logging and mining might bring would not outweigh future spills or destruction in the Pecos headwaters, already hard-hit by the 2022 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire.
“Putting the headwaters at risk isn’t beneficial for anyone downstream,” Vigil said. “Agriculture, outdoor recreation, these are economies we depend on, these other economies they want to bring in that are extractive, invasive and destructive will not be friendly to the community.”

Kennedy, Jr., for terminating nearly $11 billion in public health grants to the states. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and his counterparts in New York and Hawaii are the lead plaintiffs in a complaint filed Friday against the Trump administration seeking to stop the dismantling of three federal agencies that support public libraries and museums, workers, and small businesses.
In all, 20 Democratic attorneys general are participating in the April 4 lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Providence challenging a portion of a March 14 executive order targeting seven agencies, including three mandated by Congress: the Institute of Museum and Library Services; the Minority Business Development Agency and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
The executive order placed almost the entire staff of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) on administrative leave and will mean cutting hundreds of grants for state libraries and museums. The executive order also slashed the labor organizing staff and programs of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) and forced the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) to cut its grant programs that support small business owners. 
“This order continues the reduction in the elements of the Federal bureaucracy that the President has determined are unnecessary,” President Donald Trump wrote.
“As the President and his Administration continue their attempts to dismantle the federal government, Americans would do well to consider their priorities,” Neronha said. “What do these three agencies have in common? At first glance, maybe little. But if you take a closer look, you may realize that all three agencies empower everyday people in this country to access their full potential, whether it be through knowledge, workers’ rights, or small business support. By unlawfully attacking these agencies, they are attempting to stifle the American dream. We won’t let them, and neither should you.”
IMLS administers the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) which last year invested $180 million in libraries nationwide under its Grants to States Program. The Rhode Island Office of Library and Information Services (OLIS) received over $1.4 million in fiscal year 2025.
The funding supported core services and programs for Rhode Island libraries, including the Talking Books Library program for blind and print-disabled Rhode Islanders, the statewide summer reading program, statewide interlibrary book delivery services, and funding for nearly half of the state’s OLIS staff positions, according to a statement from the Rhode Island Library Association. 
“The Rhode Island Library Association opposes the cutting of federal funding to IMLS and stands in support of IMLS, museums and libraries nationwide,” the association wrote. “RILA also strongly opposes the reduction of IMLS staff to a level that makes it unable to fulfill its statutory duties. As library workers, we are concerned about the implications that the elimination of IMLS funding and staffing will have on Rhode Island libraries and its residents.”
The FMCS has slashed its staff from roughly 200 to fewer than 15 individuals and announced the termination of several of its core programs, making it harder for unionized workers to secure their rights, according to the lawsuit.










By unlawfully attacking these agencies, they are attempting to stifle the American dream. We won’t let them, and neither should you.


–  Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha


Many of Rhode Island’s collective bargaining agreements rely on mediation through FMCS, which slashed its staff from about 200 to fewer than 15 individuals. DCYF and one of its unions used the services of FMCS last year, avoiding a strike that could have compromised DCYF’s ability to ensure stability and security for children in their care.
The Trump administration has cut the number of MBDA staff from 40 to five and has effectively stopped issuing new grants, hurting vulnerable small businesses across the country. The MBDA provides many valuable services to Rhode Island’s small businesses, including one-on-one guidance and expertise on business strategies and resources, Neronha’s office said. The MBDA also provides grants for incubators such as Rhode Island’s Small Business HUB.
The coalition argues the executive order violates the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act by eliminating the programs of agencies without any regard for the laws and regulations that govern each source of federal funding. The AGs say the president cannot decide to unilaterally override laws governing federal spending, adding that the executive order unconstitutionally overrides Congress’ power to decide how federal funds are spent.
The two other lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Attorney General Letitia James of New York and Attorney General Anne Lopez of Hawaii. Joining the lawsuit are the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.
“We had to sue to stop Trump from defunding our schools and cancer cures, from defunding energy assistance and vaccines, from defunding disaster relief and the police. Now, we have to sue again to stop him from defunding summer reading programs and audiobooks for disabled veterans,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a report by Connecticut Mirror.
The Connecticut State Library receives $2.2 million in annual funding from IMLS, Tong said.
The other four agencies affected by the president’s executive order but not the subject of the lawsuit are the United States Agency for Global Media, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in the Smithsonian Institution, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.

Larry Rhoden and Standing Rock Chairwoman Janet Alkire converse during a meeting Monday morning in Fort Yates. (Provided by North Dakota Governor's Office)FORT YATES, N.D. – Leaders of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe asked governors of North Dakota and South Dakota for help Monday as they face uncertainties with federal funding under President Donald Trump.
The comments came during a rare meeting that brought North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong and South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden to consult with Standing Rock Tribal Chairwoman Janet Alkire and other tribal council members.
Alkire, Armstrong and Rhoden, who convened in the council chambers of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Administrative Center, said they couldn’t recall the last time both governors were in Fort Yates at the same time.
The Standing Rock Reservation straddles both North Dakota and South Dakota. This puts the tribe in the unique situation of having to manage overlapping jurisdiction with both states and the federal government.
Federal spending cuts threaten several services in Indian Country the federal government is legally required to provide, including programs that support public education, health care and law enforcement, Stateline reported last month. 
Multiple Standing Rock councilors asked Armstrong and Rhoden what the tribe can do to navigate these changes.
“We all know there’s gonna be more,” Alkire said. 
Both governors said they share concerns about the cuts.
“We’re in the mode of monitoring, just like you are,” Rhoden said. 
He defended the Trump administration’s actions as necessary to bring federal spending under control.

“It’s been many decades since I felt like we had a president that’s actually looking beyond the horizon on fixing what’s wrong with America,” he said.
Alkire said she supports streamlining federal programs if it means Native nations get greater autonomy over their own resources, but she worries tribal communities will suffer if their services are cut.
“We in Indian Country have always faced underfunding, so when you cut something for us, it’s drastic,” Alkire said.
She said Standing Rock is counting on the North Dakota and South Dakota governments and their congressional delegations to make sure the federal government honors its responsibility to Native nations.
Armstrong said he hopes tribal leaders alert their state counterparts as soon as they face issues.
“When disruption happens, we need to know,” he said.
Setting the funding cuts aside, Alkire said the federal government has long neglected to address a laundry list of tribal sovereignty issues. The tribe needs more funding and staff from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as fewer restrictions on access to federal land and the Missouri River, to name a few, she said.
“I told Secretary Burgum that he had his work cut out for him,” Alkire said, referring to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Armstrong’s predecessor as governor. 
Development was another recurring theme of the meeting.
John Pretty Bear, a district representative, asked Rhoden if he would ask D.C. to fund water infrastructure development in western South Dakota.
“It’s 2025, and we still have people that haul water,” Pretty Bear said.
Rhoden said he’s aware of the issue.
“I live in the middle of Meade County, and if you look at a water map of South Dakota as far as rural water projects, it is a black hole in that area,” he said.
Councilors also asked the governors to help support economic development on the reservation so the tribe’s younger generation can find jobs
“We need more businesses,” District Representative Joe White Mountain Jr. said. “Our kids are growing up and they don’t really have a future.”
During a January address to North Dakota state lawmakers, Alkire called infrastructure a top priority for the tribe.

Standing Rock hopes to one day build a bridge over the Missouri River connecting the reservation to Emmons County. Currently, to cross the Missouri River, Fort Yates residents must drive roughly an hour north to Bismarck or an hour south to Mobridge.
The U.S. The Department of Transportation recently awarded the tribe a $14.5 million planning grant for the project, but more support will be needed to make the dream a reality, Akire said in the address.
A bill signed by Armstrong in March authorizes the North Dakota Department of Transportation to accept ownership of the bridge if it gets built. 
Tribal officials said both states could do a better job of consulting with Standing Rock on a variety of issues, including education, transportation, gaming and land use.

Leaders of all nine Native American reservations in South Dakota voted to ban Rhoden’s predecessor, Kristi Noem — now the U.S. secretary of Homeland Security — from their lands. The votes were in response to Noem’s rhetoric about Indigenous communities in the state, including an unsubstantiated accusation that tribal leaders were “personally benefiting” from Mexican drug cartels, and an assertion that Native American children “don’t have any hope.”
“I think this is an important day in our history and in the road to recovery, as far as rebuilding our relationships,” Rhoden said Monday.
Armstrong’s predecessor, Burgum, was widely regarded as an ally to the five federally recognized tribes that share land with North Dakota.
Armstrong said Burgum’s appointment to the Interior presents “unique opportunities” to the tribe, North Dakota and South Dakota, and he hopes the three governments can continue working toward their common interests.
“There’s not a lot of people that can get me out of Bismarck on less than a week’s notice when the Legislature’s meeting, but when the Chairwoman calls, we say yes,’” said Armstrong.

When a package from Amazon arrived at her Clark County home in November 2020, Michelle Vasquez-Stickley assumed it was art supplies for her 15-year-old son. She left it on his bed for him.
The package instead contained sodium nitrite, a powder that can serve as a poison antidote and, used at low levels of purity, as a meat preservative. But at high concentrations, it can be lethal.
Vasquez-Stickley’s son, Tyler Schmidt, used 99.6% pure sodium nitrite to die by suicide weeks after the delivery.
“As parents, we do everything we can to protect our children, but how could I protect Tyler from something I didn’t even know was a danger?” Vasquez-Stickley asked lawmakers in January. “The reality is, my child couldn’t walk into a pharmacy and purchase allergy medication without restrictions, yet he could buy a lethal substance online with no age verifications or warnings about dangers.”
Schmidt is one of dozens who died by this method across the country. After many warnings, Amazon stopped selling the high-purity products in late 2022, while denying wrongdoing.
In hopes of making that restriction permanent, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson on Monday signed Tyler’s Law, a prohibition on the sale of sodium nitrite at concentrations greater than 10%. The law has exceptions for businesses that use the product.
Washington is now the fourth state to place limits on the substance, joining California, Colorado and New York.
“Tyler’s law ensures no other Washingtonian can order the deadly poison online and have it shipped to their home,” Ferguson said.
Sellers now have to label their sodium nitrite products, “WARNING DANGER: Deadly if ingested. If ingested, seek immediate medical attention for intravenous administration of methylene blue. Ingestion of sodium nitrite, even in small quantities, causes severe methemoglobinemia, extreme pain, and imminent death. Keep out of reach of children.”
Violators of the new requirements face a $10,000 fine for their first transgression, rising to $1 million for subsequent violations. The attorney general or private citizens can bring litigation to enforce the law.
House Bill 1209 passed both chambers with bipartisan support. The law takes effect immediately.
Vasquez-Stickley and Schmidt’s family were on hand as Ferguson signed the bill Monday.
“This is the kind of thing that makes a difference,” Ferguson told them. “And so I just so appreciate you having the courage to come together, to work with legislators, to work with their advocates, to bring this to public attention.”
A similar measure has seen progress at the federal level, with legislation to ban the chemical’s sale at high concentrations passing the U.S. House of Representatives before stalling in the Senate last year.
Meanwhile, the state Supreme Court recently agreed to hear one of the several cases against Amazon from families of loved ones who died after ingesting sodium nitrite.
An appeals court last year had dismissed that consolidated case, over four deaths from sodium nitrite purchased from the Seattle e-commerce giant. The judges ruled the company couldn’t be held liable for intentional misuse of its products.
Many other lawsuits against Amazon over this issue are also ongoing.
After Tyler’s Law passed the House, Vasquez-Stickley told KING 5 she hoped the bill would save lives “and prevent other families from experiencing the profound loss we have endured.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0868-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-07 19:06:00.999089

(Photo courtesy of University of Iowa)A physician is suing the University of Iowa and Board of Regents, claiming disability discrimination and retaliation.
In his lawsuit, Dr. Parijat Joy says he began his affiliation with the university in 2018 as part of the school’s cardiovascular disease fellowship, after which he trained for several years as an associate physician at University of Iowa Hospitals, then was promoted to assistant clinical professor in the Department of Internal Medicine.
According to the lawsuit, Joy’s child was diagnosed in March 2019 with a neurocognitive disability that required intensive medical care out of state. Joy alleges that prompted him to request flexible scheduling that would allow time for travel. The request was met with “harassment and hostility,” the lawsuit alleges.
In September 2019, Joy alleges, he was forced to accept a nine-month leave, without pay and benefits, from his fellowship position so that he could accompany his child to a treatment center. The lawsuit alleges a program director later retaliated against Joy for exercising his rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act by denying his requested accommodations and insisting that he undergo intensive clinical rotations.
According to the lawsuit, Joy “was expected to perform at a higher level than his peers,” and was eventually accused of absenteeism. Beginning in mid-January 2021, the “campaign of bullying and harassment escalated to direct disability discrimination,” the lawsuit claims, after an accident in which Joy fractured his wrist. Joy was allegedly denied schedule modifications so his wrist could heal and was forced to work several rigorous rotations, exacerbating his injuries.
The lawsuit also claims that on March 5, 2021, the university informed Joy his contract would not be renewed the following year, falsely alleging he lacked medical knowledge, was unprofessional and was poor at communication.
The lawsuit, originally filed in Johnson County District Court and then transferred to federal court, seeks unspecified damages for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, including discrimination and retaliation.

Josh Carlson, right, shown speaking with Rep. Rodney Lyons in the Louisiana House of Representatives, has filed legislation that would update the definition of coerced abortion in state law. (Allison Allsop/Louisiana Illuminator)A state lawmaker has filed a bill that would significantly expand the definition of “coerced abortion,” potentially making reproductive health laws in Louisiana even more restrictive.
The proposed legislation, House Bill 425, builds on the existing definition of coerced abortion, first approved in 2018, as one committed by a person who engages in the “use or threatened use of force, control, or intimidation” against a pregnant woman to compel her to undergo an abortion against her will. The existing law already defines this as a crime “whether or not the abortion procedure has been attempted or completed.”
Rep. Josh Carlson, R-Lafayette, who authored the bill, proposes replacing the word “intentionally” with “knowingly” and removes “physical” to describe the use of force or intimidation.    
The bill also details 18 examples of force, control or intimidation and removes references to outpatient abortion facilities. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Some of the examples of coercion are specific, such as kidnapping or blackmail, but others leave wide room for interpretation. 
One example says “restraint of speech or communication with others” can count as intimidation or control, including “interference with the use of mail, telephone, or money.” Another cites “isolation of an individual from others” or “exploitation of needs for food, shelter, safety, affection,or  intimate or marital relationships.” 
Michelle Erenberg, who leads the reproductive rights group Lift Louisiana, said Carlson’s bill is an attempt to weaponize the law. 
“The law already prohibits coercing someone into having an abortion,” Erenberg said in an emailed statement to the Illuminator. “Expanding the definition of what coercion means to include such broad categories is just another way to weaponize the law against anyone who may be trying to help someone access care. The real problem we should be trying to solve is people being forced by the state to carry pregnancies to term that they don’t want or that may threaten their health.” 

Carlson’s proposal follows last year’s creation of the new crime of coerced abortion using an abortion-inducing drug. That legislation made national headlines last year because it included a last-minute reclassification of mifepristone and misoprostol as “controlled dangerous substances,” making Louisiana the first state to classify these drugs in the same family as addictive painkillers. 
While the drugs are used for abortion, they also have many other medical uses including inducing labor and preventing or stopping postpartum hemorrhages. 
State Sen. Thomas Pressly, R-Shreveport, who sponsored the abortion drug law, declined to comment on Carlson’s bill, saying he had not yet reviewed the legislation.
Earlier this year, a grand jury indicted a Port Allen mother for allegedly giving her minor teen daughter abortion medication. The Illuminator is not identifying the mother to protect her daughter’s privacy. 
The grand jury also indicted the New York physician who allegedly wrote and shipped the prescription to Louisiana. Gov. Kathy Hochul has cited her state’s shield laws and refused to extradite Dr. Margaret Carpenter. 
The mother pleaded not guilty in March. Prosecutors have repeatedly claimed she “coerced” her daughter into taking the abortion medication by threatening to kick her out of the house if she didn’t. However, prosecutors notably did not seek an indictment related to the crime of coerced abortion, given the current definition. 
The allegations against her are covered under the expanded definition in Carlson’s bill because the incident could be considered “exploitation of needs for shelter.” 
Louisiana Right to Life told WWNO-FM its staff helped draft Carlson’s bill, claiming it’s “common ground for most Louisianians.” The anti-abortion organization, which also helped draft Pressly’s bill, has called the Port Allen case an example of why the definition of coerced abortion needs to be expanded.
Carlson’s proposed legislation would punish anyone who commits the crime with a $5,000 fine or imprisonment with or without hard labor for up to five years. 
Carlson was unavailable for an interview Monday.

A proposal (HB 841) that would allow employees earn less than the minimum wage for work-study, internships, pre-apprenticeship programs, or “other similar work-based learning opportunities” advanced Monday in its final committee in the Florida House and will now go the floor for a vote.
The bill says that the employee’s decision to opt-out must be voluntary and that an employer cannot coerce an employee to do so or condition an offer of employment on his or her decision. The minimum wage in Florida is $13 an hour.
That dollar figure comes via a 2020 constitutional amendment that calls for raising the state’s minimum wage by $1 every year until it reaches $15 per hour in September 2026.
“An unintended consequence of Florida’s constitutional minimum wage is that it cripples an employer’s ability to provide more opportunities for unskilled workers in areas of pre-apprenticeship and education,” said Ocala Republican Rep. Ryan Chamberlain in describing his bill. “This is having an impact on our young people and those seeking retraining in other, more profitable fields of work.”
The bill says that an employee’s waiver is only valid for 12 months after the start of employment. And it says that such work-based learning opportunities may not last more than 9 months or two full-time semesters consisting of at least 15 credit hours each.
North Florida Democratic Rep. Franklin Gallop asked Chamberlain what could ensure that an employee wasn’t being pressured or coerced into “voluntarily” agreeing to work for a lower than minimum wage?
Chamberlain said it would be illegal to coerce someone “in that manner.” However, the proposal does not say who would be the arbiter, or what penalties could incur for such coercion.
The measure is supported by the business community.
“It’s a new avenue to find more qualified workers,” said Tim Nungesser, legislative director for the Florida office of the National Federation of Independent Business. “The bill is limited. The bill is voluntary. If a worker doesn’t want to participate, they don’t have to.”
‘More ways to pay less’
Paul Cox, an Orlando stagehand, said the bill asks Floridians to waive their constitutional rights to a minimum wage.
“Florida does not need more ways to pay less. Especially when a supermajority of voters passed this amendment in 2020. It needs stronger protections. Better enforcement. Better support for recognized apprenticeships and a commitment to economic fairness. Job training is valuable, but it should not come at the expense of eroding wage rights for all Floridians.”
South Florida Democratic Rep. Felicia Robinson said that in the current economic climate, “I cannot see someone working for less than the minimum wage. Period.”
The federal minimum wage is set at $7.25 an hour, a figure that hasn’t moved since 2009. The minimum wage in Florida for tipped employees is $9.98 an hour. The federal minimum for tipped workers is $2.12.
The bill passed mostly along party lines in the GOP-controlled House Commerce Committee, 14-6.
The companion bill in the Senate (SB 676), filed by Lee County Republican Jonathan Martin, has one more stop in the Rules Committee before reaching the floor of that chamber.

Senate File 167 sets the State Supplemental Aid (SSA) rate for the upcoming fiscal year. SSA is the growth rate for public K-12 school funding, allocated to schools on a per-pupil basis.
The Senate, and Gov. Kim Reynolds, had put forward the 2% SSA rate. But in February, the Iowa House returned the legislation to the Senate after increasing the SSA rate from 2% to 2.25%. The House amendment also added other funding components like a $10 increase to the state cost per pupil, changes to transportation equity aid payment and weighting for school districts with shared operational costs, as well as a one-time allocation of $22.6 million to help school districts with rising costs and the impacts of inflation.

Since the House vote Feb. 18, the measure did not seen public discussion again before Monday, April 7. Lawmakers had already failed to meet their self-imposed deadline to pass school funding within 30 days of the governor’s budget release, in addition to failing to pass the measure before school districts’ budget proposals were due in early March. However, there are still a few weeks before the school districts’ final budgets must be submitted to the state by April 30.
House Speaker Pat Grassley told reporters in several news conferences that House Republicans were committed to providing some additional funding supports for Iowa K-12 schools, components that were part of the hold-up in passing this year’s SSA rate.
“We understand that we may not get all of those things that we include in our bill, but we’d be hopeful that there’d be at least some consideration,” Grassley told reporters in late March. “Whether it’s operational sharing, whether it’s some one-time, inflationary factors — we continue to be hopeful that at some point in time enough Iowans engaging in this conversation will at least put some of those things on the table.”
The gridlock ended Monday as Senate Republicans returned with an amendment that set the SSA rate at 2%, but included some components of the House amendment. The $22.6 million appropriation was removed, and the proposed raise to the state cost per pupil was lowered from $10 to $5. While the House language gave a standing unlimited appropriation for transportation equity aid payment beginning in fiscal year 2026 to make sure the statewide adjusted transportation cost per pupil was not lower than the statewide average cost, the Senate language set a 5% rate for payments to the transportation equity fund per pupil.
Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, said that with the amendment, the spending package represents a $238.1 million increase for K-12 schools compared to FY 2025. Of that increase, $126.8 million will go to public schools, $96.8 million to the state’s Education Savings Account (ESA) program, providing public funds for private school costs, and $14.5 million for charter schools.
Evans said that the proposal provides “responsible and sustainable funding for local school districts.” He emphasized that Republicans have steadily increased school funding in Iowa, and that K-12 spending will make up 44.7% of the state’s budget in FY 2026 at $4.2 billion.
“This bill makes a promise to local school districts that can be kept,” Evans said.
During debate on the SSA rate, Democrats have repeatedly called for their GOP colleagues — who control both chambers — to set a higher rate in 2025. The minority party argued that the 2% rate will put more than 150 Iowa school districts on the budget guarantee process, which will trigger property tax increases to meet funding obligations that the SSA rate does not cover.
Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, said Republicans’ SSA proposal was “shameful” and that the proposal will result in either higher property taxes or school staff cuts.
“This is really personal to me,” Trone Garriott said. “My kids go to one of these schools where we are going to see cuts. My school is on this list. Property taxes are going to have to go up just to scrape by. Meanwhile, parents like me get to see up close and personal, the people who are going to lose their job, the great teachers that are going to go elsewhere, the programs that are getting cut, the class sizes that are getting larger, the opportunities that are getting missed because this body and the state Legislature won’t invest in the majority of Iowa’s kids through our public schools.”
Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, criticized the measure as a part of legislative Republicans’ and Reynolds’ larger budgeting strategy which she said prioritizes private school students through the Education Savings Account (ESA) program over the majority of Iowa students who attend public K-12 schools. The ESA program, which provides students with public funds equal to the SSA per-pupil funding rate for private school tuition and associated costs, will be open to all Iowa students with no family income limits beginning in the 2025-2026 school year.
Petersen said the governor’s five-year projections for the state’s finances show repeated dips into the state’s Taxpayer Relief Fund that she said directly align with spending on the ESA program, championed by Reynolds in 2023.
“When you look at this budget … 92% of our school-age children that go to public schools are going to get an measly increase, because you have invested millions and millions of dollars for very small number of families to receive private school vouchers and corporate tax cuts,” Petersen said. “There is still time to address that, where we could put millions more into our public school districts instead of handing them over to wealthy families who are already sending their kids to private schools, I would encourage a no vote on this legislation. It is not enough.”
Evans said the amended bill is an increased investment in Iowa’s K-12 system, and also represents a focus on keeping educational funding with K-12 students rather than with school districts.
“We believe it’s important to be honest with our school districts about the state’s finances and not overpromise,” Evans said. “This bill continues our focus of funding students over systems. This proposal continues to demonstrate our commitment to education, dedicated funding to help students in the educational setting that is best for them and will prepare them for future success.”
The legislation returns to the Iowa House.

The same review said employees with the parish jail committed fraud totaling more than $210,000. Discovery of their actions ultimately led to their arrest and prosecution.
According to the audit, JPSO received a change request for the agency’s online banking information for its sales tax revenue account. Its accounting department and tax collector bureau executive staff, not realizing the request was a bogus “phishing” scheme, made the change. As a result, wire transfers totaling $1,106,085 were made from the tax receipts fund to a bank account outside the sheriff’s office.
An investigation into the bank fraud continues, and the suspect behind the scheme is unknown, according to the JPSO. As of Dec. 30, the sheriff’s office has recovered almost $293,000 of the money taken.
Separately, a correctional officer at the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center allegedly received more than $84,000 in overtime for work he didn’t perform, the internal audit said. Curtis Lamar III, 44, of New Orleans, faces one county of felony theft. He has pleaded not guilty, and his next court date is in May, according to Jefferson Parish court records.
The other alleged scheme revealed in the audit involved a clerk at the jail who is said to have pocketed more than $130,000 from people paying cash to have someone released from the correctional center. Anetra Parker, 50, of New Orleans, was arraigned last week on a felony theft charge. Her plea was not yet posted in online court records.     
These findings were included in an internal audit LaPorte CPAs performed for the sheriff’s office covering the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2024. State law requires such audits be forwarded to the Louisiana Legislative Auditor, which released the audit report Monday.
The sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to the Illuminator’s request for comment, though the audit included brief details on JPSO’s plans to ensure the fraud isn’t repeated in the future.
With regards to online banking access, the department will implement a plan to properly confirm account change information. It will also create a more stringent overtime review process, add another layer of reconciliation for its cash bail receipts and take additional monitoring measures.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1716188281-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-07 18:11:52.536464

(Stock photo by Greenleaf123/Getty Images)A multi-county court jurisdiction that saw civil and divorce trials paused for about a year because of judicial vacancies faces the risk of a similar stoppage, a top court administrator told lawmakers Monday.
The warning from Judge Michael Blee, the courts’ acting administrative director, comes as bench vacancies edge upward following a confirmation blitz at the start of 2024. There are now 49 judicial vacancies statewide, nearly 20 more than court officials say the system can handle.
Blee warned that while vacancies impose additional stresses on judges, the greater peril is for those awaiting their time in court.
“Imagine your family members are going through that process, or perhaps yourself. There’s children involved. There is no closure. Perhaps someone is in another relationship and wants to start their new life. They sit and languish,” Blee told the Assembly Budget Committee Monday.
The jurisdiction in question, called Vicinage 13, covers Hunterdon, Somerset, and Warren counties. New Jersey Supreme Court Chief Justice Stuart Rabner ordered a halt to civil and divorce trials there in February 2023 because there were not enough judges to hear them, an order he lifted in March 2024.
Only two of the state’s 49 judicial vacancies are in Vicinage 13, though Kevin Shanahan, the vicinage’s assignment judge, told lawmakers he expects at least one additional vacancy there by the start of May, with the possibility of a second judge departing early.
Shanahan warned that even a small number of vacancies could cause severe disruptions in his jurisdiction.
“In a vicinage like mine — three counties with a relatively small number of assigned judges — a vacancy in Vicinage 13 is probably the equivalent of two-and-a-half vacancies in a larger county,” Shanahan told the panel.
The Assembly, which is the first chamber to take budget testimony from the judiciary this year, plays no formal role in filling judicial vacancies. Candidates for judgeships are nominated by the governor and confirmed by the Senate.
The judges’ warnings, now delivered to lawmakers on an annual basis, are their latest call for legislators to staff up the courts. Judiciary officials have said the courts can operate sustainably with up to 30 vacancies. Blee on Monday said the courts could “could live with 25” vacancies.
Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) last March declared the state’s yearslong judicial vacancy crisis was at an end after numerous confirmations in early 2024 brought judicial vacancies down from 58 at the start of that year to 39.
But the pace of confirmations has slowed significantly in the intervening months. Senators confirmed two dozen judges between May 20, 2024, and the Senate’s most recent voting session on March 24. They confirmed the same number of judges between Jan. 1 and April 9 of last year.
The Senate Judiciary Committee, which must advance judicial nominations before they come to a vote before the full Senate, is not scheduled to meet in April, which legislators typically devote to budget hearings.
At least four judges are anticipated to leave their posts in May, a court spokesperson told the New Jersey Monitor.
The growing number of vacancies could waylay an effort to bring the judiciary’s backlog down to prepandemic levels.
Pandemic disruptions and judicial vacancies catapulted the number of backlogged cases to 97,028 in the fall of 2021. The courts have made significant progress in reducing the backlog, which fell to 41,433 in February, according to a courts website. 
“We have staff, judges constantly looking at our cases constantly trying to determine oldest to youngest, prioritizing, trying to move things,” Blee said. “It’s a difficult task, but it’s something — as I mentioned: Justice delayed is justice denied.”
The court marks a case as backlogged if the matter has not been heard within a period of time set by the judiciary. The length of that period varies depending on the type of case.

Laura Kelly, pictured here in February 2023, announced Monday she vetoed legislation that eliminates protections for LGBTQ+ youth in Kansas' foster care and adoption systems, but Republicans, who could override the veto later this week, say the bill expands religious expression for adoptive and foster care parents. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed a bill that bans policies requiring adopted and foster parents to affirm a child’s sexual orientation or gender identity if it conflicts with the parents’ religious or moral beliefs.
House Bill 2311 would forbid the secretary of the Kansas Department for Children and Families from placing children in homes based on a guardian’s beliefs on sexual orientation or gender identity, which opponents said could leave LGBTQ+ young people in Kansas’ foster care system vulnerable to prejudicial households. The legislation also would allow people to sue DCF for damages and attorney fees if barriers to foster care or adoption were enforced after July 1, when the bill was set to go into effect. 
The governor said Monday the bill detracts from the state’s “best interest of the child” standard.
“Children in need of care already face unique and complex challenges. I will not sign legislation that could further complicate their lives,” Kelly said in a news release. “I also have concerns that this bill could expose the state to frivolous lawsuits and hinder the agency by taking time and resources away from critical services.”
Republican leadership saw the bill differently, characterizing it as a way to ensure foster parents aren’t discriminated against for their religious beliefs. 
In a joint statement, House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, and Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican, called the veto “perplexing” because, in their view, the legislation would extend First Amendment protections to foster parents. 
The veto cannot stand, they said.
“Our foster care system depends on strong and stable families to care for the children in our system,” they said. “The last thing any administration should be doing is discriminating against qualified families due to their religious and moral beliefs.”
The bill has been framed as a freedom of religious expression issue, but it also targets LGBTQ+ children in the state’s foster care and adoption systems. Proponents argued religious foster parents shouldn’t have to bury their beliefs to adopt or act as foster parents, but opponents say LGBTQ+ kids in the foster care system deserve loving, accepting families. 
House Minority Leader Rep. Brandon Woodard, a Lenexa Democrat, thanked Kelly for the veto, describing the bill as “potentially harmful” because it would “allow adoption and foster care agencies to prioritize religious beliefs over the best interests of children.”
LGBTQ+ youth report disproportionately higher rates of depression, suicide and bullying than their peers. The Trevor Project, one of the nation’s leading LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations, conducts an annual national survey on the mental health of LGBTQ+ youths, which in 2024 showed that  63% of LGBTQ+ young people surveyed in Kansas said they’ve been discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or gender identity in the past year.
“LGBTQ+ young people who reported living in very accepting communities attempted suicide at less than half the rate of those who reported living in very unaccepting communities,” the organization’s 2024 survey found.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska statehouse is set to debate a bill and perhaps a related constitutional amendment Tuesday seeking to alter how the state awards Electoral College votes for president.  
Legislative Bill 3 was pushed out of the Government, Military, and Veterans Affairs Committee on March 10, after pressure from the governor, whose political future with President Donald Trump could depend on whether he delivers winner-take-all. Despite this week’s political theater and pressure from state and nationwide Republicans, the bill and the separate constitutional amendment are likely dead on arrival.

State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City is unlikely to have the 33 votes needed to overcome a promised filibuster. The same holdouts from earlier in the legislative session haven’t budged from opposing the change. As of Monday afternoon, Lippincott said he doesn’t yet have the votes for LB 3. 
“I have not seen any change, but I remain hopeful,” Lippincott told the Nebraska Examiner.  
Nebraska is one of just two states — Maine is the other — that parcel out some electoral votes to the winner of the presidential popular vote in each congressional district. The district approach, adopted in Nebraska in 1991, has led to Democrats claiming a single electoral vote from the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District three times — in 2008, 2020, and 2024. Republicans have won the rest, including two for winning statewide.
The Nebraska Democratic Party, which has dubbed the 2nd District the “Blue Dot,” calls LB 3 and the related constitutional amendment an attempt to “suppress the voices of Nebraskans” and said it would “work hard to ensure this bill fails.” Some rural Republicans have shared concerns about one day losing “their voice” under winner-take-all as the state becomes more urban and suburban over time.
Political theater meets vote reality
Gov. Jim Pillen is using the same tactic he did with the Government Committee, which he pressed to advance the bill to the floor for debate. On Thursday, he released a statement on X saying all Unicameral Republicans need to “stand together as a team.” Republicans hold 33 of the 49 seats in the officially nonpartisan Legislature.
“President Trump has called for the restoration of WTA, as have the majority of Nebraskans across our state.” Pillen wrote in the post. “I call upon our Republican Senators to answer this call and vote to advance WTA. In particular, I hope that veteran Senator Merv Riepe stands with his fellow Republicans on this critical issue.”

State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, who often proves a pivotal vote on controversial legislation, has been the loudest holdout on winner-take-all. He was one of the holdouts Trump called in 2024, when the then-presidential candidate was trying to convince senators to support Pillen’s 11th-hour push for winner-take-all.
Two months before the 2024 election, Pillen held a meeting on winner-take-all at the Governor’s Mansion with at least two dozen Republican state senators about securing support and trying to convince holdouts. The push was killed by then-State Sen. Mike McDonnell of Omaha, a former Democrat and union leader who had pledged when he changed parties and became a Republican to keep the status quo but flirted with changing his mind. McDonnell decided not to support the change, saying he didn’t want to disrupt the money and attention that presidential politics brings to the Omaha area. He has since been term-limited from office and lost a recent primary bid for Omaha mayor.
With McDonell term-limited and replaced by State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, Riepe is taking the brunt of the political pressure this go-round. He reaffirmed his stance and intent to vote against the bill and the constitutional amendment during a mini press conference Thursday, saying his voters had expressed their appreciation for how the state stands out because of its electoral system.
“I feel like my family name is on the line,” Riepe told reporters.
  State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont. Feb. 11, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, who voted to advance the bill out of committee, is also likely to vote no but has expressed interest in letting the voters decide via the proposed state constitutional amendment, LR24CA. State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams has proposed that approach, which the committee also advanced to the floor. LR24CA is not scheduled for debate Tuesday but could be discussed as a potential fallback position. 
“At minimum, WTA deserves a fair up-or-down vote on its merits by the people’s representatives, not to be smothered by a filibuster led by ultra-liberal Democrats,” Pillen said in last week’s statement. 
Another indicator of the bill’s difficult path is that Speaker John Arch of La Vista announced he is limiting floor debate on LB 3 to four hours Thursday, because most members have already determined how they will vote. Typical bills are given eight hours on the first round of debate. 
“I do not believe a drawn-out eight-hour debate benefits this body or anyone on either side of the issue,” he said.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln has already filed motions to indefinitely postpone, bracket, and send the bill back to committee before Tuesday’s debate, a hint that Democrats and others opposed to the change are prepared to follow through on a promised filibuster.  
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha told Nebraska Public Media that the LB 3 debate would be a waste of time because the proposal lacks support. 
“The people in the state of Nebraska have been clear that they like the system that we use,” Cavanaugh said. 
 Maine offsetting Nebraska

Recently, a Democratic state lawmaker in Maine proposed a bill in their state’s Legislature that would move Maine back to winner-take-all if Nebraska switches as a way of “protecting” Maine’s voices and voters.
  State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln. Jan. 28, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Riepe said that Maine’s push to change the system would offset any “advantage” Republicans would gain if Nebraska switched to winner-take-all. He added that he wished more states did their Electoral College system by district because “it’s closer to a popular vote.”
 “I’m not ready to give up on that,” Riepe said. 
The state’s Republicans have pushed for winner-take-all for decades. The effort gained new steam after Trump and surrogates expressed support during his 2024 campaign. Now, with Trump back in the White House and his grip on GOP politics strengthened, people in Pillen’s orbit have said he wants to make sure Trump does not endorse Trump donor and friend Charles Herbster in the 2026 GOP primary for governor if Herbster runs. 
Pillen defeated Herbster in the 2022 GOP primary for governor despite Herbster having Trump’s endorsement. But he had help from then-Gov. Pete Ricketts, now a U.S. senator. 
Debate over LB3 is set to begin by 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current) The Massachusetts company accused of illegally dumping contaminated soil during construction of the Route 6/10 Interchange in Providence five years ago says it is the unwitting victim of a scheme involving extortion and bribery orchestrated by a now-defunct competitor.
That’s according to a lawsuit filed March 27 in Providence County Superior Court by Canton-based Barletta Heavy Division Inc., which claims the company was sabotaged and now no longer able to obtain work in Rhode Island.
Barletta put the blame mainly on Stephen Cardi, the former treasurer of the defunct Cardi Corp., along with International Union of Operating Engineers Local 57 President Jim White. The company claims the two men bribed workers to defame and destroy its reputation, violating state racketeering laws.
“In conspiracy with Cardi, Local 57, upon information and belief, implanted certain loyalists on Barletta job sites to cause chaos, create disruption, and to otherwise sabotage projects and taint Barletta’s reputation as a general contractor,” the lawsuit claims.
Cardi and White did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Barletta is requesting the Superior Court find Cardi and Local 57 liable for trespassing, tortious interference, and violating the state’s racketeering law. The Massachusetts contractor also seeks monetary damages, though the lawsuit does not state how much Barletta has lost out as a result of the alleged conspiracy.
Tortious interference is the legal term for intentionally damaging someone else’s contractual or business relationships with others, causing economic harm.
In January 2023, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha charged Barletta with two counts of illegal disposal of solid waste, one count of operating a solid waste management facility without a license, and one count of providing a false document to a public official.
Contaminated fill from the Boston and the Pawtucket/Central Falls Transit Center was allegedly used in the ongoing $247 million highway project near Providence’s Olneyville neighborhood, according to the AG’s office.
That felony case remains ongoing in Providence Superior Court, where a trial is tentatively set to start June 9.
Barletta’s 6/10 project former superintendent pleaded guilty in federal court in December 2022 to three counts of making a false statement in connection with a federally funded highway project. He was sentenced to one year probation and ordered to pay a $40,000 fine. 
In April 2023, Barletta signed an agreement to be voluntarily excluded from bidding on federally funded projects while criminal charges were pending in court.
Barletta claims it honored its contractual obligations and permit granted from the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) and that the soil did not contain levels of contamination exceeding the state’s standards.
Complaints over the soil surfaced in the summer of 2020 after workers voiced concerns about excessive dust. A test paid for by Local 57 found toxins at unacceptable levels.
Barletta claims state officials determined the soil posed no threat to public health. DEM spokesperson Kimberly Keough deferred a request for confirmation to the state’s Department of Health, whose spokesperson acknowledged Rhode Island Current’s inquiry
Barletta said such tests were done because White allegedly trespassed to collect soil samples, which were then analyzed under the guise of residential and/or home purposes. The company claims the testing and alleged trespassing was done by White and Cardi to create conflict with Barletta’s contracts and relationships with owners, according to the lawsuit.
Barletta claims the controversy surrounding the 6/10 project harmed its reputation and prevented it from obtaining new work in Rhode Island, including damaging its prospects in rehabilitating the westbound Washington Bridge.
Barletta’s lawsuit claims Cardi had told company leaders that he would instruct Local 57 to make the soil controversy “go away” if it withdrew its bid to renovate the westbound section of Intestate 195 during the initial bid process in 2020.
Cardi Corp. won the contract, but the state put the project back out to bid after the Federal Highway Administration refused to sign off on the agreement. The award was then given to a joint venture between Barletta and Warwick-based Aetna Bridge Co. — the most recent contractors to work on the bridge’s rehabilitation before the state closed down the highway in December 2023 because it was at risk of collapse.
Barletta is among 13 contractors the state is suing for doing negligent work on the westbound Washington Bridge. Seven defendants, including Barletta, tried to get the case dismissed, but Judge Brian Stern denied their petitions on Feb. 27.

Laura Kelly signed legislation that sets up a process for Kansans to recover damages from wildfires and fires caused by electric public utility companies. (Allison Kite/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly signed several bipartisan bills, including House Bill 2107, which offers Kansans a process to recover damages from wildfires and fires caused by electric public utilities.
The state faces higher wildfire dangers this year with a weak La Niña weather system, according to a Kansas State University agronomy report. The state tends to see almost triple the number of acres burned during La Niña weather systems than El Niño.

“Kansas is no stranger to the risks and impacts of wildfires,” Kelly said in a press release. “The changes included in this bill will help better prepare utility companies to identify and mitigate wildfire risks. By taking reasonable measures, we can better protect Kansans and provide a path to recover from the financial impacts of wildfires.”


HB 2107 also sets up a legal structure to allow Kansans to pursue compensation for damages from a wildfire or fire event determined to be caused by a utility provider. Claims under the bill must be made within two years of the date of damage.


“HB 2107 will ensure that utilities will be able to identify cost-eﬀective strategies for wildfire preparedness and implement solutions that protect Kansas communities while maintaining aﬀordable energy for consumers,” said Rep. Leo Delperdang, R-Wichita. “Like any other business, utility companies must be able to operate with a strong but fair legal climate that provides recourse for those damaged but also protects against excessive verdicts that could negatively impact the financial health of an industry crucial to Kansas residents, businesses, and industry. House Bill 2107 effectively balances those interests.”


In an effort to better prepare the state and Kansas communities for wildfires, the bill also requires the Kansas Corporation Commission to convene a workshop on wildfire risks, utility readiness to mitigate wildfires, risk mitigation strategies and cost recovery for the impacts caused by wildfires.


In addition to HB 2107, Governor Kelly also signed the following bipartisan bills:


House Bill 2120: Authorizes the State Board of Regents to sell and convey certain real property on behalf of Kansas State University and Kansas State University Veterinary Medical Center.


House Bill 2109: Exempts public utilities from civil liability relating to the attachment, access, operation, maintenance or removal of law enforcement equipment on structures owned by the utility.


House Bill 2052: Streamlines the process for an individual with a provisional concealed carry license to request a standard license and addresses requirements that specifically identify off duty law enforcement officers that are conceal carrying. Off-duty law enforcement officers, who are allowed to carry a concealed handgun into any building where they could carry if they were in uniform, would not have to give personal information to anyone in the building requesting or requiring it.


House Bill 2040: Extends the time the Kansas Corporation Commission has to make a final order on a transmission line siting application, from 120 days to 180 days. This allows time for additional landowner and stakeholder input.


House Bill 2037: Updates membership of the Council on Travel and Tourism from 17 entities to 20, with three appointees being made by the governor from the National Independent Venue Association, the Kansas Museums Association and the Kansas Sampler Foundation.

On Friday [&#8230;]","Photo illustration by Getty Images.When a wheel broke on Jonathan St. Goddard’s tractor in late March, the nearest replacement he could find was in Saskatchewan for $1,253. When he brought back it back to Montana, he was slapped with a $308 tariff for the equipment, part of an expansive array of tariffs ordered by the Trump administration.
On Friday in federal court, St. Goddard, along with state Sen. Susan Webber, D-Browning, filed a lawsuit in federal court asking a judge for an injunction against Trump’s tariffs on Canada, arguing that it violates the treaty rights of Indigenous people across the nation, and saying that only Congress can approve tariffs, not the president, according to the U.S. Constitution.
The lawsuit centers on the Jay Treaty signed in 1794, ratified by Congress and signed into law by then-President George Washington, which exempted tribes along the United States-Canadian border from being taxed or levied on goods between the nations. The lawsuit, filed in the Great Falls division of Montana’s federal courts, says that the 49th parallel, the longest continuous running border in the world between two nations, bisects more than 30 tribes whose ancestral lands span both countries. In addition to the Blackfeet tribe, other tribes split by the border include the Lakota, Salish, and Iroquois.
Montana has 14 border crossings with Canada, spanning three provinces, British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan.
The lawsuit asks the court to halt the tariffs that affect Canada, or if not, declare that the emergency orders that implemented the tariffs be declared void for tribal members because they violate the 1794 treaty rights, which were ratified by Congress.
“The imposition of universal tariffs in the Canada Orders is an unconstitutional attempt by the executive to regulate commerce and violates plaintiffs’ constitutional and treaty rights,” the lawsuit said.
St. Goddard and Webber are being represented by Missoula lawyer Monica Tranel.
But the lawsuit doesn’t just focus on the treaty rights, it also challenges the Trump administration’s ability to use emergency powers to impose tariffs. Trump has declared that the fentanyl drug crisis at America’s borders have forced a national emergency.
“The plain language of the (International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977) does not include the power to ‘tariff’ or to ‘tax.’ The powers enumerated in the statute are extensive and specific. Omission of tariffs is significant given how clearly Congress referenced tariff authorities in other trade statutes. The IEEPA has been the basis for over 60 executive orders. It has never been used to impose tariffs,” the court filing said.
The lawsuit said that only Congress has the power to negotiate treaties and trade agreements.
While the Trump administrations has used the fentanyl problem to impose the tariffs, the lawsuit also contends that the tariffs have not targeted the problem. For example, Customs and Border Patrol intercepted 9,600 kilograms coming from Mexico, but only 19 kilograms of fentanyl from Canada.
“The executive orders do not address the differential or attempt to target the harm, they simply impose blanket tariffs on all borders without reference to the factual situation or any attempt to explain how universal tariffs, which are functioning like sanctions, will actually address the stated emergency,” the lawsuit stated.  “There is no link between the stated national security threat of imports from steel and aluminum and a 25% tariff on all goods, including a replacement tractor wheel necessary to continue farming and ranching.”
The lawsuit also said that Montana’s tourism and agricultural sectors will be harmed by the tariffs, two key industries for the state, and essential to Montana’s tribal nations.
“Tourism reservations are cancelled, contracting jobs are off, farm and ranch operations have been thrown into high unpredictability, and businesses cannot plan,” the lawsuit said. “The growing, tourism, and construction season is short in Montana. It cannot withstand see-saw tariffs that are on one day and higher the next.”
Montana Farmers Union filed a declaration in favor of the lawsuit, saying that tariffs had the ability to hurt the farming and ranching community because of the trade between Canada and Montana, especially in the northern part of the state.
“Many Montana farmers’ closest suppliers and buyers are just across the Canadian border. Farmers are going to get caught both ways by tariffs on both side of the borders instead of being able to rely on the historical network of businesses and family that have helped to spread their risk and workload,” said Walt Schweitzer, executive director of the Montana Farmers Union.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-158909292-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-04-07 18:11:52.536464

Free.,Markets worldwide take another dive as Trump threatens higher tariffs on China,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/markets-worldwide-take-another-dive-trump-threatens-higher-tariffs-china,,"WASHINGTON — Global markets plummeted Monday for the third consecutive trading day since President Donald Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs — and the administration gave mixed signals on meeting other nations at the negotiating table.U.S. stocks reacted positively to a short-lived, incorrect report amplified on social media that Trump may pause the tariffs for 90 days, but the market plunged quickly when the White House dismissed the claim as “FAKE NEWS.”Any upward progress was erased upon Trump’s announcement that he planned to further punish China starting Wednesday.At about 11:15 a.m. Eastern Trump threatened to raise tariffs on China a further 50% if the country does not back down on its retaliatory 34% tax on U.S. imports by Tuesday. If left unresolved, the latest U.S.-China trade war will hit American farmers, particularly soybean producers.Writing on his platform Truth Social, Trump said “Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately.”The administration maintains more than 50 countries have reached out to negotiate.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote on X that Trump has tasked him to negotiate with Japan, which could face a 24% levy beginning Thursday.“Japan remains among America’s closest allies, and I look forward to our upcoming productive engagement regarding tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers, currency issues, and government subsidies. I appreciate the Japanese government’s outreach and measured approach to this process,” Bessent wrote on the social media platform.“China has chosen to isolate itself by retaliating and doubling down on previous negative behavior,” Bessent added.European Union’s stanceMeanwhile, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she has offered the U.S. zero-for-zero tariffs on industrial goods.“But we are also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests,” von der Leyen said Monday at a press conference.Trump slapped a 20% tax on goods from the EU, set to take effect Thursday, on top of 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that began in mid-March. A 25% tariff on all foreign cars imported to the U.S. also launched Thursday.The EU is poised to impose retaliatory duties on American products in response to the import taxes. The bloc of 27 nations is scheduled to vote Wednesday on a list of U.S. goods to be taxed at its borders.When asked by reporters in the Oval Office Monday if the EU offer was enough to scale back the tariffs, Trump said “No, it’s not.”Journalists had gathered in the Oval Office for Trump’s meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who visited to discuss Trump’s new 17% tax on his country’s imports.Netanyahu promised to “eliminate” his country’s trade deficit with the U.S.""We intend to do it very quickly. We think it's the right thing to do and we're going to also eliminate trade barriers, a variety of trade barriers that have been put up unnecessarily. And I think Israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same,"" Netanyahu said.When asked by reporters if he intends to lower the tariffs on Israel, Trump said, “Maybe not.”“We give Israel billions of dollars a year,” he added.The meeting was streamed on C-SPAN.‘Let’s take the deal’Two Republican senators publicly urged Trump on social media to take the EU offer.Sen. Mike Lee of Utah wrote, “Let’s take that deal! Much to gain.”“Totally agree,” Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin replied. “At some point you have to take YES for an answer.”Another Senate Republican, Ted Cruz of Texas, has publicly criticized Trump’s steep levies on almost every nation around the globe.A bipartisan effort to claw back power from the president’s near-unilateral authority to impose tariffs might not get far, despite the economic uncertainty unleashed since Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” plan.Legislation co-sponsored by Democrat Maria Cantwell of Washington and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa would require the president to notify lawmakers prior to new tariffs from the White House and limit the levies to a 60-day window unless Congress approves an extension.Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota seemed to shut down the idea Monday, according to reporters on Capitol Hill.“I don’t think that has a future. The president has indicated he will veto it. I don’t see how they get it to the floor on the House,” Thune told Politico.A companion bill in the House is sponsored by Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska.Chances of House Speaker Mike Johnson bringing the bill to the floor are likely slim, as the Louisiana Republican supported Trump’s tariff unveiling in person last week.",,,,2025-04-07 18:11:52.536464

(Photo by Marco Lozzi for Utah News Dispatch)In the hallway to former congresswoman Mia Love’s memorial on Monday, dozens of pictures immortalized countless moments of a full life; they show her hugging her children, marrying her husband Jason, giving speeches at rallies, and being unable to contain laughter.
Love was the first Black Utahn to be elected to the U.S. Congress after a career in local politics in Saratoga Springs. That made her name widely known in national politics. However, as those photos reflect, Love’s family and friends remember her as the best friend, mom and aunt, and strong, influential figure for those around her.
She died on March 23 at 49 after fighting brain cancer for three years. As hundreds gathered in a Latter-day Saint chapel at the University of Utah’s Institute of Religion for a public funeral, many speakers’ voices cracked as they remembered stories of her life and some of the last moments they shared with Love. They also tried to honor her request to keep moments of glee in her memorial.

Former Utah Rep. Mia Love, America’s first Black Republican congresswoman, dies of cancer at 49

“Mia and I periodically spoke about this moment and the potential of one of us dying early. And as we considered the possibilities again, she would take a jab at me and say, ‘look at how well my family is aging. Remember Jason, black don’t crack,’’ Jason Love said on Monday morning prompting some laughs. “But she made it very clear to me and to our family that she wanted this moment to be a time of celebration.”
And while, inevitably, there were some tears, Love’s family and friends spent the morning quoting her jokes and full extracts of her book “Qualified,” in which she spoke about her story as a daughter of Haitian Immigrants in New York and Connecticut. She recalled how her diverse background gave her a valuable voice, not only for issues that affect minorities, but for all issues and how women, and Black women in particular, should pursue opportunities often taken by white men.
Jason Love remembered how after 11 weeks of radiation and chemotherapy, Love insisted on recording the audio version of that book, a now on-repeat staple in his routine.

“Whether in an elected position or lobbying for policies outside a formal office, I found power in my story, and cannot help but to share it,” Mia Love read in her audio book in a special note for people in minority communities. “The United States of America needs your voice and needs to hear your stories. You are qualified. Find your voice, lead with character and empower others to do the same.”

Love first learned about her brain tumor after experiencing migraines and excruciating pain during a family trip in Puerto Rico. After getting back to Utah, she was diagnosed with glioblastoma, a highly malignant type of brain cancer. Then, doctors said she would live for 10 to 15 months.
“Mia fought cancer valiantly, and this week marks her third year anniversary from her diagnosis,” Jason Love said. “She doubled the life expectancy, in typical Mia Love fashion.”
On March 1, Love’s daughter Abigale shared in a post on X that her cancer wasn’t responding to treatment and was progressing, making her family shift her focus from treatment to enjoying their remaining time together.  
Hundreds come to honor Mia Love ahead of funeral

Many have since gathered at public tributes, including a viewing memorial at the Utah State Capitol on Sunday, in which her husband and children, Alessa, Abigale and Peyton greeted guests ahead of the Monday funeral as Love lay in state. After the service, there was a military service outside the chapel, with a presentation of the American flag in front of Love’s casket. 
Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson witnessed all services from a prime spot. She and Love were close friends, bonded amid campaign conversations and a shared love of the state and the country, Henderson said during the Monday ceremony.
Henderson remembered Love’s clear instructions on how to best help her during her illness.

“‘I’m in fight mode,’ she told us, ‘and what I need from you all, more than anything, is to help me fight it. This is a campaign, and we are going to win. Fight with me. Run with me. Climb that summit with me.’” Henderson said. “And so our job was clear, no doom and gloom, no tears, although we cried many, just not in front of Mia.”
Among all speakers in the service, there were other stories representative of Love’s character; when she was mayor, she made the newly appointed Saratoga Springs city manager carry her purse around as a joke. She also made Lt. Gov. Henderson buy heels in a Tampa store ahead of her speech in the Republican National Convention, which, she indicated, “had to be tall” and had her daughter recite the pledge of allegiance in front of every American flag they encountered when she was a toddler.
Her family and friends also emphasized the message she aimed to spread during her time in public office. 
“Mia’s work is unfinished. It is. And she wanted each of us here today to join her. The adversaries of freedom and righteousness seek to divide us through the natural seams of our fabric of society. They know that if they apply a little bit of pressure to these natural seams of race, of religion, of gender, of income, they know that they can get us divided and they can weaken us,” Jason Love said. “Mia and I believe that there has never been a greater time on this earth in the history of humanity. Let’s listen to what Mia said.”

Free.,U.S. House scraps proposal for new-parent proxy voting,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-scraps-proposal-new-parent-proxy-voting,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna struck a deal this weekend to avoid a floor vote that likely would have changed the chamber’s rules and given new parents the ability to vote by proxy for 12 weeks.Johnson and Luna, both Republicans, plan to use “vote pairing” — where two members on opposite sides of an issue agree to cancel out each other's votes, typically because one lawmaker cannot make it to the floor to vote — rather than move forward with a bipartisan proposal to allow new parents to vote remotely.The deal represented progress for Johnson, who saw the issue torpedo the House agenda last week, though Democrats weren’t on board as of Monday.“Speaker Johnson and I have reached an agreement and are formalizing a procedure called ‘live/dead pairing’—dating back to the 1800s—for the entire conference to use when unable to physically be present to vote: new parents, bereaved, emergencies,” Luna posted on social media.While GOP lawmakers could pair with other members of their own party if they planned to vote differently on a bill, the plan would likely need Democratic buy-in to work on party-line votes.Democrats disappointedColorado Rep. Brittany Pettersen and California Rep. Sara Jacobs, both Democrats, issued statements expressing disappointment with Luna for no longer pushing forward with the discharge petition that was set to force a floor vote this week on the rule change.“When Speaker Johnson refused to bring our resolution to the floor for a vote — regardless of how many Members supported it — we followed the rules and tried to force a vote by filing a discharge petition and received the necessary signatures to bring it forward,” Pettersen wrote. “Instead of letting us vote, he has instead gone to historic lengths to kill our resolution and make sure the large majority of his Members don’t have a voice. Let’s be clear: these changes are not a win for us and Speaker Johnson has turned his back on moms and dads in Congress and working families.”Jacobs wrote the agreement Johnson and Luna reached wouldn’t “support new parents so they can do their jobs and vote on behalf of their constituents while also taking care of themselves and their families.""“I won’t accept the way Congress has always done things, and the American people won’t either,” Jacobs wrote. “We will keep pushing for innovative ways to support young people and parents in Congress – including by modernizing how we vote – even if it takes a Democratic majority to do so.”Jacobs, Luna, Pettersen and their allies from both parties were able to defeat a maneuver from Johnson last week that would have set aside their discharge petition. In response to the defeat, Johnson sent the House home for the week on Tuesday.Floor vote avoidedHad Luna and Johnson not struck a deal this weekend, House rules would have allowed her to force a floor vote this week on the bipartisan Proxy Voting for New Parents Resolution.The discharge petition to bring it up for a vote held signatures from 218 House members, indicating it had the support needed to change the chamber’s rules.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said during a press conference Monday that he “hadn’t had the opportunity to fully evaluate this proposal and/or talk with Rep. Pettersen or Rep. Sarah Jacobs, who have been the leaders of this effort on our side.”“And so I’m going to refrain from commenting on the proposal until I’ve had those conversations and the opportunity to review this so-called agreement,” Jeffries said, before adding he didn’t understand why so many GOP lawmakers were opposed to allowing proxy voting for new parents.“The question has to be raised: What is the Republican problem with allowing expectant mothers or new mothers to vote on behalf of their constituents?” Jeffries asked. “This seems like a very strange hill for them to die on legislatively.""",,,,2025-04-07 18:11:52.536464

Frederica Wilson is alarmed by conditions at Krome North Service Processing Center. (Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Democratic U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson wants to examine conditions at a Miami immigrant detention center, saying she’s concerned about reports of people sleeping on concrete floors.
Wilson, who represents part of Miami-Dade County, sent a letter Monday to Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem requesting her help in arranging a congressional visit this month to the Krome North Service Processing Center.
“I have heard directly from immigration lawyers about the unacceptable conditions at Krome, including reports of individuals sleeping on the concrete floor, detainees being deprived of adequate food, and female detainees being held in a facility designated for men,” Wilson wrote in her letter. “These alarming accounts illustrate the urgent need for me to exercise my duty of congressional oversight and intervention.”
Wilson led a visit to Krome during President Donald Trump’s first term in 2019.
The request followed reports that Felipe Zapata Velásquez, an immigrant on a student visa enrolled at the University of Florida, was arrested on March 28 and taken to Krome for driving with an expired license and registration tag, according to The Independent Florida Alligator.
Zapata Velásquez did not appear in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement online detainee locator system as of Monday afternoon. His mother told Colombian news outlet NTN24 that the student, who had been in the country for six years, had opted to self-deport after immigration officials said he would remain detained while making his case in court.
Gainesville Democratic state Rep. Yvonne Hinson called the arrest saddening.
“Did registration and an expired license fall under the scope of arrest and detainment? After 3 Special Sessions on Immigration and cases such as this, immigrants are under attack now more than ever. We must speak up and not allow this to continue without voicing outrage,” she wrote in a press release.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Friday announced that Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is touring “various locations in Utah, Arizona and New Mexico” between Monday and Wednesday.
The announcement, billed as part of Kennedy’s efforts to “fulfill President Trump’s promise to Make America Healthy Again,” doesn’t specify where in New Mexico he is visiting.
When Source NM asked for more information about Kennedy’s stop in New Mexico, the department said, “There will be no events open to the press in New Mexico.”
On Monday, the department said in a news release that Kennedy would appear on Tuesday morning at a “fireside chat” during the 2025 Tribal Self-Governance Conference in Chandler, Arizona.
Also on Monday, the New York Times published an article centered on Native leaders’ criticism of Kennedy for his reassignment of high-ranking federal health officials to Indian Health Service locations in western states.
The article quotes Deb Haaland, former interior secretary for President Joe Biden, congresswoman, Laguna Pueblo member and Democratic candidate for governor of New Mexico, as saying, “It’s terrible, it’s shameful and it isn’t right.”
Source NM on Monday morning reached out to spokesperson for Haaland’s campaign but had not heard back as of publication time.
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez last week joined other state attorneys general in a legal challenge against Kennedy and the department’s decision to pull $11 billion in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants for infectious disease research, including approximately $60 million to the New Mexico Department of Health.
Democratic U.S. Senator for Hawai‘i Brian Schatz, vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, said Monday that IHS plays a critical role delivering health care to Native communities, and Kennedy’s reassignments do not “look like a serious plan to do that,” and “clearly did not involve Tribal consultation.”
“If this administration truly cared about fixing IHS’s staff vacancy crisis, why did it try to cut the IHS workforce by nearly 1,000 employees just months ago?” Schatz asked in the statement. “Why is it pushing to cut Medicaid, a critical funding source for IHS, to pay for tax cuts for billionaires? And why did it give high-level career employees just hours to decide whether to uproot their lives for jobs they never applied for in places they do not know?”
Schatz added that if the Trump administration actually wants to support IHS, it should ask tribal governments about what their communities need, “not use them as political pawns in its effort to purge the federal workforce in the name of so-called government efficiency.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Senate bills limiting virtual school days and expanding school tutoring are a crucial step closer to becoming law after passing the first House committee stage on Monday.
A House subcommittee focused on education funding approved a lengthy slate of bills in its final meeting of the 2025 legislative session. The bundle of bills now advances to the House Appropriations and Budget Committee for consideration.
The panel advanced one of the Senate’s priority education bills, Senate Bill 758. The legislation would limit public schools to two virtual learning days per academic year, if the state superintendent approves the district’s online instruction plan or if the governor issues a state of emergency in the district.
The bill originated from Sen. Kristen Thompson, R-Edmond, and the Senate’s top lawmaker, President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle.
The House’s No. 2 Republican leader, Speaker Pro Tem Anthony Moore, R-Clinton, presented SB 758 to the subcommittee.

“If we’re serious about actually educating our kids, they need to be in chairs with qualified professionals to help them understand what they’re learning, and that’s the only way they’re going to learn and grow,” Moore said while debating in favor of the bill.
The subcommittee’s two Democrats, Rep. Michelle McCane and Rep. John Waldron, both of Tulsa, voted against the measure. 
McCane said some guardrails on online school days are appropriate but found the limitations in SB 758 too narrow. Waldron said the Legislature should address Oklahoma’s teacher shortage first.
The bill passed 7-4, with dissenting votes from two GOP members — Rep. Toni Hasenbeck, R-Elgin, and Rep. Ronny Johns, R-Ada. Neither spoke against the bill.
The subcommittee advanced another bill that could extend students’ time in classrooms. SB 409 would require districts to add a school day for every increase of $25 million the Legislature adds to the education funding formula, which is the chief driver of state appropriations to public schools.
The panel’s chairperson, Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, said the bill would ensure students benefit from future funding increases. 
The bill’s senate author, Education Committee leader Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, said at the beginning of the legislative session that he filed the bill with the hope of boosting education funding by $125 million, thereby adding another five days to the school year.
Bills to fund tutoring programs advance
Another bill from Moore would dedicate funds for students who need extra help in math. SB 215, called the Oklahoma Math Achievement and Proficiency Act, would require students in second through fifth grade to take three math screening tests each school year. 
Children testing above their grade level would have the option to take an advanced math program. 
Schools would have to develop a math intervention plan, involving remediation and tutoring, within 30 days of a student scoring below grade level.
The bill would cost between $10.2 million and $13.2 million, according to a fiscal impact estimate from House staff. Improving math skills in Oklahoma’s future workforce is worth the investment, Moore said.
National testing found 31% of Oklahoma fourth graders scored proficiently in math and 23% in reading. By eighth grade, levels dropped further to 17% proficiency in math and 20% in reading.
The subcommittee approved the bill with an 8-2 vote.

McCane and Waldron cast the only two votes against the legislation after voicing concerns of adding to teachers’ workload and affording the bill in a tight-budget year.
The two Democrats also were the only to oppose a new K-8 high-dosage tutoring program outlined in SB 245. The bill, which passed unanimously in the Senate, advanced from the House subcommittee 8-2.
The legislation from Sen. Dusty Deevers and Rep. Toni Hasenbeck, both Republicans from Elgin, is expected to cost $7.18 million. 
The bill would pay teachers or hired contractors $1,600 for each cohort of students they tutor per semester in reading or math. Tutors could earn $1,000 for every grade-level increase that each student improves.
Waldron and McCane questioned whether the tutoring sessions would match the quality and methods of instruction provided during school hours.
Hasenbeck said the program would complement Moore’s math achievement bill.
“This bill meets the kids where they are and teaches them the skills they need to have,” she said during Monday’s meeting.
Legislation would improve college access
Two bills earned unanimous support from the subcommittee. 
SB 140 would extend the application window for the Oklahoma’s Promise Scholarship to Dec. 31 of a high school student’s senior year. Students must apply by the end of 11th grade under current law. There is no fiscal impact estimate for the bill.
SB 235 would offer matching funds to districts that give financial aid to employees working toward a college degree in education. These initiatives, known as Grow Your Own Teacher Programs, help aspiring teachers graduate from college and achieve a teaching certification.
The expected fiscal impact from the bill is $5.2 million, said its House author, Rep. Dell Kerbs, R-Shawnee.

Kevin Stitt on Monday doubled down on his criticism of the state’s Forestry Service, accusing the agency of not using “every resource at their disposal to save lives and property” during historic wildfires last month.
The Republican also reiterated a controversial call to consider abolishing the agency that is tasked with preserving the state’s forest and is responsible for wildland fire detection.
“Unfortunately, I learned that the Oklahoma Forestry Services, the agency tasked with preventing and suppressing wildfires, did not use every resource at their disposal to save lives and property,” Stitt said in a statement. “They neglected their duties and left local fire departments begging for further resources to fight fires. This is simply unacceptable.”
Stitt said only “half” of the Forestry Service’s resources were deployed during the state’s worst wildfire outbreak, which he described as “the perfect storm of high winds, low humidity and drought conditions.”
Nearly 158 wildfires swept across the state beginning March 14, killing four and destroying more than 500 homes, including a ranch Stitt owned.
Stitt said Monday that he asked Mark Goeller, the head of the Forestry Service, to “step down” so there could be “a fresh set of eyes” and so the state could “take decisive steps to prevent a tragedy like this from happening in the future.”
Goeller has denied wrongdoing.
“The Agency to which I dedicated over 40 years of my life was said to have performed poorly,” Goeller wrote March 30 on social media. “Preparations were made well in advance, the public was notified of the impending fire danger, firefighting resources were ordered and in place.
“Nothing was held back as the events of the 14th and following days unfolded.”
Stitt last week first suggested abolishing the Forestry Service and providing funds directly to local fire departments, a plan that was swiftly panned by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. 
Several high-ranking lawmakers were highly critical of the suggestion. Many have voiced support for Goeller.
Stitt said he has asked his secretaries of agriculture and public safety, Blayne Arthur and Tricia Everest, respectively, to “assemble a report detailing where our response failed and what can be done to improve that response in the future.”
The report will be completed within a week, he said.

PCBs are a group of man-made chemicals that were previously used in manufacturing products ranging from coolants and lubricants to caulks, paper products, sealants and electrical equipment. They were banned as the chemicals are toxic and can accumulate in organisms, building up in living things over time and passing up through the food chain as other organisms consume contaminated plants and animals. 
 “While PCBs are thankfully no longer manufactured in the United States, their harmful effects continue to contaminate our natural resources, wildlife, and communities,” Nessel said in a statement. “The manufacturers responsible for this damage should be held accountable, not Michigan taxpayers. Pursuing this litigation will ensure that those who profited from the manufacture and sale of these chemicals and who hid the known toxicity and negative impacts of their use are held liable for the lasting damage they caused.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The state has pursued and secured remediation and restoration work at sites where PCBs were used and released into the environment at unsafe levels, and issues Eat Safe Fish guidelines to help protect Michiganders from exposure to PCBs and other chemicals. 
However, Nessel’s office said there are areas where too little work — or no work at all — is being done to clean up PCB contamination and restore the state’s resources.
The Department of Attorney General is seeking proposals from attorneys and law firms with experience and interest in pursuing constitutional, statutory, tort and other applicable common law claims against manufacturers of toxic chemicals that ended up in the environment. 
Contracts will be awarded based on the best value to the state, considering qualifications, experience, abilities, capacity and cost-effectiveness. Nessel will make the final decision based on recommendations from department staff in order to ensure an objective selection process and maintain bidder anonymity.  
The Department of Attorney General will post a notice to its website when the selection has been made. The selected law firms will be compensated on a contingency basis.
More information on how to submit a proposal is available at the Department of Attorney General’s website. The deadline for submissions is May 5, 2025.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/DSC_0901-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-04-07 17:09:05.086401

“I’m concerned for what an extremely radical court is going to do over the next three years, and I will be spending the next several weeks assessing what happened on Tuesday and figuring out a path to achieving a court that is not led by and dominated by the radical left, that gets back to deciding cases under the law and respecting the constitution,” Bradley said. 
Liberals have now won four of the last five state Supreme Court elections, all by double digits. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that appeals court judge and former Democratic lawmaker Chris Taylor is considering challenging Bradley in next year’s race. 
Schimel and former Justice Dan Kelly have lost the last three Supreme Court elections after arguing that their liberal opponents are partisan ideologues seeking to legislate from the bench.
Bradley was first appointed to the Court by Gov. Scott Walker in 2015 and elected to a full term in 2016. In recent years she’s been one of the Court’s most right-wing justices. 
In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, she compared restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of the disease to the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II and she sided with President Donald Trump in his unsuccessful effort to have the Court throw out the results of the 2020 election. 
She has often written in her dissents against Court decisions about her belief that the liberal majority is acting politically and said the Court’s liberals are “pursuing a political agenda.”

(Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)COLUMBIA — The state Department of Motor Vehicles has fixed a glitch in its system that automatically disqualified 17-year-olds from registering to vote, ending a legal fight with the state American Civil Liberties Union, the civil rights group announced Monday.
Under state law, teenagers who will turn 18 by Election Day can register to vote up to 13 months in advance. One way of doing so would be for teens to check a box while applying for a driver’s license saying they want to register.
But the state DMV’s system was set up to filter out applicants who weren’t already 18 when they clicked the button, regardless of whether or not they would be old enough to vote by the election. The system did not forward the information of more than 17,000 teenagers to the State Election Commission who would have been eligible to vote by Election Day but didn’t tell them that, according to the state ACLU.
Nearly 1,900 of those teenagers didn’t register any other way, meaning they were out of luck when it came time to vote in November, attorneys for the DMV said previously.
Judge rules against adding 1,900 teens to the voter roll by Election Day

The issue prompted a lawsuit from the ACLU, which unsuccessfully asked a Richland County judge in October to add those voters to the rolls. The group dropped the case in December. But in a March 26 letter, an ACLU attorney threatened to file another lawsuit in federal court arguing the DMV had violated a 1993 federal law requiring the agency help people register to vote.
By that point, the DMV had already fixed the problem, attorney Erin Baldwin said in a March 27 letter to an ACLU attorney.
“Please know that our agency moved as quickly as possible with a very old computer system to achieve the reprogramming necessary to accomplish this goal,” Baldwin wrote in the letter provided to the Gazette.
The DMV will collect information from anyone 16 and older who selects that they would like to register to vote, which it will then send to the state Election Commission. The Election Commission can then register voters who will turn 18 by the election and save the information of those not yet eligible to be registered, Baldwin wrote.
“The SCDMV will continue to work proactively with the State Election Commission to ensure we meet all requirements established in law for voter registration,” DMV spokesman Mike Fitts said in an email.
The ACLU, along with the state League of Women Voters and NAACP, celebrated the change as a win for voters’ rights.
“This victory is a powerful reminder that voting rights are for all,” Brenda Murphy, president of the state NAACP chapter, said in a statement. “When young people have access to the ballot, they drive real change.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/electionday2022-009-1-1024x6831742327334-1.jpg,,,2025-04-07 17:09:05.086401

(Nicole Neri for the Minnesota Reformer)Funding for a nonprofit run by controversial north Minneapolis pastor Jerry McAfee was cut from the latest version of a Senate budget bill after Reformer reporting showed McAfee had been a legal client of Senate President Bobby Joe Champion. 
Champion’s legal work for McAfee, which he said was pro-bono, concluded just prior to the start of the 2023 legislative session, when he successfully steered $3 million in public funds to McAfee’s group.
Last week, Champion introduced another bill allocating $1 million to 21 Days of Peace, the violence prevention group founded by McAfee. That funding has not made it into the current version of the jobs bill being debated by lawmakers.
Starting in 2022, Champion, in his private capacity as an attorney, represented McAfee and his nonprofit Salem Inc. in four court cases involving nonpayment of mortgages on multiple Minneapolis properties, totaling roughly half a million dollars. McAfee refused to tell the Reformer whether he paid Champion for the legal work, but has since told KARE-11 that Champion charged him “not a quarter.”
At the Jobs and Economic Development Committee hearing Monday, Champion told his colleagues that he has no private legal contracts with any of the remaining organizations receiving funding through the bill. 
“One of the challenges that you always have when you live in a community is that you know lots of people, and people always try to make connections in more ways than one,” he said. “I want to assure you I am not representing anyone that is outlined on our sheet, not pro-bono, not for a fee, nothing.”
He further lamented that “one of the most challenging things, always, is when someone seeks to smear your name and come up with what’s written in papers.”
Champion has asked the Senate Subcommittee on Ethics to issue an advisory opinion on whether his actions on behalf of McAfee’s group represented a conflict of interest that should have been disclosed under Senate rules. “There’s no conflict from my vantage point,” he told colleagues on the Jobs and Economic Development Committee.
He has temporarily stepped down as chair of the ethics subcommittee, and has been replaced by Sen. Sandy Pappas, DFL-St. Paul.
Senate Republican Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, told reporters at the Capitol Monday that it was “appropriate” for Champion to step down from the ethics committee, and that Republicans are considering whether to file a formal ethics complaint.
“We want to delve into this one deeply, because we cannot have members of the Senate, the members that people have voted for public trust in, to have any sort of color of misappropriation of dollars or conflicts of interest,” Johnson said. “And this clearly looks like that on the face.”
He also said Senate Republicans will be looking at ways to tighten rules around legislatively named grants, which lawmakers can allocate directly to nonprofits and other organizations with minimal oversight.

In a 2-1 decision Friday, a state Appeals Court panel agreed with Republican Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin that the state Board of Elections should not have counted votes from more than 60,000 people whose registration showed up as incomplete in the state’s database or from more than 5,500 military and overseas absentee voters. 
Griffin is trying to unseat incumbent Democratic Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs. He trails by 734 votes. Her lead was confirmed in two recounts. He wants votes thrown out so he can win the seat. 
The Appeals Court said the elections board should be required to notify voters Griffin is targeting that their ballots need to be corrected if they want them to count. Voters would have had 15 business days from the time notices were sent to either complete their registration with a partial Social Security number or a partial driver’s license number, or, if they were military or civilian overseas absentee voters, to supply a copy of a photo ID.
After Griffin filed his challenges, many voters came forward to say the identification numbers they provided on their registration forms did not show up in the database due to mismatches or typos. 
The electronic portal most overseas voters use provides no means of submitting ID with their ballots.  
Riggs and the Board of Elections asked for a temporary stay of the Appeals Court order. 
In his motion, Riggs’ lawyer emphasized the confusion the 15-day deadline would cause. 
“It is impossible to predict the full scope of confusion that could result from this 15-day cure process if implemented before this Court’s review,” the petition says. 
“Further, the Court of Appeals’ “cure” remedy will be inadequate to prevent the disenfranchisement of thousands of North Carolina voters. There can be no doubt that tens of thousands of voters—through no fault of their own—will be unable to cure their registrations or ballots in time.”
Griffin’s lawsuit is headed to the Supreme Court, where Republicans hold a 5-2 majority. Riggs has recused herself. 
Three of the Republican justices, in previous decisions in the case, have expressed support for Griffin’s positions. In the case of a 3-3 tie in the Supreme Court, the Appeals Court decision would stand.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Griffin-and-Riggs.jpg,,,2025-04-07 17:09:05.086401

(Gary Kramer/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)

Washington’s wolf population is down for the first time since resident packs were confirmed to be returning to the state about 16 years ago, new figures show.
The state and tribes counted a minimum of 230 wolves in 43 packs as of Dec. 31, 2024. That’s compared to 254 wolves in 42 packs the previous year. At least 37 wolves died or were killed in the state last year, according to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife report.
Most of the decrease was on the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation land in northeast Washington, where the wolf count decreased by 20, from 59 to 39. In the rest of the state, it slipped by four from 195 to 191.
Eighteen of the dead wolves were hunted legally on Coleville land. One was killed legally by Spokane tribal hunters. And seven wolves were poached in incidents under investigation.
“This year, I don’t feel like our mortality was up a lot from previous years,” statewide wolf specialist Ben Maletzke said during a Fish and Wildlife Commission meeting on Saturday, where he presented the report. Though he did call the unlawful wolf killings “concerning.”
The state figures show that about three-dozen wolves were killed or died each year in 2022 and 2023. In the five years leading up to 2022, annual deaths ranged from 12 to 30.
Maletzke noted that the state’s wolf population has been on an upward trend, averaging about 20% growth annually since 2008, even when factoring in last year’s decline.
“The number of packs increased in the North Cascades in 2024, and both the North Cascades and Eastern Washington Recovery regions continued to meet or exceed recovery objectives for the fifth year in a row,” he said in a statement.
Still, wildlife advocates voiced concern, highlighting a drop in packs with breeding pairs last year to 18 from 24 in 2023. 
“It’s infuriating to see this dramatic decline in both the wolf population and successful breeding pairs, but it’s not shocking given the significant uptick in wolf killings over the past several years,” said Amaroq Weiss, a senior wolf advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity. 
Wolves were once common in Washington, but are believed to have been mostly killed off in the state around the 1930s after they were heavily hunted for their hides and under government-sponsored programs to control them.
In 2008, a resident pack was documented in Okanogan County. Wolf numbers have been climbing since. 
There are long-standing tensions over how the animals are managed, which typically pit wildlife advocates against ranchers and others who argue that the wolves are a threat to livestock. 
Last year, the Fish and Wildlife report shows that the agency carried out four wolf killings after the animals had conflicts with livestock. A fifth wolf was killed when it was “caught in the act” attacking livestock.
Another wolf was killed by a cougar, one died after eating plastic.
Wolves are protected under the federal Endangered Species Act in the western two-thirds of Washington. They are covered statewide under the state’s endangered species law. Killing one of the animals without authorization can carry penalties of up to a year in jail or a $5,000 fine under the state’s law.
Last summer, the Fish and Wildlife Commission narrowly voted against downlisting wolves from “endangered” to either “threatened” or “sensitive,” moves that would have led to lower penalties for poaching and slightly easier access to permits to kill wolves that attack livestock.
“The 2024 report vindicates the Commission’s decision to maintain wolves as a state-endangered species,” said Dr. Francisco Santiago-Ávila, science and advocacy director for Washington Wildlife First.
Santiago-Ávila raised the prospect that the Trump administration could roll back federal protections for wolves. “Washington’s wolves need more protection, not less,” he said.
The Washington Cattlemen’s Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The latest wolf population report from the department said last year’s report contained errors related to the wolf count on Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation land. Five wolves killed by hunters on tribal land were not recorded in the earlier report. 
Corrected figures indicate that the Strawberry Pack should have been tallied as having three, not eight wolves. After factoring in an estimate for lone and dispersing wolves, this brought the overall 2023 wolf population figure to 254. It also decreased the number of breeding wolf pairs in the state by one.
While wolf populations have grown in eastern Washington and the North Cascades, no packs are currently residing in the Cascades south of Interstate 90 or on the Olympic Peninsula.
The state classifies these parts of the state as a single wolf “recovery region.” The report notes that at least three wolves known to have moved into the area have been killed unlawfully and no wolves were documented in these parts of the state by the end of last year.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gray-wolf-1024x602.jpg,,,2025-04-07 17:09:05.086401

John Sauer argued that, despite the government’s admitted error in deporting Abrego Garcia, the lower court does not have the jurisdiction to order the Trump administration to return someone who the administration argues is no longer in U.S. custody.The appeal to the high court came within minutes of an appeals court panel unanimously upholding the order by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who set a deadline of midnight Monday for the administration to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.Despite being granted legal protection from deportation by a judge in 2019, immigration officials detained Abrego Garcia and sent him on a March 15 deportation flight to El Salvador, where he was incarcerated at the notorious prison known as Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.‘The government screwed up’A panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit agreed Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvador was a major misstep.“The United States Government has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street and remove him from the country without due process,” two judges on the panel, Robert B. King and Stephanie D. Thacker, wrote.King was appointed by former President Bill Clinton and Thacker was appointed by former President Barack Obama.“The Government’s contention otherwise, and its argument that the federal courts are powerless to intervene, are unconscionable,” they wrote.J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, wrote in his option that “[t]here is no question that the government screwed up here.”He noted that President Donald Trump’s administration has not made an effort to rectify its mistake.“The facts of this case thus present the potential for a disturbing loophole: namely that the government could whisk individuals to foreign prisons in violation of court orders and then contend, invoking its Article II powers, that it is no longer their custodian, and there is nothing that can be done. It takes no small amount of imagination to understand that this is a path of perfect lawlessness, one that courts cannot condone,” Wilkinson said.Order to returnOn Friday, Xinis ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garcia.The Department of Justice quickly appealed the decision and Xinis issued a scathing 22-page order Sunday that cited records and official statements from Trump officials saying the administration has the power to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.“Neither the United States nor El Salvador have told anyone why he was returned to the very country to which he cannot return, or why he is detained at CECOT,” she wrote. “That silence is telling. As Defendants acknowledge, they had no legal authority to arrest him, no justification to detain him, and no grounds to send him to El Salvador—let alone deliver him into one of the most dangerous prisons in the Western Hemisphere.”Abrego Garcia was on one of three deportation flights to CECOT on March 15. Two flights contained 238 Venezuelans who were deported under a wartime law that is currently being challenged in another court case.Xinis slammed the Trump administration for arguing that she had no jurisdiction to order Abrego Garcia’s return.“For the following reasons, their jurisdictional arguments fail as a matter of law,” she said. “Further, to avoid clear irreparable harm, and because equity and justice compels it, the Court grants the narrowest, daresay only, relief warranted: to order that Defendants return Abrego Garcia to the United States.”She noted that the two countries have an agreement to house more than 250 deported men at CECOT.The U.S. is paying El Salvador $6 million to detain the men at the prison. Trump is scheduled to meet with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele at the White House on April 14.In response to the district court’s order to return Abrego Garcia, the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, posted a GIF of a confused cartoon bunny on social media.Attorney placed on leaveThe Department of Justice attorney who argued on behalf of the Trump administration, Erez Reuveni, was placed on indefinite administrative leave over the weekend.U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said during a Fox News interview Sunday that Reuveni was placed on leave because he did not “vigorously” defend the administration.Reuveni, a veteran government attorney, has argued for the DOJ over the course of four administrations.During Friday’s hearing he was candid that the Trump administration had provided him little information on why Abrego Garcia could not be returned to the U.S. and that “the government made a choice here to produce no evidence.”",,,,2025-04-07 17:09:05.086401

(Photo: Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Amid a growing measles outbreak in other parts of the country, Maine legislators heard testimony on Monday from parents, educators, and medical professionals on a proposal to repeal the state’s vaccine requirements.
The hearing reflected a sharp divide: some Republican lawmakers and parents called for reinstating religious exemptions, while health care professionals urged the state to maintain strict immunization rules to protect public health, especially in light of the anti-vaccine rhetoric of the federal government.
“It’s frightening to see that the purveyors of these falsehoods are now in positions of authority in Washington,” said Dr. Sydney Sewall, a longtime pediatrician in Hallowell, said in an apparent reference to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “Their misleading statements, which generally amplify the risks of vaccines and downplay the dangers of these diseases, have given strength to the anti-vaccine movement.”
Two bills — LD 727 by Rep. Tracy Quint (R-Hodgdon) and LD 174 by Rep. Gary Drinkwater (R-Milford) — would reinstate nonmedical exemptions for school-required vaccines, six years after that provision was repealed. Supporters of the legislation raised concerns about vaccine ingredients and enforcement, particularly regarding immigrant students. Opponents, including doctors, school nurses, and public health officials, pushed back with scientific evidence and public health data showing that Maine’s stricter vaccine policy has worked. Since the 2019 law ending religious and philosophical exemptions, the state’s vaccination rate has risen from about 94 to 97%—enough to surpass the 95% herd immunity threshold.
Public health advocates also pointed to Mainers’ support for the law in a 2021 referendum, when voters rejected an attempt to reinstate nonmedical exemptions. Dr. Puthiery Va, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, cited the ongoing measles outbreak in Texas — now affecting 22 states — as a clear warning.
“The elimination of these requirements not only threatens the health of students, but also increases the likelihood of school and community outbreaks, disrupting education, creating an unnecessary burden on our health care system and financial burden,” Va said.
Experts also cited the measles outbreak, which has resulted in two deaths, as an urgent reason to double down on vaccination requirements.
“While the science supporting vaccines hasn’t changed — we still consider them to be safe and effective — the danger facing unprotected children seems to have escalated,” Sewall said.
Drinkwater argued that Maine’s law is “not neutral,” and that religious exemptions to vaccines were protected by federal civil rights. A handful of parents and students who chose to leave public schools because of the vaccine requirements supported both bills, citing the sacrifice that unvaccinated children had to make to miss out on school and learning, as well as isolation from their peers due to being unable to participate in school sports and other activities.
“When they passed the law and I no longer had teachers around to help me, it became a struggle with my math skills,” said 14-year-old Caliope Murray-Trefts, who had to leave school when the vaccine requirements took effect.
“When I think about school now, I think how unfair it is … that I can’t do any of that.”
School nurses highlight vaccine requirements for immigrant students
Some lawmakers and speakers, including Rep. Barbara Bagshaw (R-Windham), a member of the Education Committee, claimed there is a double standard for immigrant students.
“If our children have to be vaccinated, there’s not the same standard for people coming from other countries that don’t have the same requirements,” Bagshaw said. “We’re not enforcing that they take the same vaccinations.”
But school nurses working in diverse districts — including Portland and South Portland — disputed those claims in public testimony and interviews with the Maine Morning Star. They explained that schools follow the same immunization process for all students, regardless of immigration status or where they moved from: schools review vaccination records and work with local public health networks to get students up to date, following Maine’s 90-day compliance window.
“There is absolutely no difference” between immunization requirements for immigrant students and students who move from other U.S. states, said Becky Bell, a registered nurse with Portland Public Schools. Immigration status, she told the committee, “has no bearing on whether they get immunized.”
In fact, most immigrant students who move to Maine are already fully vaccinated, according to South Portland school nurse Mary Robbins and guidance clerk Natalie Dunn, who monitor immunization records in the district.

(Courtesy of Preble Street)Both lawmakers who want to limit and expand General Assistance agree that the program is vital but isn’t working as is.
“For some, life’s burdens may feel overwhelming, leaving them vulnerable and isolated. It’s in these moments that the true strength of a municipality is revealed, not just in the policies they enact but in the genuine care that they offer,” said Rep. Rachel Henderson of the state’s assistance program, which helps municipalities pay for basic necessities for those who can’t afford them.
However, the Rumford Republican added, “Moderating these assistance programs is also imperative. It ensures that the resources are allocated effectively and equitably, reaching those who need them the most.”
Henderson was among the legislators who presented a total of ten bills proposing changes to General Assistance — expansion, restriction, altering municipalities’ responsibilities — to the Legislature’s Health and Human Services committee on Monday. 
Gov. Janet Mills’ administration opposed essentially all, however Mills has been pushing her own version of the limits she’d like to see placed on the program. 
General Assistance has already been the focus of much debate this session 
Mills, a Democrat, proposed limits to the program in her initial plan for the supplemental budget. The Democratic majority incorporated some limits, though not as sweeping as the governor requested, but the supplemental budget ultimately failed to pass due to Senate Republican opposition. 
Limits to General Assistance weren’t included in a two-year budget the majority passed last month, which largely continued funding government services, though General Assistance restrictions are expected to be considered in another budget bill that will be focused on policy. 
Maine is one of 25 states that operate a GA program. These programs vary in structure and administration, and Maine is an outlier in using a municipality-based matching formula. In Maine, municipalities and tribes determine eligibility based on state law and municipal ordinances, and pay 30% of eligible expenditures, while the state reimburses the remaining 70%.
Ian Yaffe, director of the Office for Family Independence, told the committee that absent additional reforms, the GA program is expected to grow beyond $20 million, double the current baseline of $10.4 million, in the next fiscal year. 
While community housing and homelessness organizations testified in support of proposals to expand the program, Yaffe argued none are tenable given the current reality of the project state budget deficit. 
But the administration is also opposed to legislation that seeks to limit the program, citing court precedent that struck down similar restrictions in other states and the challenges with mandating work as a condition of eligibility for welfare.
Restrictions 
Three of the proposals heard Monday would place further limits on General Assistance, including a plan from Sen. Sue Bernard (R-Aroostook) that includes the exact changes Mills initially proposed. 
LD 1066 would cap housing assistance, except for temporary housing and emergency shelters, to a maximum of three months per household over one year. It would also limit municipalities from exceeding the maximum levels for all assistance categories for no more than 30 days per household over one year.
While those aspects of LD 1066 mirror the governor’s proposal, Yaffe said the department is opposed because of the bill’s mandate on workfare — requiring recipients capable of working to do so  for the municipality or a nonprofit as a condition to receive assistance — something that is currently optional and used by fewer than 10% of municipalities. 
Portland officials defend General Assistance amid push to cut spending

“Workfare participants must not replace the employment of regular municipal or nonprofit employees and participants still require supervision, which may take municipal staff away from their regularly scheduled tasks,” Yaffe said. “Additionally, many municipalities are avoiding this type of workfare due to liability concerns.”
House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) proposed an alternative type of limit in LD 1274, capping the state reimbursement to any single municipality to 50% of the total state funding allocated for General Assistance in any given year.
Citing Portland’s high spending compared to other municipalities, Faulkingham said the municipalities outside of Maine’s largest city are left with insufficient resources. 
“The fact that one city can consume such a disproportionate share of state resources is not only inefficient, but unfair,” Faulkingham said. “This cap will encourage municipalities like the City of Portland to explore other methods of assisting residents in need, such as private donations, local initiatives and increased collaboration with nonprofits.”
The Mills administration is opposed because the bill is an unfunded mandate, Yaffe explained. 
“A decrease in reimbursement will not negate the actual need of individuals but rather shift the burden to that municipality’s local taxpayers or neighboring communities,” Yaffe said.
LD 1046, sponsored by Tracy Quint (R-Hodgdon), would establish a 180-day state residency requirement for the program.
“Our state should not be a destination point for those seeking to abuse our kindness and goodwill,” Quint said. “No part of the state should be able, through their local unsustainable misappropriation, be allowed to plunder state resources in flagrant disregard to the harm caused to the financial stability of our state.”
Testifying in opposition, Yaffe pointed to several court cases that have defended citizens’ rights to travel and to relocate without forfeiting their rights to public assistance. 
Maine’s biggest cities seek higher reimbursements, more coverage
Two bills seek to increase the state reimbursement from 70% to 90%: LD 453, sponsored by Sen. Joseph Baldacci (D-Penobscot), and LD 1029, sponsored by Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland). 
The senators represent two municipalities, Portland and Bangor, that have the largest General Assistance costs. City leaders and district attorneys have previously told the Legislature that this disproportionate spending is by design, given that most mental health and substance use treatment centers, as well as homeless shelters, are located in or near larger cities. 
Baldacci and Talbot Ross also think it’s due to inadequate reimbursement rates overall. 
“The financial burden caused by the current reimbursement rate is too large a barrier for most municipalities to overcome,” Talbot Ross said. “As such, far too often we see people leaving their natural support systems and their own communities of origin to access resources and larger service center communities.”

Baldacci said property tax payers currently bear the burden of the 30%.
“I am sure the state has saved tens of billions of dollars from this, but it’s only come at the expense of property taxpayers in Bangor and all over the state,” Baldacci said. “This bill is in part to bring some sanity back to this program. If there are regulations or restrictions that the Legislature wants to impose on General Assistance, those can be debated and discussed.”  
Community housing and homelessness organizations favor Talbot Ross’s plan because it goes farther, requiring that the maximum General Assistance level sufficiently accounts for housing assistance while also ensuring adequate eligibility for other necessities.
Annika Moore, advocacy team leader for Preble Street, which provides services to people experiencing homelessness, said as rents have increased people reach the maximum assistance level with housing payments alone. Moore provided an example of one of Preble Streets’ clients, who uses her entire General Assistance benefit to cover rent for a modest one bedroom apartment and has essentially no other possessions aside from donated food. 
Illustrating to lawmakers the inadequate funding that exists to meet needs, Katie Spencer White, president and CEO of the Mid Maine Homeless Shelter and Services in Waterville, said Sunday night her shelter provided emergency housing to 90 people. A bank released $100,000 of the organization’s line of credit Monday, she said, but she expects to need to take out another $100,000 next month. 
Shelters can’t charge people for stays, which is the underlying idea of presumptive eligibility, the assumption that a person in emergency shelter is eligible for government assistance unless proven otherwise. 
Currently, state law requires a person’s eligibility to be redetermined after 30 days. LD 1029 would increase that to 180 days, which White said is more reasonable. 
“Allowing shelter providers more time to work with clients, many of whom are in crisis and experiencing trauma that results in behavior and emotional reactions, including anxiety, fear and difficulty concentrating, will make sure the system serves the people it intends to serve,” White said.
The change would also help agencies like hers hire staff to submit invoices, “Because, believe it or not, we are a business, and if it costs more to submit the invoice than we receive in revenue, we will not submit the invoice.”
Other proposed expansions focused on the services eligible for reimbursement by General Assistance. 
LD 657, sponsored by Rep. Abden Simmons (R-Waldoboro), would designate broadband and internet as basic necessities under the program.
“By adding internet services to the General Assistance program, it would help them to not miss important doctors appointments,” Simmons said, explaining that he introduced the bill on behalf of a constituent who had this challenge. “In areas of the state with aging communities like mine, this desperately is needed.”
However, Yaffe said the program is meant to meet immediate, short-term needs, whereas he described broadband and internet services as ongoing needs. 
LD 1017, also sponsored by Talbot Ross, would add the cost of food provided or served at emergency shelters to the reimbursement, as the system currently reimburses shelters for the cost of issuing food vouchers but not providing meals themselves. 
Yaffe argued providing this assistance to shelters wouldn’t be consistent with the primary purpose of the program, which is to provide direct assistance to individuals.
Municipal responsibilities 
The Mills administration testified neither for nor against one bill, LD 1081, which would adjust part of a law passed last year that required a staff member be available to accept and process General Assistance applications during all regular business hours of a municipal office. 
LD 1081, sponsored by Rep. Melanie Sachs (D-Freeport), would change statute to require each municipality to designate daily hours for accepting and processing General Assistance applications, which can’t be less than 50% of the municipality’s regular business hours. 
“Freeport has struggled to comply with this requirement,” Sachs said, explaining that Freeport Community Services terminated its contract with the town last summer due to a lack of capacity, increased applications and case complexity. 
While Sachs said she doesn’t want to make it harder for applicants, she wants to make sure communities can provide the service. The Mills administration seemed to agree.
“The department believes that this bill strikes the right balance between ensuring access to the GA program and alleviating the burdens of program administration, particularly in smaller municipalities,” Yaffe said. 
LD 1178, is intended to “add some teeth” to the statute that deals with municipal responsibilities, said bill sponsor Rep. Suzanne Salisbury (D-Westbrook). It would expedite the process of determining when a municipality illegally moves a person to avoid the responsibility of administering General Assistance and adds penalties for doing so.
While some social services workers viewed this as a more effective alternative to the bill that proposed residency requirements, Yaffe said the data the state has about these conflicts demonstrates it’s not a major issue. 
Yaffe said the questions submitted to the program’s hotline, which is available to GA administrators or members of the public, regarding municipality of responsibility only accounted for 132 requests or about 2% of the total last year, with most requests being for guidance and not actual disputes between towns. 
While pointing to those figures, the lack of comprehensive data overall about the program remains an issue. 
Henderson proposed LD 637, which would direct the Maine Department of Health and Human Services to evaluate if it’s feasible to upgrade the program database to include information about whether a disqualified applicant is seeking assistance in another municipality.
“I don’t want to speak negatively of a very valuable General Assistance program that our municipalities provide,” Henderson said, adding that she has personally experienced poverty and homelessness. “I think one of the hardest things to see is when there’s such a negative outlook on people who reach out for help and seek help.”
Henderson said her bill would maximize the impact of the program’s funding and foster trust in the community as residents see that support is being directed to those who truly need it. 
However, Yaffe said such a report would duplicate requirements already in law — and requirements that the Mills administration has recently found it is going to be unable to execute. 
In August, the department solicited requests for proposals to build a technology platform for General Assistance program evaluation but received bids between $752,000 to $5.8 million for the initial two-year period to build the system.
“Given the current fiscal reality and ongoing increases to cost within the GA program, the department is not able to absorb these costs into department resources as it had originally intended,” Yaffe said, adding that the department will be submitting a revision to current statute to clarify what it can accomplish within existing resources, or to delay the system until funding is available.

Second, the threats to non-human, yet still essential, research subjects similarly rings in irreparability,” Kelley wrote, referring to research animals. “Finally, the potential loss of human capital and talent to virtually every Plaintiff poses yet another harm incapable of run-of-the-mill legal relief.”Kelley added the “Court is hard pressed to think of a loss more irreparable than the loss of a life, let alone the thousands of people who are counting on clinical trials as their last hope.”The case began in February after the NIH announced it would cap Facilities and Administrative fees for every institution receiving a grant at 15%, a significantly lower threshold than many research universities and medical schools had negotiated over the years.That led to three lawsuits — Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. National Institutes of Health, Association of American Medical Colleges v. National Institutes of Health and Association of American Universities v. Department of Health & Human Services — all of which are before Kelley.Facilities and Administrative fees, also referred to as indirect costs, cover expenses that are not associated with one specific research project. They can include building construction or renovations, utility bills, salaries for administrative staff, and dozens of other line items.",,,,2025-04-07 17:09:05.086401

Sharice Davids of Kansas are uneasy about proposed fees for container ships uses to import and export agriculture goods.,"Kansas Farm Bureau president Joe Newland, a former Kansas House Republican, said the state's agriculture economy could be harmed by a plan of the Trump administration to impose massive fees on container ships relied on to export Kansas farm products and import fertilizer and other inputs. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Farm Bureau president expressed skepticism Monday about the U.S. trade representative’s plan to impose U.S. docking fees of as much as $1.5 million on Chinese-built ships operating in international water to haul Kansas farm products to market or deliver key inputs for crop production.
U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer proposed the policy as part of President Donald Trump’s objective of diverting container ship construction from China to the United States.
The administration’s policy could impact Seaboard Corporation, a Fortune 500 company based in Merriam, Kansas, that operated Seaboard Marine, a large international shipping carrier. Kansas farmers rely on global shipping to import fertilizer or seed and to export crops. In 2022, Kansas exported $7.2 billion in agricultural products.
“We support efforts to increase America’s competitiveness in shipbuilding, but the USTR’s existing plan would raise shipping costs, destroy jobs and make Kansas agricultural products less competitive in global markets,” said Joe Newland, president of Kansas Farm Bureau.
He said steps should be taken to make certain U.S.-owned shipping companies and their customers, which included the state’s farmers and ranchers, weren’t “caught in the crosshairs of misguided policy.”
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat from Kansas and a member of the U.S. House Agriculture Committee, said the Trump administration’s blueprint for surging fees on American shipping companies would inflict damage on businesses and farmers, as well as threaten national security.
She said Trump administration’s proposed fee change could prove so costly that Seaboard’s marine division might be forced out of business.
“While I support strengthening America’s shipbuilding industry and the American workers employed by the sector, I am concerned that the proposed action, as currently written, will have unintended consequences that would be devastating for United States-owned international ocean carriers and employment at dozens of ports around the country,” Davids said.
Davids said industry experts warned the trade representative’s strategy could backfire by disrupting supply chains, driving up costs, narrowing options for U.S. exporters and providing Chinese companies with a competitive advantage.
She said the trade representative should amend proposed docking levies to protect U.S.-owned shipping companies while also encouraging growth of American shipbuilding.
The plan called for a service fee of up to $1 million for Chinese-owned operators of shipping vessels making a U.S. port of call. The fee could rise to $1.5 million for fleets containing Chinese-built vessels making a port of call.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/P8290413-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-07 17:09:05.086401

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A lawmaker from Oklahoma City had his last day in the House Monday after being elected Oklahoma County commissioner. 
Elected April 1, Democrat Rep. Jason Lowe was expected to be sworn in as county commissioner Monday. 
A special primary election to fill the now-vacant legislative seat, which covers parts of northeast Oklahoma City and surrounding areas, is June 10. If needed, a special runoff would be Aug. 12 and a special general election on Sept. 9, said Misha Mohr with the State Election Board. 
Lowe thanked his colleagues, legislative staff and constituents as he addressed the House chamber for the last time. 
“It is with a mixture of gratitude, community pride, and definitely sadness that I stand before you today to announce my resignation,” Lowe said on the House floor. 
While in the Legislature, he chaired the Oklahoma Legislative Black Caucus and worked to host three annual Black History Day celebrations at the Capitol. 
“It’s been the honor of a lifetime to serve the great residents of House District 97,” he said in a statement. “I’m thankful to have been elected to serve you and to serve alongside my esteemed colleagues of the legislature. I want to thank my colleagues for all of their support and insight they’ve given me over the years.”
House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, said she was grateful to work alongside Lowe in the House. 
“He has worked hard to be a voice for his constituents in Oklahoma City, and I trust he will continue to serve Oklahomans well in his new capacity as County Commissioner,” she said in a statement. “As a longtime advocate and vocal voice on criminal justice reform, I know he will take that same passion to Oklahoma County. He will be missed at the Capitol, but I know his service to Oklahomans will be long-lasting.”
There are two other open seats in the Oklahoma House in House Districts 71 and 74. The two Tulsa County-area seats became vacant when lawmakers stepped down to take jobs in city and county government.

Ron DeSantis’ latest jab at the Florida House came during a press conference Monday, when the governor criticized the lower chamber’s lack of action on a bill that would prohibit police from stopping boats to conduct safety inspections.
This legislative session has been marked by DeSantis’ public condemnation of the House’s moves to override his budget vetoes, cut the sales tax, and question executive agency heads. The governor’s comments during the press conference in Panama City Beach focused on legislation (SB 1388 and HB 1001) the chamber hasn’t taken up, as the time to do so is beginning to wind down.
“If it doesn’t pass the House, it’s only because of them taking an obstructionist bent, not because it doesn’t have support from the vast majority of folks throughout the state of Florida,” DeSantis said during the event in Treasure Island Marina.
While the legislation, known as the “Boater Freedom Act,” hasn’t moved in the House, it is scheduled for its second of three hearings in the Senate on Thursday.
Panama City Republican Sen. Jay Trumbull joined DeSantis but refrained from bashing the House, instead saying that Republican Rep. Philip Griffitts of Panama City Beach “is working hard to try to get the bill up in the House.”
Aside from making violations of safety and marine sanitation regulations a secondary offense, the bill preempts local governments from restricting use of water vessels based on their power source, such as gas or diesel.
House Speaker Daniel Perez on Thursday told reporters that his conversations with DeSantis remained cordial but said the governor’s videos slamming him and the House on X were “mind-boggling” and “disheartening.”
“For some reason, it seems the last week or so the governor has been a little more emotional and has been upset and has done on his videos to voice his opinions in another way. He has every right to do so,” Perez said.

Ambrose Castellano's complaint filed with the New Mexico Ethics Commission. (Photo courtesy of Ambrosio E. Castellano)The independent state agency that enforces New Mexico’s ethical conduct laws regarding professional lobbyists also has authority over organizations that mount ad campaigns intended to influence state lawmakers, a court ruled last week.
The New Mexico Court of Appeals unanimously ruled on April 3 that when lawmakers in 2019 passed the State Ethics Commission Act, they intended to give the New Mexico Ethics Commission power to handle complaints not only about individual lobbyists and their employers, but also to organizations that run lobbying advertising campaigns.
The ruling stems from a complaint filed with the commission against Albuquerque-based New Mexico Families Forward, which registered with the Secretary of State as a lobbying advertising campaign on Feb. 5, 2022, in the middle of that year’s regular legislative session.
In its complaint filed that May, the reelection campaign for former Rep. Ambrose Castellano (D-Serafina) alleged that NMFF violated the law by failing to disclose the identity of its donors, and how much they had given.
Attorney Ambrosio E. Castellano, the former lawmaker’s son, represented his father’s campaign in the Commission case against NMFF. He told Source NM on Monday that he was not previously aware of the ruling, and celebrated it as a victory.
“We’re happy with the Court of Appeals ruling,” he said. “I think it’s important that there’s transparency in our elections and all those who are lobbying either on behalf of a candidate or against a candidate, whether it’s an individual or an organization. I think it’s a great win not only for our client, but I think it’s a great win for New Mexico as a whole.”
Voicemails and emails seeking comment from the Ethics Commission’s spokesperson and two lawyers for New Mexico Families Forward were not returned as of Monday.
Castellano said he looks forward to the Commission prosecuting the case further and seeing if NMFF will be held accountable and be ordered to comply with the law moving forward.
He said as far as knows, NMFF still hasn’t disclosed their donors’ identities, nor the amounts they gave toward the campaign against his father.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to the complaint, NMFF sent targeted mailers to people in the area Ambrose Castellano represented, House District 70, which includes the cities of Las Vegas and Moriarty, the Village of Pecos, Ribera and other parts of San Miguel and Torrance counties.
A copy included in the complaint shows the mailers encouraged recipients to call him and ask why he voted against House Bill 132, which was eventually signed into law and banned exorbitantly high interest rates on small loans, capping them at 36%.
“Representative Ambrose Castellano voted against hard-working New Mexicans,” one of the mailers states.
NMFF started distributing the advertisements on Feb. 3, 2022, as the legislation was still being debated, according to a report it later filed with the Secretary of State. The group spent $36,000 on the mailers, the report states.
After Castellano filed the complaint with the Commission in April 2022, the Commission referred it to the Secretary of State, who reported that she could not certify that NMFF complied with the law because it had “failed to disclose the names of the contributors to its lobbying advertising campaign, and the amounts each contributed.”
NMFF argued that the Commission’s jurisdiction to enforce the Lobbyist Reporting Act extended only to complaints against “individuals” who are “lobbyists and lobbyists employers.” Since NMFF is not a lobbyist and does not employ one, it argued, the Commission did not have jurisdiction to enforce the law against it.
NMFF took the Commission to court in October 2022, and Second Judicial District Court Judge Daniel Ramczyk that December found that the Commission had “unlawfully attempted to exercise jurisdiction over” the group. He ordered the Commission to halt all proceedings in the case against NMFF, and to dismiss it.
But the Commission appealed Ramczyk’s ruling to the New Mexico Court of Appeals, which has now reversed his decision, sent the case back to him and ordered him to send it back to the Commission.
The judges noted that the appeal marks the first time ever that the Court of Appeals has been asked to determine the commission’s jurisdiction under the State Ethics Commission Act. Lawmakers passed the new law and the governor signed it in 2019 to implement voters’ decision the year before to create the Ethics Commission.

(Photo by Pat Kinney)WATERLOO — Kelly Sullivan remembers another cold April day 28 years ago.
On a Staten Island pier in New York harbor, she was expecting her first biological child — her daughter Kelcie — but gave birth to another — the Navy destroyer USS The Sullivans, hull number DDG-68, named for her grandfather and great uncles who died together in World War II.
She gave the order, “Man this ship and bring her to life!” and the sailors, men and women, ran on board and manned their stations.
On Saturday, she watched another woman, who has become her friend, do the same thing, as former Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack give those orders to the crew of the new USS Iowa submarine, hull number SSN-797, in Groton, Conn., where the sub was built.
Sullivan, also a member of the USS Iowa commissioning committee, had planned to be in Connecticut to support her friend. Due to travel and other complications, she did the next best thing. She attended a watch party for the commissioning ceremonies at Waterloo’s Sullivan Brothers Iowa Veterans Museum, part of the Grout Museum District. The Waterloo event, one of more than two dozen parties around the state, was attended by dozens of Cedar Valley residents who filled the museum “mess hall” events area, including many Navy and other military veterans.
One of those veterans was Kelly Sullivan’s father — Jim Sullivan, the son of Albert Sullivan, the youngest of the five brothers. He was a toddler when his dad and uncles George, Francis, Joseph and Madison were killed when the USS Juneau was sunk during the naval Battle of Guadalcanal. He followed his father and uncles into the Navy and served on a destroyer. Kelly and her father were surrounded by well-wishers who also turned out to welcome Iowa’s new namesake ship into service.

“It’s a historic day for the Navy, a historic day for Iowa,” Kelly Sullivan said. “I think the biggest thing is celebrating our state, our great state, and all the people who have served our country from Iowa. Iowa has a rich history of service and patriotism. Today’s a day where we celebrate that. It’s a big deal.”
It was the end of a long process, six years, to build and commission the Iowa, a Virginia-class nuclear submarine with the most up-to-date firepower and “silent running” technology. It was a challenge for contractors, crew and the commissioning committee. Work continued through the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The thing that really amazed me is all the people who make this happen,” Sullivan said. “People don’t realize what happens behind the scenes.” Many of the commissioning committee members were Iowans and Navy veterans; Iowa firms helped with the construction. “It’s neat to have so many Iowans involved in this process. And it’s been wonderful to watch the whole thing unfold for all these years.
“I feel honored to have been part of it,” Sullivan said, and she emphasized the USS Iowa sailors feel a part of the state of Iowa as well — as evidenced by crew members volunteering to help clean up the grounds of the Iowa Veterans Home in Marshalltown, and parts of Cedar Rapids, after the August 2020 derecho.
“They sent a truck full of USS Iowa volunteers,” Sullivan said. “They had generators, they had electric chainsaws, water, food and fuel. And they came for four days. They met in Marshalltown — Christie Vilsack met me there.”
They removed downed trees and limbs and helped restore some of the adjacent storm-damaged cemetery. “And then they went to Cedar Rapids and did work,” she said.
“Those sailors, they’re our family,” Sullivan said. “It’s just like The Sullivans. We have sailors from The Sullivans that come to visit Iowa all the time. Because that’s their state. It’s even more so with these sailors. These sailors feel a family connection to the state of Iowa. They’ll bring their grandkids here, and kids here, and say, ‘This is the state that represents the boat that I am plank owner (original crew member) of.’ ”
Sullivan said she also connected USS Iowa sailors with a Navy cycling crew which participates in RAGBRAI, Iowa’s annual cross-state bicycle ride, and they are part of that team now as well.
“They also go to the State Fair — they’re very well represented at the State Fair — they’ve been here (in Waterloo) a couple of times for Iowa Irish Fest, RAGBRAI and the derecho (relief effort). That’s just a few of them. So many more things than that. That’s the thing we also now celebrate, is that these sailors are now part of our Iowa family.”

The new USS Iowa is the latest and best sub in the fleet in terms of armaments and capabilities, and the first submarine with total accommodations for a crew of men and women. But it is also loaded with tradition — and one of those traditions is the role of the ship sponsor, a role that Sullivan and Vilsack are very mindful of.
The sponsor, traditionally a woman, is chosen by the Secretary of the Navy. She is technically considered a member of the crew. Sullivan has always referred to the USS The Sullivans as “my ship” and Christie Vilsack feels the same way.
Vilsack, a journalism graduate of the University of Iowa and a former columnist for the Mount Pleasant News where her husband, former Gov. Tom Vilsack, served as mayor before seeking state and national office, expressed her feelings in her new online column, “Common Ground,” she now writes as a member of the Iowa Writers Collaborative.
“Most people associate a boat christening with a woman and broken bottle of champagne. That would be me on Jun 17, 2022. But the story of a boat sponsor christening a Navy vessel is about a special long-time relationship between a woman chosen by the Navy to care for the crew and families of for the rest of her life,” Christie Vilsack wrote. “The officers, crew and families of the USS Iowa SSN-797 refer to me as the ‘mom of the boat.’ ”
  The official crest of the new U.S.S. Iowa submarine (SSN-797) includes a likeness of its predecessor namesake battleship, the U.S.S. Iowa BB-61, as well as a shamrock in honor of Waterloo’s five Sullivan brothers killed during World War II. (Illustration courtesy of the U.S. Navy)
In those christening ceremonies, she said, “Thanks to fellow Iowa teacher, Kelly Sullivan, sponsor of USS The Sullivans DDG-68, a ship to honor the five Sullivan brothers, including her grandfather, who were all killed at sea in World War II aboard the USS Juneau. She has been a great mentor and friend.”
Kelly Sullivan is one of the most active and visible ship sponsors in the Navy, supporting the USS The Sullivans crew in Iowa, its home port in Florida, New York and even attended a port visit in Ireland. Similarly, she has engaged and helped Vilsack, also the daughter of a Navy veteran and aviator, into her role as USS Iowa sponsor as they’ve worked together on projects and events like Iowa Irish Fest and the derecho cleanup.
“I feel blessed to be involved, and to have those connections with Christie,” Sullivan said. “She’s fabulous, and she’s going to make a great sponsor. She said, ‘I love being a sponsor and I’m very blessed to have this role.’ I’m proud of her. She has a very strong Navy family history and she’s really excited about this.”
And, Sullivan noted, Vilsack has her granddaughters involved with the ship as maids of honor, who serve as proxies in the sponsor’s absence and carry on her role — potentially, Sullivan said, for the ship’s entire service life.
Also at Saturday’s watch party was U.S. Army Korean War era veteran Bill Keane of Waterloo, who also attended the 1997 commissioning of the USS The Sullivans at Staten Island, New York with a large contingent of Cedar Valley area residents. He also is a member of the Sullivan Brothers chapter of the Ancient Order of Hibernians in Waterloo. He saw a parallel between the two commissioning ceremonies.
It’s ‘Anchors Aweigh’ for new USS Iowa

“It just feels wonderful because of the Iowa connection,” he said. “We’re just so proud of the Sullivan brothers, were proud of Kelly and the family and her devotion to history.”
Reminders of the Sullivan brothers’ sacrifice sail with the USS Iowa too. The official ship’s crest bears a shamrock in commemoration of the brothers’ Irish heritage and their service. It also bears a likeness of its predecessor ship, the battleship USS Iowa, BB-61, which served from World War II through 1990 and is now a museum in the Port of Los Angeles. One of the battleship’s nicknames was “The Grey Ghost,” and the submarine crew has drawn from that with its motto, “Fear the Ghost.” The ship’s crest also bears 47 stars for each of the sailors who were killed when the battleship’s No. 2 gun turret exploded in April 1989. Members of the Battleship Iowa Museum were in Groton for the commissioning as well.
Sullivan and Vilsack also are carrying on traditions from their ships’ predecessor vessels in their roles as sponsors.
Kelly’s great grandmother Alleta sponsored the first Navy destroyer USS The Sullivans DD-537, which served from World War II through 1977 and is now at a military park in Buffalo, N.Y.
Similarly, preceding Christie Vilsack as sponsor of the battleship USS Iowa was Ilo Wallace of Indianola, wife of U.S. Vice President Henry Wallace of Orient. He also served as secretary of agriculture, as Gov. Vilsack did during the Obama and Biden administrations.
Vilsack also knows, from Sullivan’s example, that a sponsor also supports a ship when its crew is at sea and potentially in harm’s way. In November, the USS The Sullivans embarked on its fifth overseas deployment in the past three years.

John Creery of Waterloo, who served in the Air Force from 1969-89 including a tour in Vietnam, said he had served at a fighter installation near the Bath Iron Works in Maine where the current USS The Sullivans was built and christened, but had never attended a ship launch, christening or commissioning. “So this sounded kind of cool,” he said.
The watch party also offered plenty of good-natured inter-service razzing and camaraderie among the many veterans in attendance — like the group of sailors who griped about a Marine veteran giving them orders while they nonetheless accommodated him to pose for a group photo.
Jim Sullivan struck up a conversation with fellow “tin can sailor” Paul Reuter of Waterloo, who served on the destroyer USS Robinson during the Korean War.
Reuter told Sullivan his grandkids had asked him if he’d ever killed anyone while in service. “I dunno … I was the cook …” he deadpanned.

(Photo by Shondiin Silversmith/Arizona Mirror)A provision in the secret, controversial agreement allowing a private company to transport uranium ore across the Arizona side of the Navajo Nation has New Mexico anti-nuclear advocates increasingly worried about the prospect of new mining activity near a mountain sacred to the Navajo people.
The Navajo Nation in late January agreed to let Energy Fuels transport uranium ore from its Pinyon Plains Mine in Arizona to its mill in White Mesa, Utah. Neither party has released the agreement, calling it confidential, they have described what it says in broad terms, and a transport policy, overseen by the United States Forest Service, details plans in case of an emergency.
Two to three truckloads a day are making the trek across the western edge of the Navajo Nation into Utah, officials have said at recent public meetings. That number could increase to 10, said Stephen Etsitty, director of the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency, at recent chapter house meetings, according to video attendees shared on social media.
In exchange, Energy Fuels agreed to pay the Navajo Nation $1.2 million and also clean up as much as 10,000 tons of material from old uranium mines for free. Energy Fuels would also pay the nation 50 cents per pound of uranium processed at the mill.
Energy Fuels also owns the Roca Honda mine near Mount Taylor in New Mexico. The shortest route from Roca Honda to the White Mesa Mill in Utah also runs through the Navajo Nation.

Energy Fuels spokesperson Curtis Moore declined to say exactly what the transport agreement said regarding the Roca Honda mine, citing the agreement’s confidentiality. But he did acknowledge the agreement contemplated the New Mexico mine’s eventual operation.
“If Roca Honda were to proceed, we agreed to take quite a bit more cleanup material at no charge to the Navajo Nation,” Moore said in an email Friday to Source New Mexico.
‘How are we going to beat this monster?’
Cheyenne Antonio, an advocate with Diné C.A.R.E, told Source that she asked Navajo Nation officials at a recent meeting about the prospect of uranium transport in New Mexico. She said Stephen Etsitty, executive director of the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency, told her that no roads had been approved yet in New Mexico for uranium transport.
Etsitty told Source New Mexico on Monday that it’s far too early to say what the route could be, but that the Cibola National Forest has presented some options in old draft environmental impact statements in the mine.
Estimates Etsitty has reviewed show that far more trucks would cross the Navajo Nation each day from the Roca Honda mine, based on assessments of the amount of uranium could produce. Between 50 and 60 trucks a day is the maximum, Etsitty said.
The Navajo Nation has, for years, opposed the development of any mine near Mount Taylor, known as Tsoodził in Navajo, Etsitty said.
But if the Roca Honda mine is approved, Etsitty said the new transport agreement contains “a framework” that would require Energy Fuels to remove 30,000 more tons of abandoned uranium mine material, on top of the 10,000 tons the company has already promised to remove as part of the Pinyon Plains transport agreement.
Energy Fuels pushed for the provision, Etsitty said, because the company believes it is far enough along in getting that mine approved that it was necessary.
“We looked at it and and we agreed, but we also stipulated that we were not waiving, we were not pre-judging, nothing was pre-decisional,” he said in a phone interview Monday with Source New Mexico. “Meaning that we were not agreeing with them that we support the Roca Honda project. Because we reserved our right to comment fully and vigorously on that project.”
The company has listed the Roca Honda project as in the “advanced” stage of permitting on its website, but the website has said that since at least 2019, according to the Internet archive.
Antonio and Leona Morgan, who heads up Haul No!, a group opposing the transport agreement, organized a small gathering at an Albuquerque library on Thursday to discuss the latest on uranium mining in Arizona and New Mexico and brainstorm ideas to oppose its extraction and transport.

“My question,” Morgan asked those in attendance, “is what is our solution to fighting it? How are we going to deal with it? How are we going to beat this monster?”
Uranium mining between the 1940s and the 1970s in and around the Navajo Nation left cancer and pollution in its wake. Companies operating in the area back then abandoned hundreds of uranium mines that continue to poison groundwater and otherwise hurt public health.
So the prospect of new mining and its transport has incensed members of the Navajo Nation, Antonio said. At a meeting late last month at the Mexican Water Chapter in Utah, one elder woman spoke up to say, in Navajo, that the agreement amounted to the tribe killing the Navajo way of life without members’ input.
“You agreed to kill our whole Navajo universe without our consent,” the elder said, according to Antonio’s translation.
Moore, the Energy Fuels spokesperson, noted that the company had nothing to do with the legacy uranium mines, which were drilled to produce weapons material, and that it is doing its part as “good samaritans” to clean up the old companies’ messes.
“Our uranium is only used for clean, carbon-free … nuclear energy, not weapons,” Moore said.
‘The Trump administration is moving quickly’
While outside observers and both parties to the agreement agree many hurdles remain in the way of the state’s first new uranium mine in more than 50 years, they see the transport agreement as the latest domino to fall.
Already this year, Cibola National Forest officials deemed the Roca Honda mine a “priority project,” following an executive order from President Donald Trump seeking to boost domestic energy production. Trump’s pushes to make public lands profitable and his newly announced tariffs could also point in the direction of new uranium mines here, Moore said.
“Roca Honda is a large and high-grade uranium deposit that could enhance U.S. energy independence considerably,” Moore said. “We are not sure what the executive orders mean yet in terms of concrete actions. However, the Trump administration is moving quickly to reduce America’s dependence on Russian and Chinese uranium and rare earth imports, which are the two commodities Energy Fuels produces today.”
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

As for tariffs, Moore said the taxes on imports could “support domestic uranium and rare earth production.”
Also, the price of uranium has risen steadily since 2020, including cresting at a little more than $100 a pound last January. That’s close to the point at which new mines are profitable, according to Eric Jantz, legal director at the New Mexico Environmental Law Center.
Etsitty, speaking to a small crowd gathered at a chapter house in Crownpoint last month, said the price hitting $100 last January is what prompted the new speculation in and around the Navajo Nation.
“That’s what drives all of this. When people say, what is this all about? Is it just about money? Yes, it’s just about money to the industry,” Etsitty said.
Moore said regulatory review can take years, even decades, for a new mine, especially if anti-mining interests get in the way.
“Anti-nuclear and anti-mining interests can severely delay good domestic mining projects,” he wrote. “Therefore, we would welcome any shortening of permitting timelines, and reductions in ‘lawfare’ and nuisance lawsuits, to get domestic critical mineral projects into production to support energy, economic and national security quickly.”
Navajo Nation officials have defended the agreement as the best deal they could strike in the face of a lawsuit they feel they would likely lose. In the Crownpoint meeting and a question-and-answer virtual meeting shortly after they struck the agreement, Nation officials cited the Supremacy clause of the United States Constitution, which they said pre-empts the tribe’s right to restrict uranium transport over roads that course through the Navajo Nation.
“We are supportive of the overarching desire to not have these functioning and operating, but we can’t stop it,” Etsitty said in the meeting. “So now we’re trying to manage it.”

Scott Perry talking to reporters at the Capitol Sept. 19, 2023 (Jennifer Shutt/ States Newsroom)As the stock market falls sharply, two Pennsylvania Congressmen from battleground districts focused on economic priorities during a conservative conference in Cumberland County.
“We ran on making life affordable again. We ran on having safe communities, and a border that’s secure and I don’t think that’s a very advanced formulary in order to achieve the goals in which we all clearly spoke on November 5,” said U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-8th District) on Friday. “But that’s what we ultimately try to do every single day.”
“From my standpoint, my mission is to save the republic,” said U.S. Rep. Scott Perry (R-10th District). “That’s my mission.”
Both are Republicans and support President Donald Trump, but have aligned themselves with different caucuses. Bresnahan is a member of the bipartisan “Problem Solvers Caucus,” led by U.S. Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-1st District) and Tom Suozzi (D-NY). Perry is a former Chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and is viewed as one of Trump’s allies in the state who supported his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.

They spoke to the crowd for over 15 minutes, but didn’t spend much time addressing the big news dominating headlines: Trump’s tariff announcement on taxing imported products from around the world.
While Trump says the move was made to promote American manufacturing, economists worry about the increases in prices for businesses and citizens, alike. Plus, the stock market had it’s worst week for the United States since the coronavirus pandemic.
Following their speeches, Bresnahan and Perry spoke with reporters and said they still support Trump’s plan.
“I have not met with an industry in DC and or locally that does not have concerns about the tariffs that are being implemented, but it’s about producing American manufacturing. It’s about bringing those jobs and national security back to the United States,” Bresnahan told the Capital-Star. “Would I perhaps have seen it like to have seen it more incrementally over a period of time? But the moral of the story, and the idea, is to bring the different countries together, start these negotiations.”
“And I’m a big believer in ripping the band aid off, but I’m also a big believer in targeted applications for most things,” he added.
“There’s always going to be concerns,” Perry said. “Certainly for short-term market volatility, but it’s going to shake out once everybody understands what the playing field is.”
“It’s the uncertainty that creates the volatility,” he added. “Once the certainty is there, the volatility will go away, because everybody knows these are the rules.”
Perry said there “has to be some rebalancing of the ledger financially between other countries and our country,” when detailing his support of Trump’s announcement. He added that the United States “cannot be dependent on the Communist Party of China” for products like steel and India for “drug and pharmaceutical precursors or the pharmaceuticals themselves.”
“The only way those industries come back is to incentivize them,” Perry said. “Like I said, we can’t force regulation and taxes in those other countries, but we can change what we do here.”
For Bresnahan, it was his first appearance at the Pennsylvania Leadership Conference as an elected official. He defeated several term incumbent U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Lackawanna) by 1.6% for a seat representing northeast Pennsylvania last November, which was one of the most expensive races in the nation.

During his speech, he detailed his road to running for Congress and his background in the private sector, while highlighting the work ahead for a few of the committees he serves on, including Transportation and Infrastructure and Agriculture.
Bresnahan promoted extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, also known as the Trump tax cuts.
“It’s imperative that we make TCJA permanent,” he told the Capital-Star on Friday.
Perry, who is a regular at the conservative conference in his district, secured reelection in November by defeating Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson by 1.2%. It was his closest reelection bid since winning a seat in Congress in 2012.
Perry made it clear that the national debt was top of mind for him and explained his concern with the U.S. Senate’s spending proposal they advanced just hours before his speech. He told attendees that he would not support the Senate’s current proposal, as written, due to his concerns about it not properly addressing the deficit.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/scott-perry-sept-2023-capitol-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-07 16:06:35.446247

The state is taking bids from probation programs across Tennessee to resume supervision services to thousands of people on the brink of being sentenced to prison time. Requests for proposals are to be filed by April 14.
Department of Correction spokesperson Dorinda Carter declined to say whether the state is taking a new direction, only that probation services contracts were set to expire and bids were re-issued to provide “alternatives to incarceration.”
Gov. Bill Lee’s administration — despite orders from lawmakers to keep Community Corrections going because of its effectiveness — practically wrote the program out of existence with a request for proposals that required different guidelines. Vendors would have to offer either day reporting centers, outpatient treatment or a residential facility, and some weren’t prepared to make such a shift.
Davidson County Community Corrections keeps clients alive

Legislators also sent a strong message to correction officials at an August 2023 meeting that they wanted the program to be renewed, instead of shifting all offenders to the state’s probation program, which is considered understaffed and less effective. Lawmakers enacted the program in 1985 as a last-ditch effort to keep people who didn’t qualify for regular probation out of prison.
Republican Sen. Ed Jackson of Jackson has been working for three years to renew the program to allow Madison County’s Community Corrections to start serving probationers again.
“Ever since they did away with it in several counties across the state, every one of them has said we really need it back. It’s been effective, it’s been good for us, keeps some people out of jail, lets them stay out and work, be supervised locally instead of going to a correctional facility,” Jackson said. 
The program cost $13.8 million when in full swing in 2022.

The decision reversed a Biden administration decision that rescinded a $5 million Title X grant in 2023 because the state’s health department said it would no longer refer patients for abortions under Oklahoma’s restrictive abortion laws. Providing education and counseling about abortions at the patient’s request had been required to receive the federal grants.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond sued in federal court in 2023, claiming the loss of the grant was punishment for Oklahoma’s efforts to “protect unborn life.”
The Trump administration last week dropped the challenge and restored nearly $2 million of the grant, said Erica Rankin, a spokesperson for the Health Department. She said the agency doesn’t know yet what the total award will be. 
Rankin said the agency is appreciative of the efforts to restore Oklahoma’s Title X grant and looks forward to providing important services throughout the state. 
“The funding, together with state and local dollars, pays for our medical and support staff as well as supplies, training and equipment,” she said in a statement. “Our staff provides the services at our county health department locations in 68 counties and we contract with (Oklahoma City-County Health Department) and Tulsa to provide these services.”
The Trump administration recently pulled over $27 million in Title X funding to family planning clinics, including Oklahoma’s Planned Parenthood. 
Tennessee also saw its Title X funding partially restored.

They urge lawmakers to maintain abortion rights, reject school vouchers, expand Medicaid, stop harming trans kids, and legalize marijuana. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A “defeated” single mother seeking health coverage, a disabled Navy veteran who wants to move to Kansas but can’t afford the taxes and a former state internal auditor fed up with corruption and bureaucracy were among the suggestions submitted to Kansas’ GOP-led Senate Committee on Government Efficiency.
The majority of submissions to the committee’s public suggestion portal, which debuted Jan. 31 and was the subject of public records requests, included complaints that do not align with the policy priorities of the majority party. Instead, top suggestions included maintaining abortion rights, leaving school vouchers out of public education funding, critiques of leadership, expanding the state’s Medicaid program, focusing on substantial policy issues instead of legislation targeted at trans kids, and more than 60 references to legalizing marijuana.
Kansas Reflector obtained leaked copies of the more than 1,500 submissions sent to officials between Feb. 3 and March 28 containing specific public input from across the state alongside sarcastic replies, spam and suggestions in jest. A significant portion of those submissions showed a sense of disillusionment with Kansas politics, politicians and government. A few submissions contained personal stories of inefficiencies in state government. Even fewer included complaints or opinions in line with Republican policy.
Sen. Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican and chair of the efficiency committee, has promised that the committee will meet outside of the legislative session to review the submissions. Republican leadership created the Senate Committee on Government Efficiency, or COGE, earlier this year in response to the similar federal effort from billionaire Elon Musk called the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The committee sponsored 11 bills this session, many of which targeted public assistance programs, public employees or spending cuts. Little, if any, of the committee’s work this year aligned with what Kansans suggested.
Suggestions could be submitted in one of two ways: via email or a standardized form in a public portal that includes the submitter’s first and last name, an age range and their county, city and zip code. The form notes that submissions are public records. Kansas Reflector did not independently verify the names provided with submissions.
Kansas Reflector submitted a request for the public records to Erickson in February. Erickson said she would deliver them to journalists on April 9, even though she delivered them to a legislator on March 17 in response to his formal records request. Under the Kansas Open Records Act, public records are required to be provided as soon as possible. 
One suggestion from Ben Carmichael, a Wichita resident in his 30s, detailed concerns that the Legislature has morphed into a “full-time machine, expanding its power and influence without corresponding checks in accountability, transparency, or fiscal restraint.” He pointed to continued meetings among legislators outside of the session and the consolidation of power within the Legislative Coordinating Council, which is made up of the governor and legislative leadership. 
The line is blurred, he said, between “part-time service and full-time rule.”
“Instead of trusting Kansans to govern their own lives and communities, the state has taken on a paternalistic posture, eroding both personal freedom and local governance,” Carmichael wrote. “This is not only inefficient government — it is unjust government.”
Carmichael added that in times of national division and economic uncertainty, Kansans don’t need more laws, rules or interference.
“They need a Legislature that knows its limits and remembers its mandate: to serve, not to rule,” Carmichael wrote. “Shrink the footprint of government. Restore the citizen Legislature. Let Kansans live free.”

Attacks on health and autonomy
Around 300 submissions included mention of abortion. Most begged legislators to leave the issue alone, as voters made their opinions clear in the August 2022 primary, during which a constitutional amendment to eliminate abortion rights failed by a 59-41 margin.
Bethany Quesnell, a 30-something in Wamego, said elected officials could be most effective if they listened to the stories of the constituents in their districts.
“Don’t just stop listening after one person who matches your personal beliefs, either,” Quesnell wrote.
And if an issue has been voted on in recent years, Quesnell suggested officials refrain from bringing that issue up again.
“Abortion is a great example,” Quesnell said. “Kansans made their opinions known and we don’t want to hear about it anymore.”
Submitters characterized the Legislature’s continued focus on abortion regulation as a waste of time and money.
“The amount of times transgender healthcare and abortion have come up in this legislature is downright wasteful,” said Kat Stucky, a Cheney resident in her 30s.
More than 130 suggestions told lawmakers to stop legislating trans issues.
Stucky, and several other commenters, said trans people make up a tiny fraction of Kansas’ population but have received a significant amount of focus, particularly this legislative session.
Pamela Sturm, a septuagenarian from Kansas City, Kansas, said the state could save money if the Legislature focused on issues guided by voter’s actions.
“The legislature has decided that attacking transgender kids is a more legitimate target for their attention than dealing with real issues for Kansans, just as they’ve decided to deny Kansas residents legitimate access to cannabis and that it’s okay for rural hospitals to close because they refuse to honor the will of the people by expanding Medicaid in our state,” Sturm wrote.

Expanding Medicaid
A “very frustrated and defeated” single mother of three, Ashlie Bruner, wrote to legislators in February detailing a recent denial of health care coverage under the state’s Medicaid program. Bruner is caught in what is known as the Medicaid gap.
Her employer doesn’t offer health insurance. She said she earns $1,200 a month while the state Medicaid income cap for a household of four is $880 a month.
“This has left me in a position where I can not afford health insurance or do not qualify for lower rates or state insurance as my income is either too high or too low,” she said. “The system is flawed.”
Average rental prices, bills and necessities make up a majority of Bruner’s spending, and, as a single parent, she said she struggles to pay those costs.
“I know I’m not the only person with this problem,” she said. “And it leaves the question of what am I supposed to do?”
Bruner begged legislators for a solution because she cannot seek medical care without paying out of pocket, leaving her “suffering through illnesses or medical conditions unable to afford the help I need.”
The vast majority of the roughly 180 submissions that mentioned Medicaid supported expansion or opposed further cuts to the program. Kansas is one of 10 states that hasn’t expanded Medicaid. Roger Smith, a Wichita resident in his 70s, suggested the Legislature ensure Medicaid fraud isn’t taking place by reviewing and confirming that Medicaid participants are appropriately using allocated funds.
“Let us all be responsible for supplying the resources needed to those that truly need it,” Smith said. “Being a good steward at all levels is very important for everyone’s survival.”

Funding or dismantling education
Suggestions on education were varied. Legislators in recent years have attempted to impose influence on education typically reserved for the Kansas State Board of Education. The Legislature controls funding for public schools and has the ability to create voucher programs.
Sandra Kirby, a 40-something from Pittsburg, asked legislators to oppose any legislation that would eliminate the Kansas State Department of Education. Kirby said taxpayers shouldn’t support any religious institution or school.
“If a person wanted to send their kids to a private or religious school- so be it,” Kirby wrote, “but leave the rest of Kansans alone.”
Kirby added: “NO VOUCHERS.”
Ryan Patton, a Hutchinson resident in his 40s, said the Kansas education system costs taxpayers around $18,000 annually per student, which is true according to KSDE data. Homeschooling produces better results, he said.
“The Kansas education system is far beyond repair and needs to be dismantled,” Patton wrote. “There is extreme amounts of waste of these funds that never reach the teachers let alone the children.”
Rick Ruppe, who did not include an age or location in his email to the committee, applauded the Legislature’s proposal to shift the Kansas Supreme Court judicial selection process to a popular vote instead of the current nomination and appointment system.
It’s long overdue, he said.
State education funding, Ruppe said, is one area that has been part of a series of “bad outcomes in decisions being made by the court, which have been politically and ideologically slanted towards liberal and progressive viewpoints.”
The Kansas Supreme Court has repeatedly determined the Legislature is not adequately funding education. Ruppe characterized the wording of the Kansas State Constitution that has been used to determine funding requirements as vague.
“This has led to this issue becoming a political football, with the punting of a real solution, much like kicking a can down the road, with no clear criteria for what ‘sufficient or adequate’ funding is,” he said.
He added that the court also erred in ruling the state constitution includes implicit rights that allow legal abortions.

‘Frivolous lawsuits’
Nearly 60 submissions included criticism of the Kansas Attorney General’s performance. Many claimed Kris Kobach’s “frivolous lawsuits” have cost Kansas taxpayers millions, and others called for him to be fired.
Amy Warfield, a Hays resident in her 30s, said “a more efficient Kansas state government would better seek to reign in vanity lawsuits” from Kobach, which include banning abortion drug mifepristone, blocking immigrants without citizenship from being counted in the Census, and limiting Title IX protections for youths.
“In fact, the list of confrontations and lawsuits is so long and such a tangled web, it’s difficult to parse through what is even in the best interest of the people of this state and its funds, or just ideological check boxes,” Warfield said.
Brice Cronn, a Colby resident in his 40s, suggested the Legislature refrain from passing any legislation having to do with Kobach.
“Millions in litigation costs are unacceptable,” Cronn wrote.
“This culture war stuff makes you popular with a certain voting block, but it is a nonsensical money pit that doesn’t do anything to improve the wellbeing of Kansans,” he said.
Kari Nilson, an Andover resident in her 40s, said the best way to cut government spending would be to “get Kris Kobach to quit filing lawsuits that the people of Kansas don’t want to be part of.”

Government efficiency
Roberta Hill, who identified herself as a disabled Navy veteran, began her email by giving credit to the state of Kansas for taking care of its veterans.
“I as a 100% disabled female veteran would move to Kansas, yet I financially could not afford to own a home,” Hill said.
In her current state, which she did not disclose, she doesn’t have to pay property taxes on the home she owns.
“I don’t abuse my taxes exempt status,” she said. “I believe in paying taxes on a lot of things. If Kansas allowed veterans to own homes and not pay property taxes. You would have them in your state paying taxes on other things. Helping the economy of Kansas!”
Bills aimed at providing tax relief for veterans did not progress this session.
A handful of submissions requested greater transparency from Kansas government.
Jadie Chauncey, a Junction City resident, submitted a list of three issues, each with a clear proposal aimed at making Kansas government more open, fair and accessible. The three suggestions included eliminating “gut and go” bills, which allow legislators to entirely overhaul the content of a bill with unrelated legislation.
“This process confuses voters and allows bills to pass without proper review,” Chauncey said.
The second item suggested the Legislature make it easier for Kansans to submit testimony and establish a mandatory 72-hour notice before testimony submission deadlines. Chauncey called the current system “confusing and outdated.”
“Some committees give very short notice for hearings, change their rules often, and require paper copies of testimony,” Chauncey said. “This makes it hard for people who live far from Topeka or have jobs during the day to participate.”
Lastly, Chauncey noticed special interest groups tend to get more time than citizens and suggested ensuring all speakers at hearings get equal time to testify.
Mark Ummel, a Burlingame resident in his 60s, said he performed internal audits and investigations for 15 years at one of the state’s largest agencies. He retired not because he was ready but because he “became fed up with various senior leaders at the agency who would use their position of power to hire their personal friends for high paying jobs without advertising publicly, review audits only to hide the malfeasance or illegal activity and position their personal needs above what is best for the agency.”
State government operations could become more efficient, Ummel said, with improved audit practices that evaluate internal processes, wasteful spending and potential fraud.
“If the legislative process can be described as ‘making sausage,’ ” he said, “the inner workings inside the agencies could be describe(d) as the ‘slaughterhouse.’ ”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250407_134646-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-07 16:06:35.446247

The South Dakota Democratic Party announced on Monday that it will conduct public town halls in four South Dakota cities “in the absence of South Dakota’s Republican senators and congressman.” 
Afterward, state Republican Party Chairman Jim Eschenbaum told South Dakota Searchlight by phone that he’s also heard complaints about the congressional delegation’s accessibility. 
“Even some Republicans have been saying that,” Eschenbaum said.

Democrats held a press conference to announce their town halls, which will be led by Nikki Gronli, former state rural development director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture during the Biden administration. Julian Beaudion, a Sioux Falls businessman and former state trooper turned community activist, will also participate in the town halls. 
The press conference came two days after thousands of people took to the streets in Sioux Falls, and lesser crowds also gathered in Pierre and Rapid City, to join in national protests against the Trump administration.
Democrats at the Monday press conference alleged that the congressional delegation has been “silent” and ignored calls and emails from constituents who are upset about the Trump administration’s mass firings of federal employees, dismantling of federal departments and programs, and freezes or cancellations of federal grants and spending.
“A chainsaw has been taken to the pocketbooks and retirement plans of hardworking South Dakotans, all while safety net programs are being dismantled,” Gronli said.
Beaudion added, “We are about putting the people first.”

The announcement follows public criticisms of U.S. Senators John Thune and Mike Rounds, along with Rep. Dusty Johnson, who are all Republicans, for not holding in-person town halls. None of the three offices responded immediately Monday to South Dakota Searchlight’s request for a response to those criticisms.
Last month, media outlets including Politico reported that U.S. House Republican leaders advised their members to avoid in-person town hall meetings due to increasing confrontations with constituents over policies carried out by President Donald Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire Elon Musk. 
The reports said House Speaker Mike Johnson and National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Richard Hudson recommended shifting to virtual formats like tele-town halls to mitigate disruptions from protesters.

New Mexico is one of a handful of states that will see an increased number of FBI agents to address unresolved violent crimes in Indian Country, including crimes related to a national crisis of Indigenous people disproportionately going missing and being killed.The Operation Not Forgotten initiative will send 60 FBI personnel to 10 field offices across the country, including Albuquerque, over six months, the Justice Department announced earlier this week.The operation has “provided investigative support” to over 500 cases in the past two years, resulting in “the recovery of 10 child victims, 52 arrests, and 25 indictments or judicial complaints,” according to an agency press release.

This next phase will include the largest number of agents yet, who will work in communities for the longest amount of time to date, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eliot Neal said during a meeting Friday of the state’s Missing and Murdered Indigenous Peoples Task Force in Farmington.
Neal, who is a member of the task force, told members it’s his understanding that agents sent to New Mexico will be working primarily in Farmington and Gallup.
“We have been able to make some great progress,” Neal said about working with agents sent to the state in the past year or two as part of the operation. “Unfortunately, because it’s been a short period of time, I feel like we make progress, and then [the agents are] gone, right? So this is a great opportunity to have them around for a little bit longer.”
During the last phase of the operation, in 2024, 50 FBI personnel worked in 10 field offices for four months, according to the agency, instead of six as called for this year.
The FBI’s Indian Country program had about 4,300 open investigations nationally at the start of fiscal year 2025, including over 900 death investigations, 1,000 child abuse investigations, and more than 500 domestic violence and adult sexual abuse investigations, according to the Justice Department.
The federal government has jurisdiction in prosecuting several types of violent crimes in Indian Country, including murder, kidnapping and sexual abuse.
‘Don’t give up’ 
Relatives of Indigenous people who have gone missing or been killed in the state spoke to the task force about their frustrations with a lack of law enforcement.
Becky Martinez, whose brother Calvin Martinez disappeared in 2019, told Neal that many Indigenous people go missing or are killed off reservations. That’s part of why the Justice Department created a regional outreach program focused on the crisis, which is the program he was hired under, Neal responded.
“I have worked on cases that have happened off the reservations where we use FBI resources,” Neal said. “The FBI has the cellular analysis survey team, for example. We’ve been able to help state and local law enforcement with cell site warrants, things like that, investigative techniques for cases where the FBI doesn’t have jurisdiction. But in those instances, it’s going to be an assist kind of situation.”
Since Julius Largo went missing near Morgan Lake in northwestern New Mexico in November, his family has organized searches for him, on their own and with help from a local nonprofit, his sister told the task force.
“We don’t see any FBI or criminal investigators until there’s a deceased body, and that’s what sucks,” Danielle Werito said. “With all these tips that we got, and I submitted to our detective, nothing is being done about it.”
Largo is a father and also has nieces and nephews who miss him, Werito said.
Mathilda Silago has been missing from Nageezi, also in northwestern New Mexico, since 2019. Her disappearance, Darrell Tsosie told task force members, has been “very challenging” for his and Mathilda’s daughter.
“I just want to tell every person out there online, those in attendance, again, you’re in my thoughts. You’re in my prayers. It is very challenging. Please don’t give up,” Tsosie said. “Let us keep each other in prayer and let us support one another. And for all of the law enforcement agencies out there, no more excuses. No more excuses. Please work together and let’s get these relatives home. Please.”
Gary Mike, whose daughter Ashlynne Mike, an 11-year-old Diné girl, was kidnapped and murdered on the Navajo Nation in 2016, also spoke to task force members.
“Please listen to all of these passionate people who represent their loved ones,” Mike said. “They are hurting. They’re looking for justice. They’re looking for their loved ones. Please understand, because I have been through that with my daughter Ashlynne.”
A 29-year-old man was sentenced to life imprisonment for her murder in 2017.
Also on Friday, New Mexico Department of Justice staffers shared updates to an online portal listing Indigenous people missing from New Mexico and the Navajo Nation. The portal now includes a tab displaying photos and stories of people who have been killed, submitted by their loved ones. There’s also a tab listing relevant community events.

John Fitzpatrick, R-Anaconda, explains his rationale for cutting some cultural and arts organizations' funding while increasing others on Feb. 21, 2025 (Photo via Montana Public Affairs Network). A state representative who called more than a dozen arts and cultural groups “slackers” and “no-shows” insists that he has no conflict of interest in the legislation, and therefore didn’t need to disclose to fellow lawmakers that his wife was leading the organization that got the largest increase of funds among the 75 groups that applied.
The organization, the St. Timothy’s Summer Music Festival, stands to get nearly three times as much funding from the state as the group had requested, while Rep. John Fitzpatrick, R-Anaconda, pushed to zero out funding requests from other groups.
Fitzpatrick’s wife, Connie, is listed on the application from St. Timothy’s, and used the same email account as one used by Rep. Fitzpatrick in his capacity as a lawmaker to communicate with the group about the funding process.
Fitzpatrick told the Daily Montanan via email on Friday that he isn’t affiliated with the organization, and that as a resident of the smaller Deer Lodge County, he knows many of the residents, which could be interpreted as a conflict of interest virtually anytime someone from the Anaconda area shows up to testify at the Legislature.
“I am not affiliated with the festival, and I do not personally benefit from the appropriation,” Fitzpatrick said.
In fact, he said that he and his wife are financial supporters of it, actually underwriting part of the festival so that it could meet the minimum requirements to apply for state funding, $5,000. The group is currently slated to received $12,500, 143% more than it had originally requested.
But in a fiery legislative meeting in February, dozens of people showed up to protest the way Fitzpatrick had led a budgeting subcommittee dedicated to distributing arts and cultural funding.
Groups from around the state said that for years, they had submitted their grant requests, but had not been required to appear before the legislative subcommittee. In fact, many were told that attending the sessions was not mandatory and would not affect funding, according to multiple residents. However, Fitzpatrick said that he expected that groups or individuals representing the organizations would at least attend via remote video conference to advocate for funding.
He told fellow lawmakers when those groups “no-showed,” he and other committee members decided to zero out the budget requests, leaving larger groups like the Charlie M. Russell Museum in Great Falls and the Alberta Bair Theatre in Billings, along with other smaller organizations, with no grant funding. Fitzpatrick also pointed out that many of the organizations were asking for less than $10,000 but had operational budgets of hundreds of thousands or millions.
Still, for nearly two hours in February, arts and cultural groups railed against the decision, saying that the change was not clearly articulated by the Montana Arts Council, the coordinating agency for the grants. Employees of the council agreed that they had misunderstood the change as well, and hadn’t communicated that testimony was required.
During the hearings and subsequent discussion with lawmakers, Fitzpatrick  didn’t disclose that his wife had submitted an application for a summertime Anaconda music festival, and that the approved funding was more than double what had originally been requested.
He told the Daily Montanan that after nearly two dozen groups did not show up, the subcommittee had a decision: Leave money sitting, or put it to work. So the subcommittee, comprised of both Democrats and Republicans, opted to allocate the funds to groups that had attended, giving many, if not all, more money than they requested, including the St. Timothy’s Summer Music Festival, whose application was submitted by Connie Fitzpatrick.
Rep. Fitzpatrick explained that without her help, the festival was in jeopardy, and she submitted the application to keep it going. He also said that even though additional funds stand to be allocated, a one-to-one funding match requirement means the small musical festival will probably not be able to use more money.
  Amend it or else 

Before HB 9 got out of the full House Appropriations Committee on Thursday, Democrats were concerned about another aspect, political hardball. Democrats said that they had been told that if the amendments to zero out the funding for some of the groups weren’t approved, the entire bill may be killed by the governor or Republican leaders.
“These groups teach children how to dance, how to act, and expose them to music. I served on a school board for six years, and I learned that we ought not punish children for the mistakes adults make,” said Rep. Luke Muszkiewicz, D-Helena. “The good bill sponsor (Fitzpatrick) has said if the amendment doesn’t pass, the whole bill will not.”
Five Democrat representatives voted against amending the bill, but after the fight to restore funding failed, the entire House Appropriations Committee passed the amended bill 22-0.
During executive action on the bill, Fitzpatrick did not deny that bill could be killed if the committee didn’t hold the line on changing the funding.
“I realize it’s a difficult vote for many. It’s not a difficult vote for me,” Fitzpatrick said. “Some of these groups are less than one mile away, and they couldn’t spend five minutes to pick up a $12,000 check, and they failed to do that. Let’s at least take care of the 47 people who had enough pride in their program and enough respect for the legislative process to show up and testify.”
Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee said they were forced into a tough situation: Either reject arts and cultural funding and hurt all the groups, or accept the changes made by Fitzpatrick’s subcommittee that would help some.
In the end, 15 groups had their funding wiped out because they did not show up to the committee. Others had their funding reduced if they only provided written testimony. Those groups that testified — either in person or via video — saw increased funding.
In total, 75 groups asked for, and originally received various amounts, mostly between $12,500 and $13,000.
After the amendment, however, 15 groups were left with zero dollars, while 10 had their grants reduced to $2,000, a roughly 85% cut.
After the amendment, the remaining groups all received an increase in funding to $19,660 to $20,160, a bump of between 55% and 57%.
The only group to receive more than that was St. Timothy’s festival that Connie Fitzpatrick had submitted. That amount rose from $5,000 to $12,160 — an increase of 143%.
During the February meeting, Fitzpatrick said that had any of the organizations showed up and apologized, they may have changed the decision.
Rep. Mary Caferro, the top ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said that she didn’t know that Fitzpatrick had a connection to any of the organizations.
“We were really concerned. We felt that they had lost funding inappropriately,” she said, “But we also wanted to support HB 9 because it did provide some projects to get funding at some level.”
She said she does not believe anyone on the Democrats’ side knew of the connection.
“That’s pretty bothersome,” she said. “I don’t remember any disclosing about it.”
At least one other Democrat, though, came to Fitzpatrick’s defense — Sen. Ellie Boldman of Missoula, who sat on the joint subcommittee that made the decision to zero out some grants, a move that she said she supported, even more after the criticism of Fitzpatrick.
Boldman said that in a small state like Montana, lawmakers have close, personal friendships with many who testify before the committees that are never disclosed. Furthermore, she said lawmakers have a responsibility to question every allocation, and they couldn’t do that because some groups did not show up.
“The idea that Rep. Fitzpatrick is the chattel of his wife and he must also disclose her unpaid volunteer connections in the community that we all know Rep. Fitzpatrick represents is also absurd,” Boldman said. “These types of relationships do not rise to any ‘conflict of interest’ and there is no obligation to disclose, and, in my opinion, the whisper and innuendo is unfair and irresponsible.”

But in the first few months of this administration, the practice of law has changed in disturbing ways, and we struggle with how to explain this to our students. Lawyers take an oath to support the Constitution — yet all around us, lawyers are making a mockery of that oath.
Recently, the law firm Paul Weiss capitulated to Donald Trump in a way so brazen and self-defeating that it rattled even those of us already poised to expect cowardice from Big Law. Trump began his campaign of retribution against private law firms that represented clients adverse to him or his allies by revoking the firms’ security clearances and threatening to cancel their clients’ government contracts. A judge halted the first order, directed at the law firm Perkins Coie, stating that it was likely unconstitutional. Nonetheless, Trump then issued a nearly identical order targeting Paul Weiss, and instead of fighting it, Paul Weiss folded.
The firm agreed to give Trump sway over the recipients of $40 million in pro bono services, and, per Trump’s press release, “conduct a comprehensive audit of all its employment practices” and “not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies.” Most chillingly, Trump reported that Paul Weiss “acknowledged the wrongdoing” of former partner Mark Pomerantz, who had worked as a prosecutor in the Manhattan DA’s office on the Trump hush money case.
It is bad enough that Trump is waging this campaign of bald political retribution. It is a different kind of betrayal entirely that Paul Weiss capitulated, especially when the order is likely illegal. Like Skadden and Millbank, which recently negotiated similar deals, Paul Weiss probably believes it is saving its business, but who will employ lawyers in a society devoid of the rule of law?
Lawyers working in this administration would earn failing grades if they were our students. U.S District Court for the Western District of Washington Judge John Cougheneour, granting an injunction against the executive order purporting to end birthright citizenship, said: “Frankly, I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar would state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order. It just boggles my mind.”
Lawyers appearing before U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge James Boasberg made representations about the expulsion of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador that the judge deemed “woefully inadequate.” Judge Boasberg has since faced baseless calls for impeachment.
These attacks on the legal profession, the judiciary, and the rule of law are escalating and relentless. Meanwhile, applications for law school are skyrocketing. We’d like to celebrate. Being a lawyer is a wonderful career, full of opportunities to help people and institutions, enable progress, and solve problems. But how can we defend our profession when so many attorneys are aiding this administration’s assault on the rule of law and enabling this constitutional crisis?
For solace, we look to lawyers who are still doing the right thing in the face of these attacks on our profession. Jenner & Block and WilmerHale have both filed suit against the executive orders targeted at them. Other Big Law associates have protested their firms’ silence in the face of Trump’s executive orders targeting firms. Attorneys remaining in the federal government continue to labor in service to the American people, even though Elon Musk and his allies are deriding them as deadweight and decimating their agencies. Others have taken the brave step of resigning when their ethics have been compromised.
Future lawyers have a role to play, too. Our first-year students are preparing their annual moot court arguments, and have practiced how to be persuasive without misleading the court. Upper-level students know to call out and correct the misinterpretation of legal authorities and the misstatement of facts. Outside the classroom, students have been working to connect immigrants to legal resources. Others have used their developing legal expertise to testify for the first time about legislation in the New Hampshire State House.
Our students are a credit to the future of our profession. No matter their political affiliation or philosophical differences, they will swear fealty to the Constitution. Shame on the lawyers currently making a mockery of that oath. The rest of us will continue to fight for the rule of law, because that’s what we promised to do.

Braun’s news release said the goals of the initiative include establishing a state-based nuclear working group with stakeholders, assessing community education needs related to nuclear energy along with developing education resources, a statewide community engagement strategy and analyzing the potential for economic development.
Long-term objectives include building a “positive and informed” advanced nuclear environment throughout the state and supporting Indiana’s strong economy and workforce.
Additional goals include potential legislative and fiscal recommendations. Indiana lawmakers have moved a bill this year incentivizing small modular nuclear reactors over the objections of some consumer protection and environmental groups.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold announced Monday that she will run for attorney general in 2026. 
“I am running for Attorney General because Colorado needs a strong, proven leader in this critical moment,” Griswold said in a statement. “I’ll stand up to (President) Donald Trump to protect our rights and freedoms. I’ll fight for working- and middle-class Coloradans, hold big corporations accountable, and safeguard our land, air, and water.”
Griswold, a Democrat, was first elected secretary of state in 2018. She was reelected in 2022 and is term-limited. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is also term-limited and announced his run for governor in January. Griswold was initially expected to join the race for governor, but changed course in going for attorney general instead.

As secretary of state, Griswold oversaw implementation of automatic voter registration and supported legislation criminalizing threats to election workers, fake elector schemes and compromising voting equipment.
An outspoken Trump critic, Griswold supported the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision to bar Trump from Colorado’s primary election ballot under the insurrection clause of the 14th Amendment, which the U.S. Supreme Court overturned. She was a defendant in the case filed by six Republican voters in Colorado. Her office also led an investigation into former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, who was convicted for her role in a breach of her own election equipment in an attempt to prove the 2020 election was stolen. 
Griswold faced intense criticism after she disclosed in late October that a document posted to her office’s website included a hidden but accessible worksheet containing passwords to election equipment in counties throughout the state. County clerks said that while election security in the state remained strong following the breach, many were upset that Griswold did not inform them about the breach until after the Colorado Republican Party learned about and announced it.
Early supporters for Griswold’s candidacy include U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, a Centennial Democrat, and Colorado House Majority Leader Monica Duran. Gail Schoettler, former Democratic lieutenant governor and treasurer of Colorado, will serve as Griswold’s campaign chair. 
“Secretary Griswold is the strong leader we need as Attorney General,” Schoettler said in a statement. “As she always has, Jena will stand up to Donald Trump, MAGA extremists, and anyone who threatens the Colorado way of life. And as a woman, she’ll protect reproductive healthcare.”
The attorney general heads the Colorado Department of Law and oversees enforcement of consumer protection and antitrust laws, defends state laws in legal challenges, and advocates for law enforcement and community safety.  
Democratic Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty and Democratic former speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives Crisanta Duran are also running for attorney general. Conner Peddington is the only Republican candidate to file paperwork in the race so far. Primary elections to decide party nominees for state offices will be held in June 2026.

“We’re going to follow the law sir. We’ll see you in court,” Gov. Janet Mills told the president in a heated exchange while attending a White House event as part of the National Governors Association winter summit on Feb. 21. 
The Democrat was referring to the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey maintain that law supersedes the president’s edict. 
Mills warned in a statement later that day that the “rule of law in our country” is at stake and that the president will likely continue to target those who speak out against his wishes.
“Maine may be one of the first states to undergo an investigation by his administration, but we won’t be the last,” Mills said.

Maine AG sues Trump administration for USDA funding freeze that hit school meals


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Monday April 7, 2025 2:27 pm












The Maine Attorney General is suing the Trump administration for freezing funds that help feed children in schools and childcare centers, as well as adults with disabilities in congregate settings.
Attorney General Aaron Frey filed a complaint Monday with the U.S. District Court in Maine against the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Secretary Brooke Rollins for their decision to withhold funding because of the state’s alleged violation of Title IX in educational programming.
In a letter sent to Gov. Janet Mills last Wednesday, Rollins that said she was freezing “Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools” and warned it was “only the beginning.” While the letter said the freeze would not affect programs that provide food to children, according to the complaint, the Child Nutrition Program of the Maine Department of Education was unable to access several sources of federal funding the following day.

Pingree calls for acting Social Security director to step down over ‘vindictive actions’


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday April 3, 2025 10:32 am












U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree reiterated her call for Social Security Administration Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek to step down after leaked emails reported on by The Washington Post revealed that he deliberately sought to punish Maine after Gov. Janet Mills’ heated exchange with President Donald Trump over the state’s transgender protections.
On March 6, the Social Security Administration notified the Maine Department of Health and Human Services that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
In a response to an emailed warning from a staff member that the change “would result in improper payments and potential for identity theft,” the acting director made clear that he acting in retaliation.
“While our improper payments will go up, and fraudsters may compromise identities, no money will go from the public trust to a petulant child,” he wrote. 
In a statement Wednesday, Pingree asked, “If a federal agency can be turned into a political hit squad at the whim of an acting appointee, what checks remain on executive power?”
“Commissioner Dudek’s vindictive actions against Maine represent a fundamental betrayal of public trust that disqualifies him from public service. He should not only resign or be removed from office; he should be investigated for his flagrant abuse of power.” 
By March 7, the agency had reversed course after Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins sought answers about the action. A spokesperson for Collins previously told Maine Morning Star that the Republican received a call from Dudek during which he claimed it was done in error.
When asked about the insult, Mills told reporters: “This is the same guy that admitted that he suspended Maine’s enumeration at birth and funeral directors’ program. First, he said it was a mistake, said it was inadvertent, then, God bless, Sen. King and Sen. Collins got after him and then he admitted he did it on purpose because the governor of Maine was not ‘sufficiently cordial to the president and I said, ‘I can’t speak to that.’”

USDA pausing funding to Maine school programs over alleged Title IX violations


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday April 2, 2025 5:35 pm












The U.S. Department of Agriculture is pausing federal funding for some school programs in response to Maine’s alleged violations of Title IX, though the agency has not conducted a formal investigation.
“You cannot openly violate federal law against discrimination in education and expect federal funding to continue unabated,” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins wrote in a letter to Gov. Janet Mills on Wednesday. “Today, I am freezing Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools.
“This is only the beginning,” the letter warned.
School lunch programs, which are funded by the USDA, will not be impacted by the freeze, Rollins said. However, the agency is “reviewing all research and education-related funding in Maine” for compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws “and the priorities of the Trump administration.”
For Maine to continue receiving funding, the state will have to “demonstrate compliance with Title IX’s protection of female student athletes from having to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males,” Rollins’ letter said.

Title IX case against Maine schools headed to U.S. Department of Justice

The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning Monday to the Maine Department of Education regarding its noncompliance with a federal directive for allowing trans girls to participate in girls’ sports.
If the state does not propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office by April 11, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice, the letter said.
Meanwhile, a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights office that found Maine in violation of Title IX for “continuing to unlawfully allow” trans girls to compete in girl’s sports has been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a Monday social media post from the agency.

Federal probe targets Maine school gender policies, citing parental rights


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Friday March 28, 2025 5:12 pm












District policies that protect students’ privacy when it comes to gender identity might be violating federal law by depriving parents of information, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
In another directed investigation launched by the department based on reports from right-wing media about Maine districts complying with the Maine Human Rights Act, the department alleged that by developing plans to affirm students’ gender, districts may be in violation of the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA).
In a letter dated March 28 to the Maine Department of Education, Frank Miller, acting director for the Student Privacy Policy Office, highlighted a 2016 memo by the Maine Human Rights Commission that explains the interpretation of the Act: “In the event that the student and their parent/legal guardian do not agree with regard to the student’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, the educational institution should, whenever possible, abide by the wishes of the student with regard to their gender identity and expression while at school,” the memo states.
“The overall memorandum on its face appears to give school officials discretion that would infringe on the rights of a parent under FERPA,” Miller said in his letter.
He also alleged that “this same rhetoric may lead to Title IX violations if applied in a school environment,” which may warrant the investigation to be referred to the OCR.

Gov. Mills responds to Trump’s demand for apology


By: Lauren McCauley - Monday March 24, 2025 12:49 pm












Gov. Janet Mills responded to President Donald Trump’s demand that she apologize after the Democrat refused to capitulate to an executive order banning transgender girls from student athletics.
“I don’t communicate with public officials by tweet or Instagram or social media,” Mills told reporters, referring to Trump’s weekend post on Truth Social, at a Monday event celebrating the purchase of Bangor mobile home park by its residents.
“Second, all of my issues are about the rule of law pure and simple,” she continued. “It’s not about transgender sports, it is about who makes the laws and who enforces the laws. I read the constitution. Constitution says the president, the chief executive, shall take care that the law be faithfully executed. It doesn’t allow him to make laws out of whole cloth by tweet or Instagram post or press release or executive order that is fundamental law, and I stand for the rule of law and the separation of powers.”
Without naming Trump, Mills went on to say that “if the current occupant of the White House wants to protect women and girls, he should start by protecting the women and teenage girls who are suffering miscarriages and dying because they can’t get basic, life-saving health care in states across this country,” according to the Bangor Daily News.
She added that people in Maine are waiting for an economic plan. “We’ve seen tariffs and threat of tariffs that threaten our economy here in Maine and across the country.”
Last week, the U.S. Department of Education notified Maine that its Department of Education was found in violation of Title IX, a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools, giving the state 10 days to comply. Maine is expected to respond with legal action.

Trump demands Gov. Mills give ‘full-throated apology’


By: Lauren McCauley -  9:14 am












In a post to his Truth Social account early Saturday, President Donald Trump demanded a “full-throated apology” from Gov. Janet Mills, following her refusal to cave to his administration’s order to ban transgender girls from girls sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination.
The Republican president also incorrectly claimed that the state has issued an apology for its policy — something that was swiftly rebutted by Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who wrote that, as the “official keeper of all state records and guardian of the seal,” she “can confirm ‘State of Maine’ hasn’t apologized.”
Here’s Trump’s full post:
“While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House Governor’s Conference, we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases. Therefore, we need a full-throated apology from the Governor herself, and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the Federal Government again, before this case can be settled. I’m sure she will be able to do that quite easily. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! DJT”

U.S. Department of Education determines Maine guilty of violating Title IX


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 20, 2025 10:04 am












The U.S. Department of Education notified Maine late Wednesday that its Department of Education was found in violation of a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools.
The letter, addressed to Maine Education Commissioner Pender Makin from the U.S. DOE Office for Civil Rights, said the determination is based on state and district policies that permit transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. It gives the state ten days to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration is interpreting Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.



This finding is the latest among several federal probes launched against the state following a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports.

USDA deems University of Maine System to be in compliance with Title IX


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 19, 2025 5:32 pm












Though the University of Maine System was officially cleared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture of any violations of Title IX, Chancellor Dannel Malloy said the system had been in compliance the entire time, having previously called the probe “an unnecessary distraction.”
UMS follows National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, which were updated last month to ban trans women from women’s sports after President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sport.
The USDA investigation was among several launched last month as part of federal scrutiny of Maine’s education policies, stemming from a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports. USDA froze funds to the university system last week for potential Title IX and Title IV violations, which ban sex and race-based discrimination respectively. After Sen. Susan Collins reportedly intervened with the Trump administration, funding to UMS was restored.
On Wednesday, USDA concluded its compliance review in a news release saying that the university system was in compliance but also warning the rest of the state to follow suit or risk losing funding.
“UMaine’s decision to side with sanity is a win for women and girls in Maine,” the release said. “The choice for the rest of Maine is simple: protect equal opportunities for women, as required by law, or lose funding.”

Trump administration says Maine Principals’ Association, high school violating Title IX


By: Emma Davis - Monday March 17, 2025 7:46 pm












The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights announced on Monday that it determined the Maine Principals’ Association and Greely High School in Cumberland are each in violation of Title IX for allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports.
On Feb. 21, DHHS issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating that same federal civil rights law, which bans sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges, and on March 5 expanded the compliance review to MPA, which governs sports in Maine, and Greely High School.
According to DHHS, the entities can “voluntarily commit within 10 days to resolve the matter through a signed agreement or risk referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for appropriate action.”   The full agreement, obtained by the Bangor Daily News, can be read here.

USDA backtracks on university funding halt


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 13, 2025 12:30 pm












Two days after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would be halting funds to the University of Maine System while it continues its Title IX compliance review, the agency backtracked.
In a statement, Sen. Susan Collins said after consulting with the Trump administration she was alerted that the funding had been restored.
“This USDA funding is critically important not only to the University of Maine, but to our farmers and loggers, as well as to the many people who work in Maine’s agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry industries,” Collins said. “Now that funding has been restored, the work that the University does in partnership with the many people and communities who depend on these programs can continue.”

Amid probe, U.S. Department of Agriculture halts funding to Maine university system


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:30 pm












On March 10, just over two weeks after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced an investigation into the University of Maine System, school leaders received a forwarded email from USDA’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer apparently ordering a temporary pause in funding for the system while the agency evaluates whether it should take any follow-up actions to “prospective Title VI or Title IX violations,” according to a news release from the university system.
“Please take any necessary actions to effectuate this direction from leadership. This pause will remain in effect until further notice,” the USDA email said.
Last fiscal year, USDA awarded $29.78 million to UMaine for research on a wide variety of agriculture innovations and environmental issues, including PFAS contamination on Maine farms, sustainable packaging materials derived from Maine forest-based materials, potato breeding and varietal development, sustainable lobster fishing and support for 4-H youth leadership and STEM skill development programs, which serve tens of thousands of Maine youth every year. 
The University of Southern Maine also has several active USDA awards. 
The state’s public universities are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which banned trans women from women’s sports following Trump’s executive order, and are “operating in a manner entirely consistent with that association’s recently updated policies,” university spokesperson Samantha Warren said.
That means that the funding was halted despite the fact that the system can’t allow trans women to compete on women’s teams.

Social Security snafu puts state on edge


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:29 pm












Another incident that was initially thought to be retaliatory but later deemed an “error” had state officials on edge. 
On March 6, the Portland Press Herald reported that Maine Department of Health and Human Services had been notified by the Social Security Administration that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
The state agency sent an email to birth certifiers on March 5 alerting them of the change, “effective immediately.”
By March 7, the agency had reversed course while Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins asked for a briefing “to explain why this decision was made at the start.”
A spokesperson for Collins told Maine Morning Star that the Republican did receive a call from Social Security Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek during which he explained it was done in error and let her know it was fully reversed.

Maine Sea Grant to be renegotiated

Maine Sea Grant funding cut


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












The University of Maine said it was notified late Feb. 28 that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, according to university spokesperson Samantha Warren. 
The grant has helped finance statewide research, strengthened coastal communities and supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades. 
The Maine Sea Grant fosters coastal workforce development, hands-on marine science education for students of all grade levels, research to inform lobster and other fisheries management, as well as storm preparedness for working waterfronts. 
It has supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades, including 20 current university employees, according to Warren, who said that every federal dollar spent on the program results in $15 of economic activity in the state, amounting to a total annual impact of $23.5 million.
However, the letter from NOAA said the grant’s work is “no longer relevant to the focus of the Administration’s priorities and program objectives.”
Maine’s Sea Grant program is one of 34 across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country. However, it appears to have been the only one cut.

In a letter to Mills dated Feb. 25, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi threatened to sue the state if federal investigations show that “relevant Maine entities are indeed denying girls an equal opportunity to participate in sports and athletic events by requiring them to compete against” trans girls. 
“Maine should be on notice,” Bondi warned, adding that “the Department of Justice stands ready to take all appropriate action to enforce federal law,” referring to the Trump administration’s interpretation of TItle IX.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determines Maine guilty of Title IX violation


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 25, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX. 
Concluding just four days after it was launched, the investigation included no interviews, data requests or negotiations, according to the Maine Attorney General’s Office, which was notified by the agency via emailed letter that the state had violated Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges. The letter also handed the case over to the U.S. Department of Justice —  a rare outcome for such a probe.
The lack of process followed by the agency’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) defies decades of precedent, according to Jackie Wernz, a former OCR lawyer for the U.S. Department of Education who now represents schools nationwide in such cases. Within any federal agency, the OCR typically conducts lengthy investigations with fact-finding, interviews and legal analysis of how exactly the agency under investigation violated federal laws the office is tasked with upholding, including Title IX.
But in this case, OCR simply appears to be enforcing the Trump administration’s stance on trans athletes, according to Wernz. 
If Maine does not sue or comply, the department could withhold funds from the state as soon as 10 days after the notice, which was sent on Feb. 25. While the letter does not go into detail about the exact amount of funding that could be withheld, Maine received more than $700,000 from HHS in 2024.

“Should the University of Maine or other entities receiving funds from USDA be found to be out of compliance, additional funding may be in jeopardy,” Linden wrote.

On Feb. 21, the same day that the U.S. Department of Education announced its investigation into Maine, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights division quickly followed suit. 
The agency said it was initiating a compliance review of the Maine Department of Education, including the University of Maine System, “based on information that Maine intends to defy” the president’s executive order on transgender athletes.
“The investigation will examine whether the State of Maine engaged in discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, and its HHS implementing regulation,” the announcement read.

U.S. Department of Education Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:24 pm












Hours after Mills and Trump traded barbs, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced it was launching a Title IX investigation into the Maine Department of Education as well as Maine School Administrative District 51, which is based in Cumberland, in response to reports that Greely High School is “continuing to allow at least one male student to compete in girls’ categories.”
The agency is arguing that Maine schools’ adherence to the protections in the Maine Human Rights Act is in violation of Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or any other education program that receives federal funding.
In response, Mills issued a statement saying the effort to “withhold federal funding authorized and appropriated by Congress and paid for by Maine taxpayers in an attempt to coerce someone into compliance with his will” is “a violation of our Constitution and of our laws, which I took an oath to uphold.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donaldtrumpfeb112025_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-07 15:08:55.690627

The West Virginia House of Delegates passed a bill that would require local municipalities to hold their elections on the same day as statewide elections. (Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)The West Virginia House of Delegates has signed off on legislation that would require municipalities to hold their elections on the same day as state elections. Delegates passed Senate Bill 50 Monday with a vote of 96 to 2. 
Supporters of the bill say requiring municipalities to have their elections along with state elections will save cities and towns money and encourage voter turnout. According to the West Virginia Secretary of State’s Office, 113 municipalities across the state will have their elections in 2025, which is not a year for state elections. 
Morgantown’s election, for instance, is scheduled for April 29. Bridgeport’s election will be June 10. 
Under the version of the bill passed by the House, cities and towns have until 2028 to hold their elections on the same day as state elections. Delegates approved the change in a floor amendment offered by Del. Geno Chiarelli, R-Monongalia, on Friday. 
The Senate passed the bill unanimously on March 3. In the Senate’s version of the bill, the deadline was 2032. Those who advocated for a later deadline have said that some municipalities established their election dates in their charter, and that changing the charters may require an election. Others argued that state law would supersede municipal law and allow cities and towns to change the dates sooner. 
The Secretary of State’s Office also supported a later deadline, saying in a statement that it would allow more time for municipalities to conduct local redistricting for any conflicts with geographic, precinct and political districts. Redistricting is especially an issue for smaller municipalities, a spokesman for the office said. 
Del. Larry Kump, R-Berkeley, spoke in support of the bill Monday, saying that in his district, Hedgesville and Martinsburg have low voter turnout because of “weird” election days.
“By mandating that all West Virginia elections are held on normal election dates, Senate Bill 50 will eliminate the taxpayer burden of holding these special elections, but importantly, will also increase voter awareness and election turnout,” Kump said. 
He relayed a story about moving to West Virginia years ago and asking about cities’ having “weird” election days. He said he was told that the off-year elections entrench government officials by ensuring that their friends come out to vote for them but others stay home, unaware of the election.
The bill will now go back to the Senate to consider the change the House made to the bill.

(Photo by Amanda Mills/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)The Maine Attorney General is suing the Trump administration for freezing funds that help feed children in schools and childcare centers, as well as adults with disabilities in congregate settings.
Attorney General Aaron Frey filed a complaint Monday with the U.S. District Court in Maine against the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Secretary Brooke Rollins for their decision to withhold funding because of the state’s alleged violation of Title IX in educational programming. 
Title IX does not reference trangender people directly, but the Trump administration has interpreted Maine’s policy allowing trans students to compete in athletics that align with the gender identity as discrimination against cisgender girls. 
“Under the banner of keeping children safe, the Trump administration is illegally withholding grant funds that go to keeping children fed,” Frey said in a Monday news release.
In a letter sent to Gov. Janet Mills last Wednesday, Rollins that said she was freezing “Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools” and warned it was “only the beginning.” While the letter said the freeze would not affect programs that provide food to children, according to the complaint, the Child Nutrition Program of the Maine Department of Education was unable to access several sources of federal funding the following day.

“This is just another example where no law or consequence appears to restrain the administration as it seeks capitulation to its lawlessness,” Frey said. “The President and his cabinet secretaries do not make the law and they are not above the law, and this action is necessary to remind the President that Maine will not be bullied into violating the law.”
In the complaint, Frey argues that the freeze is unlawful because it did not follow the legally required procedure to alter congressionally appropriated funds, including a regulation from the USDA to hold a hearing and issue a formal decision on the record before terminating funds. 
Frey is also asking for a temporary restraining order to prevent the USDA from withholding funds while the court hears the matter. 
The funding freeze was among a barrage of actions targeting Maine following President Donald Trump and Mills’ heated exchange over the state’s protections for transgender student athletes.
Both the U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services determined Maine’s polices allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports, which is supported by the Maine Human Rights Act, violate federal protections against sex-based discrimination in schools. 
The U.S. DOE gave Maine a deadline of April 11 to propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office or said the case will be referred to the Department of Justice.
Frey’s complaint marks the first official legal action in the dispute. However, the complaint specifically notes that it is asking the court to rule on the legality of the freeze rather than to interpret Title IX, though that question will likely come before the courts soon. 
“Even if the State of Maine were in violation of Title IX (and, to be clear, it is not), there are statutory and regulatory requirements that the federal government must comply with before it may freeze federal funds owed to a state,” he wrote.

BOULDER, Colo. — Colorado regulators are issuing licenses for providing psychedelic mushrooms and are planning to authorize the state’s first “healing centers,” where the mushrooms can be ingested under supervision, in late spring or early summer.
The dawn of state-regulated psychedelic mushrooms has arrived in Colorado, nearly two years since Oregon began offering them. The mushrooms are a Schedule I drug and illegal under federal law except for clinical research. But more than a dozen cities nationwide have deprioritized or decriminalized them in the past five years, and many eyes are turned toward Oregon’s and Colorado’s state-regulated programs.
“In Oregon and Colorado, we’re going to learn a lot about administration of psychedelics outside of clinical, religious and underground settings because they’re the first to try this in the U.S.,” said William R. Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.
Psychedelic mushrooms and their psychoactive compound psilocybin have the potential to treat people with depression and anxiety, including those unresponsive to other medications or therapy. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health, says the risk of mental health problems caused by ingesting mushrooms in a supervised clinical setting is low, but may be higher outside of a clinical setting. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a social media post last year, before his nomination as U.S. health secretary, that his “mind is open to the idea of psychedelics for treatment.”
Medical experts say more research is needed, particularly in people with a diagnosis or family history of psychotic or bipolar disorder. Adverse effects of psilocybin, including headache and nausea, typically resolve within one to two days. However, extended difficulties from using psychedelics can last weeks, months or years; anxiety and fear, existential struggle, social disconnection and feeling detached from oneself and one’s surroundings are most common. After the decriminalization and legalization in Oregon and Colorado, psychedelic mushroom exposures reported to poison control centers ticked up in these states and nationally.
In February, about 40 people organized by the psychedelic advocacy group the Nowak Society gathered in Boulder to talk about the coming changes in Colorado. They included Mandy Grace, who received her state license to administer psychedelic mushrooms, and Amanda Clark, a licensed mental health counselor from Denver, who both praised the therapeutic power of mushrooms.
“You get discouraged in your practice because the current therapies are not enough for people,” Clark said.
Colorado voters approved Proposition 122 in 2022 to legalize natural psychedelics, after Oregon voters in 2020 approved legalizing psilocybin for therapeutic use. Colorado’s program is modeled after, but not the same as, Oregon’s, under which 21,246 psilocybin products have been sold as of March, a total that could include secondary doses, according to the Oregon Health Authority.
As of mid-March, Colorado has received applications for at least 15 healing center licenses, nine cultivation licenses, four manufacturer licenses and one testing facility license for growing and preparing the mushrooms, under rules developed over two years by the governor-appointed Natural Medicine Advisory Board.
Psychedelic treatments in Oregon are expensive, and are likely to be so in Colorado, too, said Tasia Poinsatte, Colorado director of the nonprofit Healing Advocacy Fund, which supports state-regulated programs for psychedelic therapy. In Oregon, psychedelic mushroom sessions are typically $1,000 to $3,000, are not covered by insurance, and must be paid for up front.

The mushrooms themselves are not expensive, Poinsatte said, but a facilitator’s time and support services are costly, and there are state fees. In Colorado, for doses over 2 milligrams, facilitators will screen participants at least 24 hours in advance, then supervise the session in which the participant consumes and experiences mushrooms, lasting several hours, plus a later meeting to integrate the experience.
Facilitators, who may not have experience with mental health emergencies, need training in screening, informed consent and postsession monitoring, Smith said. “Because these models are new, we need to gather data from Colorado and Oregon to ensure safety.”
Facilitators generally pay a $420 training fee, which allows them to pursue the necessary consultation hours, and roughly $900 a year for a license, and healing centers pay $3,000 to $6,000 for initial licenses in Colorado. But the up-front cost for facilitators is significant: The required 150 hours in a state-accredited program and 80 hours of hands-on training can cost $10,000 or more, and Clark said she wouldn’t pursue a facilitator license due to the prohibitive time and cost.
To increase affordability for patients in Colorado, Poinsatte said, healing centers plan to offer sliding-scale pay options, and discounts for veterans, Medicaid enrollees and those with low incomes. Group sessions are another option to lower costs.
Colorado law does not allow retail sales of psilocybin, unlike cannabis, which can be sold both recreationally and medically in the state. But it allows adults 21 and older to grow, use and share psychedelic mushrooms for personal use.
Despite the retail ban, adjacent businesses have mushroomed. Inside the warehouse and laboratory of Activated Brands in Arvada, brown bags of sterilized grains such as corn, millet and sorghum and plastic bags of soil substrate are for sale, along with genetic materials and ready-to-grow kits.
Co-founder Sean Winfield sells these supplies for growing psychedelic or functional mushrooms such as lion’s mane to people hoping to grow their own at home. Soon, Activated Brands will host cultivation and education classes for the public, Winfield said.
Winfield and co-founder Shawn Cox recently hosted a psychedelic potluck at which experts studying and cultivating psychedelic mushrooms discussed genetics, extraction and specialized equipment.
Psychedelic mushrooms have a long history in Indigenous cultures, and provisions for their use in spiritual, cultural or religious ceremonies are included in Colorado law, along with recognition of the cultural harm that could occur to federally recognized tribes and Indigenous people if natural medicine is overly commercialized or exploited.
Several studies over the past five years have shown the long-term benefits of psilocybin for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, and the Food and Drug Administration designated it a breakthrough therapy. Late-stage trials, often a precursor to application for FDA approval, are underway.
Smith said psilocybin is a promising tool for treating mental health disorders but has not yet been shown to be better than other advanced treatments. Joshua Woolley, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of California-San Francisco, said he has seen the benefits of psilocybin as an investigator in clinical trials.
“People can change hard-set habits. They can become unstuck. They can see things in new ways,” he said of treating patients with a combination of psilocybin and psychotherapy.
Colorado, unlike Oregon, allows integration of psilocybin into existing mental health and medical practices with a clinical facilitator license, and through micro-healing centers that are more limited in the amounts of mushrooms they can store.
Still, Woolley said, between the federal ban and new state laws for psychedelics, this is uncharted territory. Most drugs used to treat mental health disorders are regulated by the FDA, something that Colorado is “taking into its own hands” by setting up its own program to regulate manufacturing and administration of psilocybin.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado declined to comment on its policy toward state-regulated psychedelic programs or personal use provisions, but Poinsatte hopes the same federal hands-off approach to marijuana will be taken for psilocybin in Oregon and Colorado.
Winfield said he looks forward to the upcoming rollout and potential addition of other plant psychedelics, such as mescaline. “We’re talking about clandestine industries coming into the light,” he said.

(Getty Images)A member of the House of Representatives is trying to exempt the Federal Aviation Administration Academy in Oklahoma City from any future government shutdowns.
The school churns out thousands of trained air traffic controllers at a time when there’s a national shortage. The legislation introduced by Rep. Frank Lucas would keep the academy at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, one of the FAA’s largest facilities, open if funds stopped flowing due to a federal government shutdown and would exempt employees and students employed by the FAA from a furlough.
“In recent times because of the challenges we’ve had with air safety, because of the tragic crashes — think about the near misses — there’s no more important time than now to have a steady stream of capable, talented, well-prepared people to be in those towers,” Lucas, whose district is home to the academy, said.

He was referring, in part, to the deadly plane crash outside of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport earlier this year. But Lucas also said that he was concerned about the facility in the context of potential cuts from the Department of Government Efficiency.
The air traffic controller workforce, which has been shrinking for decades, has received an outsized amount of attention recently as concern over flight safety has grown. Senators have questioned whether it is safe to fly after the administration laid off several hundred probationary workers at the FAA. Those layoffs included workers at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, according to KFOR-TV.
Lucas already has some interest in his bill across the Capitol.
“Congressman Frank Lucas is a very good friend of mine, and I’m very supportive about anything he does,” Sen. Markwayne Mullin said.
The aeronautical center trains 76,000 students in aviation fields annually, according to its website. About 1,000 students attend the school each day, according to an academy student handbook from 2023.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy toured the academy in February, then rolled out a plan to recruit more air traffic controllers that included boosting starting salaries for those who attend the school.
“Today’s visit reaffirmed how being an air traffic controller is one of the best, most rewarding jobs in America, and that the next generation at the Academy is the best in the world,” Duffy said in a news release. “This staffing shortage has been a known challenge for over a decade, and this administration is committed to solving it.”
Lucas pointed to the most recent government shutdown as a “total disruption” to the process of bringing in and training students.
“You upset the flow of folks making plans to come, and the FAA’s ability to absorb the people they expect to be coming out of each class,” Lucas said. “It’s just chaos.”
The previous shutdown was the first thing that came to Sen. James Lankford’s mind when asked about the bill, which he said he supports.
“The academy had to start all over again. We lost a session to the shutdown,” Lankford said, adding that Lucas is “basically just saying, we can declare that it’s essential. We’ve got to have more air traffic control folks.”
Lucas said he was concerned for the facility after President Donald Trump launched DOGE because it was looking at “anything and everything.” But Lucas’ concern wasn’t limited to the academy, he said. It also extended to “any number of things,” including food safety inspections.
“My job is to work with the administration, whoever the administration is, work with my colleagues, whoever they may be, and try and make sure that wise decisions are made,” Lucas said. “We helped DOGE on a couple of issues, in a general sense, see that perhaps things should be done differently.”

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)A group of Iowans is suing the State of Iowa, alleging Gov. Kim Reynolds has no authority to require agencies such as the Department of Natural Resources to adopt regulations that are less burdensome on industry.
The lawsuit was filed recently in Polk County District Court by Steve Veysey, a fly fisherman and clean-water advocate from Ames; Kathy Carter, a Floyd County resident who says her city’s drinking water is pulled from a source affected by a water-withdrawal permit benefitting an ethanol plant; and Mary Powell, heir to a Shelby County farm through which a hazardous- liquid pipeline is routed.
The plaintiffs claim Reynolds’ Executive Order 10, issued in January 2023, diminishes the effectiveness of regulations that are supposed to protect landowners from the environmental and economic damages caused by a pipeline.

The governor, the lawsuit claims, has “no authority to manipulate the rulemaking process prior to a final rule being adopted,” and so “any regulation adopted in compliance with Executive Order 10 is illegal and void.”
The governor’s order dictated that each state agency, board and commission repeal and replace all existing rules by Dec. 31, 2026.  In doing so, the order stated, the agencies, boards and commissions must “reduce the overall regulatory burden, or remain neutral, as compared to the previous rule.”
According to the lawsuit, Reynolds’ order “ignores the benefits” of previously existing rules.
“Unchecked corporate actions often result in damage to people and the environment,” the lawsuit claims. “The order then alleges that there is a regulatory burden on Iowans. The regulatory burden is not on Iowans. If there is a regulatory burden, it is on business and industry, which seems to be the only thing the governor’s action is concerned about.”
The lawsuit alleges all proposed rule changes must first be cleared by her administrative rules coordinator they can even be considered for the rulemaking and approval process.
As an example, the lawsuit cites a DNR proposal to change requirements related to the construction of manure storage facilities and says those proposed changes “were not allowed” to be brought forward to the administrative rules coordinator. “There is no authority in the statute for the governor to veto a rule, or a portion of a draft rule, before it is even presented to the public,” the lawsuit alleges.
While the governor’s order does not prohibit public comment on proposed rule changes, the lawsuit claims, “it renders that comment meaningless, because it ties the agency’s hands from considering that comment if the result would be regulations that violate the dictates of the executive order.”
The lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment that the executive order is beyond the governor’s authority and that any agency rules adopted in compliance with that order be deemed illegal and invalid.
The state has yet to respond to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for the Iowa attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A new property tax plan from Indiana House Republicans prevailed over qualms from Democrats on Monday, advancing to the House floor for further considerations after the 15-8 committee vote.
Senate Bill 1 would now let counties increase their local income taxes and — for the first time — allow cities to implement their own local income taxes. Under a massive amendment adopted Monday, counties would be able to levy an income tax up to 2.9%, up from the current 2.5% cap, while cities could go up to 1.2%. 
The legislation would also phase out, by 2030, the business personal property tax on anything purchased this year or later.

Democrats balked at voting for the 368-page amendment without any fiscal foresight. The Legislative Services Agency doesn’t draft fiscal notes on amendments until they’re adopted. 
“(This) is not ready for prime time,” said Rep. Greg Porter, D-Indianapolis. “We still have a lot of movement on it to get it to the point that we can even entertain it, as Democrats.”
Amendment author Rep. Jeff Thompson, R-Lizton, said it balances local government funding needs with relief for homeowners.
“Ninety-three percent (of homeowners) will pay less than they would have without this bill,” said Thompson, who chairs the committee. “Fifty-five percent will actually pay less in pay ‘26 than pay ‘25 and we do know that it’s roughly $200 per home.”
Thompson said that analysts hoped to release an updated fiscal note on the new property tax plan by this evening.

(Screenshot courtesy USFS)A provision in the secret, controversial agreement allowing a private company to transport uranium ore across the Arizona side of the Navajo Nation has New Mexico anti-nuclear advocates increasingly worried about the prospect of new mining activity near a mountain sacred to the Navajo people.
The Navajo Nation in late January agreed to let Energy Fuels transport uranium ore from its Pinyon Plains Mine in Arizona to its mill in White Mesa, Utah. Neither party has released the agreement, calling it confidential, they have described what it says in broad terms, and a transport policy, overseen by the United States Forest Service, details plans in case of an emergency. 
Two to three truckloads a day are making the trek across the western edge of the Navajo Nation into Utah, officials have said at recent public meetings. That number could increase to 10, said Stephen Etsitty, director of the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency, at recent chapter house meetings, according to video attendees shared on social media. 
In exchange, Energy Fuels agreed to pay the Navajo Nation $1.2 million and also clean up as much as 10,000 tons of material from old uranium mines for free. Energy Fuels would also pay the nation 50 cents per pound of uranium processed at the mill. 
Energy Fuels also owns the Roca Honda mine near Mount Taylor in New Mexico. The shortest route from Roca Honda to the White Mesa Mill in Utah also runs through the Navajo Nation. 
Energy Fuels spokesperson Curtis Moore declined to say exactly what the transport agreement said regarding the Roca Honda mine, citing the agreement’s confidentiality. But he did acknowledge the agreement contemplated the New Mexico mine’s eventual operation. 
“If Roca Honda were to proceed, we agreed to take quite a bit more cleanup material at no charge to the Navajo Nation,” Moore said in an email Friday to Source New Mexico. 
‘How are we going to beat this monster?’
Cheyenne Antonio, an advocate with Diné C.A.R.E, told Source that she asked Navajo Nation officials at a recent meeting about the prospect of uranium transport in New Mexico. She said Stephen Etsitty, executive director of the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency, told her that no roads had been approved yet in New Mexico for uranium transport. 
Etsitty told Source New Mexico on Monday that it’s far too early to say what the route could be, but that the Cibola National Forest has presented some options in old draft environmental impact statements in the mine.
Estimates Etsitty has reviewed show that far more trucks would cross the Navajo Nation each day from the Roca Honda mine, based on assessments of the amount of uranium could produce. Between 50 and 60 trucks a day is the maximum, Etsitty said.
The Navajo Nation has, for years, opposed the development of any mine near Mount Taylor, known as Tsoodził in Navajo, Etsitty said.
But if the Roca Honda mine is approved, Etsitty said the new transport agreement contains “a framework” that would require Energy Fuels to remove 30,000 more tons of abandoned uranium mine material, on top of the 10,000 tons the company has already promised to remove as part of the Pinyon Plains transport agreement.
Energy Fuels pushed for the provision, Etsitty said, because the company believes it is far enough along in getting that mine approved that it was necessary.
“We looked at it and and we agreed, but we also stipulated that we were not waiving, we were not pre-judging, nothing was pre-decisional,” he said in a phone interview Monday with Source New Mexico. “Meaning that we were not agreeing with them that we support the Roca Honda project. Because we reserved our right to comment fully and vigorously on that project.”
The company has listed the Roca Honda project as in the “advanced” stage of permitting on its website, but the website has said that since at least 2019, according to the Internet archive.
Antonio and Leona Morgan, who heads up Haul No!, a group opposing the transport agreement, organized a small gathering at an Albuquerque library on Thursday to discuss the latest on uranium mining in Arizona and New Mexico and brainstorm ideas to oppose its extraction and transport.

“My question,” Morgan asked those in attendance, “is what is our solution to fighting it? How are we going to deal with it? How are we going to beat this monster?”
Uranium mining between the 1940s and the 1970s in and around the Navajo Nation left cancer and pollution in its wake. Companies operating in the area back then abandoned hundreds of uranium mines that continue to poison groundwater and otherwise hurt public health. 
So the prospect of new mining and its transport has incensed members of the Navajo Nation, Antonio said. At a meeting late last month at the Mexican Water Chapter in Utah, one elder woman spoke up to say, in Navajo, that the agreement amounted to the tribe killing the Navajo way of life without members’ input. 
“You agreed to kill our whole Navajo universe without our consent,” the elder said, according to Antonio’s translation.
Moore, the Energy Fuels spokesperson, noted that the company had nothing to do with the legacy uranium mines, which were drilled to produce weapons material, and that it is doing its part as “good samaritans” to clean up the old companies’ messes. 
“Our uranium is only used for clean, carbon-free … nuclear energy, not weapons,” Moore said. 
‘The Trump administration is moving quickly’
While outside observers and both parties to the agreement agree many hurdles remain in the way of the state’s first new uranium mine in more than 50 years, they see the transport agreement as the latest domino to fall. 
Already this year, Cibola National Forest officials deemed the Roca Honda mine a “priority project,” following an executive order from President Donald Trump seeking to boost domestic energy production. Trump’s pushes to make public lands profitable and his newly announced tariffs could also point in the direction of new uranium mines here, Moore said. 
“Roca Honda is a large and high-grade uranium deposit that could enhance U.S. energy independence considerably,” Moore said. “We are not sure what the executive orders mean yet in terms of concrete actions. However, the Trump administration is moving quickly to reduce America’s dependence on Russian and Chinese uranium and rare earth imports, which are the two commodities Energy Fuels produces today.”
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

As for tariffs, Moore said the taxes on imports could “support domestic uranium and rare earth production.” 
Also, the price of uranium has risen steadily since 2020, including cresting at a little more than $100 a pound last January. That’s close to the point at which new mines are profitable, according to Eric Jantz, legal director at the New Mexico Environmental Law Center. 
Etsitty, speaking to a small crowd gathered at a chapter house in Crownpoint last month, said the price hitting $100 last January is what prompted the new speculation in and around the Navajo Nation. 
“That’s what drives all of this. When people say, what is this all about? Is it just about money? Yes, it’s just about money to the industry,” Etsitty said. 
Moore said regulatory review can take years, even decades, for a new mine, especially if anti-mining interests get in the way. 
“Anti-nuclear and anti-mining interests can severely delay good domestic mining projects,” he wrote. “Therefore, we would welcome any shortening of permitting timelines, and reductions in ‘lawfare’ and nuisance lawsuits, to get domestic critical mineral projects into production to support energy, economic and national security quickly.” 
Navajo Nation officials have defended the agreement as the best deal they could strike in the face of a lawsuit they feel they would likely lose. In the Crownpoint meeting and a question-and-answer virtual meeting shortly after they struck the agreement, Nation officials cited the Supremacy clause of the United States Constitution, which they said pre-empts the tribe’s right to restrict uranium transport over roads that course through the Navajo Nation. 
“We are supportive of the overarching desire to not have these functioning and operating, but we can’t stop it,” Etsitty said in the meeting. “So now we’re trying to manage it.”

,DC,2025-04-07 17:15:14+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump DOJ asks U.S. Supreme Court to block order to return wrongly deported Maryland man,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-doj-asks-us-supreme-court-block-order-return-wrongly-deported-maryland-man,,"WASHINGTON —  The Trump administration made an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday, asking the justices to strike down a lower court’s order that immigration officials return a Maryland man erroneously deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador. U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that, despite an error in deporting Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia of Beltsville, Maryland, the lower court does not have the jurisdiction to order the Trump administration to return someone who the administration argues is no longer in U.S. custody.The appeal to the high court came within minutes of an appeals court panel unanimously upholding the order by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who set a deadline of midnight Monday for the administration to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.Despite being granted legal protection from deportation by a judge in 2019, immigration officials detained Abrego Garcia and sent him on a March 15 deportation flight to El Salvador, where he was incarcerated at the notorious prison known as Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.‘The government screwed up’A panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit agreed Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvador was a major misstep.“The United States Government has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street and remove him from the country without due process,” two judges on the panel, Robert B. King and Stephanie D. Thacker, wrote.King was appointed by former President Bill Clinton and Thacker was appointed by former President Barack Obama.“The Government’s contention otherwise, and its argument that the federal courts are powerless to intervene, are unconscionable,” they wrote.J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, wrote in his option that “[t]here is no question that the government screwed up here.”He noted that President Donald Trump’s administration has not made an effort to rectify its mistake.“The facts of this case thus present the potential for a disturbing loophole: namely that the government could whisk individuals to foreign prisons in violation of court orders and then contend, invoking its Article II powers, that it is no longer their custodian, and there is nothing that can be done. It takes no small amount of imagination to understand that this is a path of perfect lawlessness, one that courts cannot condone,” Wilkinson said.Order to returnOn Friday, Xinis ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garcia.The Department of Justice quickly appealed the decision and Xinis issued a scathing 22-page order Sunday that cited records and official statements from Trump officials saying the administration has the power to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.“Neither the United States nor El Salvador have told anyone why he was returned to the very country to which he cannot return, or why he is detained at CECOT,” she wrote. “That silence is telling. As Defendants acknowledge, they had no legal authority to arrest him, no justification to detain him, and no grounds to send him to El Salvador—let alone deliver him into one of the most dangerous prisons in the Western Hemisphere.”Abrego Garcia was on one of three deportation flights to CECOT on March 15. Two flights contained 238 Venezuelans who were deported under a wartime law that is currently being challenged in another court case.Xinis slammed the Trump administration for arguing that she had no jurisdiction to order Abrego Garcia’s return.“For the following reasons, their jurisdictional arguments fail as a matter of law,” she said. “Further, to avoid clear irreparable harm, and because equity and justice compels it, the Court grants the narrowest, daresay only, relief warranted: to order that Defendants return Abrego Garcia to the United States.”She noted that the two countries have an agreement to house more than 250 deported men at CECOT.The U.S. is paying El Salvador $6 million to detain the men at the prison. Trump is scheduled to meet with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele at the White House on April 14.In response to the district court’s order to return Abrego Garcia, the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, posted a GIF of a confused cartoon bunny on social media.Attorney placed on leaveThe Department of Justice attorney who argued on behalf of the Trump administration, Erez Reuveni, was placed on indefinite administrative leave over the weekend.U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said during a Fox News interview Sunday that Reuveni was placed on leave because he did not “vigorously” defend the administration.Reuveni, a veteran government attorney, has argued for the DOJ over the course of four administrations.During Friday’s hearing he was candid that the Trump administration had provided him little information on why Abrego Garcia could not be returned to the U.S. and that “the government made a choice here to produce no evidence.”",,,,2025-04-07 13:24:03.437056

From extreme gerrymandering to relentless and restrictive voter ID laws, we’ve seen lawmakers chip away at our freedom to vote under the false guise of “election integrity.” 
Now, we’re witnessing it again with the Trump Administration’s newest attempted power grab—an unconstitutional Executive Order that would do nothing to protect elections but would do plenty to strip eligible voters of their constitutional right to vote. It’s the latest move in an authoritarian playbook designed to make voting harder—all while masquerading as an effort to protect the security of our elections. This Executive Order is blatantly unconstitutional and is a clear distraction from the real issue at hand: the SAVE Act which, if enacted, would disenfranchise millions of voters by requiring proof of citizenship.  
At first glance, requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote might seem like common sense, but in reality, it throws up unnecessary roadblocks for eligible voters, disproportionately impacting people of color, naturalized citizens, and elderly residents. North Carolina lawmakers have been playing this game for years, throwing up obstacles, creating confusion, and manufacturing fear to keep certain voices out of the process. This order is just the latest chapter in that shameful playbook.
As the data have shown, time and again: noncitizen voting is not a widespread problem. In fact, multiple studies and election audits have confirmed that such cases are virtually nonexistent. Yet lawmakers keep pushing this myth to justify proposed ballot measures and laws that would make it harder for eligible citizens to vote. This bill isn’t about protecting elections—it’s about creating barriers, fueling fear, and silencing voters who don’t fit their agenda.
I’ve spoken with naturalized citizens who have spent years navigating our immigration system, proudly earning their right to vote—only to now face another bureaucratic nightmare to prove their citizenship. I’ve heard from elderly Black voters born in the Jim Crow South, whose births were never formally recorded, and who now fear they’ll be turned away at the polls. And I know working mothers, like myself, who have changed their last names after marriage, only to find that mismatched documents could threaten their ability to vote. These aren’t hypotheticals; they are real people, our neighbors, who will be disenfranchised.
I experienced these complications firsthand when I voted in the 2016 primary. I walked into my polling place with my three-month-old baby, having just legally changed my name. I did everything right—I updated my name with the DMV and changed my voter registration to match. But when I arrived, I learned that my registration hadn’t been processed due to an error. The only way I could vote was under my maiden name, which was allowed under the law at the time. This wasn’t my mistake—it was a failure of the system. With this executive order, even more voters will face similar obstacles—except they might not be so fortunate.
It’s shameful and disheartening to see our North Carolina legislators and elected leaders, like Representative Don Davis, working against voters’ best interests by actively supporting legislation that would make it harder for North Carolinians to make their voices heard. If our leaders truly cared about election security, they’d be working to expand voter access, modernize our election systems, and ensure that every eligible voter can cast their ballot without jumping through unnecessary hoops. Instead, our elected leaders are resorting to fear-mongering and deception to push an agenda that serves their own interests, not the American people nor the people of North Carolina. 
North Carolinians must stand against the SAVE Act, the Executive Order, and any other efforts to make voting harder. Our democracy is strongest when every eligible voter can cast their ballot freely and fairly. We cannot allow self-serving lawmakers to strip away our rights under the pretense of security. It’s time to push back against these attacks and demand a system that works for all of us—not just those in power.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Georgia-voters.jpg,,,2025-04-07 13:24:03.437056

Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.

“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.

The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”

A mixed response from states

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.

“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”

Creating a new food system

In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

Kennedy Jr.'s layoffs included numerous staff at health agencies responsible for releasing public records,"Health experts say Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s firing of public records staffers at federal health agencies undercuts his promise to deliver “radical transparency.” (Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)Public access to government records that document the handling of illnesses, faulty products, and safety lapses at health facilities will slow after mass firings at the federal Department of Health and Human Services swept out staff members responsible for releasing records, according to transparency advocates and health experts.
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s layoffs across health agencies in recent days eliminated workers who handled Freedom of Information Act requests at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cut FOIA staff at the FDA and the National Institutes of Health, said six current and former federal workers KFF Health News agreed not to name because they fear retaliation and are not authorized to speak to the press.
FOIA is a transparency law that guarantees public access to the inner workings of federal agencies by requiring officials to release government documents. The 1966 law is a crucial tool for law firms, advocates, businesses, journalists, and the general public. It has been used to hold officials accountable and uncover harm, corruption, and political meddling in policymaking.
At HHS, FOIA requests are used to obtain a litany of records, including detailed CDC information about large outbreaks of food and waterborne illnesses, and FDA inspection reports of facilities that make food, drugs, medical devices, and dental products.
Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the FOIA cuts would have “an enormous effect on patient safety” and are “antithetical” to Kennedy’s promise to bring “radical transparency” to federal health agencies.
“It is simply not possible to honorably make that claim while decimating the staff,” Lurie said. “Can we rely particularly on this government to be forthcoming about the number of cases in an outbreak? You need FOIA to be able to take the lid off of that.”
HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano declined to respond on the record to questions about the department’s plans for processing FOIA requests from the CDC, FDA, and NIH.
Gunica Singh, staff attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the FOIA layoffs were almost certain to further slow the release of public records, which often took months or years before the cuts.
“What we need to be doing is the opposite of what’s happening now: hiring more staff,” she said.
Many records are disclosed only in response to FOIA requests. For example, during the covid-19 pandemic, FOIA requests forced the FDA to release internal documents showing little evidence to support using hydroxychloroquine to treat covid, even though President Donald Trump heavily promoted the drug.
Scientific researchers have used the law to obtain clinical trial data to assess whether drugs are safe and effective, or to get more details about adverse events associated with drugs and medical devices. Lurie said obtaining more information about adverse events is particularly important in serving as a bulwark against cherry-picking data or manipulating what’s available online to spread disinformation about the safety of vaccines and other products.
All these efforts will be slowed by the purge of FOIA offices, said Michael Morisy, CEO of MuckRock, a nonprofit group that helps journalists and others file public records requests. Scientists will have less to study. Attorneys and advocates will struggle to build cases and fight for causes. Simply, Americans will know less about their government and the industries it regulates and be less able to hold them both to account.
“I think one thing we’ve learned is that if there’s less watchdogging over an issue, that issue gets worse,” Morisy said. “I really do think that we are going to see companies become more lax with food safety, companies become more lax with consumer safety.”
Thousands of pending FOIA requests are likely to be affected.
During fiscal 2024 — from October 2023 through September 2024 — the CDC, FDA, and NIH received more than 15,000 FOIA requests and provided at least some records in response to more than 10,000, according to HHS’ most recent annual FOIA report.
Those requests were submitted by university researchers, state governments, laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, animal rights groups, law firms, and news organizations, including KFF Health News. Records sought by law firms appear related to investigations of illnesses, outbreaks, drugs, medical devices, and products used by countless Americans.
Morisy and Singh said filling requests is more complicated than many realize, often requiring an in-depth understanding of complex agencies. That’s why it’s important to house FOIA staff within each agency rather than consolidate them.
“We are sacking the entire staff and sacking all of that knowledge,” Morisy said. “And I just don’t see how these things continue to function.”

(Screenshot via Office of Economic & Demographic Research)Roughly two-thirds of Florida’s sales tax proceeds comes from households in the state, the latest analysis prepared by state economists shows, while tourists account for about 16% of the revenue collected.
The annual analysis was posted last week by Office of Economic and Demographic  Research and comes amid debate over whether to cut sales taxes c or look for ways to cut property taxes paid by homeowners. Florida levies a 6% sales tax on retail,  admissions, transient  lodgings, and commercial real estate rentals, unless expressly exempted.  A House legislative analysis shows that sales tax is projected to account for nearly 74% of the states general revenue in state fiscal year 2024-25.

Gov. Ron DeSantis wants to cut property taxes first and has cited the payment of sales taxes by “tourists” and “Canadians” as one justification. House Republicans, meanwhile, have touted their proposal to cut more than $5 billion in sales taxes as something that could take effect much sooner. House Speaker Danny Perez wants to trim back the sales tax from 6% to 5.25%.
EDR, which reports to the Legislature, estimates the source of sales tax revenue on an annual basis, but because state economists rely on data available from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics there is a lag, said Amy Baker, coordinator of the office.

The latest report, which is based on 2021-’22 information, calculates that households paid 65.8% of sales tax collections while businesses were responsible for slightly more than 18%. Tourists accounted for 16.1%.










Florida has a very regressive tax structure partly because we are so reliant on sales tax. For Floridians who make less they pay more of their income to taxation. … Any effort to address that imbalance is a positive one in my book.”


– Rep. Anna Eskamani 


These numbers have fluctuated somewhat, and previous reports show that tourists accounted for roughly 13% of sales tax collections in 2016 and 2017. The number of tourists has been on the upswing in recent years, according to Visit Florida, the state’s tourism marketing arm. EDR’s 2019-20 report estimated that more than 76% of sales taxes collected in that fiscal year came from households compared to 11.9% from tourists.
When discussing his own plan to lower property taxes, DeSantis argued that a cut in sales taxes would allow “relief for foreigners. It allows relief for visitors and part-time residents. I think that tax relief needs to be focused on Floridians.” 
The governor wants legislators to give an estimated 5.1 million residents who have a homestead exemption on their property taxes a rebate averaging $1,000 in December. That would be followed by a 2026 ballot proposal to enact a permanent tax cut.
The House, however, is moving ahead with its sales tax plan. The bill cleared its first committee unanimously on Wednesday with both Democrats and Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee praising the idea.
“Florida has a very regressive tax structure partly because we are so reliant on sales tax,” said Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat from Orlando. “For Floridians who make less they pay more of their income to taxation. … Any effort to address that imbalance is a positive one in my book.”

As NC Newsline has reported at length recently, Republicans in Congress are seeking to enact massive and unprecedented cuts to two of the nation’s core social safety net programs — Medicaid and SNAP food assistance. And while it’s not hard to show how such cuts will impact the people in need who depend on those programs, a new report from the Commonwealth Fund and The George Washington University School of Public Health points to another big and worrisome likely impact. It warns that the proposed cuts could trigger severe economic consequences — including the loss of a million jobs, a $113 billion decline in the gross domestic products of U.S. states, and $8.8 billion in lost state and local tax revenue in 2026 alone. And recently, to learn more, Newsline caught up with the report’s lead author, the Director of the Center for Health Policy Research at The George Washington University, Professor Leighton Ku.

(Provided by MSU for the Daily Montanan)The Montana Board of Regents announced Monday that Brock Tessman, former deputy commissioner in Montana and current president of Northern Michigan University, will serve as the next president of Montana State University in Bozeman.
Tessman has verbally accepted an offer and will take the reins on July 1, 2025, pending final negotiations and Board of Regents approval at its May meeting, according to a news release from the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education.
Clayton Christian, Commissioner of Higher Education and chairperson of the Presidential Search Advisory Committee, said the committee saw “intense interest” in the position.
“I’m confident the process has yielded an outstanding, visionary leader in Dr. Tessman,” Christian said in a statement. “We believe Dr. Tessman is exceptionally well positioned to guide MSU to new heights.”

MSU is the largest university in Montana, with enrollment that topped 17,000 in fall 2024, a record. It also saw a record $257 million in research expenditures in 2024.
Tessman, who visited the campus last month along with one other finalist, will serve as MSU’s 13th president if confirmed.
He’ll lead the flagship in a time of significant challenge for higher education, with cultural pressure from the Trump administration. MSU faces its own difficulties, with previous opened investigations by the federal Office for Civil Rights for numerous discrimination allegations.
Details of the offer to Tessman were not immediately available Monday morning.
Current MSU President Waded Cruzado is a top paid public official in Montana, with an estimated $576,300 in salary and other compensation as of last August.
The search for a new president started in August 2024 when Cruzado announced her plans to retire after 15 years. A news release from the Commissioner’s Office said “her administration has left an indelible mark on the university and the MSU community.”
However, Regent Dean Folkvord and member of the Search Advisory Committee said he knew the charge was not to replace Cruzado but to identify a successor who would lead with passion and dedication.
“I think we succeeded, and I look forward to working with Dr. Tessman as he takes the reins,” Folkvord said in a statement.
The news release said Tessman’s accomplishments at Northern Michigan include steady enrollment growth at both undergraduate and graduate levels, record retention rates (78%), financial stability with top-tier bond ratings, unprecedented levels of private giving, and the completion of major capital projects.
“Dr. Tessman’s stewardship has fostered positive momentum across all aspects of university operations,” the news release said.
Tessman previously served as deputy commissioner for academic affairs in the Montana University System and dean of the Davidson Honors College at the University of Montana. He earned his bachelor’s degree in international relations from Brown University and both his master’s and doctoral degrees in political science from the University of Colorado at Boulder.
The news release said Tessman is known for his energy, dedication to students, strong communication skills, and ability to deliver results — “qualities that make him uniquely suited to lead MSU into its next chapter.”
“Montana State University holds a special place in my heart given my previous work within the Montana University System,” Tessman said in a statement. “I am honored by this opportunity to serve as MSU’s next president and look forward to building on its incredible legacy.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/first-day-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-07 12:15:57.590961

The farm was one of thousands benefiting from a local food program recently cut by the Trump administration (Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm).Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
 A mixed response from states

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.
“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”

Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

(Courtesy Ivy Tech Community College)Indiana must retrain more than 82,000 working Hoosiers annually — with non-degree credentials — to meet workforce demand, Ivy Tech Community College has found.
And about 70% of job openings across four in-demand industries will require that additional training, according to the white paper, released Thursday. Non-degree credentials are industry-recognized certifications, certificates, licenses and other short-term training programs.
Ivy Tech is the nation’s largest single-accredited statewide community college system. Its analysis was conducted in collaboration with TEConomy Partners and funded by the Lilly Endowment.

“As Indiana’s workforce engine, Ivy Tech is committed to providing the high-quality, industry-aligned education and training that our state and employers need to drive economic growth and prosperity,” President Sue Ellspermann said in a news release.
 “This research underscores the urgent need to help Hoosiers acquire new or specialized skills as technologies such as automation and artificial intelligence continue to transform our workforce and economy,” she added.
Indiana, like the rest of the country, faces a workforce crisis, per the report. The state’s industry productivity is “too low,” there aren’t enough skilled workers to staff growing industries and the working-age population is shrinking.
“Indiana needs to improve productivity with the workforce it already has,” the report continues. “Employers can no longer rely on a passive approach, waiting for talent to arrive fully skilled.”
It estimated demand in four industry sectors key to Indiana’s economy:

Advanced Manufacturing: An estimated 18,300 annual positions will require credentials, including roles such as technicians, machinists, maintenance roles, and programmers.
Transportation and Logistics: Demand for 24,000 positions annually, including truck drivers, mechanics, and technicians, with a growing need for workers skilled in digital logistics and supply chain technologies.
Health care: Approximately 38,700 annual openings will require credentials, with high demand for nurses, medical assistants, and healthcare technicians.
Information Technology: Demand for 1,300 tech professionals, including software developers, systems analysts, and cybersecurity specialists, in sectors like healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics. The report notes forecasting may be limited by employment system data and rapid industry changes.

“Workforce is the economic driver,” Indiana Secretary of Commerce David Adams said in the news release. “Our ability to develop, recruit and retain talent here in Indiana is critically important, and that’s why Gov. (Mike) Braun and I are so focused on supporting the upskilling and reskilling of our incumbent Hoosier workforce. These research findings underscore the fundamental paradigm shift employers are going to have to wrap their arms around as they continue building a workforce that will strengthen the Hoosier economy.” 
In the report, Ivy Tech said it’s positioned as the “leading partner” to provide the skills training required to meet the demand. Currently, it enrolls more than 25,000 people annually in skills training and other workforce development programs — about 15% of its total enrollment.
Ivy Tech leadership will prioritize skills training delivery and scaling up related program offerings — but “cannot do this alone,” per the report.
“A collective state effort is required,” it says.
Employers should provide tuition and funding support, give data and feedback to training providers and tell their employees about training opportunities.
State government, industry associations, and economic or workforce development groups should promote training program funding and policies; enable data infrastructure and reporting capabilities; and convene others to boost partnerships, develop common curricula and more.
Postsecondary institutions — along with career, technical and vocational providers — should invest in course offerings, inform skills trainees about enrollment in occupational pathways, raise awareness that completed coursework can convert to credits for academic programs of study, and so on.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Kentucky is bracing for a “problematic” night with freezing temperatures on the way to complicate standing water and wet conditions following a four-day flooding event, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday. 
Areas that have flooded over the last four days — areas around Frankfort, Louisville and Paducah — are forecast to hit 32 degrees and below overnight Monday, according to the National Weather Service. 
“This is going to be a dangerous night where temperatures fall, where it gets potentially below freezing,” Beshear said during a Monday press conference alongside Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman, Kentucky Emergency Management officials and Frankfort and Franklin County representatives. 
“So, if you’re somewhere that’s very wet, if you’re trying to ride this out in a home that’s had water, tonight could raise concerns of hypothermia,” Beshear said.   
This forecast comes while the Ohio River at Louisville is at 64 feet — double its normal depth — and flood walls closed Friday in preparation. The Ohio River at Paducah is 45 feet, higher than it was even during the February floods. 
The Kentucky River at Frankfort is also flooded at nearly 49 feet, much higher than its normal depths of under 20 feet, according to the United States Geological Survey. 
“It looks like the water level is not going to get as high here in Frankfort as previously thought,” Beshear said. “Right now, it looks like the levees are holding and it looks like the water is receding faster than originally thought.” 
Still, emergency officials have asked Frankfort residents to continue conserving water while the city works to bounce back. 
“The lieutenant governor and I live here. We both live in Frankfort. We’re both conserving water, like we’re asking everybody else to do right now,” Beshear said. “This is very personal to us, and we’re going to make sure that everybody in this city, as well as others that have been impacted, can get back up on their feet, and that we can move forward.”
Frankfort is also under a dusk-to-dawn curfew Monday night.

By the numbers 
As of Monday morning, state officials reported:

Two people have died in the flooding. 
One person is missing in McCracken County. 
1,788 are without power. 
2,847 are under a boiled water advisory. 
538 state roadways are closed. This does not include local road closures. 
52 shelters are open. Across the state, 45 households are sheltering in state parks, 10 are in hotels and 79 are staying in temporary housing units. 
354 Kentucky National Guard members are mobilized to help with storm response.

DeFoor delivers remarks Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025, at The Forum Auditorium in Harrisburg, Pa., after being sworn in for his second term as Pennsylvania’s auditor general. (Commonwealth Media Services)A pair of statewide elected officials stayed on message about their responsibilities in an increasingly political environment, during speeches at an annual gathering of conservative activists.
Both Pennsylvania Auditor General Tim DeFoor and state Attorney General Dave Sunday focused their talks on serving the people of Pennsylvania.
“I have an obligation to do the job the way it’s supposed to be done, an auditor general who draws conclusions based on facts, by bringing up and improving government, not tearing it down,” said DeFoor. 
“If our communities aren’t safe, literally nothing else matters. And the way that we keep our communities safe is by this crazy idea called enforcing the law,” said Sunday. “This seems simple. It seems obvious, but as we see it, too many of our major cities, it’s anything but that, for me, following the facts and the law are my guiding principles.”
DeFoor and Sunday both delivered 10-plus minute addresses in Camp Hill, Cumberland County, on Friday at the Pennsylvania Leadership Conference. 
DeFoor and Sunday, both Republicans, are coming off victories in November.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
For DeFoor, he earned a second term to lead the office tasked with working as the state’s fiscal watchdog. He defeated Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta.
“My first term was about building a foundation, one rooted in transformation, accountability, continued improvement and service to the community,” DeFoor said. “Our top description is clear, and that is to make sure state government funded programs are working, and that government is transparent with what it does with our state tax dollars.”
DeFoor touted the number of audits his office has conducted since being sworn-in and emphasized his push for financial literacy to be taught in Pennsylvania’s schools as early as kindergarten. His comments about state Sen. Chris Gebhard’s (R-Lebanon) legislation that will require public schools to teach a financial literacy course for high school students starting in 2026-2027 earned applause from the audience.
Sunday, who previously held the post of York County District Attorney, defeated former state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale, a Democrat, in the open race to lead the state Attorney General’s Office.
“So with regard to my approach to being a prosecutor, to start with, it’s summarized in two words, and many of you have heard this. It’s accountability and redemption,” Sunday said.

“One of the things that I believe gets lost when we talk about prosecutors is how essential consistency is,” Sunday said. “The laws of our country and our Commonwealth don’t change when one prosecutor takes over for another. There isn’t a Republican version of the law and then a Democrat version of the law.”
Sunday said there are “risks” for those who aim to return to a “more sane way of governing.” Even though he was just sworn-in to office in January, he said he’s already been required to make decisions that will result in him not always being “the most popular guy in the room.”
“I can safely say that in my first two months as Attorney General, I’ve made decisions that have driven people crazy from the entire political spectrum, and that’s what happens when you do this magical thing called following the law,” Sunday said. “The laws are the laws, though, and I will be consistent in following them that may, at times, put me in a position that means I’m following a law that I may not like, or a law that I disagree with, or a law that I may very much agree with, or a law that I’m indifferent about.”
When speaking to reporters following his speech, he said he’d “rather pass” when asked about the specific responses he’s heard from both sides of the aisle on decisions he’s made.
“I think in this role that I have right now as the attorney general, that I must be as apolitical as humanly possible,” Sunday said.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The day police said Darren Boykins killed somebody, his mother told everyone they were wrong.
Carmella Bowers graduated from Rutgers University in Newark that day in 1981, about 25 years after she dropped out of high school. She said Darren was there, applauding at her commencement ceremony — not, as police claimed, murdering a carpet salesman a mile away.
While four other witnesses backed up that alibi at Boykins’ trial, jurors convicted him, largely on the word of a prisoner who testified Boykins had confessed the crime. No one mentioned at the trial that the jailhouse informant had reason to rat out Boykins; after the informant testified, prosecutors dropped charges against him for an unrelated murder and the sexual assaults of two toddlers.
“When we was in the courtroom after the trial was over and they found my son guilty, I couldn’t believe it. I fell out,” said Bowers, now 85. “I just couldn’t understand why he was guilty because I knew where he was that day.”
Now, Bowers has a powerful ally on her side: a retired attorney who spent seven months investigating Boykins’ case and has launched a crusade to exonerate him.
Attorney John Crayton said Boykins’ case has all the hallmarks of a wrongful conviction: authorities rushing an arrest in response to public panic over rising crime, detectives intent on locking away a trouble-making teen despite flimsy evidence, authorities hiding exculpatory facts from jurors, and a witness secretly incentivized to testify in exchange for leniency.
“The wrongfully convicted are victims of institutional failures and the callous indifference, and sometimes corruption, of those in authority positions. I strongly believe that a caring society should admit what can result from this combination,” Crayton told the New Jersey Monitor.
New Jersey lags behind other states in securing justice for people who have been wrongfully convicted. Lesley C. and D. Michael Risinger, a couple who head the Last Resort Exoneration Project at Seton Hall University School of Law, laid out New Jersey’s problems with ensuring conviction integrity in a study published this year.
“Prosecutors resist claims based on fresh exculpatory evidence with all the zeal of Spartan warriors defending the pass at Thermopylae. Judges, made weary by repeated applications for relief, find refuge in notions of finality and the sanctity of the jury verdict,” they wrote.
“Our study of New Jersey cases shows that unjustifiable obstacles to relief for the innocent cast a shadow over our criminal justice system,” they added.
Despite the obstacles, Crayton remains undeterred. He filed a clemency petition with the state on Boykins’ behalf, asked the state attorney general’s conviction review unit to consider the case, and sent an inch-thick report on his findings to the state public defender’s office, the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office, the New Jersey Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, state and federal lawmakers, and various other authorities he hopes will champion his cause.
None have committed to do so.

 A tough childhood in Brick City

Boykins came of age during a turbulent time in Newark’s history. He was a kid when race riots rocked the city in 1967, leaving years of rising crime, white flight, poor police-community relations, and high unemployment and school dropout rates in their wake.
By 1981, when two robbers gunned down Milton Laufer, 71, at the carpet company he ran with his brother on Shipman Street, Boykins was 19 and had already been in cops’ crosshairs for years.
“The police didn’t like him, because he hung around with the bad group, you know, they was always getting into trouble,” said his older brother, Johnnie Boykins. “We grew up in the projects, so everybody was on the cops’ radar.”
His neighborhood clashes also drew unwanted police attention to Boykins, who goes by the nicknames “Scoopie” and “Scoobie,” his mother said.
“Scoopie could fight, and he wasn’t scared of nobody,” Bowers said. “He would protect himself.”
Years of court records compiled by Crayton lay out what happened before and after Boykins’ conviction.
The year of Laufer’s murder, Newark had its most homicides ever, 161, a record that still stands today.
An Essex County homicide investigator charged Boykins in a prior slaying that year, but Boykins denied involvement, saying he was at work when the murder occurred. Bowers went to the detective — the same one who’d later arrest Boykins in Laufer’s death — and told him so.
“He told me, ‘I’m going to prove that he’s guilty.’ And I said, ‘Well, I’m going to prove he’s not!’” she said. “I wanted to fight him, really, because he made me so mad, because you could tell it was personal with him with my son.”
A judge dismissed the charges against Boykins, and several other men ultimately were convicted.










There’s a system failure. And it can’t be the only time this has happened.


– Attorney John Crayton


Laufer’s last day came on May 22, 1981. Two robbers entered his carpet company office and one shot him in the stomach. He died hours later.
On June 28, 1981 — with no one yet arrested in Laufer’s killing — police picked Boykins up for an unrelated aggravated assault. 
He had a .22-caliber revolver on him, but investigators determined it wasn’t the murder weapon, Crayton said.
Four days later, police charged him with Laufer’s murder. Their evidence was scant, with a missing murder weapon, a fuzzy description of the robbers, and no forensic clues, Crayton found.
Investigators also had a lead pointing them in another direction. An anonymous tipster identified another teenager with a violent history — who fit the description of the robbers — as one of those involved, and a polygraph indicated he lied when denying any knowledge of the robbery or murder, according to testimony from a 1989 post-conviction relief hearing for Boykins.
But Milton Laufer’s brother Harry had identified Boykins out of a photo lineup as one of the robbers, and the prosecution proceeded. Boykins’ attorney was not told about the other teen who failed the polygraph.
Prosecutors bolstered their case with the jailhouse informant, Alvis Holt, who told jurors Boykins confessed to him that he’d killed Laufer.
After a four-day trial, jurors convicted Boykins. He was sentenced to life in prison and has repeatedly been denied parole since he became eligible for release in 2006.

 ‘He’s a liar!’

Boykins has raised multiple issues to allege he was wrongfully convicted.
He has claimed that detectives, while he was in custody for the unrelated assault, directed him to stand in front of a mirror a day before the photo lineup. Crayton suspects that unusual direction served to give Harry Laufer an improper early peek at Boykins so that he’d be sure to identify Boykins as the culprit during the lineup the next day. Harry Laufer died in 2005.
As for Holt’s testimony, jurors never learned he had been charged in the sexual assaults of his girlfriend’s daughters, ages 2 and 3, as well as the Aug. 10, 1981, murder of John McCall, a former Marine gunned down during a robbery outside Beth Israel Hospital. Prosecutors did not inform Boykins’ trial attorney of either Holt’s criminal troubles or his cooperation in the McCall case.
Disclosure obligations require prosecutors to disclose any information to defense attorneys that could taint the credibility of a witness — such as prosecutors’ cooperation deals with informants — to ensure defendants get a fair trial by allowing jurors to judge a witness’ credibility.
After Holt testified in Boykins’ trial, prosecutors dropped charges against Holt in the sexual assault case. Holt’s murder and robbery charges also were dismissed.
Bowers said she watched Holt’s testimony with growing fury.
“I said: ‘He’s a liar! He’s a liar!’” she said. “They told me they’d put me out if I don’t shut up. So I shut up after that because I didn’t want to make it bad for my son.”
At Boykins’ 1989 post-conviction relief hearing, Holt explained how he came to be a crucial witness in the case against Boykins, who he said he had never met until they landed on the same jail tier.
Authorities initially asked him to sign a statement implicating another man in McCall’s murder. When an Essex County homicide investigator learned Holt was housed with Boykins, Holt was asked to sign a statement implicating Boykins in Laufer’s murder, Holt testified during that 1989 hearing.
According to a transcript of the hearing, Holt testified that the detective referred to Boykins as “that bastard.”
“He said, ‘I want that bastard. That bastard got away from me, but he won’t get away from me again,’” Holt said then.
Boykins did not prevail in that hearing.
“He had a good lawyer. She put all kinds of people on the stand and proved that Alvis Holt was a liar. Alvis Holt took the stand and said he was a liar. She showed all these Brady violations, one after another after another,” Crayton said. “But the judge downplayed them in his opinion, and even more shocking was that two years later, the appellate court just rubber-stamped that opinion. So there’s a system failure. And it can’t be the only time this has happened.”
He added: “It takes courage to admit that kind of wrong, and I think that’s lacking.”
The Essex County Prosecutor’s Office didn’t respond to a request for comment.
 Changes made for fairer cases

In the decades since Boykins was convicted, New Jersey has implemented a series of changes to make criminal investigations and prosecutions fairer for defendants.
The state has added new restrictions on photo lineups, recognizing that eyewitness identifications often are wrong, especially when they’re cross-racial. Mistaken witness identifications factored into 27% of nearly 3,700 exonerations across the country since 1989, according to the National Registry of Exonerations.
State officials have also changed the rules on jailhouse informants, who can be unreliable because they generally lack firsthand knowledge of a crime and have an incentive to lie.
The courts also strengthened prosecutors’ disclosure obligations on jailhouse informants under rules adopted in 2022, said Peter McAleer, a Judiciary spokesman. At the courts’ direction, the state Attorney General’s Office created an inventory of jailhouse informants in every county to track how many times they offer information or testify in cases, McAleer added. Jailhouse informants were involved in 15% of exonerations in murder cases, according to the National Registry of Exonerations.
The Attorney General’s Office also reminded prosecutors of their disclosure obligations in a directive issued in 2019, the same year it created a conviction review unit.
Meanwhile, Murphy formed a clemency advisory board last year to recommend worthy candidates for clemency.
But exoneration work can be challenging.
“Procedural rules and time bars are routinely invoked to defeat the post-trial claims of persons with compelling evidence of actual innocence,” the Risingers of Seton Hall wrote in their study. “Strong evidence of actual innocence is brushed aside and given no worth by our courts. Post-conviction discovery is highly restricted.”
Because many of the challenges in getting exonerated stem from court hurdles, they added, “the work of reviewing cases for innocence and other fundamental injustice should not be simply offloaded by our judiciary onto a conviction review unit.”
McAleer said New Jersey trial courts received 356 post-conviction relief petitions last year, and time-related restrictions keep courts from being besieged by such filings.
“The court system cannot reasonably function without time limits on cases, but relevant court rules allow for relaxing limitations that ‘would result in an injustice,'” he said.
Even so, New Jersey has a dismal record on exonerations.
Six years since its inception, the attorney general’s conviction review unit has just two victories despite accepting 618 eligible cases to review. (Cases that remain on direct appeal or weren’t felonies in state court are ineligible.)
And Murphy, now in his eighth year in office, didn’t exercise his clemency powers until December when he pardoned 33 people and commuted the sentences of three more. More than 3,000 people have applied for clemency consideration, said Tyler Jones, a Murphy spokeswoman. His office is expected to announce more clemency actions this week.
Several groups outside government do exoneration work too, including the Risinger project, Princeton-based Centurion Ministries, the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, and the New Jersey Innocence Project at Rutgers University.
Still, New Jersey averaged just 1.6 exonerations a year between 2014 and 2023, according to the National Registry of Exonerations. Illinois, the national leader, had an annual average of 34.6 over the same decade. Illinois, with 12 million residents, is larger than New Jersey, but Michigan, which is more comparable in size to the Garden State, averaged 9.7 exonerations a year, according to the registry.
The work is time-consuming because it requires a full reinvestigation of a case, using both new technology and traditional investigative methods, said Attorney General’s Office spokesman Dan Prochilo. The unit’s standard for exoneration is clear and convincing evidence of actual innocence, he added.
“These investigations take substantial resources and time, as cases and evidence are often decades old,” he said.
Estimates of how many people in prison were wrongfully convicted range from 1 to 10%. Using those metrics, at least 130 people of the nearly 13,000 people now in state prisons may have been wrongfully convicted.

 A chance at life

Boykins, now 63, has been behind bars for 44 years.
Crayton has worked as a prosecutor, defense attorney, and investigator, and he knows politics plays a part in who succeeds in their exoneration bids.
Boykins is not the kind of would-be exoneree who politicians will trot out for photo ops and press conferences. He’s in poor physical and mental health, with diagnoses of schizophrenia and antisocial personality disorder, and last year suffered a brutal beatdown at the hands of his cellmate, Crayton said. If the effort to exonerate Boykins succeeds, he’ll likely need to remain in a psychiatric care home or similar setting, he added.
“There’s no happy ending for Darren Boykins, none, period,” he said. “The happy ending for him, maybe, is that he gets to see his mother once in a while, wherever he is, and he’s safer there than staying in prison.”
He still deserves a shot at freedom, he added.
“I don’t think anybody should ignore what happened to Darren,” he said. “Healthy societies need to acknowledge their wrongs.”
Boykins’ mother and brother still visit him in Trenton, where he’s incarcerated at the New Jersey State Prison, as often as they can.
“He’s real quiet, like this, like he’s sleeping,” Bowers said, slouching and slitting her eyes. “He told me they give him medicine. You could look at him and tell they keep him drugged.”
Bowers, a retired special education teacher, mourns all that her son lost out on in life.
“If I was in there for something I didn’t do, I don’t think I could have made it this long. I probably would have been dead,” she said. “I think God is just keeping him alive so he can have a chance, a little bit of a chance, at life. I pray to Allah every night to let my son come home before I die.”

She advocates for cardiac emergency planning in public schools and funding for districts to acquire AED equipment and training. (Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Reagan Herrman’s heart condition remained hidden until halfway through a summer youth basketball game at Washburn University when she became short of breath and struggled to reach the team’s bench.
“I went behind the bench, because my coach was also my dad. He told me to go walk, to walk it off. So I did and sat on the bench. Just as soon as I sat down, as I remember it, it all went black,” she said.
Herrman collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. Health professionals and others trained in CPR jumped into action. Eventually, a portable medical device known as an AED, or automated external defibrillator, was deployed. It delivered a single electric shock that restored her heartbeat.
“If the shock wasn’t delivered, I don’t think I would have made it,” she said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “I remember waking up, being out of breath, breathing really heavy and then seeing people all around me. I heard voices and shouting and see people talking to me. Like ‘Reagan, can you hear me?’ Then I saw my mom, which she says I said, ‘I love you.’ ”


Herrman’s heart stopped for approximately four minutes on a Topeka basketball court on July 16, 2023. She was unresponsive and began to turn blue. The university’s preparation for health emergencies and the availability of a defibrillator saved the life of the then-13 year old Emporia resident.
She was airlifted to a hospital and spent a week in a cardiac intensive care unit. Doctors diagnosed Herrman with CPVT, or catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which is an inherited condition causing sudden heart rhythm disturbances in otherwise healthy children. She recovered and, eventually, was cleared to resume sports activities.
But Herrman’s story didn’t end there.
 
Politics of AEDs
The young cardiac-arrest survivor served as motivation for the Kansas Legislature to pass a 2024 law requiring public schools to develop cardiac emergency response plans that included CPR and AED training of key personnel. It was modeled after the Emporia school district’s decision in wake of Herrman’s experience to add 14 new AEDs to district buildings, provide training for school personnel and coaches, and install 120 signs to point people to lifesaving equipment.
“It is our hope that Reagan’s story can serve as a catalyst for change in Kansas’ approach to AED accessibility,” her mother, Amanda Herrman, told House and Senate lawmakers. “Reagan’s experience underscores the critical importance of this initiative. Our family feels blessed for the fortunate outcome that day, knowing that many other families may not have such a story to tell.”
That bill was supported by other Kansans with firsthand knowledge of cardiac arrest. The legislation required public schools to create cardiac emergency response plans and work to outfit buildings with AEDs. The bill received broad support in the House and Senate.
Reagan Herrman, who didn’t know CPR before enduring her own cardiac emergency, was in the Capitol for signing of the bill.
During the 2025 legislative session, the American Heart Association worked to convince the Legislature to appropriate $1.5 million to pay for CPR and AED training programs and the equipment purchases. That funding was included in a large budget bill awaiting action by Gov. Laura Kelly.
Kari Rinker, who works as a lobbyist for the American Heart Association, was involved in rallying support for additional funding to help Kansas public schools comply with the emergency training standard.
“There have been challenges in some communities getting this in place. Especially rural communities might have fewer training resources,” Rinker said.
Access to additional training and positioning of equipment in schools could reduce the hesitancy some people have about jumping into an emergency, she said.
 
‘Dream coming true’
Rinker said the survival rate of people who experienced cardiac arrest was around 10% without an immediate response from people on the scene. If CPR was performed quickly, she said, the survival rate could be doubled or tripled. When a child goes into cardiac arrest in a school with AEDs onsite, however, approximately 70% survive.
“Yet, fewer than 50% of people say they are confident to step in and perform this function. We want to improve that. We want to create a nation of lifesavers,” she said.
The $1.5 million in Senate Bill 125 was significant because a separate grant opportunity for schools to acquire AED equipment or training was eliminated due to a technicality.
Reagan Herrman said, if given a chance, she would urge the governor to support emergency medical funding for Kansas schools.
“I think this is just icing on the cake to finish what we started,” she said. “I’d say, honestly, it is a dream coming true.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Reagan-Hermann-April-2025-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-07 12:15:57.590961

That’s why we at the Michigan League for Public Policy have followed the data and research so we can help folks make the right decisions. With what’s at stake, being informed is vital.
Medicaid is in serious jeopardy.
Right now, Republicans at the federal level are considering drastic cuts to Medicaid, the program that provides essential healthcare coverage to more than 2.5 million Michiganders in every part of the state who would otherwise be unable to afford needed medical care. The proposed cuts are part of a broader budget plan that aims to slash at least $880 billion from Medicaid to fund an extension of 2017-era tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthiest Americans.
This is a big deal. Medicaid covers essential services like preventative screenings, mental health treatment, and long-term services and supports. If Congress is successful in passing their proposed spending cuts, thousands of children, families, seniors, and people with disabilities in Michigan could lose access to life-saving healthcare. Those cuts would also strain local economies by threatening jobs in health systems, hospitals and nursing facilities across Michigan that are vital to our communities. It truly is hard to overstate how deeply these cuts would affect our state.
Reductions in Medicaid funding would likely lead to:

Coverage losses: Millions of people could lose their health insurance, making it even harder to access necessary medical care.
Higher costs: Those who are unable to stay on Medicaid would face higher out-of-pocket costs for services and medications, putting more financial strain on already struggling families.
Hospital closures: Rural hospitals, which often depend on Medicaid funding to stay afloat, would be at increased risk of closing. For many rural areas, this would mean the closest hospital would be hours away, making emergency care, maternity care and other essential healthcare services much more difficult to access when they are needed. In Michigan, nearly 16% of seniors and more than 37% of children living in a small town have health coverage through Medicaid.

Many of your neighbors rely on Medicaid for their health insurance—check out our fact sheets to see how many people in your Congressional district are covered. This coverage means access to affordable, often lifesaving care. The more we understand and see the people behind the numbers, the more clearly we can defend a program that helps Michigan families stay healthy, stable, and able to thrive.

Easley decided to shut down her store in downtown Oak Grove after more than eight years on South Broadway. She relocated her business to a different vintage store in Blue Springs.
“Such a blessing to be in downtown Oak Grove for the last eight and a half years,” Easley told her Facebook followers. “I have truly enjoyed getting to know each and every one of you, hearing a little bit about your life and your story, and I will miss that the most out of everything that has happened in the last eight years. I will miss all of you.”
“Closing” was written in large letters above the shop’s door in late February, after Easley made the call to move the store. She said a lack of foot traffic made it difficult to reach profit margins in her store, which stocked home goods, jewelry and more.
While the store is in the center of the town of nearly 10,000 and sits on the town’s main thoroughfare, it also happens to be along a state highway. Route F, known as South Broadway through town, connects U.S. 50 to Interstate 70 and is a popular route for tractor-trailers as they traverse the area.
The Missouri Department of Transportation has authority over the highway and made the call to expand it to mostly five lanes in 2011. Through the downtown district, the highway shrinks to three lanes as drivers pass by a handful of retail spaces, insurance offices, hair salons and other service businesses.
“There’s just not a lot of foot traffic,” Easley told The Beacon. “That is one issue with having this be such a thoroughfare.”
“It makes me sad,” she said. “I know there’s just not a lot of shopping down here and out this way. But then it makes it too easy to shop on Amazon.”
Easley was a member of Oak Grove’s Chamber of Commerce and part of a group of small-business owners who wanted to start up a downtown revitalization project.
The group worked on staging events to encourage people to shop downtown. Ultimately, without lots of community buy-in, they struggled to get the effort off the ground.
“We were like, ‘You know what, we own these businesses down here. This should not be our responsibility,’” she said.
 Oak Grove’s dilemma 

The shop owners weren’t alone in their aspirations for downtown.
Oak Grove Mayor Dana Webb has been looking for ways to make it more welcoming to pedestrians since she was elected in 2020.
“I think we got the expansion several years too early,” Webb said of the project, which she wishes had more beautification measures built-in during the time of construction. “I don’t think our town was big enough at that time for it.”
Oak Grove advocates had previously explored joining Missouri Main Street Connection, a nonprofit that provides resources to towns across Missouri that want to launch revitalization efforts. But they ran into the same problem back then: a lack of community buy-in.
A few years later, the group of business owners approached Webb to see if their efforts overlapped with the city’s priorities. But between complicated building leases and the highway, the group ran into roadblock after roadblock.
“Businesses need eyes,” said Kennedy Smith, the former director of National Trust for Historic Preservation’s National Main Street Center and a current researcher at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. “They need traffic and visibility, so if cars are going through downtown at 40 miles per hour, people aren’t going to see anything.”
The speed limit drops as cars travel through the heart of Oak Grove. Slower traffic can reduce some crash risk and improve pedestrian safety.
“There’s just so many what-ifs,” Webb said. “I hope someday that they have engineers, a team or a board, somebody that starts to look a little bit ahead for pedestrians.… If you go to other states or other countries, you see people walking. We don’t see people walking here. If you do, it’s odd.”
According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, a pedestrian hit by a vehicle traveling 32 miles per hour has a 25% risk of death. That risk increases to 50% when the vehicle is going 42 miles per hour. The World Health Organization recommends that the maximum road travel speed should be about 20 miles per hour in areas where bicyclists and pedestrians share the space.
“The key thing is that the interests of transportation engineers and people who are interested in healthy, vibrant downtowns are not necessarily the same thing,” Smith said.
Beautification projects, like adding trees, flowers or benches, were the first projects Webb brought to MODOT for its approval. She also wanted ways to make sidewalks feel more enclosed and less noisy for pedestrians, in an effort to limit perceived exposure to traffic and large trucks.
The city first asked if it could plant trees along the sidewalks throughout downtown. That plan was rejected due to driver safety considerations — if Oak Grove wanted trees, they had to be under 4 inches in diameter in case a car crashed into them.
Then, the city asked if it could put trees in large pots. That was also rejected for safety. They returned with other requests: shrubs, flowers or benches. They were all turned down.
“MODOT sometimes views a road going through a town as getting people from A to Z,” said Matthew Randall, the city administrator in Oak Grove. “When you live in the town, the road is your town. It’s integral to your city.”
They’ve had luck with some projects, while others haven’t gotten off the ground as quickly as they would like, Randall said.
“Just being downtown, the heavy commercial traffic and tractor-trailers definitely have a negative impact on the experience,” Randall said.
 How MODOT works with Missouri cities

MODOT’s area engineers are integral links between communities and the state. They help coordinate projects and maintain infrastructure across Missouri. Usually, they are the ones who make the requests to MODOT on behalf of cities for the projects they want to pursue.
“There’s a number of places where the state highway may function more as the main street of a community,” said Eric Schroeter, the deputy director and chief engineer at MODOT. “We have to balance all of that out – not only is it somebody’s main street, but it’s also a link in a transportation system that has to help people get places, and goods and products move around as well.”
MODOT is in charge of the seventh-largest highway system in the country, but ranks 48th nationally in funding per mile. MODOT only pays for projects that relate specifically to their domain. Everything else falls to the cities.
Officials in Oak Grove and other Missouri towns are thankful for MODOT’s collaboration and the easy access they have to their area representatives. Lebanon, Missouri, launched its downtown revitalization project officially in 2019. The town’s main street intersects with state Route 5.
“The highway intersection, it can be a little dicey,” said Sarah Angst Stewart, the executive director of Downtown Lebanon. “It’s not dangerous, it’s just a little more challenging for a person who is not used to walking near semi trucks blowing by.”
Lebanon has been working with MODOT over the past decade to improve walkability throughout downtown. The public works department meets with the state on a monthly basis to talk about future projects and address concerns as they arise.
“There are challenges involved with having a highway where there are pedestrians,” Angst Stewart said. “MODOT has put an effort into making sure that it is more pedestrian friendly.”
Since putting a concerted effort into downtown revitalization plans, the mix of businesses in downtown Lebanon has started to shift.
“This is probably every rural downtown. It’s the cheapest rent because it’s a lot of stuff packed close together, in older buildings that haven’t had a lot of love and attention,” she said.
But the exact opposite has started to happen in Lebanon. What was once a downtown that was heavily saturated with insurance companies, accountants and attorneys is now home to new retail and dining.
“It’s really cool to see. I don’t know if it’s finally the right time,” Angst Stewart said. “What’s happening is this resurgence of small-town downtowns. Where do you find that real community? It’s downtown.”
In the four years that Lebanon has invested in having a director for the downtown district, the area has doubled its taxable sales from $5 million in 2019 to $10 million in 2023.
“By just focusing on it, that is a lot of tax revenue that can then go back to our local economy and fund things like our police, fire and capital improvements,” she said.
Up north in Chillicothe, the town has reaped the benefits of long-term planning and making a name for its history. The city is the home of sliced bread, which was invented there in 1928. U.S. 65 runs north-south through Missouri and is Chillicothe’s main street.
“Highway 65, or Washington Street, is the heart of that artery that fuels our town,” said Amy Supple, Chillicothe’s tourism director. “(People) get to travel right through the heart of our community, so they’re not bypassed. It’s not an exit sign that they see.”
In the early 2000s, business owners, the tourism organization and the main street organization put their heads together to find ways to diversify downtown. What resulted was a 30-year strategic plan, and the organization set short-term priorities to reach long-term goals.
A long-term plan is crucial for investment in infrastructure, said Chris Hess, the executive director of the Pioneer Trails Regional Planning Commission, which coordinates efforts across Johnson, Lafayette, Pettis and Saline counties in Missouri.
“Funding follows planning,” Hess said. “The knee-jerk reaction for funding does not end well very often. We’re thinking about what can drive the economics. Do we see a population boom coming up? Is there potential for expansion in this area?”
That’s part of what Oak Grove is trying to assess. The city’s population is growing. In 2010, the town had about 5,000 residents, according to the census. Today, the town is pushing toward a population of 10,000.
For now, Oak Grove has negotiated with MODOT that the city will take control of the parking spaces that line the downtown district. And they’ll keep trying to work with the state to make the area more inviting to potential visitors, despite its popularity for commercial truck drivers.
“We haven’t really talked to them in detail about that aspect of the pedestrian versus the car versus the connectivity,” Webb said. “Because we’re pretty much just stopped at the driver effect.”

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare. 
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state. 
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.

States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets. 
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state. 
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.

The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

Senate President Bobby Joe Champion said he would pursue an advisory opinion from the Senate Ethics Subcommittee regarding a potential conflict-of-interest raised by recent Reformer reporting, which showed that he’d done legal work for the Rev. Jerry McAfee while also advocating for McAfee’s nonprofit 21 Days of Peace to receive millions in state grants.
“I understand that questions have been raised about a potential conflict of interest regarding my work as a senator and a private practice attorney. Out of an abundance of caution, I have asked the Senate Ethics Subcommittee for an advisory opinion,” Champion, a Minneapolis Democrat, said Monday.
Under Senate rules, a member of the Senate may request advice from the Senate Ethics Subcommittee on a potential conflict of interest.
Complicating the situation: Champion is chair of the ethics subcommittee. He said he’s asked to be temporarily replaced as chairman until the matter is resolved.
Last month, Champion introduced a bill (SF2978) providing a $1 million grant to 21 Days of Peace, a violence prevention group headed by McAfee.
Meanwhile, starting in 2022, Champion, in his private capacity as an attorney, represented McAfee and his nonprofit Salem Inc. in four court cases involving nonpayment of mortgages on multiple Minneapolis properties, totaling roughly half a million dollars.
That period overlaps with the 2023-24 legislative session, when lawmakers gave a $3 million grant to McAfee’s nonprofit. Champion was the chief author of that bill as well.
Champion says that his work on the mortgage cases was pro-bono, and that because it concluded in December 2022, prior to the start of the legislative session, he did not need to disclose the relationship to the public or to his colleagues.
“There would be no need to disclose a work relationship which had already concluded at that time, and which provides no financial benefit to me,” he said through a spokesperson.
McAfee, in an interview with the Reformer, refused to say whether he paid Champion for his legal services: “I won’t answer that,” he said. “Is there something on the books that would prevent me from hiring him as an attorney?”
Champion says he keeps records of his pro-bono clients, but declined to share the relevant portions.
Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota Law School professor who was the chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, said Champion’s actions represent a “clear” conflict of interest.
“Nobody should sponsor a bill in the Legislature favoring a client, pro-bono or not, it doesn’t matter,” he said. “It’s a basic principle that in a legislative body, if there is a bill that’s going to help your client, you say, ‘This is my client.’”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NN230324_240-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-07 11:19:18.368768

As has been well-documented in recent weeks, the Trump administration is implementing a massive and chaotic bloodletting of the federal government. From the attempted elimination of the Department of Education to the evisceration of several other key departments — including the National Weather Service and the Department of Veterans Affairs — President Trump and Elon Musk have moved, without legislative authorization, to end or dramatically reduce funding for a host of programs and initiatives.
So how is this playing with North Carolina voters? According to new survey data released by the Elon University Poll, not so well. As NC Newsline learned in a recent special extended conversation with the poll’s director, Prof. Jason Husser, North Carolinians are skeptical of the cuts and deeply divided over the President’s mass immigrant deportation initiatives and his overall job performance.

The findings were part of a study published in the journal Global [&#8230;]","A spawning redband trout from the Upper Klamath Basin. (Photo by Jonny Armstrong, courtesy of Oregon State University.)Some already threatened cold-water fish species in the Northwest will not only face shrinking habitat from climate change but will face growing pressure from invasive fish species fleeing their own warming and dwindling waters, according to modeling from researchers at Oregon State University.
The findings were part of a study published in the journal Global Change Biology by fisheries professor Guillermo  Giannico, associate fisheries professor Ivan Arismendi and graduate student Arif Jan. The three found that climate change is likely to compel all kinds of species migration that could lead to increased predation, competition and some localized extinctions of once native species in the Northwest and globally.
Giannico said their models can be run on most species in the world. But for their recent study, the three zeroed in on the northern migration of non-native smallmouth bass and northern pike into threatened and endangered native redband and bull trout habitat in the Northwest. All four of the species are likely to lose habitat as climate change accelerates and are likely to seek homes in colder water at higher elevations.
They created maps using ecological data that indicate the breadth of territory where each species lives and then modeled the impact of changing conditions such as higher temperatures and drought projected through 2070 to see how that would influence the range of all four species’ movement and overlap.
“We forecast how these species would respond to those changing conditions by disappearing from certain regions that will be too warm for them, and appearing in others that maybe today are too cold, but they would be more suitable in the future,” Giannico said. “Because not all shifts are equal, there will be areas where they will be more crowded together, and they would overlap more, and areas where they wouldn’t overlap that much.”
Of great concern is the migration of aggressive and predatory northern pike into redband and bull trout territory, and the increasing likelihood the two will overlap more frequently.
“They all shift, but they end up shifting in a way that the amount of overlap in their distribution is going to be greater,” Giannico explained. “It’s like you have less room to avoid nasty people at the party, and you end up being cornered in the same part of the room with the same people you don’t enjoy, and you’re all packed in the wrong place with the wrong companion.”
Giannico said researchers have long separately studied how climate change will compel the migration of some species and how native species respond to the introduction of invasive species. The modeling done by the Oregon State scientists is an effort to combine the two, and to show how species’ habitats will overlap as climate change compels both native and nonnative species in an area to migrate and cohabitate.
The researchers fear that this increased negative interaction could lead to local extinctions of some native salmonids, similar to those occurring among shrinking populations of bull and rainbow trout from invasive species in southeastern Alaska, Giannico said.

“We are breaking away from the winter. It’s the reunification of families after a long winter. We celebrate it in our Spring Feast,” said John Ostrander, 63, Executive Director at Nokomis and member of the Ojibwe Nation.

Before the feast, those present gathered around the fire outside the Nokomis Center. The tobacco had been placed around the sacred fire, so everyone took a handful and offered it into the flames after a short prayer.
The youngest woman among the group brought a small portion of each food from the feast to offer to the spirits of the ancestors. The smoke rising into the sky carries those prayers and offerings to the elders who are no longer here, honoring that they are still present here with them. Then, everyone can go inside and eat.
From elders first to the youngest, everyone served themselves the food that they each brought, but before that, a prayer of gratitude was offered. Ariel Waagosh gave the prayer in Anishinaabemowin, the Great Lakes region language.

“All life is here and connected, and as human beings, we couldn’t live without breath, plants, water, and the sun. We are nourished by life. As gratitude, the prayer comes from our most humble place”, said Waagosh, 47, a member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians.

The attendees of this gathering emphasized the importance of staying united and continuing these traditional events that strengthen ties among their members.
“This is the only place in my life where I can have a community. These are scary times right now; nothing is certain, so we have to take joy from where we can get it”, said Julia Tehauno, 23, Comanche member.
“You could see, during lunch, how loud it was; it was because people were talking, relaxing, and having a good time. And within the Native community, that’s a good thing to have: a space where every Indigenous person is welcome,” said Ostrander.

Penningtion was fired from his job as an economic policy analyst at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for his criticism of Cargill on LinkedIn. Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer.Environmentalists have long feared that Minnesota state regulators have been captured by local industry heavyweights — allowing big companies like Cargill and 3M to shape environmental policy in their own interests instead of the public’s. 
But no one would accuse Derric Pennington, a conservation scientist hired by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency last year, of being captured by industry, and by Cargill in particular. 
Pennington is active on social media, especially LinkedIn, where he shares his original hand-drawn editorial cartoons with captions critiquing the country’s biggest food and agriculture companies — and ineffective attempts by regulators to rein in pollution. He’s developed a following of nearly 7,500, many of them drawn to Pennington because companies’ marketing posts offer a ripe opportunity to question their sustainability claims.

From the perspective of Cargill, however, Pennington’s assertive posture with the Minnesota-based food industry giant — including direct messages to a Cargill employee — was “unprofessional.” When they alerted the MPCA, the agency acted. 
The case underscores the complexity of free speech issues for government agencies, said David Larson, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law. Unlike private employers, public employers like MPCA are governed by the First Amendment. But the state can still fire employees when managers believe the employee’s speech “interferes with the agency’s interest in maintaining an efficient and effective workplace,” Larson said.
Before he was onboarded to the agency, Pennington told the hiring supervisor that he was an unpaid cartoonist and essayist on the side, and asked if he would be able to continue his activities outside of work while working for MPCA. 
“Its been a way for me to engage both my right and left brain when communicating my science and to publicly critique the many private and public policy solutions being proposed to chart society and business on a more sustainable course,” Pennington said.
The manager checked with Human Resources and confirmed with Pennington that he would be allowed to continue his activities, as long as there was “no conflict of interest with the business (i.e., financials) or mission (i.e.,ensuring that every Minnesotan has healthy air, sustainable lands, clean water, and a better climate) of the agency,” according to an email obtained by the Reformer.
In August, Pennington messaged a Cargill staffer on LinkedIn and asked some technical questions about the company’s oilseeds investments, and criticized its sustainability work.
The employee responded, offering a couple of times to talk on the phone rather than via direct message.
“Call me skeptical given my experience with Cargill’s sustainability team,” Pennington wrote at one point.
(Click the photo below to view the full exchange.)
  Private messages between Derric Pennington and a Cargill employee. The Reformer redacted the Cargill employee’s name.
Those messages made their way to Cargill higher-ups, and in August, Cargill government relations director Gary Kay emailed the head of MPCA’s climate division.
Kay wrote to the MPCA: “Our concerns lie with the accusations of green washing, and just the unprofessional nature of Mr. Pennington’s tone. Asking for future planned investments, market insights, and what we are paying producers are, in our opinion, wildly outside the scope of a state regulator.” 
Pennington said his direct messages to the Cargill employee were a personal interest and unrelated to his work at the agency.
  An email sent to MPCA’s climate director on August 22, 2024. The Reformer redacted the name of the Cargill staffer who messaged with Pennington.
One of Pennington’s supervisors sent him a memo, stating that by listing MPCA as his employer on LinkedIn, Pennington had given the impression that he was speaking on the agency’s behalf. 
“You are not authorized to represent MPCA’s views, and you must not engage in behavior that would adversely affect your work, job duties or ability to function in your position or create a hostile work environment,” the supervisor wrote, referencing the agency’s social media policy. 
Social media usage could become the basis for discipline in the future, the memo reads. 
“You should not post comments/posts/tweets/etc. that: 1)Impede the services provided by MPCA; 2)Disrupt MPCA’s workforce or operations; 3)Interfere with important working relationships; 4)Negatively impact the ability of MPCA to carry out its mission,” the memo continues.
Pennington removed MPCA from his LinkedIn profile and continued posting his cartoons and accompanying critiques of mainstream agriculture practices, carbon capture schemes and regulatory failures. 
He said he believed his posts were protected speech, and he wasn’t disclosing any information directly related to his employer or job duties — nor was he ever told not to engage with Cargill or its employees, he said. By removing MPCA from his profile, he said he believed he eliminated the perception that he was speaking on behalf of the agency.
“I didn’t think I did anything wrong,” Pennington said.
Then, in November, Pennington commented on one of Cargill’s LinkedIn posts promoting the company’s carbon market program, RegenConnect:
“Cargill what % does this 1 M acres represent relative to your total U.S. farm acres? Iowa alone had over 28 million acres planted in corn and soy last year.”
Pennington’s comment continued, questioning the details of the program.
Kay then emailed the MPCA chief of staff. 
“As I mentioned the first time, we view posts on this website from government employees as distinct from private citizens. Additionally, we take issue with the tone and the facts he put forward,” Kay wrote. 
Five days after the second complaint, Pennington was fired — just days before he reached his six month anniversary at the agency, when he would have joined the union and gained the right to a grievance process.
Pennington said his firing was a violation of his right to free expression, a misapplication of the agency’s social media policy and an example of corporate capture of Minnesota regulators. 
He said he believes his actions were in line with MPCA’s mission of “ensuring that every Minnesotan has healthy air, sustainable lands, clean water, and a better climate.”
Pennington’s case is nuanced, Larson said. The fact that the agency gave him a go-ahead to keep up his editorial cartooning works in Pennington’s favor, but the “okay” from the agency may not have extended to the private messages. And it’s unclear whether an employee’s duty not to interfere with the agency’s ability to “maintain an efficient and effective workplace” applies to the relationship between an agency and the companies it regulates. 
In Larson’s view, the direct messages could be perceived as investigatory. 
“I think there’s a distinction between posting an opinion and pursuing an investigation,” Larson said. 
Marshall Tanick, a Twin Cities employment and constitutional lawyer who has provided counsel to Pennington, said it’s a close case, but in his view, the termination was improper. 
“I think (MPCA) overstepped their boundaries, and I think they lack good cause to fire him under these peculiar circumstances,” Tanick said.
MPCA declined to comment, citing the confidentiality of personnel matters. Cargill did not respond to a request for comment. 
Pennington’s application for unemployment benefits was denied because he was fired for misconduct, so he appealed.
The appellate judge wrote that “Pennington’s continued posting of his opinions on social media in November 2024 was more akin to a good faith error in judgment or simple unsatisfactory conduct than the serious violation of standards required to find employment misconduct.”
The judge overturned the decision to deny Pennington benefits.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P1230025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-07 10:05:53.067714

(Photo courtesy of Layla Luna)Layla Luna was driving along a crowded Los Angeles street with her son Rio six years ago when the sirens started whaling and the lights of a police cruiser started flashing behind her.
She pulled over, as did the officer trailing her. However, he didn’t switch off the lights on top of the car.
Moments later Rio, who was 9 or 10 at the time, started making loud noises, banging his head and even trying to escape the vehicle.

Rio struggles with nonverbal autism. Lights from cars and streetlights combined with the flashes of red and blue on top of the police cruiser to send him into sensory overload.
“Everything is so intensified,” said Luna, who still bears a scar on her wrist from the incident.
In 2000, an estimated 1 in every 150 children in the United States had autism. By 2020, prevalence had increased to every 1 in 36 children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The South Carolina Autism Society estimates that more than 70,000 people in the state are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.
Yet, education on autism, as well as most other neurodivergent diagnoses, still lags.
Luna founded Just Bee, an organization that aims to make communities more autism friendly, in 2019, while still living in California. After her family was told to leave a pizza restaurant when Rio started to have sensory overload, Luna said she asked herself, “Why can’t people just be nice?”
She wondered if the situation would’ve gone differently if the employees understood that Rio was autistic and were trained on how to respond: “That was my call to action,” she said.
In 2021, Luna ditched Los Angeles for Mount Pleasant, leaving behind her previous career as a dancer and choreographer.
She met Gov. Henry McMaster later that year at a state Chamber of Commerce event. She shook his hand and said she was going to make South Carolina the first autism-friendly state.
It’s a moment she chuckles when reflecting on. But Luna was sincere.
In 2023, Just Bee launched an app Luna describes as “the Yelp of autism.”
Families can find sensory-friendly and welcoming spots on the app where employees have gone through autism training. They may offer discounts and sensory-friendly hours.
So far, most locations on the app — which include restaurants, gyms and even doctors’ offices — are in the Mount Pleasant area, though Luna hopes the desire to create a welcoming atmosphere will spread.
“It’s not about disability. It’s about possibility,” she told the SC Daily Gazette.
‘Rio’s law’
Her advocacy also led to the creation of a specialty license plate with the Just Bee emblem. It’s meant to alert officers before they approach the vehicle that someone inside is autistic or neurodivergent and could have a sensory reaction.
Luna first mentioned the idea of a specialty license plate to Carl Ritchie when he was a Mount Pleasant City councilman — a year before he was elected Charleston County sheriff.
He connected Luna with Rep. Kathy Landing, R-Mount Pleasant, who introduced legislation in January 2024 to create the Just Bee plates. Her proposal got wrapped into a broader bill creating multiple specialty plates, which the Legislature passed unanimously and McMaster signed last May.
“I’m very lucky I got that introduction,” Luna said.
According to the Autism Society, 20% of people with autism spectrum disorder will be stopped and questioned by police by the time they are 21, and 5% of them are arrested.
That’s because an untrained officer often misinterprets traits of the disorder — such as a lack of eye contact or little social awareness — as being suspicious or disrespectful, which can escalate a situation.
“A teenager (with autism) may encounter law enforcement and may not be doing anything wrong, but something doesn’t seem quite right to the officer,” Landing said. “Next thing you know, they’re in a situation where they’re questioning them; it scares them, and they start acting on you.”
She and Luna see “Rio’s law” as a step toward minimizing those situations.
The plate became available in February.
As of March 31, nine of those plates had been issued, said Mike Fitts, spokesman for the state Department of Motor Vehicles.
Luna’s confident that number will rise as more people know about it. Plus, she said, that’s nine vehicles that are safer than they were before.
“We never have a dry eye in the room when we tell parents their kids are going to be safer,” Luna said.
Officer training
This year, Luna is advocating for a bipartisan bill that would require all law enforcement officers to undergo training on autism spectrum disorder. Landing is the chief sponsor.
The House Judiciary Committee voted unanimously last week to advance the bill to the House floor.
It would help people with autism live a “full life,” Luna told legislators at a March 27 hearing.
“Without training, we cannot protect our loved ones like my son. We cannot protect our officers, our first responders,” she said.
The proposal would expand on the training officers undergo at the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy.
Currently, autism is discussed as part of mental health training. By requiring courses specifically on autism, the proposal would lead to a deeper understanding of autism and how to respond to people they encounter, said Jackie Swindler, the academy’s director.
Stephanie Turner, director of autism for the state’s department of disabilities, has been traveling around the state for more than two years conducting voluntary training related to autism at law enforcement agencies.
She said most officers she speaks with know someone with autism and want to learn more. Her lessons are part of a week-long program offered by the National Association of Mental Illness on a variety of topics.
After the license plate law was signed last year, she started telling officers about it as part of her training. Turner said Luna helped in creating a flyer on autism that Turner hands out to officers.
There’s “a lot of work that can be done with autism” in the state, she said.
“I think what Layla and Just Bee have done is remarkable,” Turner said. It “shows the power of a mom.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/processed-467D7C5D-3EC5-4682-979A-F67BBF7CBD29-e1744030803267-1024x783.jpeg,,,2025-04-07 10:05:53.067714

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)With more than half of Alaska’s regular legislative session over, attention in the state Capitol is focusing on a limited set of topics.
Before their scheduled adjournment in mid-May, leading legislators say they intend to pass a public school funding increase, enact one or more bills that would increase corporate taxes, and set the budget — including this year’s Permanent Fund dividend.
Late last week, all three priorities remained in a state of flux, and it wasn’t clear what form any will take by the time lawmakers leave Juneau.
Where’s the state budget?
Every year, the Legislature deals with multiple budget bills. 
First, there’s the supplemental budget, which addresses problems — unforeseen expenses and rises and falls in revenue — with the budget that lawmakers passed last year.
That budget deals with the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. Right now, there’s almost a $200 million deficit in the current fiscal year. The House has passed a bill to address that deficit, but it has not yet unlocked the Constitutional Budget Reserve — the state’s main savings account — to fill the deficit. 
The supplemental budget bill is scheduled for hearings in the Senate this week. That bill could advance through the Senate separately, or it could be combined with another budget bill. Regardless of what the Senate does, the House will still have to vote to unlock the CBR to balance the supplemental budget.
The Legislature may have to unlock the CBR for the upcoming fiscal year’s budget as well.
On Thursday night, the House Finance Committee approved a draft operating budget bill that would cover the fiscal year that starts July 1. 
That draft is expected to face a vote of the full House this week. As currently written, it would result in a deficit of $1.9 billion, and that would have to be covered with money from the CBR. 
As the House votes on the operating budget, the Senate is expected to vote this week on the capital budget, which pays for construction and renovation projects across the state.
As drafted, that bill contains only the minimum amount of state money needed to unlock federal grants. 
There’s also the state’s mental health budget bill, which is moving forward along with the operating budget but is generally uncontroversial because it is paid for with the state’s mental health trust fund and doesn’t affect the rest of the budget.
What’s the state of education funding?
Right now, the House’s draft operating budget includes a funding boost for K-12 public schools that’s worth more than $250 million. Without additional legislation, that’s only a one-time boost.
On Wednesday, the Senate Education Committee advanced House Bill 69, which would permanently boost per student funding by $1,000, to $6,960 per student, and incorporates a variety of education policy changes like open enrollment statewide and capping class sizes. 
The per-student increase would cost $253 million, plus an estimated $22 million for reading incentive programs, $706,000 for Mt. Edgecumbe High School, and over $158,000 for a new state charter school coordinator, totaling over $275 million. 
Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage and the education committee chair, said she was aiming to find common ground through the latest version of the bill.
The bill moved to the Senate Finance Committee on Friday, but has not been scheduled for a hearing yet. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy took to social media on Thursday to criticize the education committee’s version of the bill, saying that it would “inequitable constraints” on students enrolled in correspondence programs. The bill would tie funding for these programs — which serve most of Alaska’s homeschool students — to students being assessed through a standardized test or portfolio. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXDunleavy introduced education legislation in January through the House and Senate to provide one-time funding for schools, and added a range of policy changes, including an expansion of the correspondence programs that enroll most homeschool students in the state. The proposal would cost an estimated $181 million next year, including $75 million for the homeschool students as well as career and technical education, and $14 million for transportation. 
That measure, Senate Bill 62, is currently being heard in the Senate Education Committee, and its counterpart in the House, House Bill 76, is in the House Education Committee, with the next hearing scheduled for Friday, April 11.  
How will Alaska pay for it all?
In recent years, the Alaska Legislature has used the amount of the Permanent Fund dividend to balance the budget, raising the dividend in good years and lowering it in bad ones rather than follow the dividend formula in state law.
Because of low oil revenue and the desire for more public school funding, taking that approach this year would result in a dividend well below $1,000.
That idea is unpopular among legislators, who are instead considering alternatives. One is the CBR, but because it requires a supermajority in the House and the Senate, it’s procedurally difficult. As few as six senators or 11 House members could block the draw from savings.
Overspending from the Alaska Permanent Fund is possible with a simple majority vote of the House and Senate, but that would reduce the amount of money available from the fund in the future and create significant uncertainty that likely would harm the state’s debt rating.
Some legislators, particularly in the Senate, are proposing tax hikes to address the situation. In late March, the Senate Resources Committee advanced a bill that would change the way the state’s corporate income tax applies to the oil company Hilcorp. That’s expected to generate as much as $150 million per year.
That bill, Senate Bill 92, is scheduled for a hearing Wednesday in Senate Finance.
The Senate Resources Committee is also considering a broader change to oil taxes that involves reducing a tax credit awarded to companies at certain oil prices on each barrel of oil. That change is in Senate Bill 112, which was heard Friday by the resources committee but doesn’t have another hearing on the calendar.
Enacting that bill is expected to generate as much as $190 million for state services or the dividend in the coming fiscal year.
The Senate Finance Committee is also considering a change to taxes on internet sales, but that’s not considered a substantial change. 
The state House has yet to seriously consider any tax increases, and Gov. Mike Dunleavy has previously said that he strongly opposes any tax increases, which has hampered the drive to balance the budget by raising taxes.

(Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.


DOGE in SD
For more about the impact of mass federal firings, funding freezes and grant cancellations in South Dakota, see Searchlight’s DOGE in SD page.


The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Funding freezes and staff cuts pull the rug out from under farmers

Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.

Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system
In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Billions of dollars at stake for farmers hit by Trump funding freeze, pause on foreign aid

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

New Mexico’s biannual, 60-day lawmaking session ended after two breakneck final weeks with the Democratic-majority, volunteer legislators working right up to the noon deadline.
In the end, it was another legislative session that confirmed business as usual for the state’s oil and gas industry. Bills that would keep new wells away from schools; keep habitual rule violators and financially risky companies and people from buying wells; increase state fees and penalties to match the rate of inflation; and codify the state’s much-touted methane regulation rules, as well as a bill to reduce the state’s overall greenhouse gas emissions — all these and more were voted down or left undebated, preserving the industry status quo.
But that may not last. Over the same 60-day period, which ended March 22, the Trump administration fired up its scorched-earth policy to dismantle the federal government, including plans to deregulate the oil and gas industry, easing the status quo for oil and gas producers. And despite warnings since the November election and increasing clarity over the last two months, New Mexico’s legislators did not address the promised federal regulatory collapse in its just-finished session.
Hours after being sworn into his second presidential term, Donald Trump sat down and signed 26 executive orders that, taken together, unwind much of the climate-related regulatory work begun under his predecessor, President Joe Biden. Two of those orders, Declaring a National Energy Emergency and Unleashing American Energy, amount to a set of promises to deregulate fossil fuel production, and particularly in the oil and gas industry, promising an earthquake of federal regulatory change for New Mexico, the nation’s second-largest oil producer.
That was Jan. 20. The next day, the New Mexico Legislature began its biannual two-month session. (In even-numbered years there is a one-month session devoted solely to the budget.)
 











It's difficult to react to breaking changes coming out of Washington


– State Rep. Matthew McQueen, D-Galisteo



 
Then on March 12, 10 days before the end of the session, EPA Director Scott Zeldin announced the mechanisms to fulfil Trump’s promises: a massive series of EPA regulation rollbacks that would dramatically deregulate oil and gas production, the state’s most lucrative industry.
“We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion,” Zeldin said.
At the time, Rep. Matthew McQueen (D-Galisteo) said, ”Right now, we’re focused on what we have in front of us and what we can get across the finish line.” The short, two-month session kept state representatives and senators focused on immediate state matters, which took the form of 1,182 bills. Only 195 of those passed both chambers and went to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham for consideration and signature into law. Given the tidal wave of legislation and the session’s tight timeframe, McQueen said, “It’s difficult to react to breaking changes coming out of Washington,” dagger or no.
McQueen sponsored or co-sponsored five industry-related bills, though only one made it all the way through: a very specific royalty rate increase on new state leases in the most lucrative acreage of the Permian Basin, the nation’s most prolific and profitable oilfield. It is one of just two notable changes for oil and gas producers in the session. The second successful bill ties state penalties for pipeline safety violations to the federal penalty rate, doubling the state’s current level. A fiscal impact report estimated the change might bring the state, at most, another $125,000 a year, depending on the number of violations. The report also warned that under this arrangement the state penalty would be jeopardised should the federal government penalty change or be scrapped.
Many legislators and Lujan Grisham tout what they call “nationally leading” methane capture rules for the industry. But rules are not laws, and this session, McQueen again sponsored a bill that would put the state’s natural gas capture requirements into law. His bill lingered for three weeks on the House floor and died there without a hearing when the session ended.
“Frustrating is the word for the Legislature,” McQueen said. “Last year, this year, every year.”
“A mixed bag” is how Lujan Grisham described it to Capital & Main.
“Not having the 98% capture requirement in statute makes the entire methane rule vulnerable to wholesale repeal by a future administration,” Lujan Grisham said. “The legislature denied too many common sense regulatory changes.”
Another bill, sponsored by state Sen. Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque), would have set in law one of Lujan Grisham’s first acts upon taking office in 2019, calling on the state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 45% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. That would likely require dramatic reductions in oilfield emissions by the industry. The New Mexico Oil and Gas Association took out a $126,000 online ad campaign to help defeat the bill, targeting both Stewart and state Sen. Benny Shendo (D-Jemez Pueblo). Later, in a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Shendo sided with all of the committee’s Republicans and state Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup) to kill the bill. Muñoz is one of the top 10 recipients of oil and gas campaign contributions in the Legislature.
Asked how the industry fared in the session, Missi Currier, president and CEO of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, said, “NMOGA members sincerely appreciate the legislators who understand the vital role the oil and gas industry plays in New Mexico’s economy.”
The Legislature doesn’t only haggle over new laws; it also budgets for the state’s two oil and gas enforcement agencies as well.










Ozone levels in New Mexico’s portion of the Permian Basin have exceeded Clean Air Act standards for six years now, and the EPA hasn’t acted.


 
The Oil Conservation Division of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department is the primary enforcer of New Mexico’s oilfield rules. It also supported several new regulatory bills that would have updated portions of its foundational Oil and Gas Act, which hasn’t seen a major update in decades. This is the third session in a row that updates to the Act have died of inertia.
One example: a bill that would have increased penalties and fees that haven’t changed in years and was forcefully supported by the Oil Conservation Division made it through two committee hearings and then stalled. Lujan Grisham said its failure “continues a distressing trend” of the Legislature not passing bills the Oil Conservation Division has repeatedly asked for.
Speaking at a legislative committee hearing in November, Melanie Kenderdine, the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department secretary, said that New Mexico ranked second among states in oil production, but ninth in regulatory staffing, and she asked for more staff.
In the end, the division received a $7,992,700 budget increase over last year, $4.9 million of that in federal funding, according to Sidney Hill, the public information officer for the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. But, he said, “There are no additional positions added for OCD in the operating budget.”
And, he said, “None of [the EPA] actions would overturn EMNRD regulations or programs designed to protect the environment and move our state to a clean-energy future.”
It’s a different story at the state’s Environment Department, which, for the past few years, has had a rocky relationship with Sen. Muñoz, head of the Senate Finance Committee and the overarching Legislative Finance Committee.
This year, the Environment Department is restructuring to consolidate multiple enforcement agencies currently spread across the department’s many programs into a single Compliance and Enforcement Division. And the Legislature doesn’t give money in a lump sum to the department — it specifies how much goes to each division within. Drew Goretzka, director of communications at the Environment Department, said that while the department’s overall budget remained flat year-on-year in the Legislature’s main finance bill, the new Compliance and Enforcement Division received only half of its $6 million request. Goretzka said it’s too early to tell what effect that will have since the division is new.
The Air Quality Bureau at the Environment Department monitors everything from quarry dust to asbestos to smoke across the state. Even so, until the restructuring, roughly 70% of its enforcement work dealt with the oil and gas industry. In the past, James Kenney, the Environment Department secretary, has said that inspectors find roughly half of oil and gas facilities don’t meet state rules, and that’s reflected in the enforcement numbers. Furthermore, ozone levels in New Mexico’s portion of the Permian Basin have exceeded Clean Air Act standards for six years now, and the EPA hasn’t acted. Outside scientists who monitored the air in the small town of Loving, New Mexico, said that while the rest of the country has improved its air quality, “This area has gone backwards.”
“Concerning” is what Lujan Grisham called the lowball enforcement funding. “The path forward must include adequate resources to ensure all industries, including oil and gas, operate responsibly while contributing to our state’s economy,” she said.
 











What’s happening at EPA is a disaster … I cannot overstate the risk we now all face. 


– Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, Western Environmental Law Center



For the past few years the Environmental Protection Agency, the Justice Department and the New Mexico Environment Department have worked together on oilfield sweeps that have turned up polluters and sparked enforcement actions. Goretzka said those projects are still ongoing. It’s not clear if that will continue, or if New Mexico will be able to do the work on its own.
“NMED’s air permitting and compliance programs are underfunded,” Goretzka said. “EPA augmented our resources with technical staff, legal staff, contractors, and technologies like aerial surveillance.” He continued, “The lack of such personnel and technology will certainly impact our oversight of industry.”
Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, executive director of the Western Environmental Law Center, said, “What’s happening at EPA is a disaster … I cannot overstate the risk we now all face.” His group has spent years holding state, federal and industry feet to the fire over environmental violations.
“Folks will, of course, fight all of this … but litigation takes years to resolve,” he said. Meanwhile, the EPA’s moves to undercut oil and gas enforcement “will cause dramatic, adverse harm to human health, our air and water, and our lands.”
Joe Robledo, the usually affable press officer for the EPA Region 6 office that oversees New Mexico, responded to questions about the March 12 announcement with uncharacteristic bluster mirroring Zeldin’s original announcement:
“With Administrator Lee Zeldin’s historic announcement on March 12, New Mexico will see the fulfillment of President Trump’s promise to unleash American energy, lower the cost of living, restore of [sic] the rule of law, and give power back to the states to make their own decisions — all while accomplishing EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment. In the days and weeks ahead, EPA will provide more information about this effort.”
The EPA has provided no more information in the three weeks since Robledo’s response. It has, however, clawed back money and accused the National Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator — both Biden Administration projects — of “fraud, waste and abuse.” The U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation have opened criminal investigations against the two groups, which fund climate-related projects in New Mexico.
“We expect those criminal investigations — which reek of lies and fabrications — to expand against anyone who opposes the administration’s actions,” Schlenker-Goodrich said. “Coupled with grotesque attacks on our federal workers and scientific research, it’s impossible not to be enraged at all the absurd, noxious and authoritarian bullshit.”
Back at the Legislature, industry regularly touted the billions paid into state coffers from oil and gas taxes — about a third of New Mexico’s $10.8 billion operating budget. Speaking during a committee hearing, Rep. Derrick Lente (D-Sandia Pueblo), the chair of the House Taxation & Revenue Committee, said that oil and gas companies still made $10 billion in net profits in New Mexico in 2024 after paying their taxes.
The industry also directly accounts for at least a third of New Mexico’s total greenhouse gas emissions, according to the state’s latest inventory. And while the Legislature didn’t do anything to curb those particular emissions, it did pass legislation that will help New Mexicans cope with their climate change effects. Wildfire preparations, forest and watershed buffer projects, zero-interest natural disaster loans, flood recovery bonds and a community benefit fund for climate impact preparations — all passed the Legislature and await Lujan Grisham’s signature.
And a third of the money to fund all of those initiatives will come from oil and gas revenues, the industry producing and protecting the carbon fuels that drive climate change “religion” in the first place.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DSC1659_01-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-07 09:00:20.609798

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Heading into the Utah Legislature’s 2025 session, a big question was whether lawmakers would take more aggressive actions to tackle the state’s affordable housing crisis and whether they would preempt city powers to do it. 
The potential was there. At least two bills would have had major implications, aimed at requiring urban cities to allow smaller home types and smaller lots. 
But in the end, those bills didn’t advance. They came nowhere near the finish line. 
And another controversial bill to create a mighty new state agency called the Beehive Development Agency that would “coordinate” major economic development projects, including housing projects, was smothered in a cloud of controversy, leading lawmakers to abandon it for the time being. 
For a session underscored by a theme of control — of legislators exerting their power in a variety of policy areas, housing was not one of them. That’s even though housing affordability has ranked as a top concern among Utah voters, according to a report last year by the nonprofit Utah Foundation. 
Utah’s new housing experiment

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox and legislative leaders have also listed Utah’s housing crisis as a top priority. But notably, rather than using a hammer (or aggressive statewide policies meant to force cities to allow more homes to be built), lawmakers in recent years have taken a gentler “collaborative” approach. They’ve focused on providing a variety of planning tools to incentivize cities and builders to build more owner-occupied, more affordable “starter homes.” 
This year was no different, when it came to the bills that actually became law.
However, impatience with Utah’s stubbornly high housing prices did fuel frustrations for some lawmakers, indicating that if the state doesn’t start seeing some significant movement on the issue soon, legislators may be more willing to take more drastic action in the future. 
Cities ‘jealously guard’ land use authority
Rep. Ray Ward, R-Bountiful, the lawmaker who sponsored the two preemptive bills that his colleagues rejected, put it this way when he knew his bills were about to fail in a House committee. He said the state is at a crossroads — it could either “find some way to allow more homes to be built for our children if we want them to still be here” or live with the expensive consequences.

Ward wasn’t alone. Sen. Lincoln Fillmore, R-South Jordan, who co-sponsored Ward’s bill, had some frank comments for reporters during a Senate media availability on Feb. 27, as the 2025 session was coming to a close. 
“I do confess to this year being a little bit disappointed in what I felt like we were able to get done,” Fillmore said. “We’re getting some good policy in, but a lot of the proposals that really would have made a big difference in increasing supply have not passed, have not made it in the consensus bills that are (progressing).” 
Fillmore pointed specifically to Ward’s legislation as “good bills” that he would have liked to see pass. He boiled their failure down to local officials fighting against legislation that would preempt local planning authority. 
“I would say, cities very jealousy guard their ability to restrict the supply of housing,” Fillmore said, “and that is a challenge for people who want to build homes, for people who want to buy  homes, for people like us who are really interested in increasing the supply of housing.” 
Fillmore added that some cities, like his hometown of South Jordan, and Salt Lake City are “doing really great work” to increase affordable housing stock, but he said generally, “it’s been a little bit frustrating this year that really meaningful policies that (would) make a big difference in increasing the supply of (starter) homes just not have been able to move because of the roadblocks created by local governments.” 
Utah lawmakers say no to ‘preemption,’ halt 2 housing bills aimed at allowing smaller homes

The Utah League of Cities and Towns — which represents Utah’s local governments on Capital Hill — successfully warded off or watered down numerous bills this session that could have usurped local powers in one way or another. 
Cameron Diehl, executive director of the League, continually emphasized “partnership, not preemption.” And that message resonated with a majority of lawmakers. 
“While we certainly had disagreements on bills, we were always able to come back to those principles, and we felt like the final outcomes on most bills reflected more of a spirit of partnership,” Diehl said. 
In response to brewing frustrations showing at least some lawmakers have an appetite to take more aggressive actions, Diehl said when taken holistically, legislators’ efforts in recent years have amounted to significant progress on the issue — it just takes time to see the results. 
“Over the last few years we have passed a lot of important legislation in the spirit of partnership that we are actively implementing,” Diehl said, pointing to legislation passed in 2022 that required some cities to develop “station area plans” with housing projects oriented around transit hubs. 
“That is now starting to bear fruit, with a lot of housing units planned for near transit that otherwise may not have existed,” Diehl said. 
Diehl added that the League’s members — city officials — are, like lawmakers, concerned about the housing crisis.

“But keep in mind that a lot of the causes of the housing crisis are outside of what the government can control,” he said. “We can’t control interest rates, can’t control inflation, can’t control tariffs, can’t control material costs, can’t control the labor shortage, and the cost of infrastructure has exploded in recent years.”
What local governments are responsible for, he said, are the “infrastructure and services that make communities desirable and livable,” and “that’s why, to us, it comes back to partnership, not preemption.” 
 “We’ve done some big things,” Diehl said. “We’ve just done it from the spirit of partnership.” 
While the slate of legislation this year was technical and wonky in nature, Diehl said it’ll still have an impact that will help streamline planning processes, create consistency for both cities and developers and, in the end, help increase the number of homes. 
“All the bills this session were focused to some degree on affordability, ownership, sustainable infrastructure, efficient land use processes and quality of life,” he said. “So I think long term, we will see benefits from these bills, improving housing affordability, particularly for owner-occupied housing.”



What did the 2025 Utah Legislature do for housing?
Here’s a high-level summary of some of the most notable bills approved by the 2025 Utah Legislature: 

HB360: Allows flexibility to use some of the $300 million set aside under last year’s HB572, which created a program for low-interest loans to developers who agree to build owner-occupied projects with a mix of “attainable” housing units, for the use of a pilot program in older cities like Ogden or Salt Lake City to buy existing rental homes in order to convert them to owner-occupied homes. The aim is to “reinvigorate our starter condo market in Utah,” said Steve Waldrip, the governor’s senior housing adviser. 
HB37: Requires state officials to develop a “state housing plan” by Dec. 31, 2025, that must “prioritize collaboration over preemption” across private and public sectors. It also creates a “density bonus” option for cities as part of their required moderate income housing plans, encouraging them to consider including an area that allows at least six units to the acre. The “density bonus” would allow home builders who build smaller or more affordable homes the ability to build more homes in a project area than current zoning allows. It also allows higher density projects if developers agree to require some or all of the homes to be owner-occupied. 
SB181: A piece of legislation crafted by the Utah Commission on Housing Affordability focused on clarifying and easing parking requirements. Importantly, the bill defines for the first time in state code what a residential parking stall is to create consistency for both cities and home builders. It also allows that when developers commit to building a deed-restricted, owner-occupied, affordable single-family home, cities cannot require the developer to build a garage. The end result is a bill that does not ban cities from requiring garages, but has a provision to encourage developers to build more affordable homes in order to avoid garage requirements. 
HB368: A technical bill to create consistency and clarify state law around land use. Among the most notable changes is a provision creating an expedited review process for “identical floor plans.” The goal of that provision is to help lower costs and provide an incentive for developers to use the more streamlined process for identical floor plans to develop more starter homes. The bill also creates what Diehl called “infrastructure assurances.” It helps more quickly free up money developers invest in infrastructure — like roads or water lines. For example, instead of waiting until the end of the project to free up the funds, cities now must return the developer’s assurances “system by system,” like when a sewer system is completed. The goal is to create more flexibility for developers to reinvest their dollars in other projects while still allowing cities to ensure infrastructure projects meet their standards. 
HB256: Allows cities, under certain guardrails, to regulate short-term rentals like Airbnbs or VRBOs. 




‘Hard discussions’ coming as statewide housing plan takes shape
Steve Waldrip, the governor’s senior housing adviser, acknowledged to Utah News Dispatch in a post-session interview that 2025 was sort of a “non-sexy” session when it came to housing bills. 
There were no big “signature policy pushes,” he said, though he added “part of that was intentional.” 
That’s because state leaders are in the process of developing and implementing a statewide housing plan, meant to set goals and metrics in order to accomplish Cox’s ambitious goal to facilitate the creation of 35,000 new starter homes by the end of 2028, as well as close a “gap” of homes the state is forecasted to have over the next decade. 
The state, according to an executive summary for the first phase of the plan, is projected to need 274,000 additional homes to meet demand over the next 10 years. However, the market is currently on pace to produce only 220,000 in that time frame.

While the 2025 session produced some wonky housing bills, Waldrip said they’re still “really important” to create consistency for housing developers seeking approval for projects in varying cities. 
Waldrip also specifically pointed to HB360, which allows state funds to finance affordable “starter condos.” 
“That one will probably make the biggest difference long term,” he said. 
However, Waldrip said it will take time — likely years — for those new policies to result in actual homes.
“Housing is a slow burn issue,” he said. “We say, ‘OK, here’s a new tool, developers. And it takes them six months to digest it.” 
While lawmakers ultimately didn’t pass legislation that preempted cities, an appetite for that may be growing among some legislators. 
“Yeah, definitely,” Waldrip acknowledged. “There’s frustration in different corners.” 
There’s a hard reality that state and local leaders need to confront, he said. Local leaders often face “political blowback if they approve, for instance, any additional density. That’s just a reality in our structure.” 
Utah lawmakers shut down housing bill meant to give Utahns an edge over corporate homebuyers

“So that’s probably where the frustration comes to the forefront the most, that even the best actors feel like their hands are tied because their residents and their voters are very set against certain outcomes,” he said. “And that just creates a tension that is really difficult for state lawmakers who are looking at this issue from a state standpoint … saying this is our job to address this.” 
As state leaders work to develop the state housing plan, Waldrip said the goal is to “push those issues to the forefront.” He hopes that as all stakeholders (cities, counties, builders, lawmakers, and others) come to agree on shared goals, that the debate isn’t so focused on state versus cities, but rather what needs to be done to increase the number of homes in Utah. 
“That will drive some of the discussion so that it’s not frustrated lawmakers, you know, punching the League in the mouth and seeing if they win versus, ‘Hey, everybody recognizes that we need more starter homes,’” Waldrip said, as well as small-lot subdivisions and streamlined processes. “By setting that up as the lead-in to the rest of the discussion, you can’t ignore the fact that’s going to require some really, really hard things to have to happen.” 
So Waldrip said as state leaders draft the housing plan, they’ll be working to put together policy recommendations for lawmakers to consider ahead of the 2026 session that’s slated to begin in January. 
That debate didn’t happen during this year’s session to allow time during the interim “so we could really tee up those hard discussions out of the legislative session, where it’s not quite so heated, there’s not the time crunch, we can take some time to be deliberative about how we approach these issues,” Waldrip said. 
It remains to be seen what the statewide housing plan will entail, but that’s likely what could set off or at least preface some of the more significant housing policy changes next year or following years. 
Will Beehive Development Agency help implement statewide housing goals?
Waldrip was among those speaking in favor of the controversial bill to create the Beehive Development Agency as a tool to help Utah fix its housing crisis by creating a “consolidated spot for all of our housing policy to be decided as a state.” 
Though lawmakers abandoned that bill this year amid controversy that it would create too powerful of an agency, they told reporters they expect to continue to work on the bill and bring it back for consideration later on. 
Controversial bill to create powerful new state agency is dead (for now), senator says

Waldrip told Utah News Dispatch that something like Beehive Development Agency could be “a component” to implement a statewide housing plan, though he added “I don’t know that it’s necessary for success.”
“But it would be helpful to have the ability to manage regional projects like we manage other regionally significant economic development projects,” Waldrip said. 
Beehive Development Agency, he said, was “part of this larger discussion” of planning for “regionally significant projects” in order to meet the state’s need of 274,000 homes in the next 10 years. 
“Given that, what do we need to do to make that happen?” he said. “From a housing standpoint, do we have a structure in place that we can make good decisions, or do we have a structure that’s encouraging poor decisions?”
Additionally, something like the Beehive Development Agency could help address “frustration” from Utahns over a rapidly growing state that’s attracting plenty of jobs, but not factoring in housing needs as part of economic development strategies. 
“So putting housing into economic development and having it be a critical component of those economic development discussions, I don’t know anybody that would disagree with that as the policy goal,” he said. 
Waldrip said “unfortunately that got wrapped up” with controversy over the rest of the bill, but he added “that’s a critical thing that we have to address going forward.”

SB 247, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, prohibits protesters from using noise amplifiers, being too close to the residence of the subject of the protest 30 minutes after sunset and 30 minutes before sunrise, and from blocking roads for the protest. 
Orr filed similar legislation in the previous two legislative sessions. In 2023, the bill passed the Senate but did not receive a vote in the House. In 2024, it was indefinitely postponed in a Senate committee.

“The first version was filed in response to the Justice (Brett) Kavanaugh hearings where people went to his house and were demonstrating outside at all hours of the night,” Orr said. “I thought how intimidating would that be whether you’re an elected person or unelected it doesn’t matter.”
The Senate County and Municipal Government Committee heard from one critic of the legislation during a public hearing. Camille Bennett, executive director of Project Say Something, an advocacy group for change focusing on Black history and anti-racism training, said the legislation was too vague and unconstitutional.
“SB 247 is not only a bad bill but an assault on the First Amendment rights and voices of marginalized Alabamians,” Bennett said.
Bennett said peaceful protests will always be near a residence in rural Alabama. 
“Alabama is the heart of the Civil Rights Movement. Black folk in Alabama understand the necessity of exercising our First Amendment rights as a pathway to freedom and navigation through white supremacist systems,” Bennett said. “We have apartments and residential housing within an earshot of any of our protests including parks and our local courthouse.”
Sen. Merika Coleman, D-Pleasant Grove, said that is especially true in cities like Birmingham that have lofts and apartments downtown.
“There’s so many lofts downtown so where would you actually go to have even a peaceful protest in downtown Birmingham and not be near a residence,” Coleman said.
Orr rebutted saying people can still  protest in public parks and other areas.
“There’s plenty of places to make your sentiments known,” Orr said.
Coleman said the legislation could violate the First Amendment and warned against restricting the right to protest on the state level.
“I just don’t want us, especially right now, especially nationally when some people feel as if our First Amendment rights are being infringed upon, just being able to say what we believe,” she said. “I don’t know if we should be doing that on a state level as well, especially in Alabama.”
Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, said the bill was too vague and suggested an amendment to set a limit on noise levels. The bill currently says that local law enforcement can deem what is too loud.
“It’s not specific so you allow the local governments to make that determination,” Coleman-Madison said.
The bill was approved 5-2. Coleman and Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Birmingham, voted against the approval, and Coleman-Madison abstained. It will now be considered by the full Senate.

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)Clark County’s decade-long practice of adjusting gas tax for inflation should continue for another decade before being subject to reapproval by voters, a broad coalition believes.
Fuel revenue indexing — often referred to as FRI — adjusts the county’s portion of fuel tax to inflation and has been a major source of funding for roadway projects in Southern Nevada since going into effect in 2014. FRI is currently scheduled to sunset at the end of 2026 unless voters approve an extension next year.
RTC foresees future revenue shortfall if gas tax indexing allowed to expire

For years, the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC) has warned that ending fuel revenue indexing will decrease roadway funding by two thirds — from $300 million to $100 million annually. A funding shortage that severe would result in canceled projects and the inability to keep up with roadway maintenance, according to RTC CEO M.J. Maynard-Carey.
RTC’s solution to the problem is Assembly Bill 530, which would allow the Clark County Commission, by a two-thirds vote, to extend FRI an additional decade beyond its current sunset date. Continuation beyond 2036 would require voter approval.
 
Gas Tax in Clark County

Federal: 0.184
State: 0.23
County: 0.10
FRI: 0.23
Other: 0.014

TOTAL: $0.758 per gallon, as of April 1


The Nevada State Legislature and then-Gov. Brian Sandoval first gave Clark County the authorization to use fuel revenue indexing in 2013. The Clark County Commission approved FRI for 2014 through 2016. In November 2016, Clark County voters extended FRI through 2026. That ballot measure passed with nearly 60% support.
RTC currently receives 24.6 cents of the total 75.8 cents per gallon fuel tax, according to Maynard-Carey. 
Warren Hardy, chair of the RTC’s Transportation Resource Advocacy Committee (TRAC), said the committee has “looked at every aspect” of funding over several years and determined that “FRI is the cornerstone.”
“If we are not able to extend FRI, we can fold our tent and go home on a whole bunch of issues related to transportation in Southern Nevada,” he said. “I’ve said it’s existential, and I stand by that.”
TRAC Vice Chair Danny Thompson called AB530 “the most important bill to Southern Nevada this session.”
More than $1 billion has been generated through FRI since 2014, according to Maynard-Carey. The money has supported 702 projects — 501 completed, 105 in construction, and 96 in the design phase.
The loss of FRI would be compounded by increases in fuel efficiency and the adoption of electric vehicles, which already result in fewer taxable gallons of fuel being sold, added Maynard-Carey.
More than 30 groups threw their support behind the bill during its hearing Thursday in the Assembly Committee on Growth & Infrastructure. Among them: Clark County and its five cities, multiple skilled trades unions, multiple building and construction industry groups, two universities (UNLV and Nevada State), two chambers of commerce (Urban and Vegas), Southwest Gas, and the Nevada Resort Association.
“Fuel tax is the best, most efficient way to collect those dollars that pay for our roads,” said Paul Enos, a lobbyist for the Nevada Trucking Association, which supports the bill. 
Just five groups opposed AB530, mostly on the grounds that the county commission should not be able to circumvent voters and that taxes are already too high.
“This takes away the right of the people,” said Janine Hansen of Nevada Families for Freedom and the Independent American Party. “They were promised 10 years ago they would be able to vote on this. … Are we afraid of a vote by the people? Do we believe in democracy?”
That same criticism was lobbed against a 2023 FRI bill that passed the Legislature with bipartisan support only to be vetoed by Gov. Joe Lombardo. That bill would have allowed the Clark County Commission to extend FRI indefinitely without a direct vote of the people.
(That bill would have aligned Clark with Washoe County, which also indexes their fuel tax to inflation but has no sunset clause. Nevada’s other counties do not index their fuel tax.)
“The arguments in favor of fuel revenue indexing are compelling, but a decision on this issue, which impacts household budgets every day, is most appropriately rendered by the voters,” Lombardo wrote in his 2023 veto message.
Democratic Assemblymember Howard Watts, a sponsor of both FRI bills, said AB530’s requirement to put the issue in front of Clark County voters in 2036 is meant to address such criticism.
“A final vote of the people has been maintained,” he said. “We do respect the will of the people while also wanting to make sure that we can continue to provide this critical source of revenue for transportation infrastructure in our state.”

(Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)There are two sorts of conservatism.
There’s the kind espoused by the 18th-century British politician Edmund Burke. It emphasizes restraint; reverence for tradition and maintaining political and social order through mutual duty. Laws must prevent mob rule at the bottom and tyranny at the top. Change is acceptable but not revolution. One should work with the world as it is, inside a moral framework aware of human shortcomings.
“The effect of liberty on individuals is that they may do what they please; we ought to see what it will please them to do before we risk congratulations that may soon become complaints,” Burke wrote.
You may not agree with this approach. But it’s one that can be defended in good faith.
And yet it’s not the way self-styled American conservatives operate.
They behave more like John Randolph of Roanoke, an antebellum Virginia congressman with a high-pitched voice and a tendency to violence.
Randolph felt no duty to anyone outside his peer group. As for his thoughts on restraint, the congressman added the phrase “Do What You Feel” to his family’s coat of arms.
He only revered the power he and other slaveholders held over Black men and women. Randolph’s single political principle was full control of the government by elites (i.e. slaveholders) without popular will or Washington D.C. getting in the way.
“I am an aristocrat,” he reportedly said. “I love liberty; I hate equality.”
These two threads — respectful restraint vs. elite impunity — run through Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall’s attempt to prosecute Alabamians helping people get out-of-state abortions.
Back in 2022, Marshall told a conservative talk show host that under Alabama’s abortion ban, providing that help was “potentially criminally actionable for us.” He doubled down on this argument in a court filing the following year.
“An elective abortion performed in Alabama would be a criminal offense; thus, a conspiracy formed in the State to have that same act performed outside the State is illegal,” the brief said.
This is ludicrous. Performing an abortion in Alabama is a felony. So is selling marijuana for recreational use. By Marshall’s logic, it would be “criminally actionable” for me to give you gas money to drive to Colorado, where you can legally smoke cannabis for fun.
Reproductive health care providers sued Marshall in 2023. Last week, U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson sided with them.
Like a responsible jurist, he explained his decision through precedent and established rights.
To take one part: Thompson noted that American law has always recognized a right to travel to another state and do anything lawful there. He cited the privileges and immunities clause in Article IV of the U.S. Constitution. And the earlier Articles of Confederation. And the still earlier Magna Carta, which recognized the right of merchants to travel. He also cited U.S. Supreme Court cases going back to the 19th century saying Alabama can’t harass you for what you do within the laws outside Alabama.
“There is no end-run around the right to travel that would allow states to burden travel selectively and in a patchwork fashion based on whether they approve or disapprove of lawful conduct that their residents wish to engage in outside their borders,” Thompson wrote.
Put the arguments side-by-side. One claims imperial power over state residents. The other invokes the past to defend individual rights.
Then ask yourself: who is the conservative here?
There’s the political frame, of course. Marshall is a Republican who praises President Donald Trump, bullies transgender kids and ignores public safety in Alabama to fight culture wars in other states.
Thompson is a federal judge who has upheld abortion rights; ordered Roy Moore to remove the Ten Commandments from the Helfin-Torbert Judicial Building in 2003 and directed the state to provide adequate mental health care in prisons.
But then look at their conduct.
Thompson is defending an idea of individual freedom, rooted in centuries of jurisprudence, that rejects state coercion.
Marshall fights for a Randolph-like vision of government where wealthy white men have the liberty to indulge their whims and hurt others if it advances their interests. It respects boundaries so long as they restrain women and minorities. And one that crosses state borders to punish those who break free.
You can see Marshall espousing this elsewhere. He boasts of joining legal briefs defending Trump’s attempt to deport Venezuelans without due process or evidence of a crime. He has been gleeful about an unelected billionaire throwing Alabamians out of work for the crime of working for the federal government.
It’s a dangerous, revolutionary attempt to create a world where a white man and his sycophants can act without restraint from Congress, the judiciary or broad political consensus.
And it hauls down the rule of law, replacing it with a giant crest that says “Do What You Feel.”
I know who the conservative is here. And it’s not the attorney general claiming to be one.

HB 445, sponsored by Rep. Andy Whitt, R-Harvest, would require the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) Board to license and regulate manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers of hemp products.
“We are coming for the bad actors that put profit and the safety of our children. Convenience stores need to stick to selling gas and sodas, and they are not our local pharmacy stores. We’re going to regulate these products,” said Whitt during a meeting of the House Health committee, while describing the current market as “unregulated, unchecked and dangerous.”

The bill includes a ban on sales to anyone under 21; restricts retail locations to existing liquor stores or standalone shops inaccessible to minors, and mandates product testing and labeling. It would also limit THC content to five milligrams per serving for edibles and beverages and impose an excise tax.
A similar bill sponsored by Sen. Tim Melson, R-Florence, failed in the Senate Health Care Committee in late March. While both bills would regulate hemp products through the ABC board and ban sales to minors, Whitt’s bill imposes higher penalties for underage sales. The Senate version also differentiated between beverages and other consumable products, while Whitt’s bill defines all products as “consumable hemp products.”

Whitt said the bill aimed to place “guardrails” on the industry, pointing to concerns about public health and youth safety. During his presentation to the committee, Whitt displayed several products purchased locally, including gummies and drinks, which he claimed were equal to 80-proof vodka, arguing they are marketed attractively, sometimes toward children.
“This is bad stuff, and it’s being sold to our kids,” he stated.
Carmelo Parasiliti, founder and CEO of Green Acres Organic Pharms in Florence and an opponent of the legislation, said that the “data simply does not support the hysteria.” Parasiliti said that the Alabama Poison Information Center reported 235 cases related to Delta-8 THC, a form of cannabinoid, in 2023 and that these cases represent just 0.018% of Alabama residents under 21.
“Most importantly, no deaths have occurred. Cannabinoids like Delta-8, CBD, and CBG are nonlethal, nonaddictive, and federally legal,” Parasiliti said.
Support for the bill came from law enforcement. Lt. Chuck Bradford of the Trussville Police Department claimed there is a rise in overdoses linked to vape store products. He also claimed that testing of purchased products showed THC levels far exceeding the legal hemp limit of 0.3%, but did not point to data.
“Basically, we’re allowing people to sell marijuana,” he said.
Molly Cole, a lobbyist for the Alabama Hemp and Vape Association, argued against what she termed “rush legislation,” claiming it could “eliminate over 10,000 jobs in Alabama.” She asked for a study commission to develop an “evidence-based policy.”
“Instead of rushing HB 445, I urge you to support a study commission. Bring together legislators, regulatory regulators, industry leaders and public health experts to craft long-term, evidence-based policy. Other states have done this successfully. Now Alabama can too,” Cole said.
Becky Gerritson from Eagle Forum of Alabama, a conservative lobbying group, said she supported the bill’s intent but argued it didn’t go far enough, stating it effectively legalizes recreational marijuana by allowing psychoactive cannabinoids. “These products need to be banned,” she urged.
The committee did not take a vote after the public hearing.

While most of us read Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale as a grim dystopian novel, the Project 2025 crowd, and all those they embolden, have seen it as more of a how-to guide for eradicating reproductive rights.
For anyone who hasn’t read the book, or watched the Hulu show (set to come back for its final season this month), it involves a newly minted fascist country called Gilead that has taken over the bulk of what was the United States following a violent coup. A centerpiece of their society are handmaids, women who are forced to bear the nation’s children, conceived through a perverse ritual of rape and slave labor.
Still, The Handmaid’s Tale is fiction. Or is it?
In season two of the show, main character Offred fears being banished to a toxic waste dump in the colonies after she has a miscarriage. This serves as a kind of death sentence. It seems like a harsh punishment for something that occurs naturally—miscarriages happen.
Here’s where reality jumps into the frame. A Georgia woman was arrested for having a miscarriage in March. Selena Maria Chandler-Scott, 24, was found unconscious on her bathroom floor. She had miscarried at 19 weeks. By all accounts it was naturally occurring. Chandler-Scott was released after weeks in jail on Friday, after public pressure. Meanwhile, legislators in Georgia are considering The Prenatal Equal Protection Act (HB 441), which would call abortion patients murderers and could give them the death penalty.
But this is just one case in one state, right? Maybe you live in a state with abortion access codified in state or local laws. Even then you might not be safe.
Let’s look at Nevada. When Roe v Wade was overturned in 2022, abortion laws reverted back to the states. Fortunately, Nevada has a law allowing abortion. In fact, we are part-way through the process of codifying abortion access into the state constitution, which requires two votes by the people. The first was last year and the second is set for 2026.
At the Nevada Legislature, there are bills that would offer provider address privacy protection (AB 235), prescribing doctor name anonymization on medical packaging (AB 411), and repealing an existing law that criminalizes medication abortion (SB 139). 
So far so good, but even so-called safe states have pitfalls. A 1985 state law requiring parental notification for minors seeking abortion is set to go into effect on April 30. The law had been blocked by a federal court for decades but has sprung back to life like so many of its kind around the country following the end of Roe. 
Conservatives like to say abortion is a state’s rights issue, which is what has essentially happened with the overturning of Roe v Wade. Now it seems that’s not enough. The states that have harsher laws want everyone to play by their rules whether you live there or not. 
Take the case of the New York doctor indicted by a Louisiana grand jury for prescribing mail-order abortion medication. While New York has abortion access as well as laws allowing doctors to prescribe abortion medication by mail, the state of Louisiana is continuing to push for felony charges under their own state laws, which criminalize abortion-inducing medication.
It shouldn’t be a trick of the map for people to have reproductive rights. A line drawn here or there becomes the difference between personal liberty or not. And the new wave of anti-abortion bills around the country are signaling that even lines on maps won’t matter much in the future.
Meanwhile the Texas Legislature is considering multiple bills that would impact reproductive rights. As Jessica Valenti reported on her Abortion, Every Day Substack last week, Texas SB 31 seeks to “prosecute abortion funds, helpers, and maybe even patients” while Texas SB 2880 would deputize ordinary citizens to report anything online that shares abortion information. The latter would mean that websites originating anywhere in America could face charges in Texas.
The point of all this seems pretty clear: No state is safe. Not when bounty hunters and attorneys can pursue you across state lines. And no person is safe, even when they are just trying to survive a natural medical event. 
In Trump’s America, anyone with a uterus isn’t just damned if you do, they’re damned period. 
The smart thing to do is to pushback with all our might. In Atwood’s book, Gilead was allowed to take shape because citizens were too shocked by the brute force of the new regime. We must take this as a warning for our very real times.
In our case, we have some tools to resist. States with existing reproductive rights and protections can beef them up by closing loopholes and addressing the modern era. If abortion medication is legal in your state, make sure other jurisdictions can’t prosecute on technicalities like mail-orders or use of the internet. If abortion rights are in your laws, codify them in your state constitutions.
Don’t just focus on your own backyard either, because it’s clear that anti-abortion networks are looking at ways to creep into national bans and regulations by way of shady state bills. Keep the pressure on elected officials. Write op-eds. Most of all, be vigilant.

This story was originally pubished in The 19th.
President Donald Trump issued a proclamation recognizing National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month — one that differs from similar recognitions issued in his first term both because of its focus and because Trump himself was found liable for sexual abuse in 2023.
The proclamation, issued Thursday evening, is narrowly focused on blaming “a dramatic increase of sexual violence in our neighborhoods and communities” on “the invasion of illegal aliens at our southern border,” pointing a finger at the Biden administration’s immigration policies.
It’s a sharp turn from the statements Trump published in his first term, which largely highlighted the need for more support for survivors and accountability for perpetrators.
The statement erroneously claims that assaults by undocumented immigrants are one of the leading causes of sexual violence in recent years. In reality, most victims of sexual assault are harmed by someone they know. Eight out of 10 rapes are committed by someone known to the victim, according to data from the Department of Justice.
Omny Miranda Martone, founder and CEO of the nonprofit Sexual Violence Prevention Association, wrote over text message that this is a classic case of what the organization calls SORVO — Systemic Oppression, Reverse Victim and Offender. “President Trump wants to systemically oppress immigrants, so he accuses them of committing high rates of sexual violence,” they wrote. “The reality is, immigrants face higher rates of sexual violence than natural born citizens and are less likely to perpetuate crime.”
While research from the federal government has found immigrants commit less crime than U.S.-born people, Trump and his allies have often drawn attention to the tragic cases of American women and girls killed by undocumented immigrants. In his proclamation, Trump cites the deaths of Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray and Rachel Morin, all of whom were killed in the past two years. An undocumented immigrant man in November was found guilty of Riley’s murder. Undocumented immigrants have been charged in Nungaray’s and Morin’s deaths; the trial in Morin’s case began this week. Riley’s murder was an anti-immigrant flashpoint for Republicans, and Trump signed legislation drafted in her honor that now allows for immigrants to be deported for nonviolent crimes. The mothers of Riley and Nungaray were also special guests at Trump’s joint address to Congress in March.
In May of 2023, Trump was found liable in federal court for sexually abusing the writer E. Jean Carroll in 1996 and defaming her afterward. He was originally ordered to pay $5 million in damages, but that amount increased by an eye-popping $83 million after Trump was found liable for defaming Carroll again after the initial verdict.
In addition to Carroll, a number of women have accused the president of sexual misconduct. Many in Trump’s inner circle, including multiple people confirmed to the Cabinet, have also been accused of sexual misconduct.
“President Trump doesn’t care about women or sexual violence survivors,” Martone wrote. “He simply uses his faux defense of women to justify oppressing minorities, particularly immigrants and trans people.”

Gaines/Maryland Matters)Legislators enter the final day of the 2025 General Assembly session Monday with no budget, no energy reform and no bill to alter the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, the state’s sweeping education reform plan. And no particular worries.
While lawmakers will have hundreds of bills to work through today, legislative leaders have more or less agreed on most of the big items. It will just be a matter of logistics to keep desired bills on track, to beat back opposition from lawmakers looking to use the midnight deadline to their advantage, and to navigate the unexpected, last-minute crises that invariably pop up.
House Majority Leader David Moon (D-Montgomery) said that with agreements in hand on most of the “big-ticket controversial items,” such as the budget and a three-bill energy package, he expects Monday to be relatively smooth, even if there are still some official actions needed to pass those bills.
Moon noted that there’s “always something” that could throw a wrench into the last day’s proceedings, but he said that the General Assembly worked hard to ensure to “get controversial bills done before Sine Die.”
One potential point of contention is legislation related to the state’s undocumented immigrant population. Several bills were advanced to protect migrant communities in response to the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented residents, but the House and Senate appear to be at odds over a proposal to eliminate so-called 287(g) agreements between local law enforcement agencies and federal officials with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.
House Bill 1222, sponsored by Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), would prohibit the agreements that let ICE delegate some federal enforcement authorities to local officers, including the authority to arrest and check a person’s immigration status through a federal database. But her bill is currently bottled up in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, which held a hearing on it just last week.
House, Senate quickly come to agreement on spending and tax plan

Supporters say residents in immigrant communities are afraid to go outside and do daily routines because of the federal crackdown. Advocates said they will be pressing hard for the bill Monday.
“We’re going to be present, and we’re going to be putting the pressure on to make sure that they [lawmakers] pass the entire immigrant justice package,” said Cathryn Jackson, public policy director with the immigrant rights group CASA.
She pointed to the erroneous detention and deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a CASA member from Prince George’s County, to a prison in El Salvador recently. A federal judge ordered Friday that the administration return him to the U.S., but so far the government has refused to comply.
“It would be deep disservice for the entire immigrant community in Maryland, and all Americans, if the Senate doesn’t do what they need to do,” Jackson said.
But a lot has to be done before those bills can happen.
Even though deals have been reached on the “bigger-stress, higher-ticket items,” which should make for a less-intense Sine Die than normal, Del. Brian Crosby (D-St. Mary’s) expects the day will still be unavoidably busy, in part because of the procedural items left on the docket, Crosby said.
“It’s not just pass a bill in both chambers,” he said. “Then you’ve got the yeas and nays, and the concurrences. So you know, it will be busy.”
And some obstacles may be intentional, as lawmakers work to churn out the hundreds of remaining bills that need final approval before time runs out Monday. Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) said that the hard midnight deadline can work to the minority party’s advantage and gives Republicans another chance to debate some of the issues.
“Sine Die is a little different. Republicans have a little more influence because we’re running out the clock,” he said Saturday.
He said that in previous years, Republicans have scored “minor victories” by stalling bills long enough that they blow past the midnight deadline, which kills the bills for the session.
Energy bills speeding toward passage in session’s final days

Some bills have already run the gantlet. Already this session, legislators passed a bill to create a Reparations Commission to study inequality among African descendants, making Maryland one of the few states in the nation to do so. Another successful bill removes a criminal penalty for intentionally transferring HIV to another person, eliminating what some call an “antiquated” and “discriminatory” law after years of failed attempts going back to 2013.
Ann T. Ciekot, partner with Public Policy Partners of Annapolis, said most of the work for her clients has been decided. While she still plans to pay “close attention” to what’s going on Monday in Annapolis, Ciekot said the next day will be a major focus.
“I am much more concerned about actions at the federal level and how they are going to impact Marylanders and my clients and the people that my clients work with,” said Ciekot, who highlighted behavioral health care and other health services.
She specifically mentioned the federal Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department Health and Human Services, which recently announced thousands of layoffs and the shuttering of some offices.
Sen. Joanne C. Benson (D-Prince George’s) called Monday “bittersweet” and said she, too, is looking ahead.
“We do need a break because we have been working very, very hard down here trying to maintain and keep the money in the budget to save some of the programs we have committed ourselves to,” Benson said after the Senate adjourned from a second session Saturday afternoon.
“I think that we’re going to have to come back before January because of what’s being projected and what we think is going to happen as it pertains to … Washington,” she said. “There’s still some uncertainty.”

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)With Republicans in control of Congress and the White House, Democrats are looking to make Virginia a firewall — and possibly a springboard — by retaking ground in the General Assembly. 
The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), the national party’s state-focused political arm, announced a seven-figure investment in Virginia’s 2025 elections. All 100 seats in the House of Delegates will be on the ballot, and the group has identified a slate of competitive districts where it plans to go all in. 
“All eyes are on Virginia in 2025,” DLCC Director Heather Williams said in a statement. “Opportunities to move policy and build power aren’t happening in Washington – they’re happening in the statehouses. State legislative races are the most immediate opportunity for Democrats to defend and build sustainable power, and Virginia will be the highest profile, most data-rich election of 2025.”
Though the Virginia Senate is not on the ballot this cycle, Democrats are also eyeing the lieutenant governor’s race as a key opportunity. With the party holding just a one-seat majority in the chamber, a Democratic lieutenant governor could play a pivotal role by casting tie-breaking votes to advance the party’s agenda. 
During his tenure, former Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax cast several tie-breaking votes in favor of Democratic priorities. In contrast, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears has often broken ties against Democratic legislation — most recently in a closely watched vote on contraception access. 
In that case, Democrats used a procedural maneuver to set up a tie by having one senator abstain and another vote no on a right-to-contraception bill. With a Republican absent that day, Earle-Sears was forced to cast the deciding vote — and voted against the measure. 
Democrats then quickly used a chamber rule that allows members who vote against a bill to request reconsideration. The bill was brought back for a second vote and passed with a Democratic majority. But forcing Earle-Sears to go on the record against the proposal was seen as a strategic move — a way to draw a clear contrast on reproductive rights between her and Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger ahead of this November’s election. 
Both parties are also preparing for competitive primaries this summer to determine their nominees for lieutenant governor.  
Although the DLCC’ focuses primarily on legislative races, its plan to support the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor underscores the office’s importance in shaping policy outcomes, especially when tie-breaking votes are needed. 
So far, the DLCC has announced it will support four Democratic candidates in battleground districts: Dels. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William; Josh Cole, D-Fredericksburg; Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, and Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach. Each won their last race by between 3 to 6 percentage points in their competitive districts. More DLCC endorsements are also expected after the June primaries.
Democrats also see opportunities to flip Republican-held seats. Two GOP delegates — Chis Obenshain, R-Montgomery, and Kim Taylor, R-Dinwiddie —  won in 2023 by razor-thin margins of 183 and 53 votes, respectively. Both will face rematches this year against their former Democratic opponents, Lily Franklin and Kimberly Pope Adams. 
In another closely watched race, Del. David Owen, R-Henrico, defeated Democrat Susanna Gibson by just over 700 votes in 2023. His 57th District, which includes parts of increasingly blue Henrico County and more conservative Goochland County, is expected to be competitive again this year. Owen likely will face either Andrew Schear or May Nivar, who are vying for the Democratic nomination.  
While the DLCC is focusing heavily on Virginia this year, it is also part of the organization’s broader 2025-2026 Target Map of battleground states. Alongside Virginia, states like North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona are  expected to receive investments, with the aim of helping Democrats flip legislatures or build stronger democratic bases. 
Virginia remains one of the DLCC’s most closely-watched and supported states this cycle, as the group looks to maintain momentum and build power at the state level.

So sponge-like and blank-brained are Our Youth, that if they read about gays or Latinos or Black people or liberals, they’ll get Ideas. 
And if they encounter sex in a book, well, they’ll instantly go out and have sex.
At least, that’s what the Florida Legislature thinks; therefore, said legislature is hell-bent on making sure no Florida student is ever again damaged by the seductive ways of language, even in books teachers and other elites call “classic.” 
SB 1692 says any text “depicting nudity, sexual conduct, or sexual excitement when it predominantly appeals to prurient, shameful, or morbid interest and is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole” will be verboten. 
No word on who gets to decide what “prurient, shameful or morbid interest” actually means. Some think Judy Blume’s “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret” is dirty because the main character gets her first period; some think a picture of Michelangelo’s “David” sculpture is filthy because you can, er, see the guy’s junk.
Claiming “artistic merit” won’t cut it any more.
If the likes of a preacher or two, a parent, or Moms for Liberty deem a book unwholesome, that book is gone.
Out of the library. Out of the classroom. 
The Moms and their fellow travellers don’t need to read the material. They’ve heard about it. On social media, Fox “News,” and other “reputable” sources.
Books are destroying America.
Anti-God: Pulitzer Prize-winner Barbara Kingsolver’s novel “The Poisonwood Bible” suggests missionaries in Africa damage Africans who are not sufficiently grateful to have Jesus foisted upon them.  
Anti-family: Anna Karenina cheats on her husband with a Russian count, then kills herself.
Gay-friendly: And Tango Makes Three is about a penguin chick being raised by two male penguins.  
This one could make children want to become homosexual. Or flightless birds. 
Smut: The heroine of “Their Eyes Were Watching God” by Orange County’s own Zora Neale Hurston likes sex way too much.  
All these books have been banned in various Florida school districts.
‘Things in their minds’
Sen. Stan McClain of Ocala, sponsor of SB1692, says, “The biggest thing we should be doing in life is trying make sure that our children are growing up with the most knowledge that they can have without a lot of other things in their minds.”
  Sen. Stan McClain via Florida House
Things in their minds such as, say, the workings of their own bodies. Tolerance of others. Questioning authority. 
This nonsense is presented as concern for children. It is the opposite.  
Florida’s government doesn’t care about kids.  
The state has — once again — refused to apply for a federal food program that helps people feed their families in the summer when school’s out.
When there’s no free or reduced lunch, many children may not get lunch at all. The state Department of Children and Families claims the $259 million in federal money is “welfare” (as if that’s a dirty word) and has some kind of Deep State strings attached.
Florida, they claim, can take care of its own.
Except Florida doesn’t take care of its own: One in five children in this state lacks access to nutritious food. 
In other words, kids go hungry here in one of the richest states in America.
While Sen. Lori Berman has introduced a bill to provide free breakfast and lunch to all schoolchildren, the Musk administration wants to cut aid, forcing states to fund SNAP benefits and other programs for the poor. 
The nonpartisan Florida Policy Institute calls this “catastrophic.”
There’s no guarantee the state will pick up the slack. A bill similar to Berman’s died last year.
Meanwhile, the House of Representatives has again voted to lower the age at which young people can buy rifles and shotguns from 21 to 18. 
OK, they’re not allowed to drink (because that could be dangerous), but they can vote and join the army, so why not let them play with instruments of death?
Nikolas Cruz was 19 when he shot up Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, killing 14 students and three staff members.
A hopeful sign: In a rare fit of good sense, efforts to allow college students to pack heat on campus has once again failed in the Legislature. 
Lest you get giddy, 1. That bill will almost certainly be back next year; and 2. There’s also a bill to repeal the state ban on bump stocks for the under-21s.
In case you don’t spend time hanging around with gun-crazed sociopaths, a bump stock is a device that allows a semiautomatic rifle to basically rock and back forth while you keep the trigger depressed, mimicking full auto fire. The Las Vegas concert shooter, the guy who murdered 60 people in 2017, used bump stocks. In response, Republicans, Democrats, the NRA, and President Donald Trump all supported a federal ban. It passed in Congress. 
Renditions, child labor
Then the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the ban, and now Sen. McClain (see above) thinks it’s unfair to stop anyone, no matter how angry, deranged, or obviously homicidal they might be, from what is almost a fully-automatic weapon.
Even teenagers! This is the Free State of Florida, where you are free to shoot at anything that scares or annoys you
But then, schoolchildren need a dose of real life, don’t they?
Venezuelans, Salvadorans, Mexicans, Haitians, and their ilk used to do Florida’s fruit-picking, toilet-cleaning, pool-scooping, house-framing, grass-mowing and floor-sweeping. 
Now the Trumpists are deporting those people to El Salvador and Guantánamo, sometimes for having tattoos, sometimes just for looking kind of not white. 
No matter: Florida needs to exploit our homegrown children to answer the call and get to laboring. 
Make ‘em earn their keep.
Gov. DeSantis huffs, “That’s how it used to be when I was growing up.”

Sen. Jay Collins of Hillsborough agrees. His bill would repeal required parental consent for a kid to work more than 30 hours a week when school is in session. If the kids are 16 or 17, they can work six days in a row. If you homeschool your 14-year-old, or if he or she learns online, that kid can work overnight shifts.
Water breaks and other such fripperies will no longer be required.
Collins calls it “workforce development” and says it will “empower minors to gain valuable skills and experience in a responsible and structured work environment.”
In olden times, kids would gain “valuable skills” picking oranges, chopping cotton, dragging a seine net at dawn and then again at midnight, logging the forest, and then going out to shoot a mess of squirrels for supper.
Happy days: Everybody went to church, men were men, women cooked and children contributed to capitalism. 
In Victorian England, the Royal Commission on Popular Education declared it is “far better that a child should go to work at the earliest age at which it can bear the physical exertion than that it should remain at school.” 
Children working in the factories or down the mines could be paid as little two pennies a day. 
The Florida Legislature probably thinks that’s fine. Indeed, there’s a bill allowing kids to “opt out” of the lawful minimum wage.
Because indentured servitude builds character.
Sen. Jonathan Martin of Fort Myers thinks interns, apprentices, and “pre-apprentices” should trade their right to make fair money for alleged transferrable skills, preparing them for future low-wage jobs.
Some employers can’t believe their luck: It’s almost as good as exploiting undocumented workers.
Doctors are terrified
And speaking of Victorians, those teenaged hussies going around flaunting themselves had better watch it. 
Sen. Erin Grall of Vero Beach  wants parents to police their children’s sexuality.  Which is frankly a bit weird.
If your 17-year-old needs treatment for a sexually transmitted disease, the parents have to OK it; if she wants birth control, the parents have to OK it. 
You can see the problem with this. If a 15-year-old is raped or molested by a family member or if her parents are abusive, emotionally or physically, she could end up with AIDS, human papilloma virus, or maybe syphilis.
Or pregnant. 
But Sen. Grall would rather your child have a child, possibly wrecking her life, than get an abortion.
Grall was the chief driver of Florida’s six-week abortion limit.
The only way a minor can terminate the pregnancy (which, at six weeks, she probably won’t even know about) is if she can prove rape or incest or if she’s at death’s door because of life-threatening complications.
Even then, her chances of survival won’t be good: Grall has a new bill which would allow people to file suit over the “wrongful death” of a fetus.
Doctors are terrified now: Florida already has a critical lack of OB-GYNs. This bill would make them even more reluctant to intervene in a medical emergency. The mother, the father, whoever, could get lawyered up and take them to court.
Under this bill, parents could claim mental anguish, loss of “services,” and “the decedent’s probable gross income after taxes.”  
The upshot is, by God, that fetus could have grown up to be a billionaire, and its parents have every right to cash in on what is a completely fictional scenario!
The courts will love that one.
‘For the children’
Grall, Martin, McClain and, of course, the governor, will say in pious voices they do everything “for the children.”
Everything’s always “for the children.”
But you can bet none of their children will work for sub-minimum wage 30 hours a week to help support the family while also trying to finish 9th grade.  
Their children will have time to play sports, play in the band, go on school trips, be a kid.
If one of their sons gets an STI, he’ll get great medical care.
If one of their daughters gets pregnant, she will, as the privileged classes say, be “taken care of” out of state.
Florida’s powerful will always protect their own children.
They don’t give a damn about yours.

Knightstown knows this situation all too well. The town, situated in the southern portion of Henry County, is 25 minutes away from the county seat, New Castle, which has their own EMS services and hospital. But sometimes the New Castle EMS may have other calls to answer, so it could be anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour for EMS to get to Knightstown. Volunteer Kevin Richey understands this; he has volunteered for many years as an EMT.
“We’re in a precarious situation down here, with how far we are from New Castle,” Richey said. “Lives can be saved or lost in that amount of time.”
In Indiana, rural EMS have been facing myriad issues, such as losing services, decreasing levels of volunteers and rising costs.
As rural communities are taking the brunt of the hit caused by the EMS and paramedic shortage in the state, communities, nonprofits and government officials are taking action to provide more coverage for rural areas.
Help from the community and the Statehouse
Since January 2023, Knightstown has not had immediate emergency medical service coverage.
Southwest District Ambulance Service had served the Knightstown area and southern Henry County since the mid-1990s, but it shuttered at the end of 2022 due to issues with funding and a lack of EMTs willing to volunteer. In the last four years of its existence, Southwest had lost $96,000.
In Indiana, a third of EMS departments across the state are volunteer; 20% are paid EMS operators, while 18% are a mix of paid and volunteer, according to data from the Indiana Department of Homeland Security published in 2024.
After Southwest ceased operations, Richey asked around the Knightstown community to see if there would be support to create a new nonprofit from scratch for providing EMS resources.
Southern Henry Ambulance Service was approved as a 501(c)3 nonprofit in early 2023, and started a fundraising effort across Knightstown and on GoFundMe to get the service off of the ground. The fundraising helped bring attention to the nonprofit, and it helped bring some funds to them. They purchased an ambulance from Letts Community Volunteer Fire and Rescue, and other volunteer services have chipped in to help the start-up. In December 2024, the Knightstown Town Council approved to lease out a barn in the town for Southern Henry Ambulance Service to use as their base of operations.

Besides government-supported types of EMS, other service providers have chipped in to fill the need with EMS support across the state. IDHS data shows that 9% of EMS providers are hospital-based and 6.2% are private.
Currently, Richey is in the process of writing grants to various organizations to help get some money that will allow them to start making runs. He said that once more funding comes through, there are service companies willing to offer their services at a discount.
Help has been coming from the state government in recent years to alleviate the financial stress of public safety. Kraig Kinney, state EMS director, said that his division got legislative funding for the first time in 2023, to the tune of $6.4 million a year. With that money the EMS division began offering grants for EMS services for equipment, training support and mobile integrated healthcare.
“Our idea was that it would help particularly the rural areas of the state, and help them get modern, innovative equipment,” Kinney said.
Because of the success of the grant programs these past few years, the EMS division of IDHS will continue to offer grants in the future. Kinney believes that there are misunderstandings with EMS funding. He says that people believe that billing covers the cost for operating that ambulance, however that is not the case, because there are many other expenses factored in as well, and that can cause competition for funding at the municipal level.
“EMS has an income source, but it is not a sufficient income source,” Kinney said.
In rural communities across Indiana, Richey believes that it is important that local communities chip in and help their areas have an adequate emergency response.
“You should have the same support, no matter if you are in New York City or Knightstown,” Richey said. “These areas get overlooked because we don’t have the voice that a larger community does. We need people to shout and get people’s attention that we need these services.”
Keeping afloat with taxes
Almost half of Fayette County’s residents live in rural areas. Exacerbating issues is the fact the county lost its only hospital, Fayette Regional Health in Connersville, in 2019. Eighteen of Indiana’s 92 counties do not have a hospital in their county, according to Indiana Department of Health data. This has put an additional strain on its existing EMS operations. Runs that used to take two to three minutes to make now take about 30 to 35 minutes.
“We have no surgery services here in the county,” Fayette County EMS chief Clint Hardin said. “We spend a lot more time taking patients to other facilities, either in Rushville or in Richmond.”
To combat the additional time needed to make runs, Hardin needed to have more staff available on call, and sometimes calls that the county EMS were taking would put them at a loss. Hardin says this is because Fayette County is an economically depressed county, and one where a sizable chunk of its residents are on either Medicare or Medicaid.

Fayette County EMS is funded half by Fayette County and half by the city of Connersville; in 2024, both the Connersville City Council and the Fayette County Council approved a 0.25% public safety tax on income to go toward providing more funds to the county’s various public safety services. Hardin said the funding from the tax allowed him to give his employees a $5,000 raise.
“There was about a decade or a decade and a half where no one got raises in this town,” Hardin said. “It was making us not an attractive place to work.”
Government funding makes up for the majority of EMS funding in the state. IDHS data found two-thirds of all EMS funding came from government funding, 24% came from health care funding and 8% came from other various funding sources. Over the past few years across the state, counties have begun to increase their public safety taxes; for example, last year in Henry County the local public safety tax increased from .25% to .42%.
With the potential implications of Senate Bill 1 — a measure to reduce property taxes — public safety services in rural counties are vulnerable. Hardin said that now more than ever, emergency departments are becoming the safety net of a community, especially in a county that does not have a hospital.
“What people kinda lose sight of is property taxes is the only tax that we pay that is 99% local,” he said. “That funds police, fire, EMS, your streets, your parks, your libraries, your schools. You get to see the benefit of your tax dollars.”

They work long hours and go above and beyond for their students, playing an essential role in strengthening our communities. To ensure Indiana remains a place where talented educators want to teach and stay, we must continue to invest in policies that strengthen the teaching profession and support the educators who shape our future workforce.
Senate Bill 146, authored by GOP Sen. Linda Rogers, would raise the minimum teacher salary to $45,000; require schools to allocate at least 65% of their state funding to teacher compensation; and provide at least 20 days of paid parental leave for full-time teachers — policies that ISTA has long championed. 

The average teacher salary in Indiana during the last school year was recorded at $60,557 — up from $58,531 the year prior —  according to the 2023-24 state teacher compensation report by the Indiana Education Employment Relations Board (IEERB). Before that, average annual salaries were $56,609 in 2021-2022 and $ 53,991 in 2020-21.
The lowest teacher salary reported was $40,000 — the current state-mandated minimum. The highest was $110,000. Teacher pay is ultimately set by local school districts.

These priorities, which Gov. Mike Braun and legislative leaders support, represent a significant step toward making the teaching profession more competitive and sustainable in our state. ISTA supports this legislation and appreciates the leadership of the governor and lawmakers in recognizing the importance of investing in teachers.
The lowest teacher salary reported was $40,000 — the current state-mandated minimum. The highest was $110,000. Teacher pay is ultimately set by local school districts.
Competitive salaries and benefits are essential to strengthening Indiana’s schools. Polling among Indiana educators shows that nearly two-thirds are dissatisfied with current conditions in the profession, and nearly one in four is considering leaving within the next two to three years. One of the top reasons? Low pay and increasing burnout. Retaining experienced educators and attracting new talent is critical to ensuring stability in our schools and improving student learning outcomes. Braun has made it clear that increasing teacher pay is a priority and now is the time for unified action.
Raising salaries and providing paid parental leave are policies that will help attract and retain talented educators, ensuring that Indiana students continue to receive the high-quality public education they deserve. Providing at least 20 days of paid parental leave is especially important, as it recognizes that teachers — like workers in other professions — shouldn’t have to choose between spending time growing their families and thriving in their careers.
SB146 reinforces the critical role that teachers play in student success by directing more resources toward teacher compensation. Research consistently shows that when teachers are well-supported, student achievement improves. Directing more education funding toward educators will strengthen classrooms, increase individualized student support and enhance long-term educational outcomes.
ISTA and its members appreciate efforts to improve pay and benefits for Indiana’s educators and look forward to continued collaboration with the governor and lawmakers. Investing in teacher pay, ensuring that a greater share of education funding supports educators and expanding paid parental leave will strengthen Indiana’s teaching profession. We encourage continued progress on SB146, recognizing its potential to make a meaningful impact on public education.

In their bipartisan capital budget plans released last week, the Senate budgets [&#8230;]","An apartment building construction site in Olympia, Washington in January 2025. (Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Over the next few weeks, lawmakers in Washington’s state House and Senate need to resolve significant differences on new taxes, education funding, furloughs for state employees and much, much more. 
But on money for the state’s Housing Trust Fund, the gap is small.
In their bipartisan capital budget plans released last week, the Senate budgets $600 million for Washington’s primary source of affordable housing funding. The House earmarked $598 million.
Both plans are substantial hikes over the current biennium, for which lawmakers sent over $527 million to the fund. That hefty sum helped earn 2023 the title “The Year of Housing” in the Washington Legislature. 
The bipartisan proposals are also more than the $536 million that Gov. Jay Inslee proposed in December. The only input Gov. Bob Ferguson’s office gave on the Senate’s capital budget was to stay close to Inslee’s funding on the trust fund.
Still, the Senate’s lead capital budget writer went beyond that baseline. 
“It’s been no surprise that I wanted housing,” said Yasmin Trudeau, D-Tacoma. “I’ve supported housing policy, I’ve supported supply, stabilization, I’ve supported anything related to housing. A lot of that is based on my own lived experience. So I know the need is acute.”
The Housing Trust Fund isn’t the only pot of money for homes in the capital budgets. The House version has nearly $724 million for housing, including the Housing Trust Fund dollars. The Senate figure is $770 million.
Much of that extra money pays for connecting utilities to affordable housing. The Senate budgets $65 million for this. The House has $100 million, including $10 million for the long-planned redevelopment of Fort Lawton in Seattle. 
The Senate plan also looks to put nearly $36 million toward developing more housing near transit. The House has $10 million dedicated to shelter and housing for youth.
Lawmakers are trying to tackle an estimated million-home shortfall over the next two decades as the state grows. And half of those added homes would need to be affordable to those making less than half of the median income, according to a state Department of Commerce report last year.
Washington is 230,000 affordable units shy of what it needs for those households. The state needs nearly 22,000 new units per year through 2044, but averaged just 7,000 from 2016 to 2023.
Meanwhile, the number of housing permits has declined the past two years, likely due to rising construction costs and higher interest rates. Affordability continues to be a major issue, as rents climb faster than incomes.
Advocates applauded the new proposed investment.
“Your investments to increase the supply of affordable homes across the state will significantly transform lives,” Michele Thomas, the director of policy and advocacy for the Washington Low Income Housing Alliance, told a Senate committee last week. 
Jesse Simpson, of the Housing Development Consortium, called the House’s proposal “bold and necessary steps to address our state’s deep shortage of affordable housing.”
Getting specific
Founded in 1986 to finance housing for low-income Washingtonians, the Housing Trust Fund has since invested $2 billion to help build over 58,000 units.
The funding mostly goes to the state Department of Commerce to dole out via competitive grants, like the roughly $100 million both chambers earmarked for permanent supportive housing, the more than $200 million for multifamily rental units and the $50 million to $55 million for housing for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Each proposal also has $50 million in the trust fund to preserve existing housing.
Most of the money goes toward grants for construction, but can also be used for rental subsidies and assistance on down payments for first-time homebuyers.
The House blueprint budgets $80 million for homeownership help, while the Senate sets aside $75 million.
Lawmakers continue to show their “commitment to affordable housing and affordable homeownership, and move us closer to our goal of 20% of the Housing Trust Fund being dedicated to affordable homeownership,” said Ryan Donohue, the chief advocacy officer for Habitat for Humanity Seattle-King & Kittitas Counties.
The budgets also include money tied to specific projects. In the House, those include $4.5 million for a shelter organization in King County, $5 million for the YWCA based in Wenatchee and $2 million for an 80-unit transit-oriented development project in Tacoma. 
And in the Senate, there is $8 million for a 17-story affordable housing project near the University of Washington, $2 million for older adult housing in Yakima and another $2 million for refugee and immigrant housing in Tacoma.
The Senate unanimously approved its capital budget plan Saturday, kicking off a few weeks of negotiations between the two chambers before arriving at a consensus. The legislative session is slated to end April 27.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apartment-construction-olympia-2025-scaled-e1739921767650-1024x650.jpg,,,2025-04-07 07:05:18.586343

On Monday afternoon, the state Senate Fiscal Review Committee will hold [&#8230;]","Missouri House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins of Bowing Green speaks during debate Feb. 11 on his bill exempting capital gains from the state income tax (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).The price tag for a tax cut poised for passage in the Missouri General Assembly is likely many times bigger than estimated, and lawmakers should learn more before voting, the research director of the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy said last week.
On Monday afternoon, the state Senate Fiscal Review Committee will hold a hearing on a bill to exempt income from long-term capital gains from the state income tax. The bill would create the deduction immediately for individuals and put it in law for corporations with a trigger enacting it in the future.
The committee’s only job is to decide whether the anticipated impact on state revenues is acceptable. 
If passed out of committee, the bill would be up for an immediate Senate vote without further discussion. That would leave only a House vote ratifying Senate changes before the bill goes to Gov. Mike Kehoe.
“I intend to pass what the Senate sends back,” said House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins, sponsor of the bill.
In the fiscal note prepared for the capital gains exemption, the Department of Revenue estimates that the combined individual and corporate exemption would reduce state revenues by approximately $235 million annually. The individual income portion would be about $111 million a year.
But federal tax data from returns filed for 2022 shows individual income tax filers from Missouri reported $13.3 billion in capital gains income. Allowing a deduction of that amount would reduce state revenue by more than $600 million if it is all taxed at the top rate of 4.7%, said Carl Davis, research director at the institute.
“I would not vote on this without more clarification from the Department of Revenue,” Davis said. “We have publicly available information from the IRS that puts this fiscal note into serious doubt.”
The IRS tracks income amounts for long-term capital gains — the profit on the increased value of property or securities held for more than a year — because the federal tax rate is lower on that income than on earnings from wages or short-term gains. 
The bill allows a taxpayer to deduct the amount claimed as capital gains from their taxable income on their Missouri return.
The bill is one piece of the Republican plan to eliminate Missouri’s income tax altogether. It passed the House in February on a party-line vote.
Most of the benefits from a cut in the capital gains rate for individuals would go to a small slice of taxpayers. The 23,800 federal returns filed for 2022 with incomes greater than $500,000 a year represent 0.8% of all returns but included 65% of the capital gains income.
When it reached the Senate floor, a Democratic filibuster forced substantial changes, including the delay in the capital gains exemption for corporate income tax returns. 
Democrats also won two other long-sought tax cuts where the benefits will mainly go to lower-income Missourians. They are:

Increased credit amounts and income limits for the refundable property tax credit known as the “circuit breaker” available to people over 65 and people with disabilities. The changes included in the bill would reduce state revenue by about $84 million.
A sales tax exemption for diapers and feminine hygiene products that would eliminate the 4.225% state portion of the tax. Local sales taxes would remain in place. The exemption would reduce state revenue by about $37 million annually.

The combined $121 million revenue reduction in the two provisions is more than the fiscal note estimate of the individual capital gains exemption. If they don’t look deeper, Davis said, Democrats may think they got a good deal.
“They’re running a bill that looks like a 50/50 split between things for working class folks and things for very high income people,” Davis said. “But if the capital gains fiscal note is wrong in the way that I suspect it may be, it’s more like 7-to-1 capital gains to these other things.”
The delay in the capital gains exemption for corporate income taxes is tied to the implementation of additional cuts in the individual income tax already in state law. Those cuts are tied to revenue growth and based on current trends, the earliest date that the cut would occur is Jan. 1, 2030.
The circuit breaker tax credit was established in 1973. People over age 65 and those who have a qualifying disability and rent their homes can claim a tax credit to offset property taxes of up to $750 if their income is less than $27,500. The credit for homeowners is up to $1,100 if they own their home if their income is less than $30,000.
The bill would increase the maximum credit for renters to $1,055. For homeowners, the maximum credit would be increased to $1,550. It would also increase the income limits for claiming the credit, to $38,200 for renters and $41,000 for homeowners, with slightly higher amounts allowed for married couples claiming the credit.
For the first time, the credit amount and the income limits would be indexed for inflation.
The sales tax exemption for diapers and hygiene products is a provision Democrats have sought for several years. 
The circuit breaker increase and sales tax exemptions “sweetens the deal” for Democrats, House Minority Leader Ashley Aune said. But that doesn’t mean they are ready to back the bill.
“This is another situation where we absolutely have to weigh the good with the bad,” said Aune, a Kansas City Democrat. “There’s still plenty in that bill that we are deeply unhappy with.”
Perkins said he likes the Senate’s inclusion of the sales tax exemption. A provision allowing ambulance and fire districts to ask voters for a 1% sales tax — up from the current 0.5% limit — is also an attractive feature, he said.
“We’re moving forward,” Perkins said. “There are a lot of people that say if I don’t get things 100% my way, I didn’t win. I don’t view it like that.”
The bill will have no more debate in the Senate before a vote because the handler, state Sen. Curtis Trent, a Republican from Springfield, formally brought the discussion to a close on Wednesday. Once it is reported from the Fiscal Review Committee, the vote could be held at any time.
Along with the potential for being far more costly than estimated, there are other reasons to delay a tax cut, Davis said.
Federal budget cuts are threatening to greatly increase the state’s cost for Medicaid. The operating budget approved last week in the House dips into the state’s accumulated surplus for about $900 million and the Senate is likely to increase that amount, with construction spending bills to follow. 
And if the bill is passed, Missouri will be the only state with an income tax that does not apply to capital gains income.
“There’s a long list of reasons to budget very cautiously at this moment and to prepare for uncertainty and volatility,” Davis said. “The last thing you want to do in an environment like this is to vote on a tax bill where you’re not even 100% confident in what the revenue liability is going to be.”

(Lori M. Nichols for New Jersey Monitor)Progressive activists argue that a bill sitting on Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk that targets disruptive pop-up parties at the Jersey Shore would instead threaten First Amendment rights.
Lawmakers unanimously approved the bill that would toughen penalties for inciting public brawls last month, but critics argue the bill is written so vaguely that it would punish more people than intended. 
“The way it’s worded, there’s many ways that people could use that to go after our First Amendment rights, especially protest rights. That’s the easiest way to put it,” said Jim Sullivan of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey.
Sullivan said the language in the bill is particularly alarming amid crackdowns from the federal government on free speech, pointing to the case of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident jailed and facing deportation over his anti-Israel protests at Columbia University last spring. 
“At a time when almost all of our civil rights and liberties are under an attack that we haven’t seen in generations, it seems to me that legislators should be rushing to put amendments on their bill to protect First Amendment rights in this environment,” he said. “I’m really confused as to why it hasn’t happened yet.” 
Sen. Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth) said he’s “extraordinarily skeptical” of those concerns. If there’s a clamp down on protestors because of this bill, he’ll sponsor legislation to address those concerns, O’Scanlon said. 
“I’m not really worried,” he said. “The presumption that we’re going back to the ‘60s when maybe you did have police looking for a reason to go after protestors — I just don’t see that in New Jersey. I don’t know any police departments itching for a fight to take on protestors.” 
The measure was one of a handful of bills lawmakers introduced in response to pop-up parties, which have drawn hundreds of teens and young people to certain events, often leading to fights and overwhelming local law enforcement.
Over Memorial Day weekend last year, Wildwood officials declared a state of emergency over “civil unrest,” and in Ocean City, a 15-year-old was stabbed after hordes of teens got into a fight on the boardwalk. In October, a haunted hayride in Collingswood was shut down after fights broke out between about 200 juveniles. 
The measure sitting on Murphy’s desk would allow authorities to jail someone convicted of inciting a public brawl — defined as organizing a group of four or more people to engage in disorderly conduct. People would also face penalties for concealing their identity or causing a disturbance at a public event. 
Sullivan said he understands the problem legislators are trying to solve with the bill, but their tough-on-crime solution is not the answer. He hopes Murphy sends the bill back to lawmakers so it can be amended to include specific protections for protest rights. 
“They want to get this done before the summer season starts, when they think more trouble is going to happen, but even then, there’s still enough time to put guardrails on it,” he said.

Safer streets, in turn, fuel business growth and community development. These legislative developments — and the changes that come with them — will undoubtedly affect ongoing crime reduction initiatives. [&#8230;]","A St. Louis Metro Police car outside Carnahan Courthouse in downtown St. Louis (Clara Bates/Missouri Independent).The imminent return of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police to state oversight is rooted in the belief that policing remains a crucial force for crime reduction.
Safer streets, in turn, fuel business growth and community development. These legislative developments — and the changes that come with them — will undoubtedly affect ongoing crime reduction initiatives.
Yet, St. Louis stands at a pivotal moment.
By official measures, the city has made progress toward reducing violence since 2020-2021, when there was a nationwide spike. Policing will play a key role in sustaining this progress, but other factors are critical as well.
Research on strategic “focused deterrence” policing, dating back to Boston’s Operation Ceasefire in the 1990s, has a key takeaway: sustained violence reductions require both effective law enforcement and authentic community engagement.
St. Louis has embraced this approach. Public-private partnerships have built a coalition comprised of public health leaders, community organizations, local government, clergy, businesses, credible messengers and residents to form a “network of capacity” for violence prevention and intervention.
This has since expanded to the Save Lives Now! Initiative and other community-driven efforts embodying a proven model: focused law enforcement, cognitive change and services. Such complementary police and community efforts target immediate violence and its harms while addressing risk factors to reduce violence in a sustainable way over the long term.
As policing oversight shifts, it is crucial to assess these community-driven initiatives. We co-lead a research team at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, studying the implementation of community-based violence intervention strategies and whether they’re making an impact. We’ve observed meetings, interviewed key players, analyzed administrative data, and supported efforts to track outcomes and build accountability.
Government-led initiatives often face public skepticism, and even good ideas can falter in execution. Yet St. Louis offers promising signs.
Examples include the Office of Violence Prevention’s collaborative relationships with both St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department and community-based service organizations in its Community Violence Intervention; the business community’s early commitment to supporting violence reduction that has since expanded to become the regional Save Lives Now! Initiative; and neighborhood residents working directly with city departments to address location-specific violence risks in the St. Louis Public Safety Collaborative.
Additionally, the Violence Prevention Commission funds and coordinates youth events to create safer, supervised spaces. Each effort reflects recommended implementation practices and helps strengthen neighborhoods, build trust with police, and support economic growth.
This collaboration is promising, but the ultimate goal of these initiatives is to reduce violence.
Recent data offers cause for optimism there as well. An analysis of official crime incident data shows that from 2022 to 2024, homicides dropped by 25% and aggravated assaults with guns declined 26%. In the 11 neighborhoods where the Office of Violence Prevention first focused its efforts, those official numbers dropped by 42% and 31%, respectively, during the same period.
While more work is needed to ensure that all members of the community feel safe, the results suggest that community-based resource mobilization combined with targeted policing can have an impact and these efforts should be expanded to other areas of the city struggling with violence.
Public policy is full of examples of once-promising programs that ran out of funding or faded over time. St. Louis cannot afford to let that happen here. Violence shapes both how residents experience their communities and how outsiders perceive the city — affecting everything from quality of life to economic investment.
Maintaining a comprehensive, collaborative strategy is essential but it requires continued support and resource allocation from local leaders and state officials coupled with advocacy and engagement from community residents and organizations.
St. Louis has reached a point where it has a rare opportunity to redefine what public safety looks like — one that blends strategic policing with community-based initiatives. This has proven to be a blueprint for successful violence reduction in other cities and it has begun to improve conditions for the better in St. Louis.
Even as changes unfold, the city must hold onto this momentum by leveraging the community’s growing capacity to effectively respond to violence.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_8944-e1733922327714-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-04-07 07:05:18.586343

Michigan State Superintendent of Public Instruction Michael Rice announced Friday he is retiring from his position.
Rice’s retirement from leading the Michigan Department of Education will be effective Oct. 3.
“It’s been an honor to serve Michigan’s 1.4 million public school children over the last six school years,” said Rice in a statement.
Rice was appointed to his position by the State Board of Education in May 2019.
Pamela Pugh, president of the board, said in a statement Rice is committed to “putting children first.”
“Even in moments of disagreement, his focus on what was best for students never wavered,” she said.
Pugh cited the state’s highest recorded four-year graduation of 82.8% in 2024, measures to rectify the ongoing educator shortage, expansion of career and technical education, and expanded school mental health services, among the outcomes Rice helped the state attain.
In recent months, Rice was outspoken about school leaders’ obligations to enforce legal protections for LGBTQ+ students, as well as the state’s continuing efforts to make curriculum reflect diverse perspectives under the Trump administration.
But under Rice, Michigan public schools did face growing criticism, including from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, because of weak student performance on state and national exams.
Whitmer’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Rice’s departure.
Rice defended the department’s record during a contentious House Appropriations subcommittee meeting last month.
“How do we keep going the wrong way and you still have a job?” said Rep. Timmy Beson, a Republican, during the hearing.
Rice said in response that “based on a number of metrics, we’re going in the right way,” citing rising graduation rates and the increased number of students entering postsecondary education.
Republican members of the State Board of Education last year criticized Rice’s public silence on the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights investigation of the state education department, which stemmed from allegations that the department violated the rights of students with disabilities during COVID-era school closures.
The state has denied any wrongdoing in the case, which is ongoing.
“I expect to return to working eye level with children, work that I have missed enormously these last six years and to which I look forward,” he said.
Before working at the state education department, Rice was superintendent of Kalamazoo Public Schools for 12 years and in Clifton, New Jersey for five.
Rice began his career in education teaching French in District of Columbia Public Schools.
He graduated from Yale University with a bachelor’s degree in psychology, and graduated from New York University with a master’s degree and a doctoral degree in public administration.

The Tennessee Small Business Alliance represents restaurants, real estate firms, retail stores and other local employers operating within the district represented by Sen. Bo Watson. 
Watson, a Republican, is cosponsoring the legislation to require proof of legal residence to enroll in public K-12 and charter schools.  The bill would also give public schools the option of charging tuition to the families of children unable to prove they legally reside in the United States – or to deny them the right to a public education altogether. 
House Leader William Lamberth of Gallatin is a co-sponsor of the bill, which has drawn significant — but not unanimous — support from fellow Tennessee Republicans. Lamberth’s version of the bill differs from Watson’s in that it would make it optional — rather than mandatory — to check students’ immigration status in all of Tennessee’s more than 1700 public schools.  
Bill to bar certain immigrant kids from Tennessee public schools advances in Senate

The bill, one of the most controversial being considered during the 2025 Legislative session, has significant momentum as the Legislature winds down for the year even as it has drawn raucous protests at times.  The legislation will next be debated on Monday in a House committee.
A statement released by the business alliance described the legislation as a “political stunt that’s cruel, economically reckless, and completely out of step with local values.”
Citing estimates compiled by the nonprofit advocacy organization, American Immigration Council, the statement noted that more than 430,000 immigrants in Tennessee paid $4.4 billion in taxes – more than $10,000 per immigrant.  
Watson, in an emailed statement from Chattanooga public relations firm Waterhouse Public Relations, said his bill “raises important questions about the financial responsibility of educating undocumented students in Tennessee—questions that have long gone unaddressed.”
The statement said the Supreme Court’s 1982 decision in Plyler v. Doe, which established the right to a public school education for all children regardless of immigration status, has “never been re-examined in the context of today’s challenges.” The statement said Watson is committed to a “transparent, fact-driven discussion about how Tennessee allocates its educational resources and how federal mandates impact our state’s budget and priorities.”










Do our representatives believe that undocumented children — who had no say in their immigration status — should be denied a public education, even though their families already pay taxes that fund our schools?


– Kelly Fitzgerald, Chattanooga business owner


Watson has previously also said the legislation was prompted, in part, by the rising costs of English-language instruction in the state’s public schools.
Democrats have criticized that argument as based on inaccurate assumptions that English language learners lack legal immigration status.
Kelly Fitzgerald, founder of a Chattanooga co-working business and one of 27 employers that signed onto the statement of condemnation, criticized lawmakers.”
“Do our representatives believe that undocumented children — who had no say in their immigration status — should be denied a public education, even though their families already pay taxes that fund our schools?” said Fitzgerald, whose own children attend Hamilton County Public schools
“My children are receiving a great education in our public schools, and I want every child to have the same rights and opportunities as mine do,” she said. 
“In my opinion, this is not something our legislators should be spending their resources on when there are much larger issues at hand in the current environment,” she said. “We should leave children out of the conversation.”

I plan to join it at: https://downing.house.gov/live.
I have a list of questions for him but the one I plan to ask is about recent layoffs at the national Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, an internationally known research center working to eliminate deadly infectious diseases. It is another in a series of mystifying directives concocted by who-knows-who from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and its “Workforce Optimization Initiative,” sanctified by President Donald Trump’s executive order creating it.
Unfortunately, there’s a virtual information blackout on the Trump Administration’s downsizing process. Government officers and employees are fearful of retribution if they talk, and the congressional majority doesn’t want to risk retribution or being “primaried”– or either they simply don’t want to know the details or are operating on blind faith. 
We can recall “Hogan’s Heroes” and the denials of Sgt. Schultz: “I know nothing! I see nothing! I hear nothing!” 
The loss of two dozen jobs at the Ravalli County laboratory is part of 1,200 personnel reductions in the National Institutes of Health, and part of a reduction of 20,000 at the Department of Health and Human Services led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  The justification for the cuts is the same verbal pablum being given across the Administration federal service. 
The reduction announcement said 28 HSS divisions will reduce to 15, 10 regional offices to 5, and widely unrelated skilled offices for human resources, information technology, procurement, public affairs and policy will be merged into a central office.
In its propaganda effort – yes, propaganda! – for popular support, the administration uses its all-purpose “glittering generalities” language with little meaning but big on obfuscation:

The reductions are intended to “reduce bureaucratic sprawl” – determined by whom?
“We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.” May we ask what these priorities are beyond the glittering generality of “Make America Healthy Again”?

Wouldn’t starting with fast-food restaurants and the myriad of snacks at gasoline stations be better places to start to make America healthier? Get Trump off MacDonald’s and Diet Coke? Who defines “healthy?”
Downing, who has perhaps the best public relations staff and “X.com” presence of our four-person delegation, joins the other three in clicking his heels, saluting and praising without exception the amorphous Trump agenda.
What does Downing really think? Kudos to him for traveling the Eastern District and posting skads of photos chronicling his visits but what has he gained from the conversations he says he has learned from?
There is an election coming up and it is not unlikely the campaign will begin in early 2026 – although Downing already is fully engaged in it. 
It is time we voters know more about what Downing is doing for Montana. Let’s ask him.

But what does Medicaid actually do?,Shalina Chatlani,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/04/07/republicans-in-congress-are-eyeing-cuts-to-medicaid-but-what-does-medicaid-actually-do/,A GOP proposal in Congress could end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid.,"A woman sits with her daughters at a clinic operated by a community health center in New Orleans. Such centers rely on funding from Medicaid, which congressional Republicans want to cut. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare. 
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state. 
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.
States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets. 
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state. 
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.
The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

(Darwin Fan/Getty Images)In a letter dated Dec. 16, the Twin Falls Historic Preservation Commission got some welcome news.
Its application for a $25,000 grant through the state’s America250 in Idaho program – the initiative to celebrate the United States’ upcoming 250th birthday and Idaho’s historical role in the founding and expansion of our country  – was selected for funding. 
“We are grateful for your partnership in advancing the ideals of the American Revolution – equality, liberty, and justice – through meaningful community engagement and recognizing, appreciating, and commemorating Idaho’s journey in America’s legacy,” said the Dec. 16 letter, signed by Idaho State Historical Society Executive Director Janet Gallimore and Idaho State Historical Society Board of Trustees Chairwoman Cheryl O’Brien.

The grant was sorely needed, said historic preservation commission member Ronald James, to help with a project that aims to tell the underrepresented story of Chinese immigrants in southern Idaho and their impact on the state’s mining history. The grant would help complete the last phase of an “ambitious multi-phase archaeological survey of Chinese gold mining sites in the Snake River Canyon near Twin Falls, Idaho, and help finalize the establishment of a National Register Snake River Canyon Historic Mining District,” according to the Twin Falls Historic Preservation Commission’s grant application shared with the Idaho Capital Sun.
But on March 24, the preservation commission received another letter, this time from state Rep. Brandon Mitchell, R-Moscow, and state Sen. Ben Adams, R-Nampa, the two chairmen of the advisory council overseeing the America250 efforts in Idaho. 
“After reviewing the Idaho State Historical Society’s America250 in Idaho Grant program, we met with Director Gallimore to discuss how these grants comport with the Advisory Council’s vision for America250 in Idaho,” the letter stated. “After careful consideration of legislative intent, the grant program through America250 is cancelled. … We appreciate your organization’s role in preserving and sharing Idaho’s story, providing information and understanding that educates and inspires. We trust that Director Gallimore will continue to find ways to support the outstanding work you do.”
The March 24 letter citing legislative intent as the reason for cancelling the grants exposed some of the disagreements that have been brewing within the advisory council, the Idaho State Historical Society and the Idaho legislators who allocated the taxpayer dollars to be spent for the 250th celebration.
James, who said he had worked on the 11-page grant application for hours, was stunned.
“It feels like you just have the rug pulled out from under you,” James said in a telephone interview. “In a way it’s like a betrayal, because first off, we were encouraged to seek these grants and to pursue this. This project I’ve been working on for the last seven or eight years, and then right when you’re right in the middle of doing what you’re supposed to do, and you’re having success within your craft, they turn around and say they just don’t know. They say, ‘Sorry, we don’t want this anymore.’”
But it wasn’t just the Twin Falls Historic Preservation Commission that received the letter.
Of the 48 applications that were submitted for the grants, 31 organizations received a letter saying their grants were selected for a financial award in December. The grants selected ranged from $4,500-$25,000, Gallimore told the Capital Sun in an email. In the council’s Dec. 18 meeting, she said the 31 selectees represented $600,000 worth of total grant funding.
Now, all but two of the 31 grants have been cancelled. And the Idaho nonprofit organizations that were counting on the money they say was already promised to them are left wondering why.

 America250 in Idaho Advisory Council wants more oversight of grant funding

Benjamin Burdick, the producing artistic director at Boise Contemporary Theater, said his organization is among the grant selectees that had already made plans for a $25,000 grant in its budget. The money was going to be used to refurbish the theater, which is located in a historic seed house built in downtown Boise in 1935. 
After receiving the Dec. 16 selection letter, Burdick said the theater received another update on Feb. 5 informing his organization that the grant’s distribution was on hold while the program was being reviewed “for compliance with legislative intent” with instructions to not spend the $25,000 before the grant could be reviewed.

“When we plan, we make plans based on what people tell us,” Burdick said in a phone interview. “So if we think we have $25,000 coming, then we start to plan around that. But to then get a letter out of the blue that says, ‘sorry, you’re not getting that $25,000,’ … Now we’re just in crisis management mode, instead of doing what we do best, which is tell stories.”
In an email to the Capital Sun, Gallimore said that while the grant recipients had been selected in December, they had not yet been contracted. In March, the Idaho Legislature passed House Bill 357, which gives control over the America250 funding to the advisory council through a new account overseen by the State Treasurer’s Office, and it was signed by Idaho Gov. Brad Little on April 2.
“Any future use of America250 funds will be at the discretion of the Advisory Council,” Gallimore said in the email to the Sun. “As an executive branch agency, the role of ISHS is to implement the budget and policy decisions adopted by the Legislature.”
The council is made up of the state constitutional officers, state legislators, a private business representative and Gallimore.
 Advisory council co-chair says grant money should be ‘hyper-focused on celebrating America’s 250th birthday’

An Idaho Capital Sun review of the Idaho advisory council’s four public meetings held throughout December, January and February shed some light on differences between members of the America205 in Idaho Advisory Council, and leadership of the Idaho State Historical Society. Adams said House Concurrent Resolution 31, which the Idaho Legislature passed almost unanimously in 2024, laid out the Idaho Legislature’s intention for the money for the celebration.

“We wanted to be hyper-focused on celebrating America’s 250th birthday,” Adams said in an interview Thursday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.
When the America250 in Idaho Advisory Council began meeting in December, Adams said there wasn’t any real oversight of the money for the grants. Adams said he wanted to ensure there was a clear, bright line connecting what the grant money would be used for and the America250 celebration and the founding of America.
Adams said the council  decided to pull all of the grants, which he described as preliminary selections, back for review to ensure the grant applications aligned with legislators’ intentions.
“It was all because the list of grants was pretty large and so the intent was we needed to pull back to make sure the funds go where we intended them to go,” Adams said.
“Not all grants fit with the intent of HCR 31,” Adams said. 
Adams said two of the grant recipients – Boise State University and Idaho Public Television – have already spent their funds. 
As of Thursday, Adams said all other grants have been paused and are under review to ensure compliance. Adams said the advisory council will reconvene at a future date to decide how to spend the money, and he expects there will be some disagreement among advisory council members about how to proceed.
“That is something we want to work through,” Adams said. But for Adams, his priority is to spend the money on one heck of a birthday party for America.
“You only turn 250 once,” Adams said. 
 America250 in Idaho Advisory Council, legislators, historical society have differing vision for grant funds

During the advisory council’s Jan. 17 meeting, Gallimore defended the process to establish the criteria for selecting the grants and pointed to language in House Concurrent Resolution 31, which both supports the America250 initiative and the nation’s birthday celebration and also highlights the need to celebrate Idaho’s history and its role in the founding of the U.S.
“In the proclamation and the resolution that you’re referring to, there’s a lot of language about, of course, our American founding values and liberty, equality, justice — all those things,” Gallimore said, “but there’s also woven through there Idaho’s role, our narrative and Idaho’s place in that story, because we’ve contributed heavily to that story.”
Like the celebrations held in 1976 for America’s 200th birthday, which lead to legacy projects in Idaho such as the state highway historic markers project and the state’s Century Farm and Ranch program, the grants could support efforts that can last and make a historical impact over time, she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
She said the historical society went through a robust, year-long process leading up to the opening of the grants in fall of 2024, which included gathering input from other state agencies like the state’s library and arts commissions on how they allocate grant funding. During an advisory council meeting, she said she met with about 20 legislators to gather input on how the grant funds should be spent and held more than 20 listening sessions, community meetings and town halls across the state to answer questions from potential awardees and to gather information on how best the grants might make an impact for them. She said in the public meetings that the historical society also extended the deadline for grant applicants to offer more time for residents to hear about the program and submit potential projects.
“We asked and did focus groups across the state with our potential awardees from (organizations like) county museums: What would be transformational? What would they need? How could they do this work? So this was very well thought through,” she said during the Jan. 17 meeting.
She said during the council’s Dec. 18 meeting that some legislators, such as Rep. Rick Cheatum, R-Pocatello, did give feedback that they didn’t want the grants to go toward projects like deferred maintenance.
“He said he would be really interested in making sure that the grants didn’t include things like maintenance, because he wanted the grants to go for stories and for deliverables, and so we took that into account when we did the grant guidelines,” Gallimore said at the Dec. 18 meeting.
She said the grant application asked how projects would incorporate the USA’s founding ideals like liberty, justice and equality, and “marrying that with the history of Idaho,” including projects that focused on nature and public lands, agriculture, arts, culture and heritage.
 Grants could be looked at as ‘pork in government,’ Idaho state treasurer says

Idaho State Treasurer Julie Ellsworth, a member of the advisory council, said during the council’s Jan. 17 meeting that she has fielded “earfuls” of calls from many concerned legislators that the grant funding was not awarded in line with the Legislature’s intent. She made a motion during that meeting to ask Gallimore to establish a forum where legislators could offer feedback and be heard about the concerns they had with how the grants were selected.
“We’ve worked hand-in-hand with the governor’s office to create those grant guidelines, and the grant guidelines were approved,” Gallimore responded. “I realize there may be a change now, but that was done in the fall, and we’re certainly happy to work with the governor’s office to have him and his staff review them.”

Ellsworth reiterated that she and other elected officials felt some of the selectees fell outside of the vision of the America250 initiative.
“Today I would not be comfortable approving these grants,” Ellsworth said in the public meeting. “You know, truthfully, I feel like that. Perhaps some people would look at it as like pork in government. You know, that’s the first blush you get when you read these things.”
Secretary of State Phil McGrane, who also serves on the council, echoed Ellsworth’s comments in the meeting. He said some of the projects, like funding a new wooden awning for the historic Mason Hall requested by the Lincoln County Historical Society, didn’t fit with legislative intent to celebrate the nation’s founding.
McGrane said that he could fully appreciate why historical sites may need repair, but “the nexus between the roof and America250 is strained.”
“So I use that as an example of the type of feedback that we are collectively receiving and of what I’ve been asking for at times. Like, where’s the balloons? Instead, there’s a roof. … Is it going to be a patriotic-looking roof? That’s, I think, the fundamental question.”
But another member of the advisory council, Sen. Jim Guthrie, R-McCammon, said the projects should have a real, lasting impact on the state and how to continually tell its story.
“If the roof thing, for example, is something that helps sustain a piece of history, that’s important and ties into the greater picture,” Guthrie said. “That has more value to me than a parade, because it has sustaining value.”
In an interview at the Capitol on Thursday, Adams said he took into consideration the concerns discussed at the public meetings, and following Ellsworth’s motion, he said he and Mitchell and met with Gallimore and decided to introduce House Bill 357 and send the letters that the grant funding had been cancelled.
However, the council did not vote on or discuss cancelling the grants at its public meetings. In its Jan. 27 meeting, Adams said the council needed an additional week to review the grant applications that were selected in December. The council canceled its meetings on Feb. 10 and Feb. 14, according to the council’s meeting agendas. The grants were not discussed in the council’s most recent meeting on Feb. 17.
 Grant selectees said they followed application guidelines to tell Idaho’s story

James with the Twin Falls County Historical Commission and Burdick with Boise Contemporary Theater said their organizations carefully followed the grant’s application guidelines, which are 11 pages long. They said they followed the application’s stated vision “to celebrate American history and the invaluable contributions of Idahoans to our region, nation, and world.”
“The ongoing process of the growth of the American nation, that’s what I was operating on, and that’s exactly what my project is,” James said. “It’s commemorating the role of these immigrant workers who first helped build the Transcontinental Railroad, and then some of them came up here and made significant contributions to southern Idaho’s frontier communities.”

When James reached out to Adams and Mitchell via email to ask for more of an explanation into their decision to cancel the grants, Mitchell responded to say the chairmen concluded that the grants did not fully meet the intended objectives of the Legislature.
“It’s important to note that when taxpayer funds are allocated, the legislature, representing the voice of the people, must carefully scrutinize how they are being spent,” Mitchell wrote in an April 3 email to James. “It is also important to recognize that no contracts were issued or signed. I understand the frustrations this decision may have caused, and I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience it may have brought. The grant applications we reviewed simply did not align with the vision we all share for celebrating America250.”
Because the Boise Contemporary Theater is in a historic building, Burdick said the grant helps fulfill that America250 vision by offering a world-class gathering place to celebrate arts and culture and provide a space educational programs for children and adults alike to learn more about theater, and by extension, the nation’s history and its past, present and future role in the world.
“The outside noise makes it difficult to keep in mind that at the heart of what we do, it’s very simple,” he said. “We move people. We start conversations. We bring strangers together. We bring friends together. We tell stories. In our education program, we’re not out to create actors or writers or directors, necessarily. At the heart of our theater lab is the desire to create collaborative citizens of the world.”",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1327680401-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-07 07:05:18.586343

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)The melodious sounds of a string quartet. The delightfulness of a smoky whiskey. Open bars. More flowers than you’d see at a funeral. It has all the makings of a lavish, big-budget wedding. 
But don’t cue “Here Comes the Bride.” 
These luxurious accommodations and the spending that goes with them are happening in conjunction with public board meetings
A nine-member oversight board Oklahoma has entrusted to ensure that many of our public colleges and universities are spending money wisely apparently feels entitled to live high on the hog while doing so.
It would be delightfully ironic, but for the fact that an Oklahoma Voice analysis of receipts provided in response to an open records request found that the sumptuous tastes of the Board of Regents for the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges have resulted in over $69,000 in combined costs connected to just 13 meetings. And, that excludes mileage reimbursement requests, which adds another $11,000 to the tab.
In short, every time these regents meet, it costs an average of over $6,100, including mileage.
These board members are entrusted to oversee the Oklahoma State University system, along with Connors State College, Langston University, Northeast Oklahoma A&M College and Oklahoma Panhandle State University.
This spending is problematic in part because our regents are doing nothing to curtail the expectation that presidents and schools must pay dearly for board members to attend obscenely expensive junkets and entertain them while they’re doing the taxpayers’ business.
Records indicate that most often the bulk of those tabs are born by the college or university that is hosting them. That means our tax dollars are paying for them to hold elaborate feasts that serve dozens of unnamed people items like 8 oz. filet, salmon, boneless beef short ribs, pit ham and stuffing, roasted garlic whipped potatoes and gravy and cast iron butter cake.  
Somehow when the regents met over two days in September, officials managed to spend close to $6,600 on dinner, $250 on breakfast and almost $1,100 on lunch.
Most cost-conscious boards would order a few pizzas, get a box of donuts or a fruit tray from the local grocery store, or bring their own peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
This king- and queen-like gluttony is tone-deaf to the fact that over 1 in 5 college students are food insecure, meaning they’re skipping meals or eating less because they can’t afford it. OSU’s fundraising arm reports that the university’s food insecurity rate is actually closer to 1 in 2 students. The spending is also outrageous given the struggles many Oklahoma families currently face to pay their bills.
And while these officials are living large, four of the five schools that these regents oversee increased tuition. While OSU did not, Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College, which hosted one of these board meetings, increased its tuition 5.5%.
So while some of these campuses are forking out thousands to wine and dine their governing board, students are suffering with higher tuition rates or fees.
How is that a good use of money?
It’s further troubling that none of the sitting members could be bothered to answer specific questions about the expenditures. Only one, now a former member, was willing to talk with a reporter about the rationale behind the spending. Additionally, we discovered that these regents don’t have individual public email addresses clearly listed on their governing board’s website. That sends a clear signal that they have very little interest in being accountable to the public they’re tasked with representing.
The board has faced increased scrutiny in recent days following the abrupt resignation of OSU’s former President Kayse Shrum in February.
And while there are no specific receipts related to alcohol purchases, the former board member said they have access to open bars, and records show we’ve paid for them to have a bartender. There’s no reason people should be drinking alcoholic beverages while participating in state business.
If that’s not gross enough, some of our board attended a “Board of Regents Night Cap” “social,” and records show the OSU Foundation, which is supposed to use donor dollars “to make a lasting impact on the students, faculty and programs that inspire us,” imprudently used funding to buy regents shot glasses and other items to facilitate a “Whiskey Tasting.” They also paid over $1,000 to host a hospitality suite for these regents and even bought them personalized cookies.
Is that what donors intended their money to pay for? If I were a donor, I wouldn’t want my money spent on that.
Enough is enough.
There’s a certain sick humor to the situation given the fact that this D.C. swamp-level of extravagance is apparently happening under the noses of Republicans who are on a quest to reduce waste. Gov. Kevin Stitt, who appointed all these folks, in particular is focused on it.
This is not an acceptable way to spend money. Board members should certainly be compensated for their mileage, and possibly a reasonable hotel stay if they live two hours or more away from a meeting site. And perhaps they should get a $30 meal voucher. But these meetings should not be wracking up over $50,000 in catering costs and thousands more in other expenses like purchasing fresh flowers.
If regents don’t want to serve without all the frippery, that’s fine. Stitt can find someone else who will.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)A Wisconsin group that helps workers who have experienced wage theft is broadening its tactics to address complaints of employer misconduct.
On Friday staff members of Worker Justice Wisconsin, along with a group of community supporters, showed up at a Middleton contractor’s office where a former employee demanded payment of unpaid overtime wages. 
The public action represents a new step for Worker Justice Wisconsin, according to executive director Rebecca Meier-Rao.
Based in Madison and supported by a group of churches and other religious bodies, Worker Justice Wisconsin has spent the last couple of decades assisting workers who don’t have unions with complaints about their treatment on the job.
For much of its existence the organization has worked one-on-one with individuals, helping them navigate the process of filing complaints with the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (DWD) and other agencies.
“The prevalence of wage theft is astronomical,” Meier-Rao told the Wisconsin Examiner. She added that it’s a nationwide problem. “Every year just millions and millions of dollars are stolen from workers.”
People of color and immigrants are the most likely to be targets, she said. The organization does not discuss the immigration status of those who come to the group for help.
In 2024, the group enabled 103 workers to recover more than $328,000 in wages they were shorted by their employers, Meier-Rao said, but those successes represent “just a fraction” of the wage theft incidents that go on each year. The resolved wage theft cases in 2024 were just some of the 155 that Worker Justice Wisconsin opened that year, involving more than $531,000 in unpaid wages.
“I’m sure the actual amount of wage theft was much higher,” Meier-Rao said.
Not only do those cases  deprive people of their rightful earnings, they also cost government the taxes on those earnings, she said.
DWD investigates wage theft complaints and will calculate what is owed to an employee, but “there’s almost no teeth if the employer doesn’t pay,” she added. “That is not going to deter the problem from happening.”
While someone who steals from a store or a warehouse can be charged with theft, wage theft in Wisconsin “is treated not as a criminal offense but a civil offense,” Meier-Rao said.
Worker Justice Wisconsin’s tactics are evolving as it looks for new ways to address the issue. “We’ve been shifting from an advocacy organization to a worker power organization,” Meier-Rao said.
About a year ago the organization began planning to take public actions to call attention to the wage theft incidents it has investigated. The group developed leaders among the workers it has supported and began building a broader support group — a “rapid response network” that has enlisted 120 community members, union activists and other allies.
By directly confronting employers, Meier-Rao said, the organization wants to draw the attention of the public and policymakers to wage theft, encouraging them to enact tougher laws against the practice.
On Friday morning, Worker Justice Wisconsin organizer Robert Christl, Meier-Rao and a small crowd of the organization’s rapid-response volunteers drove up to the storefront of Stone Concepts in a Middleton industrial park.
They were there with Crescencio Albino, who worked for four years building and installing stone countertops at the home design and remodeling contractor.
Albino, who no longer works for the company, said that he had put in  extensive overtime hours, but was paid only his regular hourly wage, not the time-and-a-half premium required under state and federal laws. A DWD investigation determined he was owed $6,875 in unpaid premium wages for the last two years of overtime work.
Outside the Stone Concepts office, with Albino at his side, Christl spoke to an employee and asked if the owner was on site. The employer said he was not, and Christl asked him to convey a letter to the owner. The letter called for Albino to be paid in full within two weeks.
Gathering at the other end of the block afterward, Meier-Rao, Christl and Albino addressed supporters. Christl served as interpreter as Albino spoke in Spanish.
Albino said he pursued the case with DWD after trying several times to resolve the issue directly with the business. Despite the DWD’s finding, Albino said the business owner has still not paid him.
“The employer wanted to pay the money already owed to me with a payment plan of six months, which I rejected,” Albino said. “It’s hard for me to understand why, in such a clear cut situation, I have to go through this whole process to get what is mine.”
He added: “If I hadn’t honored my obligation, or if I had stolen from my boss, the consequences would have been immediate and severe, but it seems that when it’s workers like me who are affected, justice isn’t applied equally. This seems wrong to me.”
Meier-Rao told the group that the action and others like it were aimed at throwing a public spotlight on a problem that has long gone unnoticed.
“For more than two decades, we have helped hundreds of workers file claims with the Department of Workforce Development to [recoup] unpaid wages,” Meier-Rao said.
“Although we have had many successful individual cases, the harsh reality is that this approach does not change the system. No amount of complaints filed will put a stop to wage theft.”
To accomplish that, “we have to organize inside and outside the workplace,” Meier-Rao said. “We have to be public. We have to make noise. We have to build collective power. That is why it’s so important that you are all here today.”
Responding Saturday to an email inquiry the Wisconsin Examiner sent Friday to Stone Concepts, Andreia Nogueira wrote that “we are not refusing to make a payment. I am sending the payment to my lawyer.”
As of Sunday, Worker Justice Wisconsin had not received a response on behalf of the company, Meier-Rao said.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.)People from across southeast Wisconsin gathered in the Wisconsin State Fair Park Exposition Center Friday to call on legislators to fund a range of priorities in the next state budget — from education to a new public safety building for Milwaukee to public transportation to child care.
The public hearing of the Joint Finance Committee was the second of four across the state this month. A hearing was also held in Kaukauna last week, and Republican and Democratic lawmakers on the committee agreed Friday morning that education funding was one of the top issues discussed. 
Committee co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein said at a press conference that funding for school districts and the fate of the Green Bay prison were two of the biggest issues discussed during the first hearing. He said lawmakers haven’t discussed any specifics yet when it comes to actions they may take on public school funding, adding that K-12 funding has historically been the No. 1 largest item in the budget and it’ll likely be that way in the future.
“We’re here to listen and input today may influence what we decide to do down the road,” Marklein said.
Co-chair Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) added that the lawsuit over Gov. Tony Evers’ partial veto that extended increases in revenue limits — the cap on how much schools can bring in — for 400 years will play a role in the discussion. The case was heard by the Wisconsin Supreme Court last year, but a decision hasn’t been reached yet.

Lawmakers also have a $4 billion budget surplus that they will be considering as they write the budget in the coming months. 
During a separate press conference held by Democrats on the committee, Rep. Deb Andraca (D-Whitefish Bay) called attention to education funding, saying that lawmakers need to “stand up and fund education, particularly special education.” Andraca said lawmakers should adopt Gov. Tony Evers’ budget proposal, which would invest an additional $3 billion in K-12 education. 
“I’m looking forward to hearing more today from all the people at this public hearing about what their priorities are in the state budget. I certainly hope my Republican colleagues are listening and will follow our lead,” Andraca said. 
A focus on education at the hearings continued as members of the public started speaking on Friday.
School leaders and advocates emphasize dire situation
Three days before the town hall, voters approved 57 referendum requests and a total of $952 million in new funding through property tax hikes for Wisconsin school districts. This was an approval rate of about 58% of the nonrecurring operating referendum requests, 65% of requests for building costs and 20% of recurring requests, which contain increases across multiple years. 
While the successful results will help school districts meet costs in coming months, voters also denied over $640 million in requests from other districts, including for Kenosha Unified School District.
Kenosha school board member Todd Price said the failed referendum, which was a $115 million nonrecurring request for operational expenses, leaves the district of 18,500 students in 31 schools facing a $19 million fiscal deficit. 
“As we are frozen in what we can raise due to revenue caps, we needed to go to our local tax payers for approval of the money,” Price said. “Our aim was to keep our class sizes reasonable, vital programs intact like advanced placement programs… which are popular for students aiming to go to college, and we want to retain our staff.” 
KUSD Superintendent Jeff Weiss, who spoke alongside Price, told lawmakers that they have the power to “be a strong partner of public education.” He said the passage of Act 20, a 2023 law to change literacy education in the state is a recent example of lawmakers using that power. 
“I am asking you to do this in the area of finances,” Weiss said. “By raising the reimbursement for special education to 60%, KUSD will receive $13 million of spendable money. We are currently facing a $19 million budget shortfall. $13 million as well as raising the revenue limit… will go a very long way to helping prevent the district from having to seek an operational referendum in the coming year.”
Weiss emphasized that the resources needed to pursue a referendum are “immense.” He said the district held four town halls, 20 small meetings, and five interviews with TV and radio stations in a six-week period ahead of Election Day. 
“This is not how I want to spend our time in the school district,” Weiss said. “I would much rather be using that time to increase student learning and improve our educational program.”
Swallow School District Superintendent Jill Ries said that the small district in Waukesha County has a history of being fiscally responsible, a trait that has helped it weather the “storm” caused by the state’s funding formula.
“We can no longer weather the storm, and we are facing a multi-million-dollar deficit in the future. We have reached the fiscal cliff. We can choose to have barebones public education, but is that what we want our state to become?” Ries asked.
Ries also called on lawmakers to increase revenue limits and at a minimum increase the special education reimbursement to 60%. 
Zachary Geiger, a physics teacher at Greendale High School, also voiced his support for Evers’ budget request, telling lawmakers that teachers have been trying to accomplish more teaching and learning with fewer resources for the last decade and a half. He said this is catching up with the district, which has had to go to referendum and recently had to cut an engineering course for the first time in 12 years.
“Instead of supporting students in pursuit of their futures and responding to the needs of the industries in Wisconsin, this course was cut with many others to reduce costs in order to balance a budget dependent on insufficient funding from the state,” Geiger said. “Please fund public education.”
The tension between public schools’ financial challenges and the growing costs of the state’s school voucher programs was also on display at the hearing.
Glendale River Hills School Board President Carla Pennington-Cross called on lawmakers to stop using school boards as a “laundering service” by sending an increasing amount of taxpayer money to private schools that don’t have “equal accountability, equal transparency and equal legal obligation” to students. 
Pennington-Cross called on lawmakers to increase per pupil funding to keep up with inflation. 
“Your long-term failure to do so means that my district has lost more than $3 million in real spending power since 2009 under your revenue limits,” Pennington-Cross said. 
Pennington-Cross called attention to the significant increases that voucher schools received in the last budget cycle. She also spoke to the disparity between the rate that public schools are reimbursed for special education costs and the rate that private and charter voucher schools receive. 
“In the past year public schools were reimbursed for only 32% of special ed costs, while private schools received 90%. Why are students with disabilities worth less when they go to public schools? They should get the same financial support from the state regardless of their school choice,” Pennington-Cross said. “Your funding model causes people to blame kids with disabilities for budget shortfalls in public schools, reinforcing stigma and discrimination. It is unconscionable.” 
Choice advocates appreciative of last investments, seeking more 
Advocates for more state funding for the charter and private schools that participate in the state’s voucher programs were also out in full force. 
“I’m grateful for the opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks for the additional funding for school choice. Your decision has made an incredible difference for families like mine,” one parent of a student at Living Word Lutheran High School in Jackson said.
In the last state budget, lawmakers implemented the largest increase for the school voucher program in Wisconsin history. The change increased payments for schools at a minimum by 18% and at most by 44%. 
Many of the parents who testified for school vouchers wore matching bright green “Parent Power” t-shirts. A group of about 75 parents were organized to attend the listening session by the City Forward Collective, a Milwaukee-based organization that advocates for school choice. 
Executive director of City Forward Collective Colleston Morgan told the Wisconsin Examiner that the last budget was an example of state leaders moving past “partisan rancor” to take action, something he is hoping they’ll be able to do again.
“We saw the Legislature come together on a package that in our understanding benefited everybody — increases in the low revenue ceiling, lifting of the revenue limits and, yes, a significant increase for students in charter and private schools,” Morgan said. “Nobody got everything they needed… but everybody got something.” 
Morgan said that there were many participating charter and private schools that were “in existential crisis” during that cycle, and the historic increase to the program helped stabilize the situation. He said many schools have been able to increase staff pay. 
“There’s still more work to do, but we’re not today talking about schools on the precipice of closing like we were two years ago,” Morgan said. 
Morgan said his group wanted to attend to express thanks and encourage legislators to continue to work in a bipartisan way to get more accomplished, including raising the special education reimbursement rate, lifting the low revenue ceiling and putting additional funding into the voucher program. 
Milwaukee leaders on their goals for next budget
Local leaders who spoke at the hearing included Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who thanked lawmakers for their work last session to secure an increased sales tax in the city. He said the investments in the last budget show that “working together and investing in Milwaukee benefits all of us because a strong Milwaukee means a strong Wisconsin.”

Johnson called on lawmakers to invest in young people in the next state budget, including by increasing funding for Milwaukee’s Earn & Learn program, a summer employment program where youth can gain experience working with local businesses, nonprofits, community and faith-based organizations. He also called on lawmakers to support Evers’ proposal for investing in 4-year-old kindergarten and increasing state funding for special education and child care.
“It’s our responsibility to ensure that the youngest residents here and young families have the support they need to start off on the right foot as they enter school and the workforce,” Johnson said.
Sarah Kazell, an advocate with Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN), is attending all the budget listening sessions.
“Child care is a public good and without public investment, it just dwindles and dies in the private market, which is what we are seeing,” Kazell said. “We cannot find teachers willing to do a really essential, really high-skilled, high-stress job for $14 an hour, which is the average pay in my field. I’m personally making $12.50 an hour to take care of eight children.”
Evers has requested the state place $480 million towards the Child Care Counts program, which gives facilities funds to help pay staff without raising costs for parents. However, the program, which has been funded with federal money, is quickly approaching the end of those funds. 
“We need at the minimum to make the investment that’s in the governor’s budget for child care, but that’s honestly just a starting point to be able to stabilize the field,” Kazell said. 
Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said the “most important” investment for public safety would be to fund the removal and replacement of the Public Safety building. 
“We have steered clear of a fiscal cliff. We kept the Brewers in Milwaukee, we shared the burden of funding important services and investments with some of our region’s most urgent issues being addressed,” he said, listing accomplishments in the last budget cycle. Now, he added, it’s time to focus on the “generational impact that we can have in our community on public safety.” 
Crowley said that the removal and the replacement of the Milwaukee County Public Safety building, which was built in 1929, would cost $495 million. Milwaukee County has requested $250 million for the project from the state. According to the capital budget, due to the integrated nature of the county’s Courthouse Complex, the Historic Courthouse and Criminal Justice Facility will need to be renovated in addition to the new Public Safety building. 
Evers’ budget proposal included $25 million for the project — a tenth of their request.
“Many of you have seen this crumbling, unsafe and inefficient facility firsthand and that’s why, in order to improve outcomes for all, strong partnerships will be key in this endeavor,” Crowley said. 
Crowley said almost 80% of Milwaukee County’s property tax levy is dedicated to state-mandated services and the county has invested an additional $70 million in state-mandated public safety services over the last five years. 
“The cost continues to rise and outpace our revenues and challenges our ability to continue funding these critical services and make any additional investments in local priorities like transportation, mental health, [services for children ages] birth-to-3,” Crowley said. “That’s why a partnership with the state is essential.” 
Milwaukee County Sheriff Denita Ball expanded on the request to replace the deteriorating building that houses the jail.
Ball said the current set-up of the building, which places victims, family members, visitors and defendants together, has created tension and resulted in 852 security incidents that required a response from the sheriff’s office in 2024.
“It is not sustainable to continue working as we have, and it is not fair to those who come in contact with our justice system,” Ball said. “In order to address the significant safety concerns and preserve the comfortability of core operations, funding from the state of Wisconsin will be critical.”
Other public hearings will be held in Hayward and Wausau during the last week of April.

Some top names stay on the list for years. (Getty Images)LINCOLN – A little-known state effort to shame delinquent taxpayers into paying up is still on the job 15 years after it was created.
But the state’s worst tax scofflaw in recent years, a former Omaha business owner, remains at the top of the state’s so-called “wall of shame” despite the listing, raising questions about the list’s effectiveness.
When it was created by the Nebraska Legislature in 2010, the state was struggling with a budget shortfall, and the public posting of tax scofflaws was billed as a low-cost way to force delinquencies to be paid.
There’s been little publicity about the wall of shame since, despite a similar budget crunch impacting the state this year.
As of March 31, nearly 370 individuals and companies from Nebraska and several other states were listed on the Nebraska Department of Revenue’s website as owing more than $20,000 in state taxes. In total, they add up to owing about $22.6 million.
Topping the list is former Omaha businessman Randall J. Thompson, who owes the state nearly $2.4 million in individual income taxes, according to the website.
That’s about the same amount that Thompson owed when the state’s worst tax scofflaws were first posted in 2010.
Does shame work?
Is shame still effective strategy for collecting delinquent taxes?

State Tax Commissioner James Kamm said the wall of shame “is one of the different tools” used by the Department of Revenue to collect delinquent taxes.
“The Department places the collection of delinquent taxes as a high priority,” Kamm said.
One former state tax commissioner, Tony Fulton, who served from 2016-2022, said the list worked for some people who wanted to avoid being publicly listed, but it didn’t work for others.
The state gives 30 days warning before listing an individual or company, giving someone time to pay up before being publicly revealed as owing taxes.
Fulton recalled that it did generate tips to the department.
“It definitely got people’s attention,” he said. “I used to get contacted … ‘Hey, I know this guy.’”
Still common to see lists
About 20 states utilize walls of shame — roughly the same number as in 2010 — according to the Federation of Tax Administrators, a national group of tax commissioners. Some states list only businesses that owe taxes, while most list both individuals and companies, according to Terri Steenblock the FTA’s tax and revenue administrator.

She said such shame walls have a two-fold purpose: to collect delinquent taxes, but also to inspire voluntary payments of taxes due.
A Nebraska Department of Revenue spokesman said that of the $9.8 billion in taxes paid to the state during the 2023-24 fiscal year, about $60 million in delinquent taxes was deemed eligible to be collected. That compares with $5 billion in total state taxes collected 10 years ago and about $26 million in tax delinquencies deemed collectible.
Patrick Roy, the department spokesman, said that some delinquencies cannot be collected, such as assets held in another state by an out-of-state taxpayer or when a deceased taxpayer has no assets.
Roy said collection of taxes due is assigned to a “dedicated team” within the compliance division of the Revenue Department that knows how to find and legally recover assets. He said the state uses a variety of other methods to collect delinquent taxes, such as tax liens and, as a last resort, selling off assets at auction.
The state does not collect delinquent property taxes. That is a local responsibility for a locally collected tax.
Roy, like Fulton, the former tax commissioner, said they could not comment on an individual taxpayers’ case, thus they could not respond to questions about why Thompson still remains atop the most-taxes-owed list.
Why collecting sometimes takes time
Back in 2010, Doug Ewald, who was then state tax commissioner, told the Omaha World-Herald that in general, if a taxpayer has no assets, there’s nothing for the state to recover.
  Taxes are always a hot topic in Nebraka. (Getty Images)
That appears to be the reason Thompson, who would now be 75 or 76 years old, remains atop the delinquent tax roll. He faced a bevy of legal problems starting back in the 2000s.
Thompson owned a day-trading firm, R.J. Thompson Holdings, which he reportedly sold in 2001 for $13 million in cash, bonuses and incentive payments.
But in 2006, a federal tax judge ruled that Thompson had set up a sham tax shelter to avoid paying taxes on $21 million in capital gains from the sale.
In 2014, he was convicted in U.S. District Court of failing to pay federal income taxes he had withheld from employees’ paycheck at his company, American Medical Files. He was sentenced to six months in prison and three years of supervised release.
The money was used, according to court files, for mortgage payments on a luxury home in southwest Omaha and expenses at a Las Vegas casino, the Bellagio. He was ordered to pay $95,505 in restitution, and, as a condition of his supervised release, not to gamble.
No clarity on payments
A clerk with the U.S. District Court in Nebraska told the Examiner that she could not publicly reveal whether Thompson had paid any of the restitution ordered, which was supposed to be paid off in monthly installments of $250 a month or 7% of his gross income.
Thirteen years ago, the Internal Revenue Service forced a sale of Thompson’s possessions in five storage units in Sarpy County. The possessions, according to Omaha television station KETV, included football helmets signed by Gale Sayers, Dick Butkus, Bart Starr and Nebraska football stars, as well as boxing gloves signed by Floyd Patterson and Muhammad Ali.
Thompson’s attempts to overturn his convictions on appeal were unsuccessful, and his name last appears in court files in 2020, when Wells Fargo Bank won a revival of a default judgment against Thompson for nonpayment of $12.4 million to the bank. That court order indicated that Thompson, in 2020, still lived in Nebraska, but attempts to reach him via phone or through past attorneys were unsuccessful.
The Examiner was able to leave a voice message with the taxpayer who owes the second-most in delinquent taxes to Nebraska, Ahmer Khan of Frisco, Texas.
Khan owes $1.1 million in sales taxes, prepaid wireless taxes and waste reduction and recycling fees in Sarpy and Douglas Counties, according to the Department of Revenue.
Those messages were not returned by Friday afternoon.

(Photo by Jonny Armstrong/Oregon State University)Some already threatened cold-water fish species in the Northwest will not only face shrinking habitat from climate change but will face growing pressure from invasive fish species fleeing their own warming and dwindling waters, according to modeling from researchers at Oregon State University.
The findings were part of a study published in the journal Global Change Biology by fisheries professor Guillermo Giannico, associate fisheries professor Ivan Arismendi and graduate student Arif Jan. The three found that climate change is likely to compel all kinds of species migration that could lead to increased predation, competition and some localized extinctions of once native species in the Northwest and globally.
Idaho watercraft inspection stations are open for the season. Here’s what to know.

Giannico said their models can be run on most species in the world. But for their recent study, the three zeroed in on the northern migration of non-native smallmouth bass and northern pike into threatened and endangered native redband and bull trout habitat in the Northwest. All four of the species are likely to lose habitat as climate change accelerates and are likely to seek homes in colder water at higher elevations.
They created maps using ecological data that indicate the breadth of territory where each species lives and then modeled the impact of changing conditions such as higher temperatures and drought projected through 2070 to see how that would influence the range of all four species’ movement and overlap.
“We forecast how these species would respond to those changing conditions by disappearing from certain regions that will be too warm for them, and appearing in others that maybe today are too cold, but they would be more suitable in the future,” Giannico said. “Because not all shifts are equal, there will be areas where they will be more crowded together, and they would overlap more, and areas where they wouldn’t overlap that much.”
Of great concern is the migration of aggressive and predatory northern pike into redband and bull trout territory, and the increasing likelihood the two will overlap more frequently.
“They all shift, but they end up shifting in a way that the amount of overlap in their distribution is going to be greater,” Giannico explained. “It’s like you have less room to avoid nasty people at the party, and you end up being cornered in the same part of the room with the same people you don’t enjoy, and you’re all packed in the wrong place with the wrong companion.”
Giannico said researchers have long separately studied how climate change will compel the migration of some species and how native species respond to the introduction of invasive species. The modeling done by the Oregon State scientists is an effort to combine the two, and to show how species’ habitats will overlap as climate change compels both native and nonnative species in an area to migrate and cohabitate.
The researchers fear that this increased negative interaction could lead to local extinctions of some native salmonids, similar to those occurring among shrinking populations of bull and rainbow trout from invasive species in southeastern Alaska, Giannico said.

Deepfakes include imagery, video or audio that is produced or distributed without the consent of the subject and has been altered, potentially with artificial intelligence, to make it appear that a person is nude, partially nude or engaged in sexual conduct. To be clear, there are also deepfakes that are not sexually explicit, like the ones depicting politicians. However, for the purposes of this commentary, when I say “deepfakes” I am referring to sexually explicit deepfakes. 
In the past, celebrities and public figures were the most common targets for deepfakes. Perpetrators once needed hundreds of photos to create a deepfake. Now, with generative AI, a deepfake can be created with just a single photo, making anyone a potential victim. 
Victims of deepfakes often experience severe emotional distress and financial or reputational burdens. Victims may be threatened with physical or sexual violence. They may lose their job. They may pay thousands for an attorney, mental health support or to websites that monitor the internet for deepfakes to remove them. Some victims have died by suicide. 
If you’ve been a victim of a deepfake, know that it was not your fault. This is something that’s done to you, not something that you caused. We all have a right to access our phones, social media accounts or dating apps without experiencing sexual violence. 
Technology and AI themselves are not the problem though. Bad actors misusing technology to abuse, threaten and exploit others are. The good news is that there are steps we can take to prevent the creation and distribution of sexually explicit deepfakes. 
AI platforms need to have rules and guidelines in place to prevent the creation of deepfakes. Social media platforms need to have an easy way to report abuse, and they need to dedicate resources to removing sexual content. We know that platforms have a streamlined process for quickly reviewing and removing content for copyright purposes. They need to show the same dedication to removing nonconsensual intimate images. 
In North Dakota, lawmakers are actively working to prevent the creation and distribution of sexually explicit deepfakes. Sharing intimate images without or against consent is already against the law in North Dakota, and House Bill 1351 would make it a class A misdemeanor to produce, distribute or transmit sexually explicit deepfake images or videos. 
As individuals, we need to report deepfakes or other nonconsensual intimate material when we see it. We need to talk to our loved ones about online sexual violence and what warning signs to look out for so that we can report perpetrators before further abuse happens. 
Anyone can be a victim of a deepfake, but teens and young people are particularly vulnerable. If you’re a parent, talk to your kids about deepfakes and why creating and sharing them is harmful. Teach technology safety and make sure your children know that they can come to you for help if something happens to them. April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, so there is no time like the present to start these conversations. 
Finally, as North Dakotans, we need to examine how we think about and treat people online. We have a culture of “North Dakota nice,” but does that culture remain behind closed doors? The ultimate solution to ending the creation and distribution of deepfakes starts with asking ourselves, “Why are these images and videos being created in the first place?” Many perpetrators of deepfakes seek financial gain or power and control over the victim. But once we see our friends, neighbors and even strangers on the internet as equal, respectable people and not as sexual objects to be consumed, degraded and profited off of, we will address the root cause of deepfakes and sexual violence as a whole.

(Kevin Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)​A​ sweeping executive order ​from President Donald Trump​ w​ould overhaul the​ administration of U.S. elections​ and upend how they’re run in Colorado, but election experts in ​t​he state say the measure is unconstitutional​, and it already faces several legal challenges​.
The order, issued late last month, requires proof of citizenship to register to vote and vote, requires all ballots be counted on Election Day, and threatens federal funding for states that don’t comply, among other changes. On Thursday, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a lawsuit alongside other Democratic states challenging the order, saying it will cause imminent and irreparable harm to states and voters. 
“This elections executive order is an overreach by the White House and it threatens to undermine Colorado’s well-established gold standard for free and fair elections,” Weiser said in a statement. “That’s why we are challenging this illegal action and protecting our freedom to vote.”

Voting rights advocates and the Democratic National Committee have filed separate lawsuits challenging the legality of Trump’s order too. Doug Spencer, a professor at the University of Colorado who specializes in election law, said legal challenges to the order “will prevail.” He said the executive order is similar to others Trump has issued in that it attempts to take actions that are beyond the president’s authority.
“Some of the executive orders I think raise some interesting questions or novel questions, and some of them are just blatantly wrong, like if you’re born here, you’re not a citizen. That’s just blatantly wrong,” Spencer said, referring to Trump’s attempt to end the constitutional right to birthright citizenship. “That the president can dictate how states run their elections, even for federal offices, is just wrong. The Constitution has clear language: Congress has authority to do this, and Donald Trump is not Congress, so those lawsuits will be successful.”
Spencer said Colorado would have to change numerous aspects of how it conducts elections under Trump’s executive order, but he doesn’t see that becoming reality. He said the order may still have the political consequences Trump is looking for, though, in that it signals to Republicans in Congress and the states what he wants from them.
Aly Belknap, executive director of Colorado Common Cause, a nonprofit that works to defend democracy and voter rights, said Congress has already passed laws detailing what is required to register to vote in federal elections, and Trump cannot simply decide there are new requirements with an executive order.
“States really just need to resist these attempts to override state and federal law through the ongoing legal challenges, and we just really need states to reassert their right to control their own elections and the core of what our democracy is,” Belknap said.
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said the order “goes well beyond” the constitutional powers of the presidency. 
“Here in Colorado we’ve been very innovative and are one of the best states in the country in how we conduct our elections, and so federal overreach like this is not welcome,” Crane said.
Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, said the order is unlawful and would prevent eligible voters from casting a ballot. 
“The Trump administration is weaponizing the federal government and trying to make it harder for voters to fight back at the ballot box,” Griswold said in a statement when the order was first issued. “The United States has always led the world in conducting free and fair elections, and we cannot let Donald Trump end that legacy.”
Burden on voters
Spencer said verifying citizenship when registering to vote “has the potential to stop non-citizens from voting. The problem is, non-citizens aren’t voting, so there’s not really a problem to be solved.” He said it’s not easy to prove citizenship, and requiring everyone who wants to vote to do so could lead to citizens not being able to vote.
“There’s not really any evidence that there’s a problem in the first place, but you’re going to risk disfranchising people because of the challenges of the documents,” Spencer said.
Belknap said millions of Americans who are eligible to vote don’t have the proper form of ID the executive order would require from a voter, such as a passport or a birth certificate. 
“This is just really scary because it basically takes the responsibility to verify a person’s citizenship status from election officials — who do that now to ensure that non-citizens aren’t voting — and puts it on American voters, making them have to convince the government that they’re eligible to exercise the right to vote,” Belknap said. 
Denver Clerk and Recorder Paul López said Colorado already has systems in place to ensure only eligible voters cast a ballot in an election, with many opportunities to catch anything suspicious. He said the state verifies a voter’s registration information with various state agencies using their ID number, and once verified within Colorado’s voter database, they’ll use the Electronic Registration Information Center to compare with other states around the country. 
“It is really nothing more than an attempt to discourage and undermine voters of all stripes and of all backgrounds, especially people of color and naturalized citizens and even women, from engaging in the right to vote,” López said of the executive order. “This would dramatically impact folks whose name doesn’t match their original birth certificate because of marriage or divorce or anything else.”

López said instances of people who are not eligible to vote attempting to vote are very rare “because the system that we use works,” and if someone does try to vote illegally, they will be prosecuted. He also said undocumented immigrants are not trying to illegally participate in U.S. elections as Trump claims.  
“On its face there’s really just this baseless claim of fraud, especially amongst undocumented immigrants who are somehow voting in these elections,” López said. “It’s a false narrative and frankly it only serves to turn Americans against each other.”
Crane said if the order were enacted, Colorado voters would have to show proof of citizenship when registering for the first time, as well as every time they update their registration. The process would also have to take place in person, removing online registration as an option, and lines to vote in person would take much longer as election workers would have to verify documentation. 
Most Colorado voters already need to have their ballot to their county clerks office by 7 p.m. on Election Day to have it counted, but for military and overseas voters, their ballot can be counted up to eight days after Election Day so long as it’s postmarked on Election Day. Trump’s order would preclude ballots to be counted after Election Day.
“We believe our military voters deserve every opportunity to have their voice heard and so this executive order would walk that back, which seems insane,” Crane said. 
Belknap said the order could also hinder Colorado’s automatic voter registration process, as Division of Motor Vehicles employees would have to “assess customer citizenship status” during every interaction they have. 
“We’ve had this automatic motor registration at the DMV for many years now,”  Belknap said. “It’s how so many Coloradans get registered to vote originally when they get their permit or their drivers license, or when they move and have to update.” 
SAVE Act 
Republicans in Congress reintroduced the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, which would require proof of citizenship for anyone registering to vote nationwide. The bill poses a more substantial threat than Trump’s executive order because Congress actually has the power to legislate certain requirements for federal elections. Spencer said the SAVE Act includes some provisions Trump tried to address with his executive order related to citizenship and voting machine verification, but it’s not quite as far reaching. 
Two Colorado Republicans in Congress, Reps. Lauren Boebert of Windsor and Jeff Crank of Colorado Springs, are sponsors of SAVE Act.
The CCCA has taken a formal position against the SAVE Act. Crane said the measure is “poorly written” and would increase costs of conducting elections without providing the funding for those costs. 
With the potential for civil or criminal charges for election workers who unintentionally register an ineligible voter in the SAVE Act, Crane said it would also deter people from working as an election judge because they wouldn’t want to risk prosecution. 
“Nobody is out there right now — no clerk, no election judge — purposefully registering somebody who shouldn’t be registered,” Crane said. “If it does happen, it’s certainly on a very, very small scale now. But if you make a mistake, you could face five years in prison and you could be sued civilly. Who in their right mind is going to want to work in that environment?”
Crane said while it is important to ensure only citizens are voting, the Trump administration is looking to do so in a way that isn’t efficient without seeking alternative means. 
“They aren’t interested in having conversations with experts who do this work to figure out those better ways,” Crane said. “They’d much rather be informed by people who have been spreading disinformation for the last four years and spreading lies and legislating based on disinformation rather than fact, and that’s a very dangerous place to be.”
López said Trump intentionally spreads misinformation — particularly the false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen — to undermine voters and create distrust to the point that eligible voters won’t want to vote. Ultimately, López said he thinks that’s Trump’s main goal. 
“He doesn’t like who’s coming out to vote, so let’s stifle it rather than fighting a fair fight in a fair election and talking about the facts,” López said. 
Claims of widespread fraud in recent U.S. elections have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, and the courts.
López said “in the age of misinformation,” he encouraged all voters to go “straight to the source” and ask their local elections officials any questions they have about their voter registration or how their vote is counted. 
“Our voters can expect the same level of excellence from their clerk and recorder’s office, from the elections division, as they are used to — the same fair, secure and accessible model that leads the nation,” López said.

(Photo courtesy of Carol Bansley)A $1 billion cut to the U.S. Department of Agriculture is expected to remove dependable protein sources for food banks in Arkansas, where one in five people lacked access to adequate food in 2023 — the nation’s highest rate.
The cuts are also expected to slash significant earnings for local farmers who participated in the USDA’s Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program (LFPA) and the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program (LFS). The programs became effective in Arkansas in the fall of 2022 upon established USDA contracts.
Former Arkansas Department of Human Services Secretary Cindy Gillespie and current Agriculture Secretary Wes Ward both commended the program contracts at the time they were signed in USDA-issued press releases. Gillespie praised the LFPA program for its goal to bring nutritious food to Arkansas families and Ward said LFS would help strengthen the state’s multibillion- dollar agriculture industry.
When asked for a statement about the federal cuts, Ward’s chief of staff referred questions to the USDA or the Arkansas Department of Education, which distributes the funds.
During the approximate two years the programs were active, the ADE distributed nearly $9.3 million combined, which helped stock 91 schools and eight food banks or distributors with locally grown products. Four dozen farmers participated in the programs, according to the ADE.
Education Department spokesperson Kimberly Mundell said the state had about $1.8 million in  LFPA funds remaining as of April 2, and “We have not been informed of any funding cuts.”
The Northeast Arkansas Food Bank received two cycles of funding from the LFPA program, Chief Executive Officer Christie Jordan said. What remains of its latest $500,000 allocation is expected to be spent within the next few months, in line with the state’s fiscal year, she said.

“The LFPA program was a steady source of fresh protein for us to distribute to people in northeast Arkansas, [and] that’s the largest impact that losing this particular stream of funding will have on our organization” she said.
Charitable food organizations largely rely on donations, and protein is a nutritional category that often comes up short. Jordan said the NEA Food Bank sources foods it lacks in donations, which is often fresh meats, fruits and vegetables.
The NEA Food Bank serves 12 counties, but it reaches residents in all 75 through partnerships.
“This loss will be felt statewide,” Jordan said. “There are farm partnerships that will feel this impact, and the food banks will be looking to source food differently because of the loss of this.”
Jordan said the funding loss will change the composition of the food the organization can provide, but she’s still figuring out how to offset the financial loss. Despite losing the federal assistance, Jordan said she is grateful funding wasn’t cut immediately and she has a few months to plan for the next fiscal year.
“I have every confidence that we will be able to continue to provide the same volume of food, but that composition of what is offered will change,” she said.
Similarly, Northwest Arkansas Food Bank President and CEO Kent Eikenberry said he’s in somewhat of a limbo stage where he’s brainstorming what alternative funding sources he can use to cover the gap.

“We are so fortunate to [be] in a position where we are not dependent upon the federal government in order to distribute food to those people who need help,” he said. 
Eikenberry didn’t provide the exact figure the NWA Food Bank received through the LFPA program. It “wasn’t a huge amount, but it’s something that we’ll just roll into our operational expenses,” he said.
With the “bonus” federal assistance, Eikenberry said he purchased ground beef to offer a new protein option in a poultry-heavy area. Moving forward, he said he expects to continue his commitment to do whatever is necessary to serve the region.
“If I didn’t think I could come up with a solution, I wouldn’t need to be in this chair,” he said.
Farmers lose financial deals, future opportunities 
The crux of the USDA programs is that local farmers would benefit from selling their product to food banks and school districts. Nearly 50 Arkansas farmers participated, from small-scale family operations to regionally known businesses.
For Bansley’s Berkshire Ridge Farm, a family operation in Harrison, losing the LFPA funding means missing out on more than $25,000 a month, Carol Bansley said.
Native Iowans, the Bansleys moved to Arkansas in 2013 and established their farm two years later, primarily raising pigs on their 250 acres.

Since participating in the LFPA program, Bansley said she has organized monthly sales with the Northeast Arkansas Food Bank in Jonesboro and a food shelter in Conway. Combined, Bansley estimated her farm was providing 3,000 pounds of protein to the organizations, which typically would have been stored away.
“[LFPA] was very nice because it took the product that we might have had excess of,” she said. “…We just have to figure out something so we don’t get that stockpile again, which will be a true bummer. Good meats were going to a good cause. It’s unfortunate.”
Bansley’s farm also sells to restaurants in Northwest Arkansas, she said. The customers they’ve already established will keep business afloat, but the additional funds made it easier to improve farm infrastructure, Bansley said.
“We got new feed bins, we added fences and we got some more housing,” Bansley said, noting that normally only one improvement is made each year.
Bansley said the loss of funding will have a significant impact on the farm’s annual earnings, but operations will return to how they ran before the programs were established.
More than 70 miles west in Pea Ridge, Shimizu Farms operator David Welch said the loss of the opportunity to participate in the federal programs feels “terrible.”
Shimizu Farms’ hydroponic lettuce and basil farm started three years ago, and Welch said he was considering expanding to a second greenhouse, but has put those plans on pause given the news of the federal cuts.

Because the operation is set indoors, Welch can grow and provide fresh produce year-round. Currently, he averages 825 heads a lettuce weekly, which he sells to nearby food distributors. Welch didn’t sell directly to food banks that received federal funding through LFPA because of his small volume, but he was considering contracting with schools under the LFS program.
Now, he doesn’t expect to have the opportunity to do either.
“I think as a farmer, obviously, we love when our product can be out into the community, especially for some of our underrepresented groups,” Welch said. “And when we’re losing that opportunity, it definitely hurts morale. It hurts us as farmers. It hurts the underrepresented groups.”

Trickle-down effect
Organizers of food banks that don’t receive federal funds also feel  pressure from the federal cuts, presuming their dependable regional funding sources will now become more competitive. 
Project HOPE Food Bank in Hot Springs doesn’t receive federal grants to purchase the food it supplies to its 70 nonprofit partners, but assistant director Becky Chote said she expects the USDA cuts will still result in less food available to hungry families.
Project HOPE is privately funded, and Chote said state and regional grants will likely become more competitive without available federal options. With residents’ pocketbooks also bearing the impact of higher prices at the grocery store, the food bank could face fewer community donations, Chote said.
“It looks like it’s going to be a tough situation,” she said. “I hope I’m wrong, but it looks pretty tough out here.”
Without a clear sense of the implications of the federal slashing, Chote said she is left guessing what will really happen.

She said she’s unsure what will become of the existing produce giveaway at local subsidized senior housing, where short shelf-life foods like salads are distributed before they spoil. Chote doesn’t know how much of a subsidy the food bank will be able to provide to its partners if the cost of food rises. Once Project HOPE has to shell out more money for its wholesale product, the cost to distributors would likely rise as well, she said.
“That’s the really scary part about all this, is we don’t really know which way it’s going to go,” she said.
One thing Chote is pretty confident in is that she believes children and seniors will be most impacted by the changes at the federal level. 
Children in Arkansas experience hunger at a higher rate than children in all but one other state. In 2022, one in four kids faced food insecurity, according to a report from Feeding America, a national nonprofit that collaborates with food banks and other meal assistance programs. 
Chote also said she’s fearful of the negative impacts of introducing tariffs, generally.
“For kids to have the opportunity to have fresh foods is just amazing, and this is really kind of greedy,” she said. “We have about 101 different products in our food bank. You would be astonished to know how few are made here in the U.S. Any kind of tariffs are going to cause more hunger, as far as we can see.”
On April 2, Trump announced he would impose a 10% base tariff on international goods, with some countries facing higher levies. The universal tariff becomes effective on April 5.

(Helaina Thompson | Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.











A lot of these farmers, they're living their dreams.

“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system

	In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

Bernie Satrom, R-Jamestown, speaks on the House floor on March 25, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The state may soon start development on a new website detailing its Legacy Fund holdings after the North Dakota Senate last week unanimously passed an investment transparency bill.
The Legacy Fund, worth more than $12 billion as of January, is a state trust fund supported by oil revenue. It was created by a ballot measure approved by voters in 2010 with the goal of being a source of perpetual revenue for the state. 
House Bill 1319, sponsored by Rep. Bernie Satrom, R-Jamestown, says the website must include all Legacy Fund “companies, funds and other financial mechanisms in which the Legacy Fund is invested,” so long as the information may be disclosed under state and federal law.
“Some people don’t care what they’re invested in,” Satrom said in February testimony on the bill before the House Finance and Taxation Committee. “To me, it matters.”
The North Dakota Retirement and Investment Office estimated the cost for the website at about $421,000, according to a fiscal note attached to the bill. It said it would cost around $27,500 annually to maintain the website.
The House in February approved the bill by a vote of 92-1.
The Retirement and Investment Office also supports the bill. Interim Executive Director Jodi Smith said that the agency already shares a wealth of information online about the fund, but a new website could make it more straightforward for members of the public to digest.

“I feel like all that language and information is on our website, but if you’ve been on our website and try to find it all, it can be a bit cumbersome,” Smith said. “It’s not easy to navigate.”
The office expects the website to save both state employees and members of the public a lot of time and effort.
Smith said that about a third of records requests filed with the Retirement and Investment Office relate to the Legacy Fund. The agency has dedicated thousands of dollars worth of staff time to fulfilling the records requests, she said. 
Getting a website up and running will take a long time, Smith said. The agency hopes to have an interface similar to one that Norway uses for its sovereign wealth fund, which allows visitors to sort all of its investments by country.
“It might take us a couple of years to get there,” she said.
The Retirement and Investment Office already discloses how much Legacy Fund money is invested in particular companies, Smith said.
However, for a portion of the money invested in commingled funds, the agency does not disclose which investments are made by specific fund managers. Smith said this would violate the agency’s contracts with those managers. About $3.1 billion of the Legacy Fund is in these commingled funds, also known as institutional funds.
“We can’t reveal a fund manager’s investment strategy,” she said.
Bismarck attorney Tory Jackson last year asked for the North Dakota Attorney General’s Office to weigh in on whether the Retirement and Investment Office violated public records laws by withholding this information.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong during his campaign for governor advocated for more transparency with Legacy Fund investments. He is now chair of the State Investment Board. Another Legacy Fund-related bill sponsored by Satrom, House Bill 1330, would instruct the State Investment Board to divest from all Chinese companies. The Senate has yet to vote on the bill.

(Stock photo by EyeEm Mobile GmbH/Getty Images Plus)LINCOLN — State lawmakers are looking to boost action by recent governors to combat suicide in Nebraska through new legislation with an extra focus on veterans and their families.
Legislative Bill 414, by State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, would house a new suicide mortality review team in the Nebraska Department of Veterans’ Affairs. The team would review the circumstances around any suicides in the state generally, with an extra focus on veterans with the location. Dungan called the bill a “first step” toward working to prevent future suicides and said it would “help Nebraska as a whole.”
“Having this established review team in the Department of Veterans’ Affairs would be a game changer for our veterans dealing with mental health issues and for Nebraskans struggling with mental illness across the entire state,” Dungan said last week during floor debate.

LB 414, which advanced 37-0, follows efforts from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, seeking similar reviews at the state and community level.
Former Gov. Pete Ricketts, now in the U.S. Senate, joined the “Governor’s Challenge to Prevent Suicide Among Service Members, Veterans and their Families” in 2022. Nebraska joined the suicide mortality review efforts under Gov. Jim Pillen in 2024. 
Review team responsibilities
With Pillen’s support, Nebraska leaders have met monthly for such reviews and received federal funding to help, too. Dungan’s bill would put the team into state law with additional structure.
Among the team’s duties would be developing a data collection system, conducting an annual analysis of the incidences and causes of suicides in the state during the prior fiscal year, creating protocols for such investigations, studying the adequacy of laws and training to determine possible changes to help prevent suicides and educating the public.

Upon request of the agency director, a county attorney or the Nebraska attorney general could subpoena to request relevant records.
The suicide mortality review team established by LB 414 would include:

The director or designee of the state Veterans’ Affairs Department.
A representative of the Nebraska Violent Death Reporting System.
A representative of Nebraska Local Outreach to Suicide Loss Survivors.
A representative of the Division of Behavioral Health in the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.
An education administrator.
A hospital representative.
An emergency medical services representative.
A member of law enforcement.
A mental health professional or licensed clinical social worker.
A veteran representative.
Additional members as needed.

An annual report would be required by April 1 summarizing the data by cause of death, factors contributing to the death, age, sex, race, geographic location and date of death. The report could include recommendations to prevent additional suicides.
Mental health importance
Dungan said he has attended the monthly meetings where mental health officials, law enforcement, county attorneys and others get involved. He said the team, for example, had identified a motel with a high number of suicides happening on the property.

The motel later received a grant for staff suicide awareness and prevention training, which was successful, Dungan said. But when the funding stopped, the impact reversed.
Dungan said there is already a database for violent death reporting and that nothing in his bill would jeopardize privacy protections.
“I care about this issue a lot. Mental health and the results that come from poor mental health care and other various things are incredibly close and near and dear to us,” Dungan said at his bill’s hearing. “I just want to make sure we take this bill very seriously.”
Speaker John Arch of La Vista selected LB 414 as one of his 25 speaker priority bills for the 2025 session.
‘We all know stories’
Jenifer Acierno, legal counsel for the Nebraska Veterans’ Affairs Department, testified in favor of the bill at its March 6 hearing. She said LB 414 “provides the opportunity to coordinate the next steps in combating veteran suicide.”
The Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee unanimously advanced LB 414, including State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County, one of three veterans on the committee.

Andersen, the committee vice chair and a 21-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force, described the issue as a “delicate dance” of ensuring privacy while making certain the suicide mortality review team gets access to all the context of the situation and how a person “got to the place where suicide was the only way out.”
He added that he knows people who have committed suicide and urged Dungan to include a veteran on the review team, who he said might have a background critical in identifying areas not readily apparent to civilians. His idea was ultimately included in an amendment that lawmakers adopted 36-0. Andersen suggested future work to identify high-risk veterans earlier to provide help.
“We’ve been in situations where we understand why they get where they get, and whatever we can do to isolate in advance and help bring them back [would help them] get on with a productive life,” Andersen said. “Kudos to you for bringing the bill.”
Dungan thanked Andersen, as well as State Sens. Dan McKeon of Amherst and Dan Lonowski of Hastings, the other two veterans on the committee, for their service. 
“Suicide is one of those things that I think affects all of us, even if it’s tangential,” Dungan said at the hearing. “We all know stories, and so I think it’s something we have to take care of sooner than later.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.

The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration.

We are an open enrollment family, meaning that even though we don’t live in the district, we choose to send our kids to MPS because we love our public school’s mission, curriculum, and teachers. But right now, my daughter’s school is closed. Not because of a snowstorm or a spring break, but because the building is so contaminated with lead that it is undergoing emergency remediation. 
As we work to unravel how deep the lead problem goes and how we’re going to fix it, we know that two things are true: 1) the incompetence and lack of qualifications of some MPS staff has put our children in harm’s way, and 2) this is the result of decades of intentional neglect from state policymakers who starve public schools of the resources needed to keep them safe and functional. While there’s blame to go around within the school system, it extends far beyond Milwaukee—all the way to the statehouse.
But let’s take a step back for a moment: imagine a thriving community garden. Lush with fruits and veggies, it’s a vibrant hub of cooperation. Gardeners, volunteers, and neighbors work side by side, cultivating a space that nourishes the entire community. 
And now, imagine a group of lawmakers find out about this garden and see it not for what it provides to the community, but as an opportunity for political favors. They want it. But they can’t take it outright—not yet. So instead they sabotage it, slowly and methodically.
First, they put limits on water usage. Next, they dilute the fertilizer. Then, they restrict access to tools, making it harder for the gardeners to do their work. As the plants begin to wither, the weeds take over. The once-thriving garden now appears neglected and struggling, despite the community doing their best with what they’ve been given. 
Then, the lawmakers point the finger at the very people who have been desperately trying to keep the garden alive. “You’re failing.” they say. 
And with that, they present their “solution.” “This garden can’t be saved,” they declare. “It’s time to give this land to someone who can do something with it.”
So they sell the land to a private company—one that rips out the plants and paves over the garden to install a private- pay parking lot. The community is locked out, the public loses, and the private company profits. “It’s better for everyone this way,” the lawmakers insist, knowing full well who really benefits.
But they aren’t done yet. In return for their part in the heist, they collect their rewards—  campaign donations, future job offers. A shared community resource is gone, transformed into private gain.
This is what’s happening to Milwaukee Public Schools.
Most MPS parents love and appreciate so much about our own public schools for the vibrant, nurturing communities they are—and for all they could be with the right support. But for years, some lawmakers in Madison have been quietly undermining our public education system — capping resources, limiting access and restricting funding. They’ve been misrepresenting outdated formulas to intentionally starve our public schools, making it harder for teachers and administrators to provide the quality education our kids deserve. Milwaukee voters recently passed a big referendum because people in the community want to support our schools. The news about poor financial reporting that followed that successful referendum drive was extremely discouraging. But problems with school administration pale in comparison to the impossible conditions the state has created for our schools. When they inevitably struggle under those conditions (frustrating every singe one of us) the same lawmakers who have been withholding funds shake their heads and blame the administrators and educators who have been forced to do more with less.
What happens next? They argue that public schools have failed and insist that privatization is the only answer. They push to divert public funds into private hands — voucher schools, for-profit education corporations and other institutions that lack the transparency and accountability of public education, but promise big profits for those in power.
They spout platitudes about how much they care about improving education, but they have had every chance to help us nourish our gardens and have resisted at every turn. We cannot let them gaslight us into dismantling a public good for private enrichment and turning our children’s future into a business model that benefits the few at the expense of the many.
Because here’s the truth: Our public schools are not failing. They are being sabotaged. There are some powerful Madison lawmakers who are forcing our school administrators to choose between things like fixing peeling paint in classrooms or hiring a new teacher, all so they can have someone to blame– when in reality, they themselves are the ones who have failed to provide enough for our kids to thrive in all the ways they deserve. They’ve been playing us for a long con, but we’re onto them. 
We must demand true nourishment and resources for our public schools. We must reject the false narrative of “failure” that is being used to justify their destruction. And we must hold lawmakers accountable for the choices they make—because our children’s education should never be for sale.
This year, Madison lawmakers will decide how resources are allocated to our schools through the state budget process. The State Joint Finance Committee is currently holding public listening sessions on the budget. They need to hear from all of us what our kids need and deserve. We must work together to ensure our public schools– where so much of our kids’ childhoods happen– are deeply nourished for the good of us all.

Her funeral was Sunday at a church in Seminole followed by a private burial.
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited the West Texas town that has been the epicenter of the outbreak Sunday and was expected to meet with the family.
“My intention was to come down here quietly to console the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief,” Kennedy wrote on social media. He went on to describe the resources he deployed to Texas in March after another school-aged child died from measles, claiming that the “growth rates for new cases and hospitalizations have flattened” since Kennedy sent a team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state reported 59 new cases in three days last week.
The child who died Thursday, Daisy Hildebrand, was not vaccinated and had no known underlying health conditions, said a spokesperson for University Medical Center in Lubbock, where she had been hospitalized. She died from “measles pulmonary failure,” the Texas Department of State Health Services reported Sunday.
“This unfortunate event underscores the importance of vaccination,” Vice President of University Medical Center Aaron Davis said in a statement. “We encourage all individuals to stay current with their vaccinations to help protect themselves and the broader community.”

The death comes about five weeks after unvaccinated 6-year-old Kayley Fehr died from measles, the first such death in the country in a decade. Fehr’s parents said that their stance on vaccination did not change after their daughter’s death.
The West Texas outbreak has sickened 481 people, most of whom are unvaccinated children, according to the state health department.
The outbreak began in Gaines County, located about 90 minutes southwest of Lubbock on the New Mexico border. Since then, cases have been reported in 18 other Texas counties, as far east as Erath County in central Texas.
The CDC has linked the Texas outbreak with measles cases in Oklahoma and New Mexico, where an unvaccinated individual who tested positive for measles died in March. And the World Health Organization reported that cases in Mexico were linked to Texas.
NM reports six more measles cases

Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through respiratory droplets passed through the air by breathing, coughing and sneezing. Vaccination is the safest way to build immunity to the virus. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93% effective, according to the CDC.
Measles was officially eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 following a highly successful vaccination program. But vaccine skeptics, fueled by misinformation and a disdain for COVID-era mandates, have sown distrust of public health and contributed to declining rates of vaccination. In Gaines County, 82% of kindergarteners are up to date on their MMR vaccine. Experts say communities need a 95% threshold to prevent the spread of measles.
A CDC spokesperson said in an email that Kennedy’s visit to Texas on Sunday resulted in discussions with Texas state health officials to deploy a second CDC response team to West Texas to further assist with the state’s efforts to protect its residents against measles and its complications.
Dr. Manisha Patel, incident manager for the CDC, said their team arrived in Gaines County in March and left on April 1. A spokesperson for the CDC said in light of today’s news and Kennedy’s order to re-deploy, another team will be in the county.
“We’re learning a lot in Gaines County on how we can help other jurisdictions also prepare for measles in their states,” Patel said.
Patel said it’s important to go in with a sensitive approach when it comes to small, close-knit communities that are unvaccinated.

However, she said there are three pieces to their measles control measures: the vaccine, not traveling if you’re exposed, and staying at home.
“MMR is the best way to protect yourself, your families, your communities against measles,” Patel said. “And, if you’re starting to get very sick from measles, not to delay care.”
Patel said for some communities, it’s important to find trusted messengers. In some cases, she said, the federal government might not be the best choice for that and it has to be someone in the community. To work around this, Patel said they’ve worked directly with state and local health departments to find who the trusted messengers are.
“Our role is making sure those trusted messengers have the materials and information they need,” Patel said. “So we translate, for example, materials into a German or Spanish or whatever the community needs.”

State health officials have said that the outbreak could persist for months. It has spread most quickly in pockets of Texas with below-average vaccination rates. In Gaines County, where a large unvaccinated Mennonite community resides, 315 people have been infected.
People infected with measles usually experience symptoms within a week or two of exposure. Early symptoms include high fever, runny nose and watery eyes. A few days later, a rash breaks out on the face and then spreads down the neck to the rest of the body. Infected individuals are contagious about four days before the rash appears and up to four days after, according to state health officials.
Doctors typically recommend all children get two doses of the MMR vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 through 15 months and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age.
Parents of infants aged 6 to 11 months living in outbreak areas should consult their pediatrician about getting the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, Sara Safarzadeh Amiri, chief medical officer for Odessa Regional Medical Center and Scenic Mountain Medical Center, said on Sunday.
Amiri said she was unaware of the second reported death but that it is not unexpected given the continued spread of the outbreak.
So far, 56 measles patients in Texas have been hospitalized, according to state health officials.

From gutting the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to eliminating funding for local food programs, these policies threaten the nutrition and well-being of people in need. 
In early March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) terminated $1 billion for programs that help food banks and schools purchase food from local farms, a move that disappointed food and agriculture advocates and drew sharp criticism from 31 U.S. Senators. Soon after, USDA cancelled millions of dollars in funding for food deliveries to food banks. The 29 million children who eat school lunch and 50 million people receiving charitable food assistance—two vulnerable groups in society—will lose access to fresh produce when grocery prices are already sky high.  
The USDA’s Local Food Purchasing Assistance (LFPA) and Local Food for Schools (LFS) Cooperative Agreement Programs help supply fresh food from local producers to feeding institutions like food banks and to schools and childcare facilities, respectively. These programs are a triple win for beneficiaries, the farmers and ranchers in over 40 states, and local economies. 
LFPA alone has generated over $1.5 billion of local economic activity since the program began in December 2021. And the loss of LFS is devastating to schools, whose meal programs were already struggling with rising food costs.

In Louisiana, advocates have witnessed the benefits of LFPA and LFS on community health and the economy as they have seen farmers expanding vegetable production every year and cattle farmers selling local beef to the school systems. The loss to the state is immense, resulting in less healthy food and less local purchasing power for schools and food banks.  
In West Virginia, the state was set to receive over $2 million in LFPA funds, with 90% of the food producers classified as underserved. “This is not a handout, but a critical market opportunity for farmers,” said Spencer Moss, executive director of West Virginia Food and Farm Coalition. “Just as we’re finally seeing meaningful progress, the support is being withdrawn. This isn’t about any single farm or food bank; it’s about supporting rural communities and investing in their future.” 
 Meanwhile, SNAP, the nation’s first line of defense against hunger, is also on the chopping block. SNAP promotes health, lowers healthcare costs, and serves as an economic stabilizer during recessions, and 40% of program participants are children. Yet the latest budget resolution proposed by House Republicans in Washington would cut at least $230 billion from agriculture programs over the next decade, the lion’s share of which will be taken from SNAP. 
Anti-hunger and public health advocates have long called for increased SNAP funding, and USDA’s own study found that over half of SNAP participants found it difficult to eat healthily because of the lack of affordable foods. This drastic budget cut would worsen food security and increase health care costs over time. Taking food away from children and families to fund a tax break for the wealthy, the prime object of the benefit reductions, is immoral.  
In the name of promoting health, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary has pushed for banning soda purchases with SNAP benefits, a position supported by the USDA. National and state efforts have increasingly aimed to prevent participants from purchasing these items with at least 10 state bills focused on SNAP restrictions introduced this year. 
However, there is little evidence showing that removing soda from the program does much to improve diet quality for SNAP participants. And when asked about ways to make the program healthier, people with low incomes, including SNAP users, consistently placed this low on this list. Furthermore, restricting SNAP purchases does nothing to address the root causes of food insecurity — adverse economic conditions and racial inequities. 
The Trump administration wants to slash SNAP benefits, take healthy food away from students, and weaken rural economies to pad the pockets of billionaires. These actions do not promote health and instead inflict hardships on people with low incomes. It’s high time for the administration to align its alleged commitment to health by restoring and expanding funds to these crucial programs.

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)As a mother and a rural family physician who provides obstetrics and gynecological care in Idaho, I see everyday how severe legal restrictions work to prevent safe medical treatment and instead result in unnecessarily dangerous pregnancy care. 
Last week, to mark the end of Women’s History Month, I traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with members of Congress in the Democratic Women’s Caucus to speak out against the many attacks we are seeing nationwide and the consequences of abortion bans on patients in Idaho and across the country in this post Roe world. 
For example, St. Luke’s Health System — the largest medical provider in Idaho — bravely took up the challenge to Idaho’s near-total abortion ban last month because the Trump administration’s Department of Justice dropped the previous administration’s defense of EMTALA, the federal law requiring hospitals that receive Medicare funds to provide stabilizing emergency care — including abortion. 
An Idaho federal judge issued a temporary restraining order that allows only St. Luke’s physicians to stabilize patients with abortion care, when necessary, rather than follow Idaho’s near-total abortion ban. 
A health system is fighting Idaho’s abortion ban. It’s not its first controversial stance.

This means that whether or not patients can receive life-saving emergency care in Idaho depends on which ER they choose. Every other hospital and provider in Idaho will once again be forced to airlift patients out of state or wait until a patient’s condition becomes a situation in which termination will prevent death before they can intervene to provide the necessary care. 
Abortion bans are killing women, and instead of taking steps to protect access to lifesaving medical care, Trump and Republican extremists are working behind-the-scenes to roll back the rights of millions of American women and doctors even further. 
My life’s work is about ensuring the wellbeing of all my patients by providing the best possible medical care I can, and making sure that every decision I make will help give them a long and happy future. 
When I was living in a small town in Western Colorado teaching high school, I became drawn to the idea of becoming a rural family practice physician as I got to know some of the families that lived there and the family doctors that cared for them. The concept of providing “birth to death” care, and getting to know a family’s story at a deeper level across the generations was inspirational to me. 
Idaho is a wonderful state filled with amazing families that I have had the pleasure of providing care and support to. However, extreme politicians jeopardize the ability of medical practitioners like myself to provide care especially during cases of an emergency where a patient’s life is at stake. 
As a physician, I can tell you that delaying care for a patient with a medical emergency is extremely dangerous and can lead to serious complications. Medical emergencies must be addressed immediately and comprehensively. 
With the current abortion bans in place, doctors outside of the St. Luke’s system may be prevented from providing the medical standard of care for a pregnant patient who is hemorrhaging until their health deteriorates enough to provide treatment to prevent her death. 
I will not remain on the sidelines in this moment. I choose instead to speak out against efforts to restrict the freedom of families to make decisions about their lives and futures. Medical decisions should be taking place as a protected conversation between patients and their doctor, without government intrusion. 
The vast majority of Americans support reproductive freedom and abortion access. Polling shows that 61% of Americans disagree with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and a majority of Americans (8 in 10) say that the decision to have an abortion should be between the pregnant person and their doctor. 
As I reflect on what Women’s History Month means to me, I am inspired by leaders like Eleanor Roosevelt, who used her position as first lady to push for progressive legislation and to speak up for women and other marginalized communities of her time. 
She once said, “the world of the future is in our making. Tomorrow is now.” 
If we are going to protect women and patients impacted by the abortion bans sweeping the nation, we must ensure that doctors, and all health care providers have the necessary tools and resources to save every life they can. When families and patients go into the emergency room, they should never be told that medical standards of care are illegal. 
It’s been the honor of a lifetime to dedicate my livelihood to providing care to my patients. I will continue to be an advocate for reproductive freedom because I am passionate about carrying out my oath to my patients. I hope that the mark I leave on history is that I not only fought for my patients in the exam room, but also in the Statehouse, the courthouse and the public square.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee’s 2nd Congressional District clearly doesn’t like or do town hall meetings.
He did one in 2019 during his first year in Congress in Grainger County. Rutledge, the county seat, has a population of 1,331 while all of Grainger County is 24,681.
Burchett shows up at well-controlled and politically safe events and photo opportunities in parts of his district like Lenoir City, Maryville or Maynardville. He also can be found in front of the cameras of right-wing cable TV chat shows, or failing to answer questions on CNN.
He tends to avoid the city of Knoxville — with a population of 198,162, the center of his district  — where people have had the temerity to challenge his notions, and have been known to vote for his Democratic Party challengers. He also routinely ducks debates with those challengers, failing to do so in 2020, 2022, and 2024.
So, it wasn’t surprising that Burchett, along with Tennessee’s U. S. Senators Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty — all three were invited — skipped the recent Congressional Recess Town Hall on the evening of March 21 at the Deane Hill Recreation Center in suburban Knoxville.  Burchett sent an email declining to attend.  One moderator, Steve Dupree, said, “I’ve known Tim for a long time; and I’m not surprised.  We effectively do not have representation in this district.”
Two local politicians — state Reps. Sam McKenzie and Gloria Johnson, both Democrats — did show up for the event sponsored by progressive groups Indivisible Knoxville and Moms Demand Action, and handled the question-and-answer section.
The event drew more than 300 people.  Speakers included labor leaders and other local people invited to speak to the audience about how cuts from President Donald Trump and his top campaign contributor, unelected interloper Elon Musk, had already or soon would harm them.  Signs dotted the enthusiastic crowd.  One read, “Burchett is MIA.”  Another read, “Fire Musk. Not Veterans.” My favorite was one saying, “Keep your grubbing hands off our Social Security.”
In Nashville, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren fires up crowd with Trump, Musk criticism 

Town halls recently have gone embarrassingly wrong for congressional Republicans.  Constituents are furious at Trump and Musk. It turns out that false promises of reduced prices are almost as unpopular as pardoning insurrectionists, cutting needed public health programs, laying off veterans, abandoning global allies, and threatening Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.
That likely is why Richard Hudson, the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, recently said GOP congressmen should hide behind choices like livestreamed events or virtual town halls. The explicit message was to avoid open in-person town halls; the implicit message was “we’re not really interested in changing our policies or listening to these constituents, so put on a well-controlled show.”
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson echoed the approach.  He said, “You can do it in telephone town halls. You can have small subgroups of people from different industries and segments of the community. We find that to be very, very productive, and more productive than if you just go to an open forum right now. Why? Because we’ve seen this movie before. George Soros-funded groups and others literally pay protesters.”
Burchett opined, “I think they just urged us to be more targeted and where’s, who we’re talking to, because it’s pretty clear that they’ve got professional instigators, people that are showing up that are not even constituents.”
Perhaps Rep. David Kustoff, a Republican representing the 8th District, was excessively worried about a planned sign waving protest by the Germantown Democratic Club. His schedule event in late March at Our Lady of Perpetual Help was cancelled due to alleged security concerns. The same night an empty chair stood in for 7th District Rep. Mark Green at a town hall meeting in Clarksville.
First District Rep. Diana Harshbarger had a public meeting on February 28th that didn’t go well. The audience disputed her claims and scoffed at her recitation of Trump talking points. At one point a woman was kicked out for repeatedly asking her a question she didn’t answer about persons who are born intersex.
Protestors have been urging the 3rd District’s Chuck Fleischmann to hold a public meeting  Reps. Scott Desjarlais and Andy Ogles, 4th and 5th  Districts respectively, have not held a recent town hall, while the 6th District’s John Rose has been too busy putting together a gubernatorial campaign.
The only Democrat in Tennessee’s congressional delegation, Steve Cohen of the 9th District in Memphis, held a town hall and he tallied 750 people showing up for a thorough and respectful discussion.
I found nothing but constituents (and no paid agitators) at the Deane Hill Rec Center Town Hall, but I am still perturbed that my congressman, Burchett, responds to his constituents with an amateurish dodge. In one recent social media post, Burchett wrote, “We got a lot of work to do. Pray for your country, and dadgummit hold us accountable. Don’t let us start making stupid excuses.”
Dadgummit, Tim, we’re trying. Show up for the town halls and the debates.

(zimmytws | Getty Images)Last week West Virginians sent a clear message: Don’t cut Medicaid. 
In overwhelming numbers, families, advocates and health care providers turned out to reject House Bill 3518, and called on their legislators to reject this dangerous proposal that would have automatically eliminated the Medicaid expansion — and with it health care for 166,000 West Virginians — if federal funding for the program was reduced by even 1%. 
While this bill was moved to the inactive calendar after swift public and lawmaker pushback, the fight isn’t over. Medicaid remains at risk — not just at the state level, but also in ongoing federal budget negotiations in Washington, D.C. 
Medicaid is a lifeline for West Virginia families, seniors, people with disabilities, low-income adults and children. Today, nearly one in three West Virginians rely on Medicaid for their health care. Cuts to the program would mean fewer doctor visits, fewer life-saving prescriptions, and more families forced to choose between paying rent and affording care. For providers, it would mean more uncompensated care, lower reimbursements, job losses and potentially even closures of medical centers.  
We know what happens when funding is cut. Hospitals, especially in rural areas, suffer financially. People go without care, and preventable conditions turn into medical crises. Mental health coverage and substance use treatment, care that was inaccessible to many West Virginians without Medicaid, will become harder to reach. Hospitals and providers, already operating on thin margins, will be at greater risk of closing their doors. That’s why West Virginians are speaking out, urging Sens. Shelley Moore Capito and Jim Justice, as well as Reps. Carol Miller and Riley Moore, to reject any federal budget cuts to Medicaid. 
Just as HB 3518 could have ended health coverage for 166,000 people, but was described in committee as a bill that “did nothing” unless Congress took action, West Virginians must be on alert for Medicaid cuts disguised as harmless or “cutting waste,” but that have real consequences and shift costs onto states and families. 
Work reporting requirements, reductions to federal matching rates, and other changes that impact Medicaid financing mechanisms all shift Medicaid costs onto the state budget, where state lawmakers have warned they will not fill the gap. If these changes are enacted, the loss of Medicaid funding will result in cuts to enrollment, fewer services covered, reduced reimbursements to providers, or some combination of the three. 
West Virginians can’t afford state or federal cuts to Medicaid. We need our congressional delegation to fight for a budget that prioritizes people — not the interests of the wealthy few. If they truly represent the interests of their constituents, they will protect Medicaid and ensure that every West Virginian, regardless of income, has access to the health care they need.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Political pandering: the act of expressing one’s views in accordance with the likes of a group to which one is attempting to appeal for the purpose of drawing support up to and including votes and do not necessarily reflect one’s personal values.
Absurd! And yet, this political pandering is becoming a core issue on the federal, state and local terrains. As such, it comes very close — too close — to preventing any real, definitive action in enacting legislation that would result in anything of real value. And knowing of the deep-seated trend makes us question the validity of the actions of our legislative leaders. Do they have our best interests at heart, or do they have their best interests at heart — i.e., what propels their own political aspirations? 
We don’t have to dig too deep to find examples of politicians not only tweaking their positions but making complete turnarounds. Politicians have always been careful in their positions of where they stand, depending on the audience, but in recent years, their blatant disregard for standing firm on conviction/principle has produced a level of distrust, evidenced in the vast number of voters who simply didn’t show up to vote in the last presidential election. And while the good-ole-boy political system exists — to some level — throughout the country, it has always been most deeply ingrained in West Virginia. And its resultant damages are crystal clear to even those who would deny it.
A few months ago, in a commentary published in West Virginia Watch, I focused on my — at times — challenging journey as a West Virginia writer. It was humbling and gratifying when the piece was picked up by a few other respected news outlets. At its core, the piece was a wake-up call to West Virginia to leave behind the antiquated ways of doing business that clearly no longer work. 
In response to that piece, I received a letter from a well-respected, critically acclaimed, award-winning West Virginia author lauding my efforts to bring to light what is essential for West Virginia’s growth. The author spoke to “the isolation, the vacuum, in which we, as creatives, work and how that environment is often at the will of others who are motivated by complex agendas and often a lot of defensiveness.” The letter made its way into a look at Charlotte Pritt’s unsuccessful run for governor, pointing out “the dark shadows which then, and I expect now, underlie West Virginia politics and culture.”
And here we are, decades later, the alarm on the clock resounding loud and clear. Are you listening, or are you simply going to keep hitting the snooze button? When will we say, “Enough!” When will we don the badge of courage, take a deep breath, and forge a new path that most assuredly will lead us to a route void of political pandering—or at the very least crumble its much too-solid core?

And in many counties, vaccination rates among the youngest school-aged children are below 95%, the target for herd immunity.","Boxes and vials of the Measles, Mumps, Rubella Virus Vaccine at a vaccine clinic put on by Lubbock Public Health Department on March 1, 2025 in Lubbock, Texas.(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)In late March, a four-year-old in Erie County was diagnosed with measles, a highly contagious and incurable disease that, in rare cases, can cause brain damage and death. 
The child, who the county did not identify to the Capital-Star, had attended day care at Creative Learning Childcare in Erie, where 160 kids were enrolled, while likely infected. According to County Executive Brenton Davis, some children under one-years-old, the age when children typically receive their measles vaccination, may have been exposed.
It was the third diagnosed case in Erie County this year, which had not had a single, documented one since 1991. And it was the sixth case in Pennsylvania. There has been one confirmed case each in Bucks, Montgomery and Philadelphia  counties as well.
Currently, the U.S. is experiencing one of its largest measles outbreaks in decades, largely due to a cluster of cases among a Texas Mennonite community. There have been more than 600 cases across the country in 2025 alone, the most cases on record since 2019 — and it’s only April. Three people have died, two of them children.
The resurgence of the disease, which the World Health Organization declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, is largely due to declining vaccination rates. Because it is so contagious, experts say it takes a 95% vaccination rate for herd immunity to be established, despite the measles vaccine being one of the most effective ever produced.

In Pennsylvania, measles vaccination rates among children are on the decline. And in many counties, vaccination rates among the youngest school-aged children are below 95%, the target for herd immunity, according to the most recent available Dept. of Health data from the 2023-2024 school year. Only 23 of the 67 counties had a vaccination rate at or over that level among kindergarten students. Measles vaccination rates among kindergarteners were measured as low as 84% in Cameron County.
“In Pennsylvania itself, when we take a look at childhood immunizations for measles, we’re somewhere around 93% and 94% statewide, which isn’t bad, but it isn’t what’s considered herd immunity,” said Dr. Jeffrey Jahre, an infectious disease specialist at St. Luke’s University Hospital in Bethlehem. He was referring to the rate among kindergarten students. “But what’s particularly important is we know that [vaccination rates] can vary dramatically from one community to another, and from one county to another.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control, roughly one in five unvaccinated people who catch measles will be hospitalized. One in 1000 infected children will develop encephalitis, an infection that causes inflammation of the brain. And roughly one to three in 1,000 children will die. 
“People now have forgotten about how bad it can really be,” Jahre said. “One of the things that becomes very, very evident when you look at the cases that have occurred in the United States is that nearly all have been in unvaccinated people.”
This year, 97% of cases in the U.S. have been in unvaccinated people or people with unknown vaccination status.
In a statement, Mark O’Neill, a state Department of Health spokesman, said, “There is no immediate risk to the general public at this time, as the latest school immunization report (2023-2024) shows that 97% of 12th grade students, 95.7% of 7th grade students, and 94% of kindergarten students in Pennsylvania are vaccinated against the measles virus.” 
“Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect against measles, and residents can request a vaccine from their health care provider,” he added.
Where is the risk and what can you do?
So far, there has yet to be a confirmed measles case in any of Pennsylvania’s highest-risk counties, based on vaccination rates. Those include Cameron County, which has an 84.2% MMR vaccination rate among kindergarten students, but 100% in both 7th and 12th grade; and Pike County, which has an 86.8% vaccination rate among kindergarteners, a 92.7% rate among 7th graders and a 95.7% rate among 12th graders.
But even in a community at or near the herd immunity target of 95% vaccination, a single case can be disruptive.

Take the latest case in Erie County, for example. The county has a 94.9% vaccination rate among kindergarteners, and was above the 95% target among 7th and 12th graders. But the one case in an unvaccinated child led to potential exposures at a gym, Fitness U; a walk-in clinic, UPMC Children’s Express; as well as Creative Learning Childcare, which was attended by children under the age of one who are typically not yet vaccinated. 
Davis, the Erie county executive, said unvaccinated people who may have been exposed were asked to quarantine. And because the disease can go undetected in infected people for over a week, children under the age of one, and anyone unvaccinated, are being asked to stay away from Creative Learning Childcare.
“There could be the potential for the community to have a very large struggle, not just having the measles, but quarantining,” Davis said.  “We know how disruptive that can be to a work schedule, particularly for people who can’t afford childcare.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Erie County has an advantage of being one of seven counties to have its own health department, and another four have municipal health departments. Nearly half of Pennsylvania’s population lives in these areas, and each of the counties had a measles vaccination rate above 94% in kindergarten students. 
Davis said the health department “ makes us more nimble.” The case was diagnosed on a Sunday, and they were still able to have roughly 20 staff working on contact tracing and other response tasks that day.
Measles symptoms include a high fever, cough, rash, red watery eyes and a runny nose.
“Obviously, we are preparing for the potential of something larger,” Davis said.  “There’s not a major panic, it’s just more or less trying to get ahead of any event.”
The case in Erie County is a reminder that highly vaccinated counties can still experience measles outbreaks.
“We kind of break [vaccination rates] down county by county, but we see people travel across counties all the time,” said Dr. Patrick Gavigan, an infectious disease expert at Penn State Health in Hershey. “People are so connected, so it’s easy for cases to spread.”
Dauphin County, where Gavigan works, only has an 88.9% Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccination rate among kindergarten students, a 92.5% rate among 7th grade students, and a 95% rate among 12th graders. 
It’s one of 8 counties with a kindergarten measles vaccination rate below 90%, and one of 45 with a rate below the 95% herd immunity target.
Pennsylvania also has seven counties where 7th grade MMR vaccination rates are below 90% and 25 below 95%. Among 12th graders, only one county, Tioga, had a vaccination rate below 90%. 


“The lower that number gets, the higher the risk for outbreaks and spread,” Gavigan said. Though Gavigan cautioned that grade-wide measurements are not necessarily indicative of community vaccination rates, which are the most important factors.
Still, Gavigan says that most parents, even in such areas, shouldn’t be worried about their children. “They can get their children vaccinated and feel very comfortable that they’re going to prevent infection and serious disease,” he said.
But his concern lies with the parents of infants, and for people who are immunocompromised. Cancer patients, for example, often have their immune systems weakened by chemotherapy and other treatments, and can be prone to infection even if they’ve been vaccinated.

Gavigan said parents of infants in areas with low measles vaccination rates can consider vaccinating their children as young as six-months old. While the recommended age to vaccinate children is one, there is no harm in vaccinating a child early. However, antibodies passed down from a vaccinated mother may still exist in the child, which could potentially make the vaccine less effective. But, Gavigan cautioned, no one should make that division without consulting with their pediatrician.
“Herd immunity is so important to the 3 to 5% of kids who don’t respond to the measles vaccine, and to that group that is not able to get vaccinated or is immunosuppressed,” Gavigan said. “It’s one of the most effective vaccines we have.”
“We’ve created this situation”
There is no cure for measles. And the only effective way to prevent the disease is with a vaccine. However, measles vaccination rates have been declining for several years, both in Pennsylvania and the U.S. more broadly.
“In some ways, low vaccination rates are almost a product of the success of vaccines, because no one sees measles,” Gavigan said. “So the need for vaccines becomes less apparent to most people. There’s also been more spread of misinformation surrounding vaccines. And then I think the COVID pandemic itself disrupted a lot of regular medical visits.”
Dr. Jahre attributed the drop in vaccination rates among children to the politicization of vaccines.
“We’ve created this situation,” Jahre said. “COVID was one of the first situations where health information and vaccinations became a political football, and it still is to this day.”
But Jahre said the U.S. Health agencies and officials who led the COVID-19 pandemic response are not blameless.
“There was a lot of information that was put out that was said to be absolute when it shouldn’t have been,” Jahre said. “There was a failure, in some cases, to admit what wasn’t known, and an effort to make things sound like one-size-fits-all. When you do that, and you have this discordance, people end up saying, ‘I don’t know what to believe.’”
Jahre pointed to a string of high-profile communication failures during the pandemic. That included conflicting statements about the effectiveness of masking in preventing COVID-19, and overstatements of the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines in preventing the disease.
On the flip side, Jahre said, the current U.S. Secretary of Health, Robert F. Kennedy, a long-time leader in the anti-vaccine movement, has overemphasized the risks of vaccinations, and has a history of amplifying misinformation and casting doubt on their effectiveness.
“Recently he did come out and say that your best bet to prevent measles is to get the vaccine, Jahre said. “But he needs to say it loudly, clearly, repetitively, and try to mitigate some of the information that he gave before, which in a lot of cases, was just provocative and not necessarily true.”

Kennedy has downplayed the severity of the ongoing measles outbreak and has advocated for unproven and sometimes dangerous treatments. While he has encouraged people to get the MMR vaccine, in an interview on Fox News, Kennedy falsely suggested the vaccine does not provide lifetime immunity and warned it “causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes.”
The measles vaccine is between 95% and 97% effective, and vaccinated people who do catch the disease, are far less likely to develop complications. While there have been rare cases of febrile seizures linked to the MMR vaccine, they are unlikely to cause long-term health impacts and there is a far lower risk of complication from the vaccine than the disease itself. There have been no deaths in healthy children linked to properly administered MMR vaccines, according to the Infectious Disease Society of America, a collective of 13,000 doctors and infectious disease experts. 
Children who develop measles have a far greater risk of serious complications, and face a one to three in 1,000 chance of dying.
In Pennsylvania, the statewide rate of MMR vaccination among kindergarteners dipped below the 95% herd immunity threshold in the 2022-2023 school year, dropping to 94%.That was down from 95.1% the previous year, and from over 96% in the 2019-2020 school year, when the COVID pandemic broke out.
While most states allow for religious exemptions to vaccine requirements, Pennsylvania is one of 15 that also allows parents to reject vaccines on philosophical or personal grounds. And the rate at which children are claiming those objections has risen. 
In the 2020-2021 school year, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, 1.2% of kindergarten students claimed a philosophical exemption to vaccine requirements and 1.2% claimed a religious one. In the 2022-2023 school year those numbers rose to 1.5% and 2.2%, respectively. In 2023, it was 1.8% and 2%.
Jahre believes the law should be changed to get rid of the philosophical exemption.
“We support individual rights,” Jahre said. “But when individual rights may infringe on others and create harm, that’s where we draw the line.”
He compared this to laws requiring car inspections. “It’s not just a question of, if your breaks are bad, that you put yourself in harm’s way. But obviously, you can then put others in harm’s way. The same is true with certain infectious diseases, measles being one of those.”
33% of 483 confirmed measles cases in the country, as of March 27, were among children under 5-years-old. Another 42% were among children between 5 and 19-years-old, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
A quarter of infected children under 5 — 40 out of 157 in total — were hospitalized, and that accounts for half of all measles hospitalizations in the country this year.
“It’s frustrating and discouraging, especially with something like measles, where we could have effectively prevented it in the U.S.” Gavigan said about the recent cases. “We have something available that is extremely effective and extremely safe. And, as opposed to COVID where it was this new vaccine, we’ve got years and decades of data to support the effectiveness of this measles vaccine.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/measles-vaccine-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-07 06:02:04.433083

Such inspections could become less frequent if the Trump administration carries out a plan to terminate the leases of dozens of mine [&#8230;]","On the 15th anniversary of the Upper Big Branch mine disaster in West Virginia, the Trump administration is considering closing 33 federal mine safety field offices around the country.

(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)Federal inspectors conducted more than 300 safety inspections at coal mines in Harlan County over a recent 14 month-period, checking that toxic gases were ventilated, flammable materials under control and equipment working safely. Such inspections could become less frequent if the Trump administration carries out a plan to terminate the leases of dozens of mine safety field offices, warn advocates for miners.
The inspectors conducting those hundreds of inspections in Harlan County traveled from offices in Barbourville and Harlan, both of which are on a list of seven in Kentucky slated for closure by the federal Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). That’s according to an analysis of federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) data by the nonprofit Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center.
Closing those offices, the analysis says, could turn a 30-minute drive to inspect a rural coal mine into a three- or four-hour round trip.
“We are really worried that any kind of cutting to field office capacity or requiring longer commutes of these inspectors just means that they’re spending less time at the mines,” said Rebecca Shelton, the center’s director of policy.
Especially worrying, Shelton said, is the possibility that inspectors would no longer have time to conduct inspections that are classified as discretionary but are “critical” to worker safety in one of the country’s most hazardous occupations. She said discretionary inspections can be made in response to complaints from miners to the agency about mine hazards or when an inspector decides a follow-up visit is needed after noticing an issue. Some inspections are required by federal law.

News outlets first reported last month that DOGE had listed the leases of dozens of MSHA field offices across the country among numerous “lease cancellations” for federal agencies. The lease terminations are part of cost-cutting efforts to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse, according to Trump officials and Trump adviser Elon Musk who’s played a leading role at DOGE.
If the government cancels the leases on the list, MSHA would be left with Kentucky offices in Lexington and Pikeville.
A spokesperson for MSHA did not directly answer questions from the Lantern about the status of MSHA offices that were on the DOGE list or if and when the offices’ leases would be terminated. 
“Mine Safety and Health Administration inspectors continue to conduct legally required inspections and remain focused on MSHA’s core mission to prevent death, illness, and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for U.S. miners,” a U.S. Department of Labor spokesperson said in a statement. 
The Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, based in Whitesburg, compiled and analyzed data from the federal Mine Data Retrieval System on the number of inspections conducted and cumulative hours worked by inspectors at each of the 33 MSHA field offices designated for lease cancellation by DOGE. The analysis looked at the first two months of this year and all of 2024. Offices slated to have their leases terminated stretch across the country and are concentrated in Appalachia and the Ohio Valley. 
While thousands of coal-mining jobs have been lost in recent decades, MSHA inspectors remain busy, the analysis found. Out of the 33 MSHA field offices listed by DOGE, 16,639 inspections were conducted accounting for more than “234,000 hours on site at mines and over 399,000 total hours completing inspection duties.” 
Willie Dodson, the coal impacts program manager for the environmental advocacy nonprofit Appalachian Voices, told the Lantern last month that MSHA operates under a legal and regulatory framework that came from “massive grassroots movements” in the 1960s and 1970s to address dangerous working conditions in mines. Congress created MSHA as part of the Mine Safety Act of 1977 after the deaths of 26 miners in two underground explosions at the Scotia Mine in Letcher County the year before.
The rate of mining fatalities and injuries has plummeted since MSHA was established in 1977, Dodson said.
Dodson said new regulatory obligations being taken on by MSHA to monitor and control silica dust in mines that’s contributing to a surge in cases of the occupational disease coal workers’ pneumoconiosis — commonly known as “black lung” — is coinciding with a decline in staffing at MSHA over the past decade. Shelton also pointed to the firing of federal researchers who were studying “black lung” as another safeguard for miners that is “on the chopping block.” 
Adding the potential termination of field office leases to the mix makes Dodson say “the math doesn’t work out” for regulating active mines.
“I am very concerned that certain inspections just aren’t going to happen, or inspectors are going to be so rushed that they’re going to miss things that they need to take note of,” Dodson said.

“She’s like, ‘They’re preparing. They’re building bomb shelters,’” Smekodub said. “I’m like, ‘Your sister is off her rocker. She’s nuts. This is never gonna happen.’”
This was back three years ago, but she remembers the conversation vividly. Not because her sister-in-law said something crazy, but because she was right.
War was coming.
On Feb. 24, 2022, Russia launched a full invasion of Ukraine.
“It was unbelievable,” Smekdub said. “It’s still unbelievable.”
Smekodub, who moved to the United States from Ukraine when she was nine, is married to a Russian, Alexii Chankov, who immigrated to America from Moscow when he was 20. The two met in New York and recently settled in Gouldsboro, in Wayne County.
Despite coming from two countries at war, there is no tension between the two over the conflict. They consider themselves Americans now.
Three years later, Pennsylvanians with connections to Ukraine feel a mix of emotions as the war has dragged on and the Trump administration has taken office.

Pennsylvania has the second-largest population of Ukrainians and Ukrainian Americans in the country with more than 150,000 people living in the state. Schuylkill County in the northeastern part of the state is the bedrock – with four of the top 10 communities in the country with Ukrainian roots.
Starting in the late 1800s many immigrants from Eastern Europe, including from the region that would later become Ukraine, moved to the northeast part of Pennsylvania, seeking work in the anthracite coal mines. The immigrants set up a strong presence in the region, establishing Ukrainian churches and cultural centers. Throughout the next century, the area continued to attract more Ukrainian immigrants during both World Wars and the country’s fight for independence at the end of the Cold War.
While many who spoke with the Pennsylvania Capital-Star said they are holding onto hope that there will be a resolution, most do not see the current peace talks working out. Some also said they have experienced more negative remarks about their native country since Trump returned to the White House.
But none of them has lost hope that Ukraine will win.
Shifting Stances
For Alex Groysman, one moment is stuck in his mind as the point when everything changed.
CNN’s Matthew Chance was standing on top of a building in Kyiv, as explosions could be heard in the background. Then, he ducked down to put on a helmet and vest.
There it was on his television. Russian forces on Ukrainian soil.
Groysman moved to the United States from Kyiv around the time the Soviet Union fell in 1991. He was 10.
“We were hoping that there’s no way this is going to happen,” Groysman said. “There’s no way they’re gonna start bombing my home city, the capital.”
Now living in Scranton, he started a fundraiser, Scranton 4 Ukraine, in the months after the invasion, to help raise money for humanitarian causes in Ukraine. Groysman said the 5K race – held in August – has seen a decline in participation since its inauguration. But this year, he is anticipating an increase in numbers with the current state of political and international affairs.

Over the past two months, the Trump administration has spoken with both Ukraine and Russia separately trying to fulfill one of President Donald Trump’s campaign promises – to end the war.
Amid the early chaos of Trump’s second tenure, the war has taken center stage at times, with administration leaders travelling to Saudi Arabia to meet with Russian officials without Kyiv. In late February, the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine appeared strained when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to talk with Trump, but left early after a meeting at the White House descended into arguments with Trump and Vice President JD Vance. Trump announced soon after his administration would stop sending military aid and sharing intelligence with Ukraine. When Zelensky agreed to a ceasefire proposal, the U.S. agreed to restart cooperation.
“It’s been chaotic,” said Groysman.
While the majority of Scrantonians have been supportive, Groysman said he has experienced more people reacting angrily when he has a Ukrainian flag.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“When I first encountered it, I didn’t expect it,” Groysman said. “I was shocked by it. But now, whenever I’m running out there with my flag, I expect nasty things to be said. And if I go for a run and I didn’t get one bad word, that’s a win for me.”
Groysman said people yell, ‘Go back to Russia” out of their vehicles as they drive past him.
He said he tries to stay hopeful for Ukraine’s future and believes in the importance of Ukraine defending itself.
His home in South Scranton has a Ukrainian flag that hangs off of the corner of his white porch. Inside the window to the right of the porch is a sign that says “Stand with Ukraine” with a soldier on it, and if you look close enough at the corner of his fence there is a strip of blue and yellow tape for the Ukrainian colors.
While he sometimes struggles with guilt for not being there to fight, he will continue with his Scranton 4 Ukraine fundraiser to send financial support to those in need. He said the organization has raised more than $35,000 to send humanitarian supplies over since it launched in 2022.
He said that he admires Zelenskyy’s resolve as the war has continued and made sure to show support for the Ukrainian president during his visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant last September.
The factory produces 155 millimeter howitzer rounds and has ramped up production since Russia’s full-scale invasion back in 2022. The plant is one of three production facilities in the state that combined is now putting out 36,000 rounds a month. From 2009 to 2017 the output was at about 9,000 rounds a month. A representative with the company that owns the factory, General Dynamics and Tactical Systems, said they cannot share the exact numbers of how many jobs have been added to meet the demand, but he did say that the increase in the production of the artillery metal parts at the Scranton plant from 2022 to now has resulted in over 100 jobs.

According to a representative with the U.S. Army Joint Military Command, production has not been slowed in the last few weeks with the current political climate.
Even though Groysman did not see Zelenskyy in the vehicles that drove by he said that he was happy to be outside the plant wearing Ukrainian colors. Later, Groysman said he saw Zelenskyy comment online about seeing the group in Ukrainian colors and thanking them for being there. And that was enough for him.
Here vs. There
After service on a Sunday in late March, Ruslan Boroyvyi sat in front of a wall covered in photo collages, Ukrainian colors, and the unmistakable Ukrainian ‘trident’, talking about his loved ones back in Ukraine.
He is pastor for the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church who moved to Philadelphia in 2021 from the southwestern part of Ukraine. But that weekend he was at the Ukrainian Homestead in Lehighton, in Carbon County for a retreat for Ukrainians.
By the door sat a large plastic tub waiting to be filled with money to support people in Ukraine.
Borovyi said his home country feels a little betrayed by the shifting stances in the United States.
And as for the fighting, he said people have gotten used to life under wartime conditions and that scares him.
“It’s not normal…the whole situation, but it’s a normal reaction of people to just get used to it and try to live their lives under this circumstance,” Boroyvi said.

Borovyi tries to preach hope to his parishioners. But he said hope is not knowing that everything will be all right, but believing that the steps people take matter.
As the war drags on, many Ukrainian Americans said they will keep doing what they can to help their former home from Pennsylvania.
Ulana Prociuk’s parents came to the United States after World War II. She is still in touch with her Ukrainian heritage and works as an administrator for the Ukrainian Homestead.
Prociuk grew up hearing about Russian and German tanks moving across the country during World War II and just talking about the three-year war now makes her tear up. She has family in Ukraine and said they are scared. But she said she believes the Ukrainian people are resilient and will fight for as long as it takes to defend their freedom.
After hearing her parents’ stories about living under the Soviet Union’s iron fist, she feels blessed to enjoy the freedoms offered to her here. She had family, including her grandmother, sent to Siberia as punishment back then. It was a trip her grandmother did not survive. She died on the cattle car and “they just threw her (body) out,” Prociuk said.
To her, many Americans do not understand what it was like under a communist regime and why stopping Russia from taking over Ukraine is so important.
After Borovyi’s service, Eugenia Podalak sat on a chair resting both hands on top of her cane, talking about her childhood.
She said Ukrainians only want to live free, while not giving up their independence as a country. Her family left Ukraine in 1945 and moved to America in 1949. She first settled in Philadelphia before moving to Lehighton.
Like Prociuk, Podalak had family members sent to Siberia as punishment.

Now 87, Podalak remembers living in occupied Ukraine and bombings by both the Germans and Russians. One of her most vivid childhood memories is going to the basement of her house only minutes before one bomb landed in the family kitchen.
“I just hope people in the United States understand that Ukrainians, we want our own country,” Podalak said.
She is American but remains connected to her home country and its traditions. Her children and grandchildren all speak Ukrainian.
As the war drags on
Sitting outside of a Starbucks in Dickson City on an overcast Monday, Alexii Chankov is dressed in a New York City Ranger’s sweatshirt and hat. He’s getting the attention of at least one other Rangers fan who called to Chankov at the table as he was getting into his car in the parking lot.
He grew up playing hockey in Russia and the New York City team was a natural fit when he moved there. And his love for New York sports goes beyond just the Rangers as he jokes that his favorite football team is the worst in the league– the New York Jets.
His wife, Yelena Smekodub, sat next to him in a grey sweatshirt, occasionally translating for her husband who moved to the country more recently than she did.
Watching the war drag on has been taxing for the two. They wish people would understand Ukrainians did not ask for the war, that it must defend itself, and ultimately the people just want peace. But neither has much hope in negotiations or faith that Russian President Vladimir Putin will abide by any peace agreements.

Russian citizens are also struggling with the cost of war – a conflict most of them did not want either, Smekodub and Chankov said.
In Russia, Chankov said prices for goods are soaring, putting tremendous strain on the population. Chankov also said he has a teenage nephew who’s afraid to be outside, because he might be taken to go fight in the war.
And the mental toll is getting to Russian parents as well. Chankov said a school friend who lost a son in the war was outside demanding to know where her son was and was arrested. Russia uses mass graves, so it is hard to find the dead, he said.
The divide that is forming between Russia and Ukraine is sad to both. Smekodub moved to the U.S. when it was still the Soviet Union. But even when the Soviet Union fell, she said people freely traveled between Russia and Ukraine. She compared it to traveling between Canada and the U.S.
When Russia invaded, she had an uncle in Moscow and her father was in Dnipro which is on the eastern side of Ukraine. And the Ukrainian side is now angry with the Russian side. She said her family in Ukraine often goes without electricity or running water.
“All of a sudden you have these people going, ‘Oh, we hate Ukrainians? Since when?,” Smekodub said. “And Ukrainians go, ‘We hate you Russians.’ Since when?”
To them, the problem is Putin, not the people.
One common refrain from Ukrainian Americans who spoke with Pennsylvania Capital-Star is the one good thing the Trump administration seems to have done is that it has caused the rest of Europe to come to the realization they can no longer depend on the United States.
“It’s nice to see Europe waking up because they know what’s at stake,” Groysman said.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, is known for responding to extreme weather like hurricanes and wildfires — the kinds of disasters that are becoming more intense and common as climate change gets worse. But the agency also has a program that sends billions of dollars to communities, municipalities, and states proactively so that they can prepare for these events before they hit.
In an internal FEMA memorandum obtained and first reported by Grist, the Trump administration announced its plans to dismantle that program — the biggest climate adaptation initiative the federal government has ever funded — even as disasters incur hundreds of billions of dollars worth of damages across the United States. The decision comes as at least seven people were killed this week as tornadoes and catastrophic flooding descended on the central United States in what meteorologists called a once in a generation event.
The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, or BRIC, was established in 2018 during President Donald Trump’s first term, replacing a similar FEMA initiative. BRIC’s first round of funding was launched in 2020, when Trump was still in office, and in 2023, the program awarded close to a billion dollars to scores of communities, states, and tribal nations across the country. In January, before Trump began his second term, the agency opened its fiscal year 2024 notice of funding, with $750 million in matching grants made available to applicants from areas that received a major disaster declaration within the past seven years.
But FEMA now aims to cancel those grants and any other BRIC grants that have not been paid out yet by the federal government, according to the pre-decisional memo dated April 2 from Cameron Hamilton, a Trump administration official who is serving as FEMA administrator until the president appoints a permanent head of the agency.
“Following the administration’s direction, FEMA is working to … implement the principles of cost efficiency and common sense to our approaches and investments,” the memo says. BRIC generally shoulders 75 percent of the cost of a given resilience project, and up to 90 percent of the cost of projects in disadvantaged communities. The program’s emphasis on equity is what may have marked it for demolition — the Trump administration has been systematically dismantling Biden-era efforts to infuse equity into governmental programs and direct more climate spending toward underrepresented groups.
FEMA employees disputed Hamilton’s argument in the memo that BRIC grants “have not enhanced the level of hazard mitigation as much as desired.”
“I don’t know where that came from,” said one agency employee who preferred to stay anonymous.

According to a source within the agency, the Trump administration asked BRIC staffers to offer justification for the program and its Direct Technical Assistance sister initiative, which offers non-financial support to help communities navigate the BRIC funding process and identify the hazards they face. The request was made on April 1 with an April 2  deadline.
With a tight turnaround, staffers offered success stories from across the country. BRIC awards have helped communities bury power lines, build culverts, protect wastewater facilities from being inundated by flooding, and upgrade power stations. If BRIC is frozen, communities will no longer be able to apply for the grants for fiscal year 2024 made available in January. Projects that have been selected in past years but not yet disbursed funds will no longer receive payment. Partially completed projects will be scrutinized and reviewed, the memo said.
“The administration now has one of FEMA’s most effective grant programs on the chopping block,” said Shana Udvardy, a senior climate resilience policy analyst with the Climate and Energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It’s oversubscribed almost every single year.” In fiscal year 2023, FEMA received more than 1,200 subapplications across all 50 states, 35 tribes, five territories, and Washington, D.C., totaling more than $5.6 billion in requests. It was able to provide less than a fifth of the money requested.
A looming question is whether FEMA can yank grants that are being funded with money appropriated by Congress. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the bipartisan infrastructure law, allocated approximately $6.8 billion to FEMA for community-wide mitigation efforts, with a portion of this funding directed to the BRIC program. “If this administration does away with the program, it goes against a law that Congress passed,” Udvardy said, “so there’s a concern there to be raised.”

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Accessing quality care in Kentucky is a daily challenge. The state is ranked ninth worst in the country for overall health and sixth worse in overall health for women and children.
Planned Parenthood has been a trusted safety net provider in Kentucky since 1932, helping fill gaps in a state where there are already far too few options for essential care, providing services like birth control, wellness exams and preventive screenings. Thousands of people, 52% of whom live under the federal poverty line, see us every year in Louisville and Lexington, often traveling great distances from across the state to receive care. Yet today, these critical services for Kentuckians are under attack at every level of government.
Title X is under attack: The Trump administration is withholding tens of millions of dollars of Title X funding from Planned Parenthood affiliates nationwide, including here in Kentucky. This attack on the nation’s only family planning program will lead to more than 3,500 Kentuckians with low incomes facing increased barriers to care — or the possible loss of their health care options altogether.
Title X funds a wide range of essential health services for people who often rely on Planned Parenthood as their sole provider for care. For many of our patients, care supported by Title X funding may be the only affordable option.
Medicaid is also at risk: Politicians are spreading exaggerations and falsehoods, trivializing the successes of Medicaid and working hard to strip affordable health care away from those who need it most. In Congress, it has been widely reported that Republican leaders are weighing enormous cuts to Medicaid to pay for an extension of tax cuts for the wealthy.
In Kentucky, Planned Parenthood is a key provider of essential care for Medicaid recipients, which covers 45% of births statewide.
At the same time, last week the U.S. Supreme Court heard a case out of South Carolina that threatens Planned Parenthood’s role in Medicaid. Federal law requires that Medicaid include “any qualified provider” in the program. But in South Carolina, lawmakers are attempting to cut Planned Parenthood out, solely because of its association with abortion care. 
If the Supreme Court allows states to target a trusted provider solely based on politics, it’s a safe bet that Kentucky will follow suit. Since 2017, the state has prohibited spending state dollars outside Medicaid on any Planned Parenthood services. They’ve also passed recent bills targeting other parts of Medicaid, including work requirements and gender-affirming care. Carving us out of Medicaid altogether will make the state less free and less healthy. Inevitably, Kentucky would experience more unintended pregnancies, missed cancer diagnoses and untreated sexually transmitted infections.
If any of these efforts succeed, the consequences for Kentucky will be catastrophic. The state simply cannot afford to lose Planned Parenthood’s services. If Congress cuts Medicaid funding, or if Kentucky copies South Carolina to block Medicaid patients from accessing Planned Parenthood, this combined with the Title X cuts mean other providers will not be able to absorb the patient load.
The politicians pushing for Medicaid and Title X cuts and blocking free choice of patients to choose Planned Parenthood don’t seem to care. They also don’t care that because of the harmful Hyde amendment, Title X and Medicaid already don’t cover abortions. What they do care about is punishment: punishing Planned Parenthood, punishing our patients, and punishing people with low incomes — all to appease their anti-abortion backers.
To our patients, please know that we are fighting this every step of the way — no matter what. Medicaid and Title X are critical programs in Kentucky and across the country, and if politicians do the right thing, they can continue to be for years to come.

(Capital-Star photo by John Cole)Pennsylvania Republicans secured big victories in the 2024 election, but 2026 was clearly on the minds of a few potential candidates for governor at an annual gathering of conservatives in the suburbs of Harrisburg.
“Next November, the Keystone State will send a Republican to the governor’s mansion,” said state Treasurer Stacy Garrity.
“In order for us to have an America First agenda, we’ve got to have the governor’s office,” U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District) said. “My friends, we definitely need a governor who has a plan for Pennsylvania, not a plan for Pennsylvania Avenue.”
Both elected officials and potential 2026 hopefuls delivered speeches at the 36th annual Pennsylvania Leadership Conference in Camp Hill, Cumberland County, and mingled with conservative activists. Over the past few months, both have said that they are considering challenging Gov. Josh Shapiro in the 2026 race.
During the successful 2024 election for Republicans which saw Donald Trump carry the White House, and Dave McCormick defeat longtime incumbent U.S. Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Garrity secured a second term to serve as state treasurer. She broke the record for most votes received in a statewide election during her victory over Democratic challenger Erin McClelland.
Meuser, who was first elected to Congress in 2018, cruised to reelection in November to represent the conservative 9th Congressional District, which spans a large portion of central and northeast Pennsylvania.
Both are allies of President Trump.
They both spoke at length about their support for Trump’s agenda, including his administration’s actions on the economy, support for natural gas, immigration, and foreign policy.
Garrity, serving her second term as state Treasurer, and Meuser, who was the Secretary of Revenue under former Gov. Tom Corbett, both touted their experience with leading offices tasked with handling taxpayer dollars.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
They talked about that as an asset for Pennsylvanians, while also promoting the cuts to the federal government made by billionaire Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
“Who here is excited about what Elon and DOGE are doing,” Garrity asked to the crowd which applauded. “Well, guess what? My office is doing that right here in Pennsylvania.”
Meuser also applauded DOGE for “attacking debt, overspending, and government expansion.”
“The left and the swamp are fighting back like their life depends upon it, because I think it does,” Meuser said about DOGE.
Following their speeches, Garrity and Meuser confirmed their interest in potentially running for governor and said they’d have to make a decision in the next few months.
“It’s really an honor that so many people have asked me to think about it,” Garrity told the Capital-Star on Saturday. “We’d have to make a decision, probably in the summer.”
“I think the personal decision needs to be made relatively soon,” Meuser told reporters on Saturday. “And the rest of the pieces of the plan need to be brought together, but I would imagine just a public announcement can wait until mid-summer, so maybe August 1, or something like that.”

“I’m also aware of the demands of those who want to support from the party as well as President Trump,” he added. “So, I wouldn’t run without his support.”
Meuser added that he thinks it’ll be difficult to defeat any incumbent governor, which is why he believes the party needs to be united in order to defeat Shapiro.
During the 2022 primary election, the Pennsylvania Republican Party did not endorse a candidate for governor in the crowded race, while Trump delivered a last minute endorsement to state Sen. Doug Mastriano.
After Democrats won three straight gubernatorial races in Pennsylvania, all nearly by double digits, Garrity and Meuser believe the Commonwealth needs a change.
Garrity said she thinks the message should be the party asking voters if they are happy with the way things are going in the state.
“I mean, we spend, every year, billions more, I mean billions: This year, $3.5 billion more than what we bring in,” Garrity told the Capital-Star.
Meuser also argued that there’s been “no results” in Pennsylvania.
“There’s a lot of talk. There’s little action,” Meuser told reporters. “What is better in Pennsylvania over the last 10 years, except we have a $51 billion spending.”
Meuser also claimed Pennsylvania would be better off with a “pro-energy governor.”
“We’re being left behind,” Meuser said.
However, Shapiro has consistently held a positive approval rating.
Mastriano, the GOP nominee for governor in 2022 who lost to Shapiro by double digits, is also reportedly weighing another run for the office. He was not in attendance.
In a recent radio interview with WJFP-AM 740, Mastriano floated teaming up with Garrity to run as a ticket, saying the two would be “unbeatable.”
Candidates for governor and lieutenant governor run in separate primaries in Pennsylvania, although some endorse one another in those races. In 2022, Shapiro endorsed Austin Davis for lieutenant governor, who won the Democratic Party primary over state Rep. Brian Sims and Ray Sosa. Mastriano endorsed Teddy Daniels for lieutenant governor, who ended up finishing in third place in the nine-candidate GOP race.

Garrity told the Capital-Star on Saturday that “we really haven’t had any conversations,” when asked about teaming up with Mastriano to run.
“I have a great working relationship with the senator,” Garrity said. “He does a lot of good things for veterans, and I like what he’s doing, but we have not talked about it.”
During Mastriano’s 2022 bid for governor, Shapiro’s campaign spent money on an ad that ran during the GOP primary linking Mastriano to Trump.
Mastriano helped organize panels that falsely questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 election, and buses to attend Trump’s rally on January 6, 2021, before a mob attacked the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential results and keep a defeated president in power. Mastriano said he did not enter the Capitol building that day or cross police lines, although some of his Democratic colleagues in the state Senate called for him to resign for being in attendance at the rally.
Following Trump’s 2020 defeat to Joe Biden, Meuser joined seven of his Pennsylvania Republican colleagues in voting against certifying the election results, despite no evidence supporting any election fraud claims that would have changed the outcome of the election.
Garrity also seemingly questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 election during a speech in January 2021, but has since walked those comments back.
Garrity and Meuser support Trump’s tariffs
Trump’s recent announcement of taxing imported products from around the world was not a major theme at the conservative gathering. However, Garrity and Meuser both expressed their support for Trump’s tariff policy during their speeches to attendees. 
Business owners who purchase goods from outside the U.S. will have to pay the increased duty rates to bring the products over the border, unless Trump carves out exceptions for certain industries.
“He’s restoring fair trade balance with the United States and our trading partners by putting tariffs on countries that place tariffs on American goods,” Garrity said on Friday.

She described his tariff policy, along with other parts of his agenda as “common sense measures” that are good for the American people and a “death sentence for the evil forces at play within our own country and abroad.”
“Tariffs, we’ve heard a little bit about lately, are being used to increase domestic production,” Meuser said on Saturday. “And ladies and gentlemen, seriously, over the last 25 years, free trade has been equivalent to unfair trade for the United States of America, and we’re correcting it, and we’re correcting it on Trump time.”
“The markets are having a tough time dealing with that, but he’s got his fingers on the pulse of this situation, and I do believe it’s going to work out in the manner that it’s intended,” he added.
Following Trump’s tariff announcement on Wednesday, it was the worst week for the United States stock market since the coronavirus pandemic.
Garrity expressed optimism that Trump’s tariff policies will benefit the American worker, saying “these countries, you can see it already, they are going to work with us.”
“I come from the private sector, and we had to shut down a business unit, 250 jobs. You know where they went? China,” she added. “I think anything that we’re doing to bring manufacturing jobs back into America is a great thing.”
Meuser said the markets reacting the past few days is “obviously not a favorable situation,” but said Trump’s plan is a good one. He believes the trade agreements and tariffs are “going to open up new markets” for the United States.
“So, what we’re going to do is work through the tariffs. We’re going to negotiate what’s best for America, but equivalent for the world,” Meuser told reporters. “In the past, it was very imbalanced. So, we need to create the balance.”
According to reporting by States Newsroom, rising prices under Trump’s tariff scenario are likely to cost an extra $2,400 to $3,400 per family, according to the Yale Budget Lab, with most of the financial burden falling on the lowest-income households.
An analysis from the Peterson Institute on International Economics estimated the typical American household would lose over $1,200, just from the 25% tariffs already imposed on China, Canada and Mexico.
Supporters of Trump argue that the tariffs levied against foreign countries will help promote American manufacturing and jobs.
Shapiro blasted Trump’s tariff stance on Wednesday, calling it “disastrous, reckless policy” and expressed concern about how it will impact businesses and consumers in the state.
“I just wish the president wasn’t working against us as recklessly as he is,” Shapiro said Wednesday. “This tariff war that he is starting, this button that he is pushing is going to have one effect, and that effect is to drive up costs on consumers and businesses throughout Pennsylvania at a time where we can’t afford that, and it’s going to make our lives way more difficult.”
Never say never,” Pa. Senator Scott Martin says.
State Sen. Scott Martin (R-Lancaster) also delivered an address at the conference on Friday. As the Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, he spent the bulk of his speech talking about the upcoming budget and expressing his concerns about Shapiro’s spending proposal.
“We’re kind of standing on an edge of a cliff,” Martin said. “Are we going to turn around and walk back down to a healthy Pennsylvania? Or are we going to allow this governor, his insatiable appetite to just keep spending more money, help take us over the cliff?”
In the previous gubernatorial race, Martin considered a run for the office and even launched an exploratory committee, but ultimately decided against joining the race in 2022 after breaking his leg.
Martin told reporters on Friday that he was in attendance at the conference to outline the goals of the Senate Republican Caucus, but said he isn’t ruling out a run just yet for 2026.
“I’m not going to ever get ahead of my family on something like that either, but people are talking to me about it, but we’ll take it as it goes and see where the winds blow,” Martin said. “But right now, I’m really focused in my current role.”
“You never say never for anything,” he added, “but at the end of the day, there’s a lot to weigh out with that.”
Are Democrats gaining momentum? 
While the 2024 election was a success for Republicans in the Keystone State, Democrats in the state have already secured two special election victories this year. Democrat Dan Goughnour’s victory for the state House’s 35th District ensured that Republicans will remain in the minority in that chamber.
However, Democrat James Malone’s victory in a special election for the state Senate’s 36th District over Lancaster County Republican Commissioner Josh Parsons has garnered national attention, since Trump won the district over Vice President Kamala Harris by more than 15% in November. It’s also the first time since 1879 that a Democrat will represent Lancaster County in the Pennsylvania Senate.
Despite the upset victory, Republicans said they are confident it’s not a sign of things to come, with some citing voter registration gains made by the party in recent years.

Garrity wins straw poll
As-is tradition at Pennsylvania Leadership Conference, results of a straw poll of attendees are announced at the conclusion of the three-day gathering.
Scott Davis, President and CEO of the Cybersecurity Association of Pennsylvania, polled attendees on a wide range of issues, including the GOP race for governor. He said 267 people participated.
Garrity led the way with 41.1% of attendees saying she should be the GOP candidate for governor in 2026, followed by Meuser with 9.13%, and Mastriano in 3rd place with 6.39%. State Sens. Kristin Phillips-Hill (R-York) and Martin were tied with 2.28% of the vote.
Garrity also topped the previous year’s straw poll, although it was much more divided with her only tallying 7% of the vote. 
2021 was the last time PA Leadership Conference conducted a poll one year prior to a gubernatorial race. Mastriano was the preferred GOP candidate in that poll, who later became the nominee one year later.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1_720.jpg,,,2025-04-07 06:02:04.433083

(Courtesy of Children's Museum of Richmond)FindItVirginia, a platform that provides free education resources and tools for children, parents, military veterans and English language learners, is one of several programs statewide whose funding could be gutted by the shuttering of the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the latest in a series of moves by President Donald Trump’s administration to slash “wasteful” spending.
The platform has helped connect military veterans to employment resources, provided tutoring services for children and tools to learn different languages, all for free — federal funding through IMLS offsets the costs of the $1.6 million system. 
“All of these resources, which would ordinarily cost individual libraries or even individuals a lot of money if they wanted access, are shared here as a resource with all public libraries,” said Lisa Varga, executive director for the Virginia Library Association.
She added that the platform is also available to Virginia’s schools and is “an incredible asset, because there are so many schools, like rural schools, that don’t have the money for these databases.” IMLS grants make it possible for every student in the state to have access to programs and services like FindItVirginia, Varga said.
 Federal agencies in the crosshairs

The Institute of Museum and Library Services, the primary source of federal support for the nation’s museums and libraries, is one of the several entities included for elimination in Trump’s March 14 executive order to cut government waste, along with the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness and the Minority Business Development Agency.
In the order, Trump directed the government entities to be “eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law” and to “reduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel” to the minimum required by law. 
The order also directed the offices to “reject” funding requests if they were inconsistent with the president’s directive. The office had seven days to file a plan, but Trump appointed a new IMLS director in the closing days, which could have led to the office’s delay in submitting its plans. 
The public learned later that officials placed staff on administrative leave before the end of March.
Varga said, as of last week, she was unaware of any plan IMLS may have drawn up or submitted. In the meantime, libraries are now “scrambling” to ensure they can still provide resources.
“The hard part is not knowing, and we don’t know what to plan for,” Varga said. 
Virginia received at least $6 million in grants from IMLS in 2024 to help fund educational programs and digitize historical records, according to agency records. Those funds were provided through the Library Services and Technology Act, which is designed to support library services, technology, access and literacy programs for underserved communities.
The funding has also supported higher education institutions like Old Dominion University, Virginia Tech’s libraries, Virginia Union University’s Center for African American History and Culture & Library Services, George Mason University’s Virtual Library of Virginia and the University of Virginia Library.
 Statewide implications for universities, museums and libraries

In 2024, the Children’s Museum of Richmond received a $188,000 grant from the Museums for America Grant fund to expand its school readiness programs and resources in the Richmond area. The grant will also help educators with Virginia Commonwealth University’s School of Education to gather insights.
Sarah Newman, a spokeswoman for the Children’s Museum of Richmond, said the organization is still assessing the implications of the IMLS suspension. Other institutions, including the Christiansburg Institute and the Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art, are doing the same.
Newman said that nearly half of Virginia’s kindergartners still need to build literacy, math, self-regulation and social development skills. In response, the museum supports families preparing children for kindergarten through its Trailblazer Club. She said the disparities are even more alarming for Hispanic and English language learners. The threat of losing funding could devastate the program and several others.
“As a small nonprofit, this funding is not just meaningful—-it’s essential. The Museums for America grant enables us to commit staff time, develop curriculum, offer materials to families, and build lasting partnerships with early learning providers. Without this investment, the Trailblazer Club would not be possible at its current scale.”
Annually, IMLS awards funding to states including Virginia from the Grants to State Library Administrative Agencies fund, which is the largest source of federal dollars for library services in the U.S.
Last year, the Library of Virginia (LVA) received $9.7 million from IMLS, including $4.3 million dedicated to supporting the library’s goals over the next five years: developing community libraries for “lifelong learning” and “civic engagement”; providing access to information and cultural heritage to develop an informed community; and enhancing training for library leadership and staff to adapt to a changing environment.
The grant funding has supported the state’s newspaper archive program, adult services consulting and public library infrastructure.

Dennis Clark, the Librarian of Virginia, stated that it is “extremely unlikely” the Library of Virginia would be able to make up any funding cuts to its statewide initiatives. He noted that 16% of the library’s budget comes from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and this funding supports between 30 and 35 positions, which accounts for 25% of the Library of Virginia’s workforce.
“Rural public and school libraries in particular depend on the online databases, summer reading programs, and interlibrary loans that IMLS funding provides,” Clark said in a statement. “Libraries are the nexus of community and civic engagement, and are available to every Virginian, regardless of education, income, or status and the elimination of the IMLS puts that in jeopardy.”
Clark said the library expects the funding from the grants to remain available through the end of the fiscal year, which closes Sept. 30. However, as of Friday afternoon, the library has not received its last funding infusion. 
“All other funding — the majority of what Virginia receives — would likely be considered discretionary, and it’s unlikely that those obligations will be met, as there are no longer active IMLS employees,” Clark said. 
He said given that the Museum and Library Services Act expires this year, and the intent of Trump’s executive order, the act “seems unlikely to be reauthorized.”

The Rhode Island Clean Water Association is hosting a series of open houses at five local wastewater treatment plans starting Tuesday. The public events aim to promote awareness and understanding of the typically closed-door process responsible for turning wastewater into clean water, able to be discharged without environmental or human health consequences.
“This is some major infrastructure that is hidden in plain sight and taken for granted,” Peter Connell, president of the Clean Water Association, said in a statement. “You really need to see the process to appreciate what happens after you flush the toilet.”
Rhode Island’s 19 treatment plants, known as water resource recovery facilities, process more than 120 million gallons of wastewater each day, ensuring that the water returned to the environment is clean and safe. All facilities are permitted and inspected by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management for compliance with state environmental regulations.
Open house dates and locations are:

10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Tuesday April 8, at the Bristol Wastewater Treatment Facility at 2 Plant St., Bristol
10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Wednesday, April 9, at the Newport Wastewater Treatment Facility at JT Connell Highway, Newport
10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Thursday, April 10, at the Quonset Point Wastewater Treatment Facility at 150 Zarbo Ave., North Kingstown
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, April 12, at the Fields Point Wastewater Treatment Facility at 2 Ernest St., Providence
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, April 12, at the Warwick Wastewater Treatment Facility at 125 Arthur W. Devine Boulevard, Warwick (rain date, April 19)

Tours will be offered throughout the designated time frames and last 45 minutes. Visitors are asked to avoid wearing open-toed or high-heeled shoes or flip-flops.
More information is available on the Rhode Island Clean Water Association website.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The U.S. Justice Department announced last week that it will surge FBI assets across the country to address unresolved violent crimes in areas with high Native American populations, including crimes related to missing and murdered Indigenous people.
The FBI will send 60 personnel, rotating in 90-day temporary duty assignments over a six-month period. A news release described the effort as “Operation Not Forgotten” and said it will be “the longest and most intense national deployment of FBI resources to address Indian Country crime to date.”
FBI personnel will support field offices in Albuquerque; Denver; Detroit; Jackson, Mississippi; Minneapolis; Oklahoma City; Phoenix; Portland, Oregon; Seattle; and Salt Lake City. The FBI will work in partnership with other federal and tribal law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions, the Justice Department said, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs Missing and Murdered Unit.
The territory of the FBI’s Minneapolis office includes North Dakota.
At the beginning of fiscal year 2025, the FBI’s Indian Country program had approximately 4,300 open investigations, including over 900 death investigations, 1,000 child abuse investigations, and more than 500 domestic violence and adult sexual abuse investigations, according to the news release.
“Crime rates in American Indian and Alaska Native communities are unacceptably high,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in the release. “By surging FBI resources and collaborating closely with U.S. attorneys and tribal law enforcement to prosecute cases, the Department of Justice will help deliver the accountability that these communities deserve.”
FBI director Kash Patel said in the news release that “the FBI will manhunt violent criminals on all lands” and also “find those who have gone missing.”

(Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.



North Carolina food banks, small farms will suffer
Trump administration cuts have North Carolina food assistance programs and farmers confused and worried. As Raleigh’s News & Observer reported in March, the cuts will eliminate around $11.4 million from the state’s share of the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program and $19 million from the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program.
Amy Beros, CEO of the nonprofit Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina, told the N&O that “It’s [the Trump administration action] going to take healthy food away from children and funds away from family farms.”
Likewise, Patrick Brown, a small farmer from Henderson, said, “I couldn’t believe the program was going to be killed.”

Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.











A lot of these farmers, they're living their dreams.


– Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture



“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system
In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

For over a decade I have helped lead an annual trip of community leaders from western Colorado to meet with federal agencies and our members of Congress. We travel to Washington, D.C., because the U.S. Constitution established the need for a compact and independent seat for the federal government.
In contrast, Project 2025 — the current administration’s top-down blueprint to dismantle government and inspire “trauma” in its workforce — undermines this critical foundation of our republic.
Project 2025 attacks many things, including America’s public lands. It would open up our national estate to increased privatization, industrialization and outright liquidation. In its section on the Department of Interior, Project 2025 specifically states: “(The Bureau of Land Management) headquarters belongs in the American West.” But my own experience has led me to think otherwise, and to conclude that America’s Founders who debated, drafted and then agreed on our Constitution, are instead the ones who are correct.

Each year, we travel from our valley to meet with leadership at agencies and with all our federal elected officials or offices. In just a few days we can meet with the Interior Department and its agencies like the bureaus of Land Management and of Reclamation to talk about public lands and irrigation projects.
Our rural delegation, which includes farmers, can meet with U.S. Department of Agriculture, and agencies such as the Natural Resources Conservation Service to talk about soil health funding and program priorities, and with the Forest Service to talk about managing the local watersheds. Within a few days we bring concerns and questions directly to top leaders of several agencies and to our representatives only because we are able to visit a single seat of government.
I feel confident that this is as the Founders intended.
The rationale for relocating BLM headquarters — to better serve public lands stakeholders — is dubious. Project 2025 itself admits that the agency is already highly decentralized, writing that “97 percent of BLM employees are located in the American West.” These state and field offices, and agency employees who staff them, are indeed critical. But Project 2025 also demands vast federal workforce reductions. This transparent bad-faith argument made by Project 2025 should be a warning to any and all who want to see the efficient and proper management of our public lands.
BLM headquarters belongs with its department, which belongs with fellow federal departments in the independent and compact seat of government. This most efficiently allows states, citizens and stakeholders from across a far-flung nation the opportunity to petition the government for redress. And it better meets other purposes for which businesses, states and localities, and citizens might have to meet, share information, and work with the variety of agencies that make up our national government.
Like most of the parts of our Constitution, the idea and particulars of a federal seat of government and its agencies was discussed and debated. In the Federalist Papers, James Madison emphasized the necessity of complete authority at the seat of government to ensure its independence and effectiveness. “… but a dependence of the general government on the State (that holds the seat of authority) … for protection in the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonorable to the (federal government) and dissatisfactory to the other (states).”
The American republic is a union of free and sovereign states. As Madison and the Founders rightfully concluded, a functional federal government protects the individual sovereignty of all the states and of all its citizens. States, and the people, serve to check overreach by the federal government. And the federal government is also sovereign, as a necessary force to provide balance among the needs and perspectives of the varied states.
Madison saw a federal seat of government and its agencies as key to protecting the republic’s own independence, which in turn best guards the equal footing of the states. One can suppose that the Constitution’s authors wanted to ensure that the presence of the federal government in any of the various states could not compromise the nation’s ability to perform its duties with impartiality.
That federal functions not be paired closely with particular states “has the more weight, as the gradual accumulation of public improvements at the stationary residence of the government would be both too great a public pledge to be left in the hands of a single State,” Madison wrote.
Project 2025 does not seek to create more efficiency, but to deconstruct the federal government and to privatize public lands and resources so that a narrow set of wealthy interests can take an even greater share. Madison correctly saw peril in a weak federal government and intended for the national capital to serve as its “stationary residence.” The establishment of major national agencies outside of this seat runs contrary to that purpose and need.
Project 2025 stands contrary to the shared American project. Project 2025 is not interested in better management for our public lands, more public engagement in decision-making, or even that these lands, or much of the government, remain public at all. Moving the BLM headquarters away from its department and all its sister agencies is part and parcel of the Project 2025 plan.
And no one who cherishes our national public lands ought to be fooled one bit, or for one moment, otherwise.

(Screencap/CapitolTV)From mid-December to January, workers in the Department of Human Services (DHS) were forced to process public benefits like food stamps the old fashioned way — on paper — after its system was hacked by cybercriminals.
Now, nearly four months after RIBridges — the system used to manage eligibility and applications for social services as well as the state’s health insurance marketplace — was taken offline, everything is in its right place again. 
“I would say we’re back to full system operation,” Kimberly Merolla-Brito, DHS director, told the state representatives on the health and human services subcommittee of the House Committee on Finance at a hearing last Wednesday.   
During the four-hour meeting last week, the subcommittee heard from DHS, the state’s Medicaid office, and the parent agency of both entities, the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS), about their respective agencies’ budgetary needs and predicted challenges in the upcoming fiscal year, which begins July 1. The Rhode Island House of Representatives drives the budget-making process after the governor’s office submits its spending proposal in January.   
As the state’s health and human services agencies get back on their feet after the massive cyberattack which put the personal data of hundreds of thousands of Rhode Islanders at risk, officials continue to have a lot of tech on their wish lists. 
“I see it all through EOHHS’ budget…it’s just the unbelievable amount of technology that we’re bringing into the state,” said Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, about a $31 million capital plan request to replace RIKidsBridge, which child welfare workers use to manage cases.
Other big asks include $62 million from EOHHS to modernize its Medicaid information management system, with $6.2 million coming from state revenue and the rest coming from federal funding.
The state has already encountered problems with implementing one initiative: An income verification system that would automate eligibility checks for benefits applicants. It is contracted for $8.9 million, according to the EOHHS presentation, but the contract with Experian has not yet been inked, and the initiative is not likely to take effect this year as originally intended.
There have also been issues with a $91 million initiative to replace the state’s payroll system.
There could also be trouble down the road for the state’s modernization projects for Medicaid and RIBridges, according to Linda Haley, principal legislative analyst in the House Fiscal Advisory Staff. She told lawmakers in her presentation on the EOHHS budget that the federal match rate for Medicaid funding projects may be reduced soon — from the feds supplying 75% to 90% of funding to offering a 50% match instead. 
Rhode Island, like other states, is waiting to see what the fallout will be from a Republican Congressional budget that opponents strongly suspect will have to slash Medicaid to meet its spending goals. 
But for Rhode Island residents, the state’s current technology is at least working as it should, and access to public benefits is smoother than it was in December. Merolla-Brito said her agency acknowledged customers’ access to benefits as “a guiding principle,” and DHS managed to avoid interruption of people’s benefits over the duration of the network outage.
“But we did have some bumps in the road with some of the provider payments,” Merolla-Brito said.
RIBridges was brought back online in phases starting in January, with the employee backend coming first, followed by the online interface for customers. 
As of March 29, the HealthyRhode mobile app used to access the benefits portal is back online, and has been uploaded to the Google Play store and Apple’s App Store in an updated version. An EOHHS newsletter sent to providers in March showed the HealthyRhode app has also been outfitted with a number of user-friendly improvements.
But some distrust of the service remains among users, even if things are back to normal.
“We have seen a decrease in use of the mobile app … and we have seen a decrease in use of the customer portal,” Merolla-Brito said. “So there are efforts in motion for technology adoption, to rebuild trust and to get customers back into using these technologies.”

(Photo illustration by Getty Images)New Hampshire reduced its business profits tax from 8.5% to 7.5% and its business enterprise tax from .75% to .55% in a series of cuts spanning from 2016 to 2024. The result, according to new research from the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, was somewhere between $795 million and $1.17 billion in forgone revenue.
“The rate reductions do not appear to have provided clear, unambiguous economic benefits to the state,” Phil Sletten, author of the study and research director at the Fiscal Policy Institute, said. “They may have, but we have not been able to measure those economic impacts in a way that is directly identifiable as a result of the tax rate reductions. However, the state not having sufficient revenue to fund existing services is a clearly identifiable risk associated with having fewer public dollars available, including from business tax revenues.”
While the timing of the study wasn’t intended to correlate with the state’s budget season — Sletten said his team was awaiting final audited figures for fiscal year 2024 to be released in March — it comes in the middle of a challenging fiscal environment for lawmakers. In February, Gov. Kelly Ayotte released her proposal for a nearly $16 billion two-year budget, which lawmakers in the state House of Representatives subsequently began debating and amending. Ayotte’s budget relies on optimistic fiscal projections that predict the state’s tax revenues will rebound sharply after years of lagging. However, the House Ways and Means Committee estimated these revenues would come in hundreds of millions of dollars lower than the governor did, and the House Finance Committee has been hacking away at the budget to make it fit into that lower projection.
In the study, Sletten explained that his team built off a similar analysis it did in 2023, adding in newly available data, and examined New Hampshire job growth, personal income growth, and overall economic growth. They compared those data points across different time periods before and after cuts and to different parts of the country with different tax rates.
“There’s not a clear pattern that would provide evidence of a direct and overriding causal relationship between business profits tax rate levels and either higher or lower in job growth in the state’s economy,” he said.
Sletten said that they created their range — $795 million to $1.17 billion — by using two different recuperation rates. In other words, if the state was able to recoup 0% of the revenue it lost from these cuts through increased economic growth, it likely would have lost out on $1.17 billion. If it had recouped 32% — a figure Sletten called “relatively high” — the state likely would’ve lost out on $795 million. Sletten said that because New Hampshire is a small state it is possible more businesses are able to travel across borders, hence the high maximum recuperation rate.
Proponents of the tax cuts said they’d spur economic growth, which would offset the loss and result in higher revenue. However, what the Fiscal Policy Institute found, Sletten said, was that there was no correlation between these tax rate reductions and economic performance, relative to other parts of the country. This does not mean the state’s total revenue decreased during that time. It actually increased, but this analysis found that those increases weren’t higher than other parts of the country without similar tax rate reductions, and they found no evidence that the tax reductions were the cause of these increases as proponents argued they would be.
“The increases that New Hampshire has seen in state corporate tax revenues are not unique to New Hampshire,” Sletten said. “If the changes were driven by state policy in New Hampshire, then New Hampshire might be breaking a trend that we’d see relative to what we see in other states. However, we see that tax revenues for state corporate taxes nationwide have increased substantially during this time period.”
In fact, he said, state business tax revenues across the country have increased even higher than in New Hampshire alone. From fiscal years 2015 to 2023, New Hampshire’s combined business tax revenues saw a 124% increase. Nationwide during this period, all 50 states collectively saw a 192% increase. The Fiscal Policy Institute also looked specifically at New Hampshire’s neighbors. Vermont saw a 166% increase and Maine saw a 167% increase during this period. Across the entirety of New England, excluding New Hampshire, there was a 172% increase during this period. However, New Hampshire did outperform Massachusetts, which saw a 105% increase.
“We can’t definitively say that there is no economic impact from the business profits or business enterprise tax rate reductions,” Sletten said. “However, it is not clear that there is an economic impact. For the business tax rate reductions to have spurred enough economic activity to generate more revenue, we would have seen those impacts in job growth, in personal income growth, in growth in the size of the economy overall in a manner that would have been much clearer than the lack of correlation that we saw.”
Sletten also explained that a huge portion of the revenue generated from the business profits tax comes from a small number of large multistate and multinational corporations. These are corporations less affected by New Hampshire policy alone, but rather by national and other state policies as well. This means the increase in their economic performance and the amount of revenue they generate for the state might not be as much a result of New Hampshire policy. It also means that the benefits of these tax cuts disproportionately went to out-of-state corporations.
“There is some significant evidence that the revenue would likely flow to shareholders or owners of the company, which may include shareholders,” he said. “Shareholders could be anywhere in the world or anywhere, depending on the company, that shares are accessible for people to buy, right? So to the extent that a business profit tax rate reduction benefits shareholders by increasing profits and those profits are then distributed to the people who own the company — whether it’s publicly traded or a private entity — those individuals don’t necessarily live in New Hampshire, right? Or have to live in New Hampshire to receive those benefits. So they could be anywhere in the world. There is some significant research … regarding who benefits when there’s a business profit tax rate reduction. And there is some component that goes to workers. But it’s generally considered by the research a relatively small share that goes to pay employees. Now that could be different in different economic environments. However, the research suggests that when a portion goes to employee pay, there’s one study that estimated that a very sizable percentage of that benefit would go to employees at the top end of the income scale in a company.”
Free-market and fiscal conservatives still argue the merits of these tax reductions.
“The purpose of business tax cuts was not to generate more state revenue,” Andrew Cline, president of the New Hampshire-based conservative think tank Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, said in an email to the Bulletin. “It was to reduce the tax burden and make New Hampshire more economically competitive, which it did.”
Cline, who said he hadn’t yet read the full study when he wrote to the Bulletin, pointed out that New Hampshire now ranks above Texas in lowest tax burden. He also pointed out that then-Gov. Maggie Hassan predicted business tax revenues would decrease after these rate reductions. They increased.
“People will debate how much of New Hampshire’s rising revenues can be attributed to the tax cuts,” Cline said. “It’s interesting that opponents claim no effect from those cuts while giving credit instead to the growing national economy, which received a boost from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. At least they’re acknowledging, even if they don’t realize it, that tax cuts have positive economic effects.”
He also argued that the increase in the number of registered businesses in good standing in New Hampshire is evidence that the tax cuts were not simply benefitting large, out-of-state corporations but were also enabling local business growth.
The Fiscal Policy Institute’s study did not examine the impacts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a hallmark action of President Donald Trump’s first term in office. Additionally, that federal tax cut package impacted all 50 states. And New Hampshire’s further tax cuts did not give it an edge over the rest of the country, which also saw these federal cuts, the study found.
Meanwhile, Sletten prefers direct investment in citizens and cuts targeted at the least wealthy.
“If we look at the economic literature available regarding which policies do provide effective economic stimulus,” Sletten said, “policies that direct more resources and assistance to residents with low and moderate incomes, whether that’s a tax rate reduction that’s targeted at individuals with low and moderate incomes or services that support individuals or families with low and moderate incomes, those are estimated to, based on the economic modeling and evidence collected by both public and private sector entities, have a more substantial economic impact in terms of stimulating the economy per dollar invested by a public entity, such as state government or the federal government.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/biztaxescuts-1024x573.jpg,,,2025-04-07 06:02:04.433083

During the summer of 2024, countless transgender and gender expansive patients expressed to me fears about what might happen to their access to gender affirming medical care if a conservative administration were to win the White House. This worst-case scenario became reality in the first weeks of 2025, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order redefining legal gender identity as a strict binary of male and female — effectively erasing recognition of nonbinary and transgender individuals and interrupting federal funding to institutions providing gender-affirming health care.
As a transgender health program intern, I have seen providers try to reassure patients of their well-being and safety while they themselves fear how their job will be affected if the laws would drastically alter the way we practice medicine.
As a gay man about to enter the medical profession, I am afraid. The recent wave of anti-trans initiatives pushed by this administration is part of a much broader effort to dismantle diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) programs across the country under the guise of “restoring meritocracy” and “leveling the playing field.” But in health care, the playing field has never been level. Minority populations continue to face disproportionate health risks and barriers to care.
DEIB is the foundation of medical education. It teaches future physicians how to address these disparities and combat the structural inequities that put vulnerable patients at risk. Studies show medical students have felt unprepared to manage transgender and gender expansive patients upon graduation. One study even claimed that only 27% of students were confident in their knowledge of the health needs of transgender patients. Beyond that, they could not correctly answer questions about race-related medical history despite affirming that understanding historical context is important in medicine. This lack of education was always a problem, and efforts were underway to solve it. Eliminating DEIB would not only erode this progress but set us back behind where we were even before we started.
In 2020, the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) rolled out the Structural Competency Curriculum which aims to train providers “to recognize and respond to the impact of upstream, structural factors on patient health and health care.” Since then, medical schools around the country have adopted the values of this curriculum and incorporated it throughout the course of their students’ training. Health equity is a core pillar of medical students’ professional development and should be embedded into the culture of patient-centric care.
When DEIB is dismantled, programs like these disappear, and awareness of health disparities among marginalized patient populations fades from the culture of those whose job is to provide the proper care and treatment.
If physicians are not trained on specific health risks that directly impact transgender patients, how can we provide adequate care? If we are not taught about racial health disparities, how will we work to combat them? If we stop prioritizing inclusion, how can we ensure equal health care for all?
Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. Legislation cannot change a person’s identity, but it will change their access to health care. Medical schools need to teach this, and we as students want to learn. Future doctors like me are watching everything that is happening, and we are worried. When students apply to medical school, the number one question they are asked is, “Why medicine?” While the answer to this question can take many different forms, the bottom line is pretty simple: We want to help people. Medical schools can make a monumental difference in how future doctors navigate this political environment and provide care to patients. We urge medical schools to keep teaching us how to do that for all patients.

Such centers rely on funding from Medicaid, which congressional Republicans want to cut. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare. 
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state. 
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.
More than 5M could lose Medicaid coverage if feds impose work requirements

States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets. 
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state. 
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

DemasThis article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.
Illinois boasts 63 miles of coastline along Lake Michigan’s southwestern shore, nearly all of which is fortified by metal breakwaters, concrete seawalls and even swaths of land built out into the lake.
These structures are meant to protect the city of Chicago and its suburbs from coastal erosion. But according to Hillary Glandon, a scientist at the Lake Michigan Biological Station in Zion, Illinois, this fortification is “part of the problem.”
“You have protection structure after protection structure after protection structure, and it has really disrupted the natural flow and processes that occur in these coastal zones,” Glandon said.
With water levels that can vary by several feet from year to year—and climate change making these variations even more unpredictable—cities across the Great Lakes are working to fortify their coastlines and prevent erosion. But traditional coastal infrastructure like breakwalls can cost tens of millions of dollars, making them a heavy financial lift for local governments. And while these breakwalls help retain sand and build up the coastline directly inland of where they’re constructed, they also block currents from carrying sediment farther down the coast, compounding the effects of erosion downstream.
Glandon and her team have a solution: Install artificial reefs in the lake’s shallows to temper the intensity of waves and preserve the shoreline directly inland. Through a federally funded pilot project, the team is studying two artificial reefs—one at Illinois Beach State Park in Zion, and another at Fort Sheridan in nearby Highland Park. They’re hoping to collect data on how these reefs impact the local shoreline to see if artificial reefs are a scalable solution to coastal erosion in the Great Lakes.
“This project was hoping to come up with some softer designs, not necessarily fully stopping that movement of sand and water, but also a more cost effective design,” Glandon said. The two reefs she’s studying are both made entirely of natural materials and built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The reef at Fort Sheridan was built in 2020, while the one at Illinois Beach State Park was built the following year, designed as part of the University of Pennsylvania’s Healthy Port Futures program. Their approach, called “rubble ridges,” is relatively simple and involves piling dredged sand and limestone beneath the surface to block waves.
While artificial reefs have been used around the world to bolster biodiversity, their use for erosion control is new. Lake Michigan is already home to a handful of artificial reefs, most of which are located farther from shore as a habitat for marine life.
Some researchers in the U.S., though, say these could serve the dual purpose of boosting fish populations and preventing erosion, disrupting waves so that they’re less intense when they crash ashore.
“It’s a hydrodynamic optimization to get the wave energy that’’s coming into these reef structures,” said Ansel Garcia-Langley, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who’s working on another architected reef design. “As the waves hit these pillars, it forces the waves into different directions, so that they spin off into these vortices. So a lot of the energy coming in is dissipated in on itself.”
Garcia-Langley and his colleagues at MIT wrapped up their initial study of architected reefs last March, and found promising results. His team, headed by ocean science and engineering professor Michael Triantafyllou, created a unique cylindrical reef design that is intended to maximize drag on wave energy, forcing the waves through cracks in the structure to lower that energy before it hits the coast.
Reefs like these help preserve the natural flow of sand and sediment along coasts. Structures like seawalls can create what Garcia-Langley called “dead zones,” where this flow reaches a standstill, redirecting increased wave energy to the surrounding areas.
For local governments jockeying for control over the Lake Michigan shoreline, avoiding these dead zones is critical.
“The lake is valuable, right? People want to live near the lake. They want to be able to go to the beach,” Glandon said. “And so removing that possibility from a landowner due to actions upstream tends to cause some real tension.”
In Illinois, there are dozens of municipalities that border Lake Michigan, and hundreds of private landowners. Because the towns and property owners with a slice of that shoreline control their own infrastructure, shoreline protection can get heated. Sediment flows from north to south in Lake Michigan, so when one town installs a seawall, it can prevent sediment from reaching shores directly south, leaving those places more vulnerable.
This has led to heated debate between some shoreline towns, said Cody Eskew, a specialist in coastal studies with the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center. Eskew, who works closely with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, has helped run IDNR’s Shoreline Management Working Group since 2015, holding biannual meetings with local governments who share Lake Michigan’s coastline to work through their shoreline protection plans.
“At first, I think there was just a lack of understanding of what the shoreline dynamics were in our region, especially the North Shore region,” Eskew said. “At Illinois Beach State Park, there’s a ton of sand there, but when you go a little bit farther south toward those North Shore neighborhoods, we found that there’s just not much naturally occurring sand on that piece of the shoreline. So communities are really limited in terms of, you know, what they can expect from their neighbor and getting sand from updrift.”
That makes artificial reefs particularly alluring in the Great Lakes—they’re a way to block wave energy without making erosion worse for neighbors, and they’re far cheaper than traditional infrastructure. For instance, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources recently funded a project building 22 breakwalls off the coast of Illinois Beach State Park, which cost about $73 million. Installing the beach’s rubble ridges cost $1.4 million, according to Eskew.
“The typical community is not going to have in their capital budget to be able to install something that large,” he said of the breakwalls. “So they are really looking into those more hybrid structures.”
The costs aren’t set and can vary widely, said Juliet Simpson, a coastal ecologist with MIT’s Sea Grant program who also works on their architected reefs project with Garcia-Langley. Last year, the team estimated their model to cost about $6 million per mile, while Simpson noted that other reef models can cost upwards of $10 million per mile. The team is hoping to slash that cost even further to make these protections affordable for coastal communities.
So what’s keeping this new approach to artificial reefs from taking off? According to Sean Burkholder, who heads the UPenn Healthy Port Futures team that helped design the rubble ridges, it’s simply a lack of familiarity.
“We’ve lived on shorelines that have been protected by seawalls for hundreds of years, and we kind of know that they work,” Burkholder said. “We also kind of know when they fail, and how they’re going to fail. Any type of nature-based infrastructure, they’re not super well proven.”
To prove the concept, Glandon and her team are meticulously collecting data on how the artificial reefs at Illinois Beach and Fort Sheridan impact their respective shorelines over the course of five years.
The data is already showing promising results—and according to Eskew, it’s been drawing attention from officials working on shoreline management all over Lake Michigan. If all goes well, these rubble ridges could soon appear beneath the surface of many of the Great Lakes.
“Often these types of structures are built, and there’s very few requirements for post construction monitoring.” Glandon said. “I think this is a really quantitative picture of shoreline change and aquatic habitat creation as a result of these nearshore breakwaters.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0564-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-07 06:02:04.433083

Multiple representatives for Haslam Sports Group were contacted by email and on social media but did not respond. An inquiry to the contact information on the group’s website also did not receive a response.
Background
Ohio House Republicans unveiled its version of the state budget on April 1.It included $600 million in state-backed bonds for a new domed stadium in Brook Park for the Cleveland Browns. 
Calling it “a once-in-a-lifetime project,” House Finance Committee Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, praised the deal, suggesting the stadium and similar projects, are “huge economic drivers.”
The proposal was first announced last year, with the Browns looking to leave their current home at Huntington Bank Field on the lakefront in downtown Cleveland. The team is asking for $1.2 billion in taxpayer money to help pay for the project, which may cost $2.4 billion to build. Under their plan, $600 million would come from the state in the form of bonds, and be paid back by tax revenues. 
Brook Park and Cuyahoga County would be asked for another $600 million in bonds, to be covered by parking, admissions, and income tax. The rest would be paid for by the Haslam Sports Group, which owns the Cleveland Browns, and if all goes well, the stadium will be open by 2029. 
State, county, and city officials have condemned the plan. 
Gov. Mike DeWine recommends raising the sports betting tax and using the money to create a fund that all sports teams can use. DeWine has also argued that Ohio doesn’t have the money for such a project, saying “We can’t really afford to continue to put money in sports stadiums out of a general fund.”
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, has said the state can’t afford to fully fund public education. Last week, he submitted a proposed budget decimating the amount called for under the Fair School Funding Plan by about two-thirds, to $226 million.

Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb also criticized the idea, and Cuyahoga County Executive Chris Ronayne called the proposal “a risky bet with taxpayer dollars.” He believes the data isn’t there to justify his county’s investment. 
Jimmy Haslam is the Chairman and Managing Partner of the Haslam Sports Group, and his wife Susan “Dee” Haslam is CEO. They own the Browns, co-own the Milwaukee Bucks, and have operating rights to the Columbus Crew. Jimmy Haslam’s personal net worth is $8.5 billion, and the Haslam family overall is valued at $14.4billion. 
Aside from owning the Browns, the Haslams are also significant political donors. They’ve contributed millions to federal and statewide causes over the years, and most recently were among the largest individual donors opposing this past November’s Issue 1 amendment against gerrymandering. Voters rejected the amendment, which sought to remove politicians from the map-making process.
Now, several of the lawmakers who will determine if the stadium proposal ends up in the state budget have received contributions from the Haslam family. 
The Ohio Capital Journal reviewed campaign finance reports from Jan.1 2024 to April 3 2025, and asked lawmakers if this cash would impact their decision-making. 
Republicans
The majority of Haslam family donations were to Republican politicians. Jimmy and Dee Haslam held a fundraiser for J.D. Vance during his 2022 Senate race, and another for current Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno. 
The state official who has benefitted most from the Haslam family’s largesse is Huffman, the House speaker who wants to slash funding for public education. 
Between Jan. 1, 2024 and March 24, 2025, Huffman’s political action committee (PAC) Huffman for Ohio accepted $60,999 from Jimmy and Dee Haslam, according to campaign finance reports. The couple are among the Ohio House speaker’s largest individual donors. 
Huffman has voiced support for the Brook Park stadium idea. 
“I’ve heard mostly positive things from our Republican caucus about it, so we’ll see what happens here,” the news organization Signal Cleveland quoted Huffman as saying. 
“Campaign contributions do not influence policy decisions,” Huffman’s office said when asked about the donations.

Stewart, chairman of the House Finance Committee, didn’t receive donations from the Haslams directly, but his largest contribution was from Huffman’s PAC, $15,499 on Feb. 7.
 “This is going to be a destination center,” The Columbus Dispatch quoted Stewart as saying about the project. “I really do think when the ribbon is cut and people walk in the door, I think people are going to be happy that this is in Ohio.”
House Finance Committee Vice Chair Mike Dovilla, R-Berea, received $2,500  from Dee Haslam and Jimmy Haslam on Aug. 16, 2024, in two separate donations worth $1,250.
There are twenty-one Republicans on the House Finance Committee. Including Dovilla, four have accepted direct contributions from the Haslams:

Rep. Gayle Manning, R-North Ridgeville: $2,500
Rep.  Sharon Ray, R-Wadsworth: $2,500
Rep. Jamie Callender, R-Concord: $2,500

Manning’s donation was accepted most recently, on Sept. 13, while Dovilla’s was delivered on Aug. 16. 
Of the nine Republicans on the House Arts, Athletics and Tourism Committee, Committee Chair Melanie Miller, R-Ashland, and Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, have accepted direct contributions from the Haslams.  Miller was given $1,250 on Aug. 19 last year by Jimmy Haslam, and Rep. Thomas received $2,500 from Jimmy and Dee on the same date. 
“Campaign contributions do not influence my policy decisions,” replied Rep. Miller in an email. 
Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, has voiced skepticism about the Haslams’  proposal, saying “I’m not in favor of something that would just simply be a handout. There would have to be an ability to be paid back.” 
McColley received $30,999 from Jimmy and Dee Haslam last year, according to campaign finance reports. 
Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirkland, was appointed Senate Finance Committee Chair in January. 
“It is imperative we are good stewards of your taxpayer dollars and make sure those funds are properly utilized,” Cirino said when given the position. “I look forward to working with my colleagues to accomplish our goals for our state’s continued prosperity and progress.”
Reports show Jimmy and Dee Haslam gave Cirino $15,000 in August of last year, and attended an event supporting Cirino on Aug. 29.
Three other Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee have received donations from Jimmy and Dee Haslam within the last year. They are:

Sen. Nathan Manning, R-North Ridgeville: $5,000
Sen. Tom Patton, R-Strongsville: $5,000
Sen. Mark Romanchuk, R-Ontario: $2,500

Democrats
Only five Democrats appeared on the list of candidates to whom the Haslams have donated. Rep.Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Westlake, is a ranking member on the House Finance Committee. She accepted $5,000 from Jimmy and Dee Haslam last year. Rep. Terrence Upchurch, D-Cleveland, serves on the Arts, Athletics and Tourism Committee. He was given $1,250 by Jimmy Haslam on Aug. 27, 2024.
Should Ohio taxpayers give Jimmy Haslam $600 million for a new Cleveland Browns stadium?

Upchurch, along with Reps. Dani Issacsohn, D-Cincinnati, and Dontavius Jarrells, D-Columbus, issued a statement calling for a pause on the stadium plan, writing, “Elected officials have a responsibility to the people we represent – not to developers, not to sports owners, but to working families.”
Three other Democrats are beneficiaries of contributions: 

House Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington:$2,500
Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood: $2,500
Rep. Darnell Brewer, D-Cleveland: $2,500

Does money influence policy?
Common Cause Ohio Executive Director Catherine Turcer said that major donors to candidates often consider these contributions an investment in their business.
“Ohioans aren’t naive. It’s not hard to connect the dots,” she said. “The legislators are considering cuts in education and services that impact our daily life. Campaign cash is the only reason our legislators would consider corporate welfare to the tune of $600 million.”
Political activity in Ohio increasingly requires large sums of money. Last year, the pro- and anti-Issue 1 campaigns raised a combined $42,600,000 from donors and dark money groups, while $113.2 million was raised in the race for Sherrod Brown’s Senate seat, now occupied by Republican Bernie Moreno. 
Money can often be wielded to pressure politicians. The Ohio House Bill 6 scandal, which led to the incarceration of former House Speaker Larry Householder, and the Cincinnati City Hall bribery investigation are recent examples. 
Both cases involved bribery and quid pro quos — neither of which can be proven by just a campaign contribution. 
In Turcer’s view, even if donations don’t constitute bribery, campaign cash is essential to a lawmaker’s survival, and generosity from donors or corporations often hangs over their heads. 
“Campaign contributions influence public policy with a wink and a nod. The avalanche of dark money or secret money doesn’t mean that our representatives aren’t influenced by it,” she said. “It just means that it’s harder for the public to clearly identify shenanigans. The role of money in elections is so pervasive that many seeking office just think of it as just business as usual.”

Last Friday, a pair of GOP state Court of Appeals judges accepted Griffin’s ridiculous theory that sixty-five thousand registered North Carolina voters who complied with all voting rules, including providing a valid photo ID, must still nonetheless come forward and again prove their identity, or have their votes thrown out.
The ruling is a stunning assault on democracy. As Judge Tobias Hampson wrote in a long and scathing dissent, quote “changing the rules by which these lawful voters took part in our electoral process after the election to discard their otherwise valid votes – in an attempt to alter the outcome of only one race among many on the ballot – is directly counter to law, equity, and the Constitution.”
The bottom line: Hampson is right. The voters have spoken in the Riggs-Griffin contest, and this rogue ruling cannot be allowed to stand.

The Ohio Housing Trust Fund was created in 1991 and is administered by the Ohio Department of Development. It is funded by a portion of the fees collected by county recorders, with half of the fees staying with the county and the other half going back to the Ohio Housing Trust Fund — which requires at least 50% of the funds be spent in non-urban areas.

“Through the Trust Fund, it funds homeless services, home modifications and repairs for homeowners, usually individuals who are aging,” said Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio’s Executive Director Amy Riegel. “It also provides gap financing for housing development and affordable housing development across the state.” 
The House budget proposal would remove the requirement for county recorders to send the Department of Development money to reallocate the funds, making it less effective across the state.
“Each county, whatever their receipts are, that’s the funding they have, and that’s all the funding that they have,” Riegel said. “It is a significant change.”
She was surprised to see this in the House’s budget proposal. 
“When the state is able to aggregate those dollars, they are then able to put it back out into communities where it is most needed at that time, and there are not enough resources,” Riegel said. “The Trust Fund could be 10 times what it is today, and we still wouldn’t be able to solve every housing issue across the state, but it is very effective, very useful dollars. … This is a program that actually works really well, that’s very strong, and we only have the hope to continue to strengthen it.”
Ohio is lacking more than 264,000 affordable rental units, according to the 2025 Gap Report released by the National Low Income Housing Coalition and coalition on housing and homelessness. Ohioans make at least $20.81 an hour working a full-time job to be able to afford a “modest” two-bedroom apartment, according to the 2024 Out of Reach Ohio report.
Ohio House lawmakers also nixed Gov. Mike DeWine’s Ohio Housing Investment Opportunity Program in the budget that would have invested $100 million in fiscal year 2026 to help increase single and multi-family housing in rural areas. 
“That would have helped individuals build all types of homes,” Riegel said. “I know that was something that the home builders have really advocated for, so disappointing to see that not included.”
The House’s proposed version of the budget would give the Ohio Housing Finance Agency $18.9 million for fiscal year 2026 and $19.6 for fiscal year 2027, the same as DeWine’s proposal. 
The House is set to vote on its version on the budget soon. The budget will then go to the Senate before going back to DeWine’s desk where it must be signed into law by June 30.

Meanwhile, a bipartisan pair of lawmakers are trying to prevent electronic benefit card fraud by equipping them with chip technology.
As the House released its proposed spending priorities for the next two years, its Agriculture Committee heard about plans to help Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants, and a rundown of the Ohioans who could be impacted by those changes.
“As a health care provider, I am acutely aware that food security is a fundamental social determinant of health,” said state Rep. Kellie Deeter, R-Norwalk.
Deeter and Rep. Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood, are co-sponsors of House Bill 163, which would enhance SNAP benefit cards with chip technology similar to that on most debit and credit cards.
According to the bill sponsors, $17 million in SNAP benefits were stolen from Ohio residents from June 2023 to January 2025. That money was reimbursed through a federal program, but that program ended in 2025.
“That means when SNAP benefits are stolen now, families will shoulder the loss,” Deeter said. “These are real Ohioans who suddenly find themselves without the means to buy groceries, through no fault of their own.”
Rader is also sponsoring a bill with Rep. Desiree Tims, D-Dayton, that would establish a state program to replace SNAP benefits for victims of electronic benefit theft, hoping to appropriate $17 million from the General Revenue Fund for that cause.
“This came through a conversation because I continue to get calls from constituents who have lost their benefits, often disabled veterans, often senior citizens, who are in a panic on how they’re going to access food because of the SNAP threat and the (electronic benefit transfer) theft,” Tims said.
In fiscal year 2022, Ohio households received $306 per month in average SNAP benefits. Households with older adults received $155 per month on average, according to research by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

In an analysis of state and federal SNAP data from fiscal year 2024, the center’s research showed that, of the nearly 1.4 million Ohio residents using SNAP, more than 43% are families with older adults or disabled individuals. That’s higher than the national rate of 37%.
Families with children make up the largest group, with more than 62% of SNAP participants falling into that category, the same as the national rate. The center also found that 35% of SNAP recipients are members of working families.
Legislators are fighting to see those benefits returned as the legislature debates cuts to hunger assistance even beyond the federal program, along with work requirements for SNAP recipients.
Ohio hunger budget
 
The SNAP work requirements in the Ohio House’s draft budget weren’t part of Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive proposal.
If the House’s version of the work requirements become law, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services would be prohibited from “seeking, applying for, or renewing a waiver from the work requirements that apply to able-bodied adults without dependents,” budget documents say.
The Department of Job and Family Services also couldn’t implement a “federal option” to grant exemptions from SNAP work requirements, though the draft budget noted that SNAP benefits are funded by the federal government, so the work requirement doesn’t impact the state budget funds.
The House draft budget kept language from DeWine’s proposal regarding the assessment of SNAP participants who may be eligible for a work requirement waiver. The provision allows the state job and family services agency to refer participants in SNAP and the Ohio Works First programs who are “claiming a mental or physical illness or impairment” to the Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities office for “vocational rehabilitation assessment and support.”
Unless Ohioans are unable to meet minimum work requirements, as determined by the disability agency, they would be required to meet work requirements to receive benefits, according to the proposal.
The House budget also would require recipients to report “changes in circumstances that may affect eligibility for continued receipt of benefits” within 30 days of the change, a provision that also bars the job and family services department from “implementing simplified or quarterly reporting procedures for households receiving SNAP benefits.”
Food fight
Advocates for the hungry have said increased support for SNAP benefits is critical for Ohioans who need food assistance, especially as the current SNAP levels often need to be supplemented by food banks and other programs.
“The relationship between food banking and public assistance, particularly … SNAP, is relatively straightforward: SNAP provides more meals than we ever could,” said Hope Lane-Gavin, director of nutrition policy and programs for the Ohio Association of Food Banks, in testimony supporting another piece of anti-fraud legislation, a Senate resolution to urge Congress to restore stolen SNAP benefits.
Lane-Gavin also said significant changes in SNAP can affect “everything from the benefit allotment itself to changes in accessibility in the program’s application and interview.” Those changes are felt throughout the food assistance system, including food banks, she said.
“I offer that to say, even when the program is working as intended, for many Ohio families receiving SNAP benefits, the benefit itself is woefully inadequate.”
Food banks may have to brace for more cuts, as the House’s proposal chopped funding allotted to the Children’s Hunger Alliance via Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) dollars. DeWine’s executive proposal maintained the current funding of $7.5 million over the next two years, but the House proposal slashes it to just $3 million.
The alliance said in a statement that the reduction would cut 2.8 million meals throughout the state, and double the number of schools on a waitlist to participate in alliance programs.
“Across Ohio’s 32 Appalachian counties, children bear the brunt of hunger, and we provide food at 338 sites,” alliance president and CEO Michelle Brown wrote in a call-to-action email sent on Thursday. “In Columbiana and Athens counties alone, this cut represents about 150,000 meals.”
The Ohio Association of Foodbanks has previously pleaded with legislators to help, because the organization couldn’t afford to provide for another increase in hungry families in the state. Federal-level cuts could also be looming.
The House’s version of the budget took up DeWine’s proposal to earmark $44.1 million in TANF funds over the next two years for the association. The governor specified those funds should be used not only to purchase and distribute food, but also for SNAP outreach, along with summer meal programs, free tax filing services and “capacity building equipment.”
The budget also includes a proposal for a sub-grant agreement with the food banks association to distribute food to low-income families and support “transportation of meals for the Governor’s Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives Innovative Summer Meals program.”
Through the agreement, the association would be required to purchase food for state food programs, support a capacity-building grant program and pay for equipment for “partner agencies that is needed to increase their capacity to serve more families eligible under the TANF program.”
The Ohio Senate will draft its own budget before the House and Senate drafts can be combined and sent to the governor. The deadline for approval the state budget is June 30.

They filled the streets in Topeka, in Lawrence, in Wichita, in Kansas City and elsewhere. They marched, they chanted, they waved signs. They spoke out loudly against the unprecedented authoritarian threat emanating from Washington, D.C., where President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have mangled constructional norms.
These thousands of Kansans showed, over the course of one inspirational day, that Americans will not roll over and accept a would-be dictator. For those who have hesitated to speak, or felt reluctant to share opinions, let these protesters inspire you.
Free speech will only die if we let it.
That same day, Kansas Reflector staff members appeared for a town hall at the Lawrence Public Library, sponsored by the Women for Kansas of Lawrence/Douglas County. Nearly 70 folks attended, many coming straight from the protest. While I could sense optimism and enthusiasm from the crowd, a dark river of fear still flowed beneath the surface. Not everyone in the United States, or Kansas, can count on their safety these days.
We have watched the government snatch students from the streets. We have seen visas and green cards rescinded on a whim. And those who previously wouldn’t have thought twice about traveling to or from the United States must now weigh the potential risks of doing so.

As columnist Eric Thomas wrote Friday, this complicates matters for those of us who work as journalists or train would-be journalists. Certain subjects — the Israel-Hamas war — and certain categories of people — immigrants, students, professors — have been targeted by the D.C. cartel. I couldn’t in good conscience tell a student on a visa from the Middle East to write about pro-Palestinian protests. As a journalist I would have to weigh carefully telling the story of an immigrant who might be the target of a deportation order.
In some situations, the risk might be worth it. But I wouldn’t want to make that decision for anyone.
As I told the crowd at the Lawrence library, this puts responsibility on the rest of us. My family has lived in the United States for generations. I’m still, as far as I know, a white male. That doesn’t mean I should take comfort in the threats emanating from our nation’s capital. It means that I — and others like me — have a greater responsibility to speak in support of those under threat.
Not that you would know from the lousy examples set by those in high places.
An epidemic of spinelessness has spread throughout this country’s power centers. You can hardly visit the website of a news organization without reading headlines like “‘The Terror Is Real’: An Appalled Tech Industry Is Scared to Criticize Elon Musk” or “Law firms refuse to represent Trump opponents in the wake of his attacks.” Closer to home, we have this one from yours truly: “Trump’s tariffs will wreck Kansas economy. Gutless wonders at the Statehouse won’t even protest.”



What do they fear? A mean tweet from a real estate developer? Primary election challengers? Losing a few dollars?



Our nation’s elites have picked cowering over courage.
What do the Saturday crowds prove? They proved that Americans have decided en masse to solve the collective action problem posed by the Trump administration. That means that while it’s in everyone’s best interests to resist, doing so individually carries too much perceived risk. So folks worked together.
Crowd of energized Kansans carrying homemade signs and showing their refusal to be cowed by one man in the Oval Office should give us all hope. Democrats, independents and, yes, Republicans should all cheer the use of peaceful, nonviolent protest (as covered by the First Amendment of the Constitution we all revere). We don’t want the alternative.
Most of all, though, this uprising should stiffen the spine and set the jaws of those who previously feared to speak. Your fellow Americans are worth it. Responsive government is worth it. The Constitution is worth it. Free speech is worth it.
Freedom is worth it.

When presidents try to make big changes through executive orders, they often hit a roadblock: A single federal judge, whether located in Seattle or Miami or anywhere in between, can stop these policies across the entire country.
These court orders have increasingly become a political battleground, increasingly sought by both Republicans and Democrats to fight presidential policies they oppose.
This explains why the Trump administration recently asked the Supreme Court to limit judges’ power to issue what legal experts call “nationwide preliminary injunctions.” Congress also held hearings on curtailing judges’ ability to issue the injunctions.
But what exactly are these injunctions, and why do they matter to everyday Americans?
 Immediate, irreparable harm

When the government creates a policy that might violate the Constitution or federal law, affected people can sue in federal court to stop it. While these lawsuits work their way through the courts – a process that often takes years – judges can issue what are called “preliminary injunctions” to temporarily pause the policy if they determine it might cause immediate, irreparable harm.
A “nationwide” injunction – sometimes called a “universal” injunction – goes further by stopping the policy for everyone across the country, not just for the people who filed the lawsuit.
Importantly, these injunctions are designed to be temporary. They merely preserve the status quo until courts can fully examine the case’s merits. But in practice, litigation proceeds so slowly that executive actions blocked by the courts often expire when successor administrations abandon the policies.
 More executive orders, more injunctions

Nationwide injunctions aren’t new, but several things have made them more contentious recently.
First, since a closely divided and polarized Congress rarely passes major legislation anymore, presidents rely more on executive orders to get substantive things done. This creates more opportunities to challenge presidential actions in court.
Second, lawyers who want to challenge these orders have gotten better at “judge shopping” – filing cases in districts where they’re likely to get judges who agree with their client’s views.
Third, with growing political division, both parties aim to use these injunctions more aggressively whenever the other party controls the White House.
 Affecting real people

These legal fights have tangible consequences for millions of Americans.
Take DACA, the common name for the program formally called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protects about 500,000 young immigrants from deportation. For more than 10 years, these young immigrants, known as “Dreamers,” have faced constant uncertainty.
That’s because, when President Barack Obama created DACA in 2012 and sought to expand it via executive order in 2015, a Texas judge blocked the expansion with a nationwide injunction. When Trump tried to end DACA, judges in California, New York and Washington, D.C. blocked that move. The program, and the legal challenges to it, continued under President Joe Biden. Now, the second Trump administration faces continued legal challenges over the constitutionality of the DACA program.
More recently, judges have used nationwide injunctions to block several Donald Trump policies. Three different courts stopped the president’s attempt to deny citizenship to babies born to mothers who lack legal permanent residency in the United States. Judges have also temporarily blocked Trump’s efforts to ban transgender people from serving in the military and to freeze some federal funding for a variety of programs.
While much of the current debate focuses on presidential policies, nationwide injunctions have also blocked congressional legislation.
The Corporate Transparency Act, passed in 2021 and originally scheduled to go into effect in 2024, combats financial crimes by requiring businesses to disclose their true owners to the government. A Texas judge blocked this law in 2024 after gun stores challenged it.
In early 2025, the Supreme Court allowed the law to take effect, but the Trump administration announced it simply wouldn’t enforce it – showing how these legal battles can become political power struggles.
 Too much power or necessary protection?

Some critics say nationwide injunctions give too much power to a single judge. If lawyers can pick which judges hear their cases, this raises serious questions about fairness.
Supporters argue that these injunctions protect important rights. For example, without nationwide injunctions in the citizenship cases, babies born to mothers without legal permanent residency would be American citizens in some states but not others – an impossible situation.
Congress is considering legislation to limit judges’ ability to grant nationwide injunctions.
The Trump administration has also tried to make it expensive and difficult to challenge its policies in court. In March 2025, Trump ordered government lawyers to demand large cash deposits – called “security bonds” – from anyone seeking an injunction. Though these bonds are already part of existing court rules, judges usually set them at just a few hundred dollars or waive them entirely when people raise constitutional concerns.
Under the new policy, critics worry that “plaintiffs who sue the government could be forced to put up enormous sums of money in order to proceed with their cases.”
Another way to address the concerns about a single judge blocking government action would be to require a three-judge panel to hear cases involving nationwide injunctions, requiring at least two of them to agree. This is similar to how courts handled major civil rights cases in the 1950s and 1960s.
My research on this topic suggests that three judges working together would be less likely to make partisan decisions, while still being able to protect constitutional rights when necessary. Today’s technology also makes it easier for judges in different locations to work together than it was decades ago.
As the Supreme Court weighs in on this debate, the outcome will affect how presidents can implement policies and how much power individual judges have to stop them. Though it might seem like a technical legal issue, it will shape how government works for years to come – as well as the lives of those who live in the U.S.

Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
 A mixed response from states

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.










A lot of these farmers, they're living their dreams.


– Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture


“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
 Creating a new food system

In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Democrats and Republicans take on soda, but they’re using different tactics

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

(Getty Images)We “celebrated” April Fools last week, pranking, getting pranked or observing from a safe distance. I once wrote an April Fools column that ended up passed around on the floor of the Nebraska Legislature, prompted an angry call from the head of the Nebraska School Administrators Association and caused four subscribers to the Grand Island Independent to cancel their subscriptions. 
Geesh, who knew? I retired from the prankster game after that folderol.
Few, however, know that April 2, the day after our annual descent into tomfoolery is known as International Fact-Checking Day. The brainchild of the International Fact-Checking Network, which supports more than 170 fact-checking organizations, International Fact-Checking Day is held each year to remind us of the critical nature of getting the facts right, supporting honest public discourse, invalidating myths and underscoring accountability in journalism.
Libraries matter
Fact-checking has become a life preserver in today’s ocean of disinformation where we often find ourselves treading water to stay informed and afloat. In the modern maze one must navigate to find and embrace the truth, one place remains a bulwark against the propagandists: the library.
But now perhaps, librarians may be hobbled in their work. Among the president’s recent barrage of executive orders (109 as of April 1, including going after of all places, the Smithsonian) is the gutting of the small agency that supports American libraries and museums. The entire staff at the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) is on paid administrative leave, which may disproportionately affect small rural libraries and museums.
Nebraska has benefited from the IMLS. In an interview with The Conversation, Devon Akron, Director of the MSU Museum at Michigan State University said that in 2019 the IMLS awarded funds to libraries in Nebraska to support economic development in 30 rural communities. “The project created rotating “innovation studios” in local libraries and provided residents with tools, instructional materials and programming to foster entrepreneurship and creativity. The IMLS supports libraries of all types — public, academic, school and research … It is the only federal agency dedicated to sustaining the entire museum and library ecosystem in the United States.”
The American Library Association said the executive order “would decimate services such as early literacy development and reading programs, high-speed internet access, employment assistance, homework and research resources and accessible reading materials.” Its own internal research indicated that “89 percent of voters and 92 percent of parents believe local public libraries have an important role to play in communities.”
Trump administration defends cuts
The Trump administration said the cuts would “strengthen IMLS’s ability to serve the American people with integrity and purpose. President Trump was given a clear mandate by the American people, and his executive order delivers on that by reducing federal bureaucracy. This restructure is a necessary step to fulfill that order and ensure hard-earned tax dollars are not diverted to discriminatory DEI initiatives or divisive, anti-American programming in our cultural institutions.”
Mandate? At 49.81 percent of the vote? Seriously? And again with the DEI? What exactly was the “anti-Americanism” or “discrimination” or any other divisive behavior? Libraries and museums are by design filled with diversity in ideas, culture and art. They are at their best when they provide the truth, fire our imaginations, build communities and remain a repository of exploration and wonder for all ages, whether through a book, a computer screen, a class or the myriad of programs you can find.
Full disclosure: I am a lifelong fan of libraries, starting with the Carnegie Library in Grand Island where I checked out my first book as a little guy and where I loved spending time among the stacks of titles, the quiet like a friend, the musty smell of something old and important. I often spent time at the Fairfax Branch of the Los Angeles City Library during my decade in the City of Angels, browsing, reading and writing. And when I moved to Lincoln last fall, my first stop — before a new driver’s license or a utility account or a new dentist — was the library near my home for a new card.
My own biases aside, I’ve yet to see how cutting a small agency that supports libraries and museums could benefit Americans.
By the way, last Friday was National Tell a Lie Day, a fitting bookend to the week. But if you want to be sure your friend or coworker or state senator or congressman or president is telling the truth, I suppose you have a few options: Google, Facebook, TikTok, etc.
Or the one you can count on: a library.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/library-books-3.jpeg,,,2025-04-07 04:58:09.658431

Mia Love and offer their condolences to her family. 
Love is survived by an extensive family including her husband Jason, daughters Abigale and Alessa, and son Peyton, who greeted guests at the Capitol as Love lay in state.
Love’s career was marked by important firsts, including being the first Black woman elected as mayor in Utah, when she was chosen to lead Saratoga Springs, and as the first Black Utahn elected to Congress. When she took her place in the U.S. House, she was the first Black Republican congresswoman.
She died March 23 at the age of 49 after battling a rare form of brain cancer.

As they shared memories of Love on Sunday, some who came to honor her recalled her energy for her work and her commitment to Utahns.
“Mia was, I think, groundbreaking in a number of different ways. She had the energy to do the job, but she wanted to do it in a way that made a difference to people and that meant representing all the people,” said Richard Piatt, Love’s former communications director. “She would meet with anyone that wanted to meet with her, and she made friends with a lot of people. I think that that’s probably one of her biggest legacies is that she didn’t mind taking on issues that she knew mattered to Utah, and mattered for the 4th District.”
Others described Love’s knack for connecting with those she met and her dedication to service.
“If you talk to just about anybody here, they will tell you that they were best friends with Mia. She was everybody’s best friend,” said DeLaina Tonks, a longtime friend of Love. “Her dad told her ‘You must give back.’ That was his thing that he told her after coming to the states from Haiti, and she has taken that to heart. That’s what she taught her children, it’s what she taught my children, it’s what she taught all of her friends is that we’re here to make a difference, to change the world and to make the world a better place.”
Love will be remembered in funeral services Monday at 10 a.m. at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ Institute building at the University of Utah. A live stream can be viewed on YouTube.

But with the Kentucky River expected to crest at a record level of 49.5 feet following several days of unrelenting rain, her family and friends worked Sunday afternoon to move couches, tables and more from the home along Murray Street.
Just a couple houses over, the swollen river had already partially submerged the homes of people Bobbitt, 64, says she knows from growing up together. The river’s expected crest Monday morning would beat the previous record by a foot if realized, according to a projection by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
“I just hate that all these people down here — we grew up with them,” Bobbitt said. “I just pray for our community.”

The state capital of Frankfort is one of a number of communities across Kentucky grappling with a deluge of flash flooding from torrential rainfall over the past several days — more than a foot of rain in some parts of the state — that’s now caused rivers to rise leading to evacuations along the Kentucky River in Frankfort and in the Pendleton County cities of Falmouth and Butler along the Licking River. 
In Carroll County, the deputy judge-executive Sunday afternoon ordered the mandatory evacuation of some areas because of a release of water from gates on Dix Dam along the Kentucky River. Robb Adams, the mayor of the Carroll County seat of Carrollton, in a livestreamed video on Facebook said the water release was planned.
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear closed all state offices Monday given that flooding is limiting the available water supply in Frankfort, and he urged Frankfort residents to conserve water. The city utility Frankfort Plant Board in a Sunday morning Facebook post wrote electrical equipment used to pump water from the river had to be turned off due to the flooding and that the city was relying on water storage tanks.

The widespread flooding across Central and Western Kentucky has caused numerous roadway closures and has, so far, killed two people: a nine-year-old child was swept away by floodwaters in Frankfort and a Nelson County man was found submerged in his car. 
Ben Bramble, a 21-year-old lifelong resident of Frankfort, was moving furniture Sunday afternoon out of his rental duplex in the rain along East 3rd Street with the help of his family.

With the expected record river crest and floodwaters surrounding homes just a couple blocks away, he wasn’t sure what he will come back to when the river finally recedes. Bramble said flooding is a “recurring problem” for the state. But no matter how many floods you’ve experienced, there’s nothing to be done once you’ve been told to evacuate. 
“It’s going to be higher than we could ever have thought,” Bramble said. “I really just hope that we can come back to our house and have it still here.”

(Source: National Weather Service Little Rock)JONESBORO — Willadean Hergott of Jonesboro clutched a stuffed toy monkey while sitting in the Craighead County safe room in Jonesboro Friday evening and waited for the next round of storms.
“I don’t like tornadoes. I don’t like seeing what happened in Lake City,” she said, referring to a twister that smashed the western edge of the Craighead County town Wednesday evening with winds of 150 mph.
“You never know anymore where one will come up,” she said.
Hergott sat in a chair inside the shelter, which has a capacity for 600 people. She said she had the monkey for her grandchildren who would show up shortly.
At 5 p.m. Friday, there were already 60 people inside the shelter, which can withstand 250 mph winds. Storms did not reach Jonesboro until around 9 p.m. Friday. Large television screens inside the shelter showed live weather coverage from the local ABC television affiliate.
On Wednesday, more than 800 packed into the shelter. Deputies had to turn back another 200 people because it was overcrowded.
Rachael Townsend also went to the shelter Friday hours before the inclement weather hit.
She moved to Jonesboro about a week before a tornado hit the town on March 28, 2020, and is still shaken by the memory.
“I have PTSD,” Townsend said. “I have really bad storm anxiety. I can’t sleep at night anymore because of these storms.”
Townsend stayed in a friend’s storm shelter when the Lake City tornado struck. Lake City is about 15 miles east of Jonesboro. This time, she said, she sought safety early.
Storm anxieties have ramped up since early March when the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, forecast an extremely high potential for tornadoes in Arkansas on March 14. Twisters hit Cave City, Cushman and Diaz that evening, validating people’s fears. Three died in Cushman and 32 were injured in those storms, the Arkansas Public Safety Department reported.
Then, the March 28 tornado hit Bay, Lake City and Monette, injuring four people and damaging 25 structures. Another storm hammered Cross County Friday evening, and on Saturday, the National Weather Service issued tornado warnings for Craighead, Crittenden, Cross, Mississippi, Poinsett and St. Francis counties.
Torrential rains hindered cleanup efforts in the tornado-ravaged areas Saturday, but it also created record level river-flooding, adding to the mounting fears.

In Hardy, the Spring River rose to 23.5 feet by late Saturday afternoon. Flood stage there is 10 feet. Water covered a riverside park and lapped against railroad tracks that cut through the town.
“It’s the worst I’ve ever seen,” Hardy Fire Chief Joshua Moore said of the flooding. ‘”We had advanced warning this was coming since Tuesday, and we warned people that they needed to evacuate.”
Emergency officials did rescue two people trapped by high waters Saturday morning, he said. Rapids also washed out a train trestle in Mammoth Springs, he said.
“This has been a lot,” he said. “Four weeks ago, we had wildfires. Then we had the tornadoes on March 14, more wildfires and now flooding.
“As best as I can tell, people here are staying home and out of all the weather,” Moore added. “My guys are tired, but we’re not quitting.”
The White River in Newport, where the flood stage is 26 feet, is expected to crest at 33 feet Tuesday. The record stage there is 35.9 feet.
The Buffalo River in St. Joe is forecast to crest at 48 feet Sunday. Flood stage is 27 feet.
President Donald Trump issued a federal disaster declaration for much of Arkansas Saturday, releasing funds for cleanup and rebuilding. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders made the request in a 12-page letter earlier in the week, saying damage from the storms exceeded $11.6 million and estimated debris removal costs $3.7 million.
Sanders also released $250,000 from the state’s emergency fund for cleanup efforts.
In addition to the rains Saturday, the National Weather Service issued several tornado warnings in Craighead, Crittenden, Cross, Mississippi, Poinsett and St. Francis counties.  For the fourth time since the safe room first opened in the new Craighead County Courthouse Annex building in early March, people crowded into the shelter.
“There’s always a lot of hype with storms,” Craighead County Office of Emergency Management Director Anthony Coy said. “People post pictures all over Facebook and social media. There is massive community storm anxiety.”
He said storm chasers flood YouTube with videos of storms and the seeming constant live reports on local television add to the fear.
On Friday, scores of chasers swarmed into Arkansas in expectation of severe weather, increasing the already heightened fears of Arkansans.  One storm chaser, while live streaming his trip on YouTube, called out, “Here, ’nado, ’nado, ’nado,” as he drove through Newport.
“Fears and anxieties can be caused by a lot of variables,” said National Weather Service meteorologist Jeff Hood in North Little Rock. “Everybody reacts to trauma differently. They see the media pictures of all the damage from tornadoes every day lately. The media conveys how dangerous it is.”
He said it’s rare that meteorologists deal with the constant weather events like they’ve had this time.
“We were talking about that,” Hood said. “It’s been 10 or 20 years since we’ve had something like this. It’s not typical that we have something day after day after day.
“It’s unfortunate that we’re seeing all these ingredients line up like they’re doing,” he said. “Arkansas is in the wrong place at the wrong time.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
 A mixed response from states

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.
“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
 Creating a new food system

In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.

Two new eastern Washington lawmakers from opposite sides of the political aisle paused just before the Legislature turned its attention to hammering out a budget to reflect on their first term. They told Inside Olympia host Austin Jenkins that it has been a whirlwind of learning, pressure, and unexpected appreciation for the work under the Capitol dome.
Rep. Natasha Hill, D-Spokane, and Rep. Brian Burnett, R-Wenatchee, bring vastly different life experiences to Olympia, but both describe their early days in office with humility and intensity.
“It’s not like anything that I’ve ever experienced before,” Hill said. “You’re really just getting your feet wet, learning from the folks around you, and learning as you go.”
Hill, an attorney and longtime advocate for equity in eastern Washington, said entering the Legislature during a time of fiscal crisis added weight to her role. “It’s been a very ominous experience, honestly. We know things are not good,” she said. “Coming in, it didn’t feel good at all. It felt like we’re not gonna be able to get anything new done, especially as a new member.”
Despite the challenges, Hill said she’s encouraged by the opportunity to serve and emphasized the importance of public input. “I didn’t realize how important it was — people to share their stories, to sign in pro and con on bills.”
For Burnett, a former Chelan County sheriff with 23 years in law enforcement, the shift from executive leadership to being one of 98 House members was jarring but ultimately rewarding.
“The first three, four weeks was just unbelievably [like] drinking from a firehose,” he said.
Burnett, who serves on committees including Community Safety and Appropriations, said he’s found purpose and a sense of community despite a steep learning curve. “Oh my goodness, I absolutely could say that I think I really love it. I can see that I fit in here, and I think I have something to provide, both legislatively, across both aisles.”
Burnett remains humble about what lies ahead. “I feel like I’m barely scratching the surface of what I have to learn,” he said. “You eat humble pie, and you learn from other people.”
Both lawmakers said they hope to continue building relationships and delivering results as their first term unfolds.

Sponsors this weekend’s “Hands Off” rallies include dozens of advocacy organizations, including the AFL-CIO, Americans for Financial Reform, Common Cause, the Consumer Federation of America, Indivisible, and Planned Parenthood.
As with last Saturday’s protest outside a Columbus Tesla dealership, many were protesting Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, whom Trump is permitting to slash federal programs and employees. They include the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Veterans Affairs.
“Trump Musk go,” said one sign. Others said, “Hands off science and scientists,” “Get the heil out,” Tax wealth, not work,” and “This penis party must end.”
But the major theme of the protest appeared to be a desire to protect democracy itself. 
“Not a paid protester,” said one sign. “My speech is free.”
That appeared to be a rebuttal to Musk’s claim that people are only protesting because they’re being paid by some unidentified boogeyman. He made that accusation even as he was handing out millions to Wisconsin voters in an attempt to sway and election to the state Supreme Court. He ended up losing badly.
Leslie Kern of Clintonville on Saturday said she felt a duty to protest at the Ohio capitol .
“I am so frightened that we’re going to lose our democracy that I decided that I had to come,” she said. “I heard a story this morning that the people who were deported to El Salvador were all deported illegally.” 
At least one man was improperly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador after being accused without evidence of a gang affiliation, the Associated Press reported last week.
“It’s possible that a majority were not even associated with a gang. It feels to me like Berlin in 1938,” Kern said, referring to a time when thugs controlled by Adolph Hitler harassed, arrested and beat Jews and political dissidents and destroyed their property. “People are being snatched off the street by masked men and no one sees them again. A lot of people die in those prisons. And that was just this morning.”
Unlike some earlier protests, a healthy portion of the crowd Saturday appeared to be under 40.
Lilly Karhoff, a 17-year-old student at Hillyard Bradley High School, said she was protesting with an eye toward the future.

“This is the country we’re going to be living in,” she said. “Everybody needs to be aware of what’s going on. We need to preserve our democracy and our rights. It’s our democracy and the rights of everyone. Not just women. Not just children.”
She added, “I have many immigrant friends. Many Arab friends. Many Hispanic friends. This affects them and we talk about it.” 
But Kerhoff said administrators at her school won’t allow those concerns to be a topic of classroom discussion.
“There’s a lot of concern among our peers,” she said. “But unfortunately, our teachers have been instructed not to talk about the political climate, so we’re in a very limited environment. So I think it’s important to get out here and spread my voice.”
Kyra Milton, 21, of Columbus said her “whole objective is to stand against what’s happening to America, to our democracy. I’m just fed up with the way things are going and I’m not going to stand for it. I feel like our democracy is being attacked. Our rights. Our freedom of speech. Everything that humanity stands for is being attacked by the current administration.”
Despite all that, Milton said she’s optimistic.
“I feel like if we keep standing up like this, saying we know our rights and stand against them being attacked, we’ll have a better future,” she said.
Kurt Bateman, a member of the United Auto Workers, retired after 30 years of making parts for General Motors on the site where the Hollywood Casino now sits on Columbus’s West side. 
“They traded in middle-class-wage jobs for tip-wage jobs,” he said.
Among the issues Bateman was protesting were Trump’s attacks on organized labor. He added that the massive tariffs Trump implemented last week won’t achieve their stated goal of bringing back American manufacturing.
“We lost that battle in the 80s,” Bateman said. “They said, ‘We don’t care about making anything here. We’re going to financialize the economy.'”
Steven Stone traveled from Nelsonville to protest. Having served in the Army from 1969 to 1974, Stone said of Trump, “He’s not my commander-in-chief.”
“I’m here because the guy that’s supposedly our commander-in-chief called soldiers who died in combat ‘suckers and losers,'” Stone said. “He dishonored me and everybody who served in the military.”
Kern, of Clintonville, said she believed that protests such as the one on Saturday are one of the last tools for preserving American democracy.
“This and some courts are the last bastions standing against fascism,” she said. “Congress has fallen. Every institution of government that I thought would stand has fallen. So I feel like the people are the last bastion against fascism, and that’s the one voice that I hope still counts for something.”

That [&#8230;],"The sun sets on the LaCreek National Wildlife Refuge near Martin, South Dakota, in April 2021. (John Deuter/USDA NRCS South Dakota, public license)Hundreds of thousands of acres of wetlands in northeastern South Dakota are likely to lose federal protection under the Trump administration’s proposed narrow interpretation of what water is important to preserve.
The proposed restrictive definition says a wetland deserves protection only if it has a continuous surface connection to a navigable stream or lake.
That leaves almost all of South Dakota’s 1.7 million acres of wetlands, which are home to about half of all threatened and endangered species, at the mercy of land developers and agricultural interests. 
A new report by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) shows the catastrophic loss of federal protections for wetlands across the United States. 
‘Wild places are worth fighting for’: Concern grows for receding South Dakota wetlands

Using Geographic Information System (GIS) modeling,  the model can zero in on specific counties. It shows that more than 70 million acres of wetlands — approximately 84% of the total area protected before the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 Sackett v. EPA decision — are left without federal safeguards. 
It also shows that nonperennial streams, which make up the vast majority of U.S. waterways and are essential for drinking water and flood mitigation, are also at risk. If only perennial streams remain protected, more than 8 million miles of U.S. streams could lose Clean Water Act protections.
Under the Trump administration’s definition, about 460,000 individual wetlands covering about 743,000 acres in northeastern South Dakota’s 10 most affected counties would be at risk. 
The most impacted counties in order are Brown, Beadle, Hand, Spink, Faulk, Edmunds, Roberts, McPherson, Sanborn and Hyde.
An additional threat is emerging in a lawsuit in Iowa that seeks to overturn the federal Swampbuster and Sodbuster provisions that tie wetland preservation to farm safety-net programs. Arguments were heard Monday in Cedar Rapids.   
At the federal level, organizations and individuals will have opportunities this month to voice their support for wetlands. The EPA has offered a general 30-day public comment period and a series of listening sessions.  
Schedules for states, tribes, industry and agricultural stakeholders and environmental and conservation stakeholders have been set from April 29 to May 1, but a listening session for the general public has not been announced. 
The odds of convincing the Trump administration to broaden its protection appear daunting.
In the Sackett decision, the court ruled that wetlands are protected by the Clean Water Act only when they have a “continuous surface connection” to other covered waters. It also held that other waters, like streams, are only protected if they are “relatively permanent.”
The Biden administration liberally interpreted what constituted a connection, but Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers are taking a strict approach, excluding most of what we think of as a wetland or marsh or protected streams. 
“Our analysis confirms that the Supreme Court has gutted the Clean Water Act’s ability to protect our wetlands, exposing communities to increased flooding, worsening water pollution, and threatening habitats that sustain wildlife and local economies,” said Jon Devine, freshwater ecosystems director at NRDC. 
In South Dakota, potentially “93 percent of wetland area and 99 percent of individual wetlands are predicted to lack protection,” the NRDC analysis said.
The National Wildlife Federation, which is the nation’s largest hunting and fishing conservation organization, is also voicing opposition.  
“This will be the fourth rule attempting to define the Waters of the United States in a decade. We need to stop playing political ping pong with this vital issue,” said Jim Murphy, the federation’s director of legal advocacy. “With the likelihood of a skeletal workforce at EPA, this move will put even more pressure and expense on states and localities to ensure our water is safe.”
For South Dakota, which does not have a state wetland program plan or a wetland monitoring plan, a resource so important to the state’s $1.4 billion annual fishing and hunting economy and quality of life appears as threatened as the species that depend on their life-giving waters.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)More than 4,500 gathered in Raleigh’s Bicentennial Plaza on Saturday to protest the Trump administration, calling for an end to cuts to health care and welfare programs as well as the removal of massive tariffs that have caused the stock market to tumble.
The demonstration, organized by a wide swath of activist groups including the 50501 Movement, Bishop William Barber II’s Poor People’s Campaign, and the Union of Southern Service Workers, was part of a national day of protest that saw thousands gather in state capitals and major cities around the country. Protesters demanded the Trump administration take its “hands off” core social services such as Medicaid and Social Security as well as scientific research and international aid programs.
Speakers included veterans and union workers and brought together both longtime local advocates, like Rev. Rob Stephens of the Poor People’s Campaign, as well as those who only recently became engaged in politics, like high school junior Michael Turner, who came to the demonstration from Rocky Mount.
“They don’t care about the values that built this country, they don’t care about us,” Turner said of the administration, garnering cheers.  “We deserve leaders who fight for all people, not just the rich.”
“A couple of months ago, I didn’t even really want to be involved in politics,” said Aden Kalinowsky, whose sister depends on Medicaid for treatment of a rare genetic condition. “I don’t think it’s fair that they’re trying to take our Social Security from us. I don’t think it’s fair that they’re trying to take away our Medicaid from us.”
Eshawney Gaston, a food service worker in Durham with the Union of Southern Service Workers, demanded the administration take its “hands off my Medicaid.” She said her daughter requires specialized medical care and physical therapy because of her sickle cell anemia, health care Gaston would not be able to afford without help from Medicaid.
“We all have to stand up and fight together because health care is a human right,” Gaston said. “People don’t use Medicaid because they want to, I use it because I have to, because I can’t afford to do it on my own, because if I could, I would.”
While most of the discussion centered on national politics, North Carolina officials took heat from protesters as well, particularly Judge Jefferson Griffin, who has contested the state Supreme Court race for months via a bid to dispose of tens of thousands of ballots that on Friday received an affirmative ruling in the state appeals court.
“You need to know the names Phil Berger, Destin Hall — those are our leaders in the General Assembly who have been selling us out and have had the most corrupt government. The White House is taking all their cues from here,” Stephens said. “Yesterday, we know for sure that we don’t have a strong democracy, because Jefferson Davis — I mean, Jefferson Griffin — [is] trying to control who votes, who matters, and who has power in this democracy.”
Among the signs at the protest was a poster with the face of Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) captioned, “Where are you Thom? Do your job!” Another advised attendees to “Check the Griffin List,” the list of voters whose ballots are included in the challenge to the state Supreme Court race.






The demonstration doubled as a food drive, with John Freeman, a frequent organizer of Raleigh’s 50501 demonstrations, sharing the fact that organizers had raised roughly $4,000 for the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina. He said his group, the Iron Front of North Carolina, would also be distributing many canned goods and other food items collected at the April 5 demonstration.
Charlotte Ellis, a painter and former educator living in Louisburg, said she was motivated to participate in the protest by the administration’s cuts to schools. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the closure of the Department of Education, a move that has since been challenged in federal court.
“I want the schools to continue being funded and the teachers work really hard, and they’re trying really hard to do a good job, and they don’t need their funding cut, they need to keep their funding,” Ellis said. “All young children need to be trained to their full potential.”
Megan Bell, a participant in the national Women’s Marches under the first Trump administration, said she was “impressed and energized” by the crowd in Raleigh. “We don’t have much power right now, but we do still have our voices, and while we do still have them, it’s important that we use them,” she said.
Massage therapist Marvin Chambers said he decided to attend after seeing a flyer on a lamp post yesterday, joining demonstrations both in Durham and Raleigh Saturday. He said that while he was pleased with the turnout for the protests, he hopes people will “put their dollars where their voices are.”
Robert Shaughnessy, a machinist, condemned the “blatant disregard for due process of law, the Constitution, [and] the process of making, interpreting, and enforcing laws” by the Trump administration. He said it was “heartening” to see so many voice similar concerns at the Raleigh protest.
“There is no question whatsoever that the current administration has no compunctions about just bringing down steel on people who are law-abiding citizens,” he said. “Whether we like it or not, you have to meet steel with steel.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4051315-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-06 09:01:56.754062

In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing federal grants and loans, alarming HBCUs, where most students rely on Pell Grants or federal aid. The order was later rescinded, but ongoing cuts leave key support systems in political limbo, said Denise Smith, deputy director of higher education policy and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.
Leaders worry about Trump’s rollback of the Justice40 Initiative, a climate change program that relied on HBCUs to tackle environmental justice issues, she said. And there’s uncertainty around programs such as federal work-study and TRIO, which provides college access services to disadvantaged students.

“People are being mum because we’re starting to see a chilling effect,” Smith said. “There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.”
Most students at HBCUs rely on Pell Grants or other federal aid, and a fifth of Black college graduates matriculate from HBCUs. Other minority-serving institutions, known as MSIs, that focus on Hispanic and American Indian populations also heavily depend on federal aid.
“It’s still unclear what these cuts will mean for HBCUs and MSIs, even though they’re supposedly protected,” Smith said.
States may be unlikely to make up any potential federal funding cuts to their public HBCUs. And the schools already have been underfunded by states compared with predominantly white schools.










There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.

Congress created public, land-grant universities under the Morrill Act of 1862 to serve the country’s agricultural and industrial industries, providing 10 million acres taken from tribes and offering it for public universities such as Auburn and the University of Georgia. But Black students were excluded.
The 1890 Morrill Act required states to either integrate or establish separate land-grant institutions for Black students — leading to the creation of many HBCUs. These schools have since faced chronic underfunding compared with their majority-white counterparts.

‘None of them are equitable’

In 2020, the average endowment of white land-grant universities was $1.9 billion, compared with just $34 million for HBCUs, according to Forbes.
There are other HBCUs that don’t stem from the 1890 law, including well-known private schools such as Fisk University, Howard University, Morehouse College and Spelman College. But more than three-fourths of HBCU students attend public universities, meaning state lawmakers play a significant role in their funding and oversight.
Marybeth Gasman, an endowed chair in education and a distinguished professor at Rutgers University, isn’t impressed by what states have done for HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions so far. She said she isn’t sure there is a state model that can bridge the massive funding inequities for these institutions, even in states better known for their support.
“I don’t think North Carolina or Maryland have done a particularly good job at the state level. Nor have any of the other states. Students at HBCUs are funded at roughly 50-60% of what students at [predominately white institutions] are funded. That’s not right,” said Gasman.
“Most of the bipartisan support has come from the U.S. Congress and is the result of important work by HBCUs and affiliated organizations. I don’t know of a state model that works well, as none of them are equitable.”

Under federal law, states that accept federal land-grant funding are required to match every dollar with state funds.
But in 2023, the Biden administration sent letters to 16 governors warning them that their public Black land-grant institutions had been underfunded by more than $12 billion over three decades.
Tennessee State University alone had a $2.1 billion gap with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
At a February meeting hosted by the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, Tennessee State interim President Dwayne Tucker said the school is focused on asking lawmakers this year for money to keep the school running.
Otherwise, Tucker said at the time, the institution could run out of cash around April or May.
“That’s real money. That’s the money we should work on,” Tucker said, according to a video of the forum.
In some states, lawsuits to recoup long-standing underfunding have been one course of action.
In Maryland, a landmark $577 million legal settlement was reached in 2021 to address decades of underfunding at four public HBCUs.
In Georgia, three HBCU students sued the state in 2023 for underfunding of three HBCUs.
In Tennessee, a recent state report found Tennessee State University has been shortchanged roughly $150 million to $544 million over the past 100 years.
But Tucker said he thinks filing a lawsuit doesn’t make much sense for Tennessee State.
“There’s no account payable set up with the state of Tennessee to pay us $2.1 billion,” Tucker said at the February forum. “And if we want to make a conclusion about whether [that money] is real or not … you’re going to have to sue the state of Tennessee, and I don’t think that makes a whole lot of sense.”

Economic anchors

There are 102 HBCUs across 19 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands, though a large number of HBCUs are concentrated in the South.
Alabama has the most, with 14, and Pennsylvania has the farthest north HBCU.

Beyond education, HBCUs contribute roughly $15 billion annually to their local economies, generate more than 134,000 jobs and create $46.8 billion in career earnings, proving themselves to be economic anchors in under-resourced regions.
Homecoming events at HBCUs significantly bolster local economies, local studies show. North Carolina Central University’s homecoming contributes approximately $2.5 million to Durham’s economy annually.
Similarly, Hampton University’s 2024 homecoming was projected to inject around $3 million into the City of Hampton and the coastal Virginia region, spurred by increased visitor spending and retail sales. In Tallahassee, Florida A&M University’s 2024 homecoming week in October generated about $5.1 million from Sunday to Thursday.
Their significance is especially pronounced in Southern states — such as North Carolina, where HBCUs account for just 16% of four-year schools but serve 45% of the state’s Black undergraduate population.
Smith has been encouraged by what she’s seen in states such as Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee, which have a combined 20 HBCUs among them. Lawmakers have taken piecemeal steps to expand support for HBCUs through policy and funding, she noted.
Tennessee became the first state in 2018 to appoint a full-time statewide higher education official dedicated to HBCU success for institutions such as Fisk and Tennessee State. Meanwhile, North Carolina launched a bipartisan, bicameral HBCU Caucus in 2023 to advocate for its 10 HBCUs, known as the NC10, and spotlight their $1.7 billion annual economic impact.
“We created a bipartisan HBCU caucus because we needed people in both parties to understand these institutions’ importance. If you represent a district with an HBCU, you should be connected to it,” said North Carolina Democratic Sen. Gladys Robinson, an alum of private HBCU Bennett College and state HBCU North Carolina A&T State University.
“It took constant education — getting folks to come and see, talk about what was going on,” she recalled. “It’s like beating the drum constantly until you finally hear the beat.”

For Robinson, advocacy for HBCUs can be a tough task, especially when fellow lawmakers aren’t aware of the stories of these institutions. North Carolina A&T was among the 1890 land-grant universities historically undermatched in federal agricultural and extension funding.
The NC Promise Tuition Plan, launched in 2018, reduced in-state tuition to $500 per semester and out-of-state tuition to $2,500 per semester at a handful of schools that now include HBCUs Elizabeth City State University and Fayetteville State University; Western Carolina University, a Hispanic-serving institution; and UNC at Pembroke, founded in 1887 to serve American Indians.
Through conversations on the floor of the General Assembly, and with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, Robinson advocated to ensure Elizabeth City State — a struggling HBCU — was included, which helped revive enrollment and public investment.
“I’m hopeful because we’ve been here before,” Robinson said in an interview.
“These institutions were built out of churches and land by people who had nothing, just so we could be educated,” Robinson said. “We have people in powerful positions across the country. We have to use our strength and our voices. Alumni must step up.
“It’s tough, but not undoable.”
Meanwhile, other states are working to recognize certain colleges that offer significant support to Black college students. California last year passed a law creating a Black-serving Institution designation, the first such title in the country. Schools must have programs focused on Black achievement, retention and graduation rates, along with a five-year plan to improve them. Sacramento State is among the first receiving the designation.
And this session, California state Assemblymember Mike Gipson, a Democrat, introduced legislation that proposes a $75 million grant program to support Black and underserved students over five years through the Designation of California Black-Serving Institutions Grant Program. The bill was most recently referred to the Assembly’s appropriations committee.

(Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.

Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
 A mixed response from states

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.










A lot of these farmers, they're living their dreams. 


– Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture


“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
 Creating a new food system

In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Democrats and Republicans take on soda, but they’re using different tactics

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

Mark Amodei.
Politico reported Friday that Amodei’s fellow House Republican, Don Bacon of Nebraska, plans to introduce a House version of a bipartisan-backed Senate bill empowering Congress to cancel tariffs ordered by a president.
The Senate version of the bill was announced Thursday by Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley and Washington Democrat Maria Cantwell, and four more Senate Republicans have signed on as co-sponsors so far.
Congress reining in Trump on tariffs (and, for a change, protecting and preserving the legislative branch’s role in the U.S. government) is a tremendously tall order. Even if Congress passed it, Trump would veto it, and then a whole lot more Republicans would have to find the spine to stand up to Trump and help form the two-thirds majorities in both houses needed to override a veto.
Yes, that many Republicans defying Trump seems unthinkable.
But then, just less than a week ago, the notion that the stock market would see one of its worst weeks ever just because of the crackpot obsessions of one 78-year-old man seemed unthinkable too.
When the markets plummeted upon opening Thursday, Bacon was already reportedly mulling some sort of House action to rein in Trump on tariffs. I emailed Amodei’s office asking if he had been in conversations with other House members about taking action to reassert congressional authority over tariff policy and whether Amodei agreed (as Bacon had put it) that “Congress should take back its tariff authorities.”

In a statement provided by his office Friday, Amodei ignored the question. Instead, he tossed around some Trump talking points and brushed off “Wall Street wigging out.”
“We’ll be closely monitoring key indicators of economic stability,” Amodei added, “such as job reports, inflation, and consumer spending, but nobody said this was going to be instant gratification, and as the President said, ‘We’re dealing with a very sick patient.’ Under Biden, we saw the largest trade deficit in U.S. history, and the status quo is simply not sustainable. We need significant changes to steer our country toward self-reliance.”
A couple things:
First, really, Amodei? “Nobody said this was going to be instant gratification”? Fine, let’s give Amodei the benefit of the doubt and assume he was talking about “instant gratification” as a result of Trump’s tariffs. But let’s also not forget that while campaigning Trump promised that “Starting on Day 1, we will end inflation and make America affordable again,” as well as “Prices will come down. You just watch: They’ll come down, and they’ll come down fast.” Trump has been promising nothing but instant economic gratification for the last, oh, three years. And so far he’s delivered exactly the opposite of that.
Second, when Amodei says 2024’s trade deficit is the largest ever, he’s presumably referring to a dollar amount, which is the dumbed-down way of looking at it. Each and every year countless measurements are the largest in history, like the world’s population, for instance, or, say, the sum total of inane hyperbole spewed by Republican members of Congress. Rather than a dollar amount, a far more concrete and informative assessment of the trade deficit is determined by measuring it as a percentage of GDP. In 2024 the trade deficit was 3.1% of GDP, while in 2006 it was more than 5%. But thanks for bringing it up, congressman.
Meanwhile, to reiterate, Amodei failed to answer the question he was asked, which essentially boils down to whether he too, like at least a half dozen of his fellow Republicans in Congress (Bacon and five senators), is ready to take the U.S. Constitution seriously and reestablish the legislative branch of the United States government as, you know, a going concern.
Courts are slow, and the Supreme Court is stuffed with Trumpers. Congressional Democrats are sidelined (and many of them, including Nevada ones, have demonstrated a willingness to pretend everything will be fine).  And Republicans have majorities in Congress, though to clarify, they don’t really control it; they’ve surrendered their control to Trump.
But assuming Trump can be reined in, a number of congressional Republicans are going to have to participate in the reining.
Some of the damage Trump has already inflicted on the economy, the rule of law, national security, international cooperation, science, human rights, the First Amendment, the system of checks and balances that underly the Constitution, democracy, and the practical workings of the federal government is so severe that fixing what he has broken will take years, assuming it’s fixable.
It’s tempting to write off Amodei, in the expectation that he’ll just continue to pretend this is all normal while supplying rote apologies for Trump laced with aw shucks quips and mealy-mouthed let’s-wait-and-sees.
But over the years Amodei has demonstrated on occasion there might be more to him than that. Since he’s the state’s only Republican in Congress, Nevada better hope there is.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Attorney General Dana Nessel warned thousands of protesters gathered on the lawn of the Michigan Capitol Saturday that President Donald Trump could pose the type of domestic threat warned about in the oath of office administered to elected officials and service members in the United States, predicting that he would order military action against dissidents.
Nessel was speaking during a “Hands Off!” protest organized by the 50501 Movement and various statewide groups, including civil rights organizations, labor unions, LGBTQ+ advocates, veterans, and fair-elections activists. ​It was one of 55 rallies planned to take place in Michigan at the same time as more than 1,000 protests nationwide. Rallies in Michigan were also organized in cities including Detroit, Grand Rapids, Traverse City and Marquette.
Nessel offered a stark warning to the protesters, predicting that Trump would order the U.S. military to target citizens who speak out against the administration.
“We will not capitulate. We will not act as appeasers. We will not bow down,” Nessel said. “And when Trump invariably invokes the Insurrection Act and commands the National Guard and the military to train their weapons upon us, we will let them know that when they took an oath to defend the United States against enemies, both foreign and domestic, that means Donald Trump and his accomplices, not all of us.”

The Democratic attorney general said that the United States is already “in the midst of a constitutional crisis” as Trump “has been thumbing his nose at the courts, disparaging judges and their rulings and completely violating court orders.”

“Trump and his lawless, corrupt and chaotic administration can ignore court orders, but they cannot ignore all of us,” Nessel said. “This is our state, our country, our democracy, and we will not relinquish it to a wannabe dictator, tyrant king.”
Nessel said she began suing the Trump administration on his second day back in office, and vowed to continue suing him “each and every damn time he violates the law and injures our state.”

“Donald Trump seems to believe that he has a mandate to cripple our nation, violate the law and throw out the Constitution, because he won this state by 80,000 votes,” Nessel said. “I want to say that I won this state by 370,000 votes, and unlike Donald Trump, when I swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, I actually read it, and I definitely meant it.”
Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie, who is running for secretary of state as a Democrat, pointed to Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election as an example of the threat he poses, noting that Trump has been talking about seeking a third term—which he has no constitutional power to do.

“There is nothing that will stop Donald Trump from trying to destroy this country for his own personal gain, and he’s at it again,” Edevbie said.
“We’re going to either stand up and fight, or we’re going to let Trump become a dictator and a king.”
Edevbie noted that Michigan voters have approved numerous changes to the state’s election laws in recent elections, with ballot proposals passing by wide margins of support.
“When we rise above the lies, when we rise above the bulls—t, when we rise above misinformation, we win,” Edevbie said.
The rallies taking place throughout the country Saturday were meant to oppose Trump and Elon Musk’s sweeping changes to the federal government, which include “everything they can get their hands on,” according to a statement from organizers.
Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, who announced a campaign for governor last month, said that while there are areas where government can be more efficient, the Trump administration does not have the mindset to propose real solutions.
“I’m tired of people who claim they serve but only serve themselves,” Gilchrist said. “I’m tired of an administration that wakes up and, before they eat breakfast, they figure out who they can fire, they figure out whose healthcare they can strip, they figure out what veteran can’t get their benefits, and they figure out who doesn’t get their Social Security.”

Former U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow said that the Trump administration is “embracing an agenda of revenge, racism, power and greed.”
Gilchrist estimated that there were more than 7,000 people in attendance at the rally, making it one of the largest since Trump took office in January.
Former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed, who resigned from his position earlier this week to explore a possible campaign for Michigan’s open U.S. Senate seat, called back to his standard stump speech when he was a candidate in the Democratic primary for governor in 2018.
“I ran on this idea that Donald Trump wasn’t himself the disease, he was the worst symptom of the disease. And unless we were willing to take on the symptom and the disease, that that symptom would come back,” El-Sayed said. “And I hate to say it, we did do something about the symptom, but guess what? Disease came roaring back. And that’s what we’re living through right now.”
El-Sayed said his parents immigrated to the U.S. from Egypt, adding, “I love immigrants. But there’s just this one that I got some issues with,” referring to Musk.
“That boy came over here, he took billions of dollars of our government money to support companies that he didn’t even start, and now he wants to kill government for the rest of us,” El-Sayed said.
“You know how many times I’ve been told to go back to my country? I was born and raised here. Elon can go on and go back to his country.”
Detroit marchers; ‘This is what democracy looks like’

Meanwhile, more than 2,000 people gathered in Midtown Detroit on Saturday for a protest organized by the Hands Off! Detroit Fights Back coalition. The marchers chanted “Show me what democracy looks like. This is what democracy looks like” as they started at the Detroit Institute of Arts and ended near Little Caesars Arena, walking a three-mile route through the city.
The group criticized President Donald Trump, as well as billionaire and head of the Department of Government Efficiency Elon Musk, accusing them of harming public services, workers’ rights, and data privacy.
“Donald Trump and Elon Musk think this country belongs to them. Detroit is fighting back!” the coalition said in a press release. “They’re taking everything they can get their hands on… and daring the world to stop them.”
Organizers said the protest was part of a larger movement to resist policies they see as a threat to democracy and working-class communities.

Critics want lawmakers to ban the burgeoning online business they consider a racket, arguing that it undermines the fine-dining experience and could potentially leave restaurants with empty tables. However, proponents of the practice say it benefits both diners and restaurants when done properly. 
Some iconic restaurants topped the list during a recent scan of the New Orleans section of Appointment Trader, one of several platforms designed to let people with scheduling conflicts sell highly coveted reservations on the open market. A Saturday night reservation at Brennan’s later this month is available for a suggested bid of $235 — a discount compared to the whopping $2,138 someone paid for a four-top at Antoine’s during the Super Bowl weekend. 
Are those prices based on genuine demand for seating at the restaurants, or is it artificially inflated by technology built to cash in on wealthy tourists desperate to dine in the city’s elite culinary corners?
That’s a question Louisiana lawmakers will try to answer in the coming months as they consider House Bill 90, sponsored by Rep. Troy Hebert, R-Lafayette. The legislation could ban companies such as Appointment Trader, Dorsia and Wuw Wuw from operating in Louisiana.

Specifically, Hebert’s bill prohibits third-party companies from offering or arranging reservations at any restaurants that have not agreed to the service through a contract. 
Hebert could not be reached for comment, but the Louisiana Restaurant Association, a trade group that asked Hebert to file the legislation, said it is modeled after similar laws recently enacted in other states such as New York. They all describe the legislation as a measure to prevent “restaurant reservation fraud.” 
Appointment Trader, founded in 2021, lets users buy and sell reservations and appointments of all kinds through auction-style bidding. Sellers can set their own asking prices, and bidders can make offers at any rate. Additionally, prospective buyers can use the platform as a concierge service, offering a fee to any user who can secure them a reservation at a particular establishment. 
In its early days, the platform was limited mostly to hotspots such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Las Vegas. It has since gained popularity and expanded into smaller markets including New Orleans and virtually anywhere else one has a reservation they want to sell. As of Thursday, the platform had clocked over $6 million in trades within the last 12 months. 
In a phone interview, Louisiana Restaurant Association spokeswoman Wendy Waren said platforms like Appointment Trader are selling reservations without the restaurants’ permission or knowledge. If no one buys the reservations, tables just sit empty, which can cause seating delays or prevent genuine customers from getting a reservation and actually bringing business to the restaurant, she said. 
“It creates artificial scarcity,” Waren said. “It’s like somebody’s hijacking the process.”
‘Our backs are really against the wall’: New Orleans restaurants brace for new tariffs

New York hospitality trade groups have accused the platforms of using software bots to snap up reservations and sell them on what they call a “black market.” 
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey said he is just trying to solve a problem with a legitimate service that can benefit all parties, particularly the restaurants. The 37-year-old software engineer is a German immigrant who came to the U.S. five years ago and came up with the idea for his platform while waiting in a long line at his local motor vehicles office in Las Vegas. He now lives in Miami with his wife and is serious about maintaining legitimacy on his platform, he said.  
“I’ve basically lived in a computer all my life, and nothing gives me more joy — well almost nothing — than when thousands of people use the software I built to solve a problem in their life,” Frey said. 
In phone interviews this week, Frey explained how users on his platform must sell at least half of the reservations that they post or risk account suspension. This prevents people from trying to book all the available tables and hoard them to create artificial demand. Also, the free-market style platform means that unsold reservations put downward pressure on the prices in a given area, he said.
The app is still quite new in the New Orleans market as there have only been a handful of transactions, so the current 90-day average bid prices have been skewed by reservations sold during special events such as the Super Bowl. Frey said those “one-offs” are not the norm.

In a market such as New Orleans, diners can typically get reservations without paying if it’s a normal weekend, but it can be next-to-impossible at certain restaurants in other cities. Reservation trading lets people sell valuable bookings that they, for whatever reason, can’t use or no longer want, 
When someone has a coveted reservation but a scheduling conflict prevents them from using it, they might not bother calling to cancel, leading to what restaurants call “no-show reservations.” 
Just a few no-shows can disrupt a restaurant’s operations and cost it thousands in lost sales. Approximately 28% of American diners have admitted to ghosting on their reservations, according to a 2021 OpenTable survey. 
“Wouldn’t it be better for everyone if you could just resell it?” Frey asked.
Lisa Blount, director of marketing for Antoine’s, said she’s all in favor of entrepreneurs figuring out new ways to make money in the restaurant industry. She’s less worried about no-shows because Antoine’s requires credit cards to make reservations, but she does have a few other concerns.
At Antoine’s and other fine dining eateries, the staff take a lot of time to learn about their customers when they make a reservation, Blount said. They might be on a tight schedule, have diet restrictions or could be visiting for a special occasion. This kind of information allows the restaurant to make preparations with food ordering, shift scheduling and other arrangements.
“There’s a lot more to coming to our restaurant than just buying a ticket,” Blount said. “We try to know a lot about you before you even get in the door.” 
Blount said she worries that trading or selling reservations to unknown customers could stymie a restaurant’s ability to offer its best level of service. She also said she hates the idea of an unwitting customer paying for a reservation and then showing up and seeing empty tables because it turned out to be a slow evening. The customer would feel scammed, and it could damage the restaurant’s reputation, she said. 
Still, Blount said she’s open to the concept of reservation trading if there are ways to control for those kinds of issues.
Frey said he is actively trying to partner with restaurants to make the app better for all parties. His platform currently takes a 30% cut of each transaction, and he offers partner restaurants an equal share of the net proceeds. So far, Frey said he has not landed any partnership agreements as he tries to keep his company alive through an onslaught of state legislation. 
Seafood testers find Shreveport restaurants deceiving customers with foreign shrimp

Bans on reservation trading apps are already in place in New York and Arizona, and a similar bill is currently pending in the Illinois legislature.
Some large corporations could lose a chunk of their business if reservation trading catches on. Restaurant booking platforms such as OpenTable and Resy are free for customers to use. They make money by charging restaurants a fee for every reservation made through their app. 
Platforms like Appointment Trader threaten to disrupt the online booking sector by flipping that business model on its head. Under Frey’s partnership model, restaurants would get paid just to let customers inside. 
But all that depends on genuine demand existing in a particular market area. 
“There’s so many restaurants here,” Blount said from her New Orleans office. “We’re not New York.”

“It creates artificial scarcity,” Waren said. “It’s like somebody’s hijacking the process.”
‘Our backs are really against the wall’: New Orleans restaurants brace for new tariffs

New York hospitality trade groups have accused the platforms of using software bots to snap up reservations and sell them on what they call a “black market.” 
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey said he is just trying to solve a problem with a legitimate service that can benefit all parties, particularly the restaurants. The 37-year-old software engineer is a German immigrant who came to the U.S. five years ago and came up with the idea for his platform while waiting in a long line at his local motor vehicles office in Las Vegas. He now lives in Miami with his wife and is serious about maintaining legitimacy on his platform, he said.  
“I’ve basically lived in a computer all my life, and nothing gives me more joy — well almost nothing — than when thousands of people use the software I built to solve a problem in their life,” Frey said. 
In phone interviews this week, Frey explained how users on his platform must sell at least half of the reservations that they post or risk account suspension. This prevents people from trying to book all the available tables and hoard them to create artificial demand. Also, the free-market style platform means that unsold reservations put downward pressure on the prices in a given area, he said.
The app is still quite new in the New Orleans market as there have only been a handful of transactions, so the current 90-day average bid prices have been skewed by reservations sold during special events such as the Super Bowl. Frey said those “one-offs” are not the norm. 
In a market such as New Orleans, diners can typically get reservations without paying if it’s a normal weekend, but it can be next-to-impossible at certain restaurants in other big cities across the country. Reservation trading lets people sell valuable bookings that they, for whatever reason, can’t use or no longer want. 
When someone has a coveted reservation but encounters a scheduling conflict that prevents them from using it, they might not bother calling to cancel, leading to what restaurants call “no-show reservations.”

Just a few no-shows can disrupt a restaurant’s operations and cost it thousands in lost sales. Approximately 28% of American diners have admitted to ghosting on their reservations, according to a 2021 OpenTable survey.
“Wouldn’t it be better for everyone if you could just resell it?” Frey asked.
Lisa Blount, director of marketing for Antoine’s, said she’s all in favor of entrepreneurs figuring out new ways to make money in the restaurant industry. She’s less worried about no-shows because Antoine’s requires credit cards to make reservations, but she does have a few other concerns.
At Antoine’s and other fine dining eateries, the staff take a lot of time to learn about their customers when they make a reservation, Blount said. They might be on a tight schedule, have diet restrictions or could be visiting for a special occasion. This kind of information allows the restaurant to make preparations with food ordering, shift scheduling and other arrangements.
“There’s a lot more to coming to our restaurant than just buying a ticket,” Blount said. “We try to know a lot about you before you even get in the door.” 
Blount said she worries that trading or selling reservations to unknown customers could stymie a restaurant’s ability to offer its best level of service. She also said she hates the idea of an unwitting customer paying for a reservation and then showing up and seeing empty tables because it turned out to be a slow evening. The customer would feel scammed, and it could damage the restaurant’s reputation, she said. 
Still, Blount said she’s open to the concept of reservation trading if there are ways to control for those kinds of issues.
Frey said he is actively trying to partner with restaurants to make the app better for all parties. His platform currently takes a 30% cut of each transaction, and he offers partner restaurants an equal share of the net proceeds. So far, Frey said he has not landed any partnership agreements as he tries to keep his company alive through an onslaught of state legislation. 
Seafood testers find Shreveport restaurants deceiving customers with foreign shrimp

Bans on reservation trading apps are already in place in New York and Arizona, and a similar bill is currently pending in the Illinois legislature.
Some large corporations could lose a chunk of their business if reservation trading catches on. Restaurant booking platforms such as OpenTable and Resy make money by charging restaurants a fee for every reservation customers make through their app. 
Platforms like Appointment Trader threaten to disrupt the online booking sector by flipping that business model on its head. Under Frey’s partnership model, restaurants would get paid just to let customers inside. 
But all that depends on genuine demand existing in a particular market area. 
“There’s so many restaurants here,” Blount said from her New Orleans office. “We’re not New York.”

(Safura Syed/Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – Hundreds of people gathered in Lafayette Square for a rally against the Trump administration Saturday afternoon. The protest was a part of a national mass mobilization effort, Hands Off, which advocates against cuts to government services like Social Security and loss of protections for marginalized groups.
The first three months of President Donald Trump’s administration have been marked by uncertainty as the president and Elon Musk cut funding to various government agencies and laid off hundreds of workers. Around 20% of revenue in the New Orleans city budget for 2025 comes from federal funds. Statewide, the reliance on federal dollars is even larger, making up around 50% of the budget. Cuts have already put funds for HIV treatment and environmental projects in jeopardy.
Civic leaders including New Orleans City Council members JP Morrell and Helena Moreno spoke at the rally. Morrell compared the current state of the federal government to the Civil Rights era, citing the surveillance of activists.
“We are going to organize at our kitchen tables, at our bars, our restaurants, in the parks, like our forefathers did,” Morrell said during his speech. “That’s what’s necessary.”

Lisa Green, a resident of Bayou St. John, said she was worried about threats to public education. She drew connections to her mother’s advocacy for civil rights during the sixties and seventies. Green attended the rally despite unfounded warnings she saw on social media about martial law being enacted on protestors.
“I’m just trying to keep her legacy going and keep things straight and safe for my grandkids,” Green said. “If you’re fighting for something that you believe in, that’s just a chance you have to take.”
Attendees expressed their frustrations with the billionaire Musk’s control over the federal government. Metairie resident Whitt Conner came to the rally with his family and strung a handmade Cybertruck pinata to a tree. Conner said Trump’s policies have created a nation in which he and his family cannot survive, especially because members of his family are on Medicaid. After the speeches concluded, people flocked to the tree for a chance to hit the Cybertruck pinata.

Speeches emphasized community building, education and standing up to conservative agendas locally and nationally. Members of immigrant rights group Union Migrante implored elected officials to protect rights of undocumented migrants in the city and for the police to not collaborate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency that oversees deportations.
“If you’re a person with privilege, if you’re white and you have wealth and connections, it’s the moment to use that for good — to take the risk, to talk to your friend who’s a politician, to take to email, to stand up, to film ICE and tell them that this is shameful, what they’re doing,” Union Migrante member Edith Romero said. “We are taking a risk right now, being publicly, locally, fighting for our rights. If we can do it, you can do it.”
Union Migrante and other advocacy groups, like Step Up Louisiana and the Worker Justice Project, organized the New Orleans rally. Sue Mobley, a member of Indivisible NOLA, a progressive political advocacy group, was one of the organizers. Before the rally, she told Verite News that the peaceful protest would focus on calls to action, especially as voters express mounting frustration at the state of federal politics.
“Part of why it’s important to get people out in the street and get people involved in the long term, is to reduce that feeling of helplessness and give it somewhere to go,” Mobley said. “Not all of us are going to run for Congress tomorrow, but a lot more of us can show up at school board meetings and city council meetings and be engaged where we are most impacted.”
Samara Smith, an organizer at worker and racial justice group Step Up Louisiana called on elected officials to fight back.
“Our expectations from you, our elected officials, is that when they push the line, you push back harder,” Smith said in a speech. “When they toe the line, you pull it tighter and make it clear you’re willing to put your body and your career on the line to protect our liberties. Because I promise you, the ones you need to fear are not AIPAC, it’s not Shell and it’s not Lockheed Martin. It’s us, the people, and we will remember.”

Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.”
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, is known for responding to extreme weather like hurricanes and wildfires — the kinds of disasters that are becoming more intense and common as climate change gets worse. But the agency also has a program that sends billions of dollars to communities, municipalities, and states proactively so that they can prepare for these events before they hit.
In an internal FEMA memorandum obtained and first reported by Grist, the Trump administration announced its plans to dismantle that program — the biggest climate adaptation initiative the federal government has ever funded — even as disasters incur hundreds of billions of dollars worth of damages across the United States. The decision comes as at least seven people were killed this week as tornadoes and catastrophic flooding descended on the central United States in what meteorologists called a once in a generation event.
The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, or BRIC, was established in 2018 during President Donald Trump’s first term, replacing a similar FEMA initiative. BRIC’s first round of funding was launched in 2020, when Trump was still in office, and in 2023, the program awarded close to a billion dollars to scores of communities, states, and tribal nations across the country. In January, before Trump began his second term, the agency opened its fiscal year 2024 notice of funding, with $750 million in matching grants made available to applicants from areas that received a major disaster declaration within the past seven years.
But FEMA now aims to cancel those grants and any other BRIC grants that have not been paid out yet by the federal government, according to the pre-decisional memo dated April 2 from Cameron Hamilton, a Trump administration official who is serving as FEMA administrator until the president appoints a permanent head of the agency.
“BRIC was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program,” a FEMA spokesperson told Grist. “It was more concerned with climate change than helping Americans effected by natural disasters.”
BRIC generally shoulders 75 percent of the cost of a given resilience project, and up to 90 percent of the cost of projects in disadvantaged communities. The program’s emphasis on equity is what may have marked it for demolition — the Trump administration has been systematically dismantling Biden-era efforts to infuse equity into governmental programs and direct more climate spending toward underrepresented groups.
FEMA employees disputed Hamilton’s argument in the memo that BRIC grants “have not enhanced the level of hazard mitigation as much as desired.”
“I don’t know where that came from,” said one agency employee who preferred to stay anonymous.
According to a source within the agency, the Trump administration asked BRIC staffers to offer justification for the program and its Direct Technical Assistance sister initiative, which offers non-financial support to help communities navigate the BRIC funding process and identify the hazards they face. The request was made on Tuesday this week with a Wednesday deadline.
With a tight turnaround, staffers offered success stories from across the country. BRIC awards have helped communities bury power lines, build culverts, protect wastewater facilities from being inundated by flooding, and upgrade power stations. If BRIC is frozen, communities will no longer be able to apply for the grants for fiscal year 2024 made available in January. Projects that have been selected in past years but not yet disbursed funds will no longer receive payment. Partially completed projects will be scrutinized and reviewed, the memo said.
“The administration now has one of FEMA’s most effective grant programs on the chopping block,” said Shana Udvardy, a senior climate resilience policy analyst with the Climate and Energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It’s oversubscribed almost every single year.” In fiscal year 2023, FEMA received more than 1,200 subapplications across all 50 states, 35 tribes, five territories, and Washington, D.C., totaling more than $5.6 billion in requests. It was able to provide less than a fifth of the money requested.
A looming question is whether FEMA can yank grants that are being funded with money appropriated by Congress. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the bipartisan infrastructure law, allocated approximately $6.8 billion to FEMA for community-wide mitigation efforts, with a portion of this funding directed to the BRIC program. “If this administration does away with the program, it goes against a law that Congress passed,” Udvardy said, “so there’s a concern there to be raised.”

(Library of Congress)Leavenworth is a city of prisons.
The area is home to five separate facilities, including a federal penitentiary, a state prison, and the U.S. military’s only maximum security prison. The imposing federal pen once housed Machine Gun Kelly and Robert Stroud, the “Birdman of Alcatraz,” who did most of his research on birds in Kansas, not on the California prison island.
In popular culture the city’s name has become synonymous with incarceration, a legacy of pulp magazines and old gangster movies. Prisons are among the city’s major employers, and construction is underway for a new $532 million federal prison to replace the existing 128-year-old facility by May 2026.
But there’s one detention facility that Leavenworth city officials don’t want.
It’s the newly (and Orwellian) named Midwest Regional Reception Center, a for-profit prison that would hold ICE detainees gathered in massive raids now undertaken by the Trump administration. The center would be located in the former Leavenworth Detention Facility, in operation from 1992 to 2021, which a federal judge once called “an absolute hell hole.”
Owned and managed by CoreCivic, formerly the Corrections Corporation of America, the nation’s largest private prison firm, the Leavenworth Detention Facility was a nightmare of humanitarian and civil rights abuses where both guards and inmates feared for their lives, according to court documents. Operated under a contract with the U.S. Marshals Service, in 2017 the Office of Inspector General issued a 129-page audit that found chronic understaffing and mismanagement.
Abuses continued even after the audit.
The American Civil Liberties Union and federal public defenders sent a letter to the White House documenting their concerns. Beatings and stabbings were rampant, suicides were prevalent, sexual assault reports were discouraged, and the company failed to report the death of an inmate for six days. Employees who were victims of crime were forbidden from being interviewed by police during work time, and CoreCivic staff refused to cooperate with city police on sexual assault allegations.
In 2019, a federal judge found that telephone conversations between detainees and their attorneys — conversations that should be confidential by law — were routinely recorded.
In 2021, a 39-year-old detainee, Scott W. Wilson, was beaten to death by another inmate who attacked him with a plastic food tray. The entire facility went on lockdown for weeks, with detainees kept in their cells except for showers every few days.
“The only way I could describe it, frankly, what’s going on at CoreCivic right now is it’s an absolute hell hole,” said U.S. District Judge Julie A. Robinson during a resentencing hearing four years ago. “The court is aware of it. The defense bar is aware of it. The prosecutors are aware of it. The United States Marshals are aware of it.”
The environment inside the facility was causing trauma to all involved.
“Guards have been almost killed,” she said. “Detainees are being traumatized with assaults and batteries, and not long ago a detainee was killed. So I’m well aware of the situation at CoreCivic and very troubled by it as well.”
After an executive order by former President Joe Biden prohibited the Justice Department from contracting with private prisons, the Leavenworth Detention Facility officially closed on Jan. 1, 2022.
But the story doesn’t end there.
Anticipating an opportunity to profit from the mass deportations, on Feb. 21 of this year CoreCivic applied for a special use permit from the city of Leavenworth to open a detention center for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The permit was necessary under city code because the facility had been closed for more than 24 months.
The application for “reactivation” of the detention center, which would operate as the “Midwest Regional Reception Center,” would allow approximately 1,000 detained noncitizens to be held on the 20-acre site.
“On average, detainees will be held for approximately 51 days as they are processed through the immigration system, including through removal hearings held at the facility,” CoreCivic said in document supporting the application. “All detainees who are processed through the facility will be transported to the nearest major transportation hub (i.e., the Kansas City International Airport) or the ICE office in Kansas City.”
CoreCivic, headquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee, would operate the detention facility through an interagency agreement with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. The city had scheduled an initial public hearing before the planning commission hearing on the permit for April 7.
But on March 13, CoreCivic withdrew the application for the special use permit. It said it didn’t need one. On March 25, the prison corporation asserted that the recently awarded contract with ICE “necessitates a swift contract activation of the Midwest Regional Reception Center to accommodate their pressing need for capacity in the region,” according to court documents. There was no time to go through a lengthy permitting process. It began advertising for correction officers and other staff needed to reopen the facility.
On March 31, the city of Leavenworth filed suit in U.S. District Court to prevent CoreCivic from reopening the facility without a permit. The complaint asks for a temporary restraining order.
“The city is likely to suffer irreparable, irreversible, direct, and intangible harms to the health, safety, comfort, economic development, and property values of Leavenworth citizen and businesses” if CoreCivic is allowed to proceed, the city argued.
Supporting the suit was a declaration by Patrick Kitchens, Leavenworth chief of police, asserting that “significant problems” were encountered by the department when investigating violent felonies at the facility.
“Whether officers would be permitted to enter depended entirely on who was in charge,” Kitchens said. “Officers often were not allowed access at all and had to conduct interviews outside of the facility’s gate.”
CoreCivic prohibited its employees from giving interviews to police on company time, he said.
“Instead, these crime victims were forced to provide a written statement through the holes of the facility’s fence and then follow up on their own time,” he said.
The company also routinely refused to turn over evidence, including photographs and weapons that had been used in assaults among inmates and against guards.
I reached out to CoreCivic for a response to the city’s lawsuit.
“We don’t believe it’s right for Leavenworth’s taxpayers to have to pay for a lawsuit protesting efforts at the facility that would result in the creation of 300 jobs,” Ryan Gustin, senior director for public affairs, wrote in an email. “We’ve been part of this community as a dedicated employer for more than 30 years, and our intention remains to meet the emerging needs of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at our Midwest Regional Reception Center.”
Gustin said CoreCivic believes the site is already properly zoned. He did not address a question about allegations of past abuses at the facility.
Leavenworth has been a prison town for more than a century, and its city leaders and residents know that’s not an easy legacy. When I visited Leavenworth a few years ago, I heard from shopkeepers along its main street and the customers in a local diner that nearly everybody either had worked at one of the prisons or had a family member who did.
When I learned recently the city had filed suit to stop the reopening of the Leavenworth Detention Facility, my first thought was it seemed out of character for a prison town. But the more I thought about it, the less out of character it seemed. Who better to judge the civic threat posed by a for-profit prison company with a horrifying record of mismanagement and abuse?
It may also be part of the crisis of conscience the country is having about mass deportations. If the flights to a notorious El Salvadoran prison, in apparent defiance of a federal judge’s verbal order, don’t give you pause, consider this: the Trump administration has admitted that not everyone it deported on those planes was a criminal. An “oversight” resulted in the deportation of a Maryland man who had been granted protected status, but the U.S. government says it’s unable to retrieve Kilmar Abrego Garcia from the custody of El Salvador.
What the government of the United States did in our name was to effectively disappear a 29-year-old father. Whether he will emerge alive from his ordeal is uncertain.
Despite noncitizens having rights under the Constitution, hurried deportations are preventing detainees from accessing the courts. This obscene abuse of power is brought to bear not only on those who are suspected gang members, but is also being used to remove international students whose opinions the administration finds irksome.
There is a name for this, and it is terrorism.
Terrorism is defined in the U.S. Criminal Code is to engage in violent criminal acts that appear to be intended to “intimidate or coerce a civilian population.” What happened to Garcia and others was violent and illegal, and there is little doubt it was meant to intimidate and coerce others.
Today the deportees are those “suspected” of being gang members because of their tattoos and college students who have exercised their First Amendment rights with op-ed pieces about Gaza. Tomorrow it might be just about anybody the government finds troublesome or merely inconvenient.
Take a look at your own tattoos, your own posts on social media and your friends or family members. There is something or someone among them that authorities could use to punish you. Have a butterfly tattoo? Some sources identify them as gang symbols. Have a cousin who did time for drugs? You’re a suspect, too.
To make mass deportations more efficient, facilities such as the “Midwest Regional Reception Center” are needed. Organized repression at scale requires the ability to detain thousands while hearings — or flights to third-world oubliettes — are arranged. The manufacture of terror also requires the tacit approval of a majority of citizens. This last is perhaps easier than imagined, because as any criminal defense lawyer will tell you, there is a built-in bias among the American public that if you’re arrested for something, you must be guilty.
That bias can only be overcome with fact.
Here is a 29-year-old Maryland man who was removed by irrevocable error. There is a Columbia University student arrested only because he was a political activist. And in Kansas, a private prison firm seeks to profit by becoming part of America’s mass deportation machine.
The story of American prisons is told in the architecture of the institutions at Leavenworth, from the castle-like old federal penitentiary built in 1903 to the modular shape of the contemporary military barracks. But the building that housed the Leavenworth Detention Facility resembles nothing so much as a warehouse, a place to store the bodies and souls of noncitizens until they can be discarded.
The question of whether the former Leavenworth Detention Facility should be brought back online as part of the mass deportation pipeline goes beyond the legal issue of whether it can be done without a municipal permit. It’s a moral question of whether it should be done.
The answer will define us.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/service-pnp-ppmsca-31700-31777v.jpg,,,2025-04-06 04:58:03.049492

(Maryland Matters file photo)With the end of the legislative session looming at midnight Monday, the bills have been coming fast and furious for Maryland lawmakers in recent days — and the pace will only pick up when they return Monday. While they haven’t cleared all the hurdles, some bills are pretty clearly on their way to final approval.
PDAB expansion bill nearing finish line
A bill that would expand the authority of a state board that is working to lower certain prescription drug costs is ready for the governor’s consideration, after the Senate passed House Bill 424 on party lines Friday evening.
The Prescription Drug Affordability Board is currently tasked with finding ways to reduce the cost of prescription drugs on the state’s health plan, saving some taxpayer dollars in the process.
The bill would expand the board’s authority to set what are called upper-payment limits on prescription drugs in the commercial market. Doing so would limit how much drug purchasers could spend on certain medications, which supporters hope would result in savings for more Marylanders. The bill also increases the number of people who sit on the board’s stakeholder council.
“This is a big day for Marylanders who may struggle to pay for their prescription medicines,” Vincent DeMarco, president of the Maryland Health Care for All Coalition, said in a Friday statement. He has been a vocal supporter of the board’s efforts and the bill expanding the board’s authority.
“With this measure enacted, the board can expand its work and develop common sense solutions to bring down costs for average Marylanders,” he said in the statement.
The Senate’s 33-12 vote on the House bill sends the measure back to the House for review. If the House approves, the bill will head to the governor’s desk for his review and possible signature. House approval is expected, as the Senate version of the bill is in the same posture.
FAMLI delay ready for full Senate consideration
The Senate Finance Committee passed a bill – somewhat reluctantly – to delay the implementation of the state’s paid family leave act, a program that has been pushed off twice already.
The Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) program is set to begin in July. But amid a $3 billion budget shortfall and rapid-fire policy decisions from the Trump administration, the Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) administration proposed delaying the start of the program by 18 months, with benefits going out in 2028.
House Bill 102 would impose the delay, but some lawmakers are not happy prolonging the start to the program, according to discussions in a Senate Finance Committee voting session Friday.
Sen. Dawn Gile (D-Anne Arundel County) said the delay is “disappointing,” though she understood that it may be a necessary move due to the state’s budget concerns.
Committee Vice Chair Antonio Hayes (D-Baltimore City) also had heartburn over delaying FAMLI program, which has been pushed off twice since the program was created in 2022.
“This is the third time it’s been delayed,” Hayes said. “It continues to concern me because we’ve put so much into it, but we are where we are.”
Hayes ultimately voted against the bill, along with Democratic Sens. Benjamin Kramer of Montgomery County and Clarence Lam of Anne Arundel and Howard counties.
“I want to see it come to fruition,” Lam said. “It’s important to get this stood up as quickly as possible … there are a lot of people who need that help who could be helped sooner.”
But Finance Committee Chair Pamela Beidle (D-Anne Arundel) said the delay is necessary. If the state keeps the current timeline, “this program is going to start and we’re not going to have anything set up for it because we don’t have computer programs and we don’t have people.”
The Finance Committee voted 8-3 for the delay. Republicans who largely oppose the FAMLI program voted to delay the program start date but said that they’d rather not see the program get started at all.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/annapolis-1.jpg,,,2025-04-06 04:00:13.281706

The two-hour Omaha rally along Dodge Street and South Happy Hollow Boulevard involved nearly 1,000 protesters, many of whom showed up with signs, chants and common goals.
Protest organizers said in a statement online that the mass mobilization was a “message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies.”
Behind the protests
The rallies targeted the Trump administration’s immigration policies and the Department of Government Efficiency’s approach to cutting and pausing spending on healthcare, services, jobs and access to personal data held by the government.
Two pro-democracy organizations, Like-Minded Friends and 50501 worked with local partisans and others to pull together the event. They assembled a lineup of local and state political figures to speak in Memorial Park.

The lineup included registered nonpartisan U.S. Senate candidate Dan Osborn, who reaffirmed that he is weighing a run against Pete Ricketts for Senate in 2026 and Omaha Mayoral Candidate John Ewing Jr, a Democrat running against incumbent Republican Mayor Jean Stothert on May 13.
Ewing, a former Maverick who also taught at UNO’s College of Public Affairs and Community Service, mentioned the importance of voting and civic engagement to “have the democracy that our forefathers imagined.”
“I think it’s always critically important that people take an active role in their government,” Ewing said. “When they don’t, then we end up with what we’re seeing across the country right now, with the chaos, the fear, the uncertainty, the hatred and everything that is diametrically opposed to what America is supposed to stand for.”
Douglas County Democratic Party Chair CJ King said the demonstration “was a show of force” to help people realize they can make a change locally and nationally.
“I think there’s a lot of people that just don’t like the direction we’re going in,” King said. “People need to come out and recognize that you can’t sit alone and be despondent and have anxiety and fear. We come together and we have hope and an opportunity.”
Republicans respond
Douglas County Republican Party Chairwoman Nancy Hicks, responding to the protests, acknowledged the concerns of the protesters but said she and the party support the actions of the federal government.

Hicks said she believes Medicare and Medicaid “lose billions annually to improper payments.” She questioned why citizens wouldn’t want government expenditures to be examined “to make sure they actually are functioning as designed.”
“The Douglas County Republican Party, aligning with Trump and Musk, agree that the focus is on preserving these programs by rooting out misuse, fraud and waste, not necessarily dismantling them,” Hicks said.
Along with congregating in Memorial Park, protesters lined both sides of Dodge Street and the overpass. The sound of car horns blared as drivers held fists and signs out their windows in support.
Some posters said, “Hands off our democracy.” Others said, “Stop the chaos.” Another said, “Elect a clown, elect a circus.” Many said they backed democracy.
Attendees speak
UNO student Calvin Snyder attended the protest with his family and expressed worry for his future education, mentioning the federal government’s focus on dismantling the federal Department of Education.

“It feels like people are finally realizing that they are not alone in this,” Snyder said. “They are angry, and they are feeling the brunt of these terrible policies and that they can do something about it. I think this is a moment of awakening in a lot of America.”
Creighton University theology professor Susan Calef voiced distress about “the loss of democracy” and the failure of the checks and balances system. Having attended previous demonstrations, she said the people “have got to come together.”
“When you watch the news on a daily basis, it’s grim and very distressing. So to be together with other people and mobilizing like this really helps,” Calef said.

Omaha citizen Jean Zinnen attended the protest with her 15-year-old granddaughter, holding up signs along Dodge Street. Zinnen said the importance of protesting was so her granddaughter’s voice could be “heard and respected.”
“I am here because democracy is at risk,” Zinnen said. “I have friends, so many friends in marginalized communities. I have a trans niece, gay family members, and this is just horrifying. My granddaughter is protesting for her future.”
Omaha citizen Dawn Marie Hart was one of the first protesters to arrive, bringing a banner and dangling it on the overpass. Hart said she was 64 and has “never felt so strong about anything in [her] life.”
“I think the power of the people speaks a lot,” Hart said. “It doesn’t matter if they’re Republican or Democrat or what[ever] they are. He made promises, and he didn’t keep them. Now we have to fight to get everything back.”

William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery) responds to questions Saturday on the bill that seeks to limit financial liability in child sex abuse lawsuits. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Lawmakers gave final approval Saturday to a bill designed to give survivors of childhood sexual abuse their day in court, while shielding Maryland from what could be billions of dollars in payouts for such claims.
The rapid-fire passage of House Bill 1378 — it got out of the House, through the Senate, back to the House and to the governor’s desk in just two days — followed two weeks of often emotional and sometimes personal debate about the bill.
The bill is a response to the Child Victims Act of 2023, which lifted the time limit during which people could file lawsuits against public or private institutions where they claimed they had been sexually abused as children. That bill was a victory for Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), a child sexual abuse survivor himself who had spent years pushing for the measure.
But Wilson sponsored HB1378 this year after thousands of people lined up to file claims against the state and it became clear that damages could rise into the billions of dollars, potentially bankrupting the state. Many lawmakers who voted for the bill in recent days pointed to the need to protect the state while allowing survivors their day in court.
“On balance, I think this is the right way to go,” said Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), chair of the Judicial Proceedings Committee that passed the bill Saturday morning. The full Senate passed it 36-7 just hours later.
Opponents were divided between those who said the Child Victims Act should never have been approved in the first place and those who said the bill to fix it was either unconstitutional or wrongly hurt victims — or both.

“This is the most knowingly unconstitutional piece of legislation this legislative body has ever passed,” said Corey Stern, an attorney representing child sexual abuse survivors, in a text after Saturday’s full Senate vote. “The members who voted for it should be ashamed of themselves. The leadership that insisted they do should be voted out of office.”
The Child Victims Act capped awards against public institutions, like the state, to $890,000 per incident for an abused child. It set the cap for private institutions, like the Catholic Church or scouting organizations, at $1.5 million.
HB1378 would lower the cap for public institutions to $400,000 and for private institutions to $700,000 for cases filed June 1 or later, when the new law takes effect. Claims before that would be subject to the original rules. The bill would also cap fees for attorneys at 20% for cases that settle out of court and 25% for cases that result from a court judgment.
The bill also narrows the scope of the term “incident,” so that all crimes by one abuser against one victim would count as one incident, rather than one incident for every separate assault.
Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City), who spoke on behalf of Wilson during a Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee hearing on the bill Friday, said about 1,500 lawsuits have been filed since the Child Victims Act was passed, and another 4,000 cases are waiting to go forward.
Sen. Jack Bailey (R-Calvert and St. Mary’s) was one of seven Senate Republicans to vote against the bill Saturday. He also voted against the Child Victims Act two years ago.
“I did not feel it was appropriate that if the General Assembly allowed these current victims to receive compensation based on a decision we made, that now all of a sudden, we should change that,” Bailey said after Saturday’s vote.

Much of the Senate debate was between Smith and Minority Whip Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll). Ready said it “was a mistake” for the legislature to pass the 2023 measure that lifted previous statutory time limits and allowed survivors to sue their abusers or organizations that harbored them “at any time.”
“Hindsight is always 20-20,” Smith said.
“But there was foresight. I think people didn’t want to say ‘no’ to the pressures. Not do something, but slow down,” Ready said.
After about 25 minutes of debate, the Senate give the bill preliminary approval before suspending the rules so that the bill could go to third reading, or given final approval, on the same day.
Before the final vote, Sen. Chris West (R-Baltimore County) said part of the legislation could face an immediate court challenge, especially over the limited definition of incident for victims. West summarized a recent Maryland Supreme Court decision when an incarcerated person in prison was assaulted twice “that occurred within minutes of each other.”
“The whole question that this bill sets up is whether our intent to now limit the cause of action to a single occurrence per claimant, whether that is constitutional,” said West, who voted for the bill. “This is going to be a lawsuit that will surely be filed almost immediately, and it will surely go right up to the Maryland Supreme Court.”
Because the Senate made a technical amendment to the bill, it had to go back the House for review. The House agreed to concur in the Senate amendment on a 92-40 vote, sending the bill to the governor.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sen.-William-C.-Smith-Jr.-4-5-2025-1024x770.jpg,,,2025-04-06 02:57:49.970845

“We face an epic struggle for democracy, for justice, for equality, for the very future of our country!” said Claire Richardson, one of the event organizers with the group ReSisters, to cheers from the crowd.
She read a long list of recent actions by the Trump Administration, and the crowd echoed, “Hands off!”

“We are here to tell Donald Trump and Elon Musk, hands off our democracy!” she said. “Hands off our children’s education. Hands off our jobs. Hands off our veterans. Hands off our bodies and gender choice. Hands off our elections, hands off Medicaid, hands off our libraries and museums. Hands off Social Security, hands off Greenland and hands off Canada!”
Many demonstrators carried Canadian flags, in a nod to support for Alaska’s closest neighbor and in protest of Trump threatening economic sanctions and even annexation of Canada. 
Alaskans joined demonstrations across the state, including Skagway, Haines, Gustavus, Petersburg, Sitka, Ketchikan, Kodiak, Soldotna, Wasilla, Healy, Dillingham, Bethel, Nome and large crowds in Anchorage and Fairbanks. 
The mood was high spirited, with the crowd singing together — some original songs by local artists — cheering, and waving signs. 
Speakers evoked the origins of the United States and the fight for independence from an oppressive monarchy, and condemned U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and U.S. Rep. Nich Begich, R-Alaska, for allying with Trump, alleging they violated the Constitution and their oath of office.
“Have you no outrage at the detention and deportation of lawful residents?” said Juneau resident Tristan Knutson-Lombardo to the crowd, directed at Sullivan and Begich. “Have you no concern for Trump’s attempts to quell freedom of the press, defy judicial orders and seek retribution toward political opponents for supporting imperialistic land grabs?
“Shame on you for standing idle as our government whitewashes our history, represses scientific study, suppresses creative thought and erases the notion that anyone could identify as something other than the sex written on their birth certificate,” he said. “Shame on you!” 
Lauryn G̱úud Gíigangaa Framke, a Haida language teacher, made a powerful plea for action on behalf of youth and the next generation. “We are told that children are sacred, but that is only true until they are born poor, or until they are gay, or until they are trans or brown, or until it is time for them to go to school and the right to arms will always be more important than their lives,” she said. “But there is one thing we can have hope in, and that is community …. We can make sure that this community is a safe place for our children to grow up in. Because our youth are sacred, and they deserve better than this.” 
Ernestine Hayes, a former Alaska writer laureate and award-winning Tlingit author and professor, addressed the crowd and focused on the history of colonization being repeated. 
“They are taking our land. They’re telling us we have to speak English only. They want everyone to believe in their God. They’re removing our history and seizing our wealth. Does any of that sound familiar?” she said. “It’s still time to decolonize.” 
Mike Williams, a Juneau resident and small business owner, protested with a sign that towered over the crowd – on a 24-foot pole reading, “We’ve had it up to here.” He said he’s most concerned about the mass federal firings and cuts by the arm of the White House named DOGE, or “the Department of Government Efficiency,” coordinated by Elon Musk. 
“It just blows my mind that only 4% of our federal budget is on staffing. So to cut staff at all just makes little sense… I heard a really good metaphor. All of this is like cutting off your legs to try to lose weight,” he said. “Sure, you lost the weight, but at what cost? The outcome is much worse.”
He said the most difficult part is talking with close family members who continue to support Trump.  He said he’d like to see more people push back against “blind faith” in Trump and stand up against these kinds of actions of the Trump administration. 
“It’s okay to say that someone’s doing something wrong,” he said. “Like, we thought Biden has made a lot of mistakes. We thought Obama had some mistakes, and we can admit that. So, I just don’t understand why we can’t admit that about all this that’s going on too.”
Demonstrators and speakers noted the large crowd size for Juneau, with families with children, seniors and friend groups attending. Crowd size estimates exceeded 1,000, with organizers saying there were 1,550 based on photos taken from the fifth floor of the Capitol. More protests and demonstrations are expected, according to organizers.
Protests were planned for Saturday in more than 1,200 locations across all 50 states, as well as cities in Europe, including London, Berlin and Paris.

Cory Booker (D-NJ) attends a Town Hall at Bergen Community College on April 5, 2025, in Paramus, New Jersey. Earlier in the week, Sen. Booker spoke on the Senate floor for over 25 hours, protesting President Trump’s agenda, breaking a record set by Sen. Strom Thurmond's 24-hour, 18-minute filibuster against the Civil Rights Act in 1957. (Photo by Kena Betancur/Getty Images)PARAMUS — Sen. Cory Booker urged a crowd of about 1,000 people at a town hall in this Bergen County town Saturday to speak up against the Trump administration, days after Booker won attention nationwide for a record-breaking, anti-Trump speech he delivered on the floor of the U.S. Senate.
Appearing at Bergen Community College on a day of nationwide protests against President Donald Trump, Booker spoke to people gathered in the school’s gym about funding threats to Medicaid, attacks on the LGBTQ community, and stronger leadership within the Democratic Party.
“One of the greatest lessons from history that I’ve learned … is that the only thing necessary for bad things that happen in any democracy is for good people to say nothing,” said Booker, a Democrat.
Audience members told the New Jersey Monitor that Booker’s Senate floor speech — which started Monday night and lasted for 25 hours and 5 minutes — was the first concrete action they had seen any Democrat take against the Trump administration, and they came to hear more from the senator.
“He just stood there and would not give up. That’s why I’m here today: to support him. He’s supporting America. We need more of that,” said Deborah Brown from Hackensack.
Saturday marked Booker’s first public event since the attention-grabbing speech, which surpassed a previous record when South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes in opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1957.
The town hall, and Booker’s speech, come as voters have pushed Democratic Party officials to take more action against plans by Trump and congressional Republicans to slash funding to social services, deport scores of undocumented immigrants, and implement tariffs that will push consumer prices skyward.
As Booker walked out to “I Won’t Back Down” by Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, the crowd applauded and chanted “Cory, Cory, Cory.” Booker opened by saying that he’s heard from thousands of constituents telling him to help protect social services and the country’s democratic freedoms.
At one point, several protesters asked him to do more for Palestinians in Gaza. As law enforcement escorted them away, Booker said he respects their right to free speech but that he did not want others to be disrupted from sharing their stories.
He later said he wants more members of the public to stand up for their rights, encouraging them to “do a little bit more” by posting on social media or attending rallies.
“Find out what you can do. Do not let your inability to do everything undermine your determination to do something,” he said.

Courtnay Johnson-Suffern, president of the Bergen County NAACP, asked Booker what he would say to young people who feel disenfranchised and discouraged from running for office.
Booker responded by saying Democrats are unfairly accused of being “alarmists.”
“When our country is taking on the tactics of authoritarian leaders in authoritarian countries, when you see books being band from libraries across the country … those [are] tactics of authoritarian countries,” he said.
After the town hall, Booker spoke to reporters about what Democrats can do in this moment, as more young voters and voters of color express their disappointment in the party and in the political system at large.
“The party’s going to do great if they make the center of their focus the people and people struggling, people suffering right now,” he said.
He also said he recognized his party needs to take more action, but also highlighted the importance of convincing Republican politicians to vote against Trump’s policies.
“All of us have to be asking us right now, what can I do to help to appeal to the conscience of people who are many of them are in districts that are purple, districts that many of them — it’s clear that what Donald Trump is doing is wildly unpopular amongst their voters,” he said.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)The House passed a potentially transformative package of energy reform bills Saturday that are aimed at hastening new power generation in Maryland and curtailing costs for ratepayers.
The move tees up the three-bill package, backed by General Assembly leadership, for final passage, even if it may come on the 90-day session’s final day.
The Senate, which previously approved the energy bills, is likely to concur with amendments made in the House, sending the bills to the governor’s desk, said Sen. Brian Feldman (D- Montgomery), chairman of the Education, Energy and the Environment Committee.
“We’ve been in pretty close consultation,” he said. “Unless there’s some surprise, I would anticipate that we’d be concurring.”
The legislation, which will spur in-state power generation, came as a response to escalating electric bills for Maryland consumers. In the run-up to the General Assembly session, new transmission line projects also stirred frustration from rural parts of the state, which will bring energy through Maryland from other states, spurred by coal plant retirements and increased power demand from data centers and other users.
Together, the bills would create uniform siting standards for solar arrays, replacing a patchwork of local policies, and set up a new state office focused on energy planning.
They would also establish expedited procedures for new power facilities in Maryland, potentially including nuclear and natural gas, as well as battery energy storage. In an effort to reduce costs for power customers, the bills would also limit certain utility spending and ratemaking practices, and hand out an electric bill rebate averaging $80 per household.
Lawmakers’ touted electric bill refund would average $81 per household

“We are an energy desert because the policies of the Maryland General Assembly do not like and do not promote anything but green energy, and green energy in the year 2025 cannot meet the needs of Maryland’s population,” said Del. Jason Buckel (R- Allegany), the chamber’s minority leader, on the House floor Saturday.
In response, Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery) took to the microphone to list off provisions in the bill she expects to save power customers money. Under the bill, Maryland’s utility regulator wouldn’t be able to approve multiyear rate plans, which can lock in successive rate increases over a period of several years, unless there is a benefit to customers. The bill also wouldn’t allow utilities to use a “reconciliation” process to recoup additional spending through rates.
The bill also places new limits on using ratepayer dollars to replace gas pipelines, requiring utilities to show a safety need. And it restricts other spending of ratepayer dollars, Charkoudian said, including on trade association memberships.
“These things, over the next years and decades, will save hundreds of millions of dollars for our ratepayers, and we should be proud to vote green for that,” Charkoudian said. “Oh, and as a bonus, ratepayers aren’t going to be paying for private jets for Exelon.”
The broadest bill (House Bill 1035 and Senate Bill 937), focused on utility regulation and power generation, has garnered pushback from environmental groups, who argue that natural gas plants would get a fast track, flying in the face of the state’s ambitious climate change goals and burdening nearby communities with air pollution.
The bill does require that any new natural gas plants approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission under the bill have the ability to convert to hydrogen or zero-emissions biofuel when “feasible.” It also requires the Commission approve renewable projects at a 4 to 1 ratio.
After Del. Brian Chisholm (R-Anne Arundel) slammed the legislature as “hostile to business” with excessive regulations, Del. Brian Crosby (D-St. Mary’s) pushed back.










It’s not an attack on a way of life. It is creating an opportunity for some of these farmers that simply do not wish to farm anymore.


– Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), chair of the House Economic Matters Committee


“Much to the chagrin of some of the environmental groups, it promotes gas. There has not been, nor is there, a cap on gas in this bill. All it does is streamline a permitting process to cut down costs,” Crosby said.
The package’s bill focused on solar energy (House Bill 1036 and Senate Bill 931) also stirred considerable pushback from Republicans. The bill prevents local governments from adopting certain laws that block solar developments and sets statewide standards.
Solar farms are allowed to occupy up to 5% of any one county’s “priority preservation area,” which is agricultural land. After that ceiling is hit, counties can restrict solar on the remaining 95% of farmland.
Republican members of the House argued on Friday that the 5% cap was set too high. They argued that solar companies, bolstered financially by the government’s backing, could offer large sums to lease or buy farmland for massive solar arrays.
The associated loss of farm acreage could destroy the fabric of the Eastern Shore’s agriculture industry, said Del. Jefferson L. Ghrist (R- Upper Shore). And if acres of grain production are lost, the Shore’s poultry houses could be forced to import chicken feed, undermining their business as well, he said.
“This bill doesn’t explicitly hurt farmers. I want to make that crystal clear,” Ghrist said. “It does make an attempt to reduce the acreage to improve this, but the reason why I’m so adamantly against it, is because it just doesn’t go far enough. We could potentially lose up to 54,000 acres on the Eastern Shore front from grain production.”
Del. C.T. Wilson (D- Charles), chairman of the House Economic Matters Committee, which approved the energy bills, said that farmers should have the choice to bring solar onto their land, and shouldn’t be blocked by local governments. In turn, the panels will bolster the state’s energy generation goals, Wilson said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“It’s [the bill] not an attack on a way of life,” Wilson said. “It is creating an opportunity for some of these farmers that simply do not wish to farm anymore.”
But Ghrist argued that counties weren’t stepping out of bounds by restricting solar, but rather exerting their proper zoning authority.
“If somebody wants to put a nudie bar next to a church or a school, and the county says: ‘No, you can’t do that,’ I don’t think anybody in this chamber will say: ‘You know what? The county’s taking away their property rights,'” Ghrist said.
Del. April Miller (R-Frederick) pushed back against the funding mechanism for the package’s new “Strategic Energy Planning Office” (House Bill 1037 and Senate Bill 909).
“I still am struggling with setting up this office on the backs of ratepayers,” Miller said Saturday.
But Crosby said that all three of the energy bills, when taken together, are likely to yield ratepayer savings that go beyond the $5 million cost of setting up the planning office. And the data provided by the office will allow Maryland to be less reliant on the regional grid operator to answer its own queries.
“We think it’s money well spent,” Crosby said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC02846-brighter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-05 22:59:41.007276

In Madison a massive crowd filled the lawns, sidewalks and streets on the State Street corner of the Wisconsin State Capitol, then marched the one-mile stretch to Library Mall on the University of Wisconsin campus. Organizers estimated more than 10,000 people participated.

Madison residents Jason and Aubrey, who declined to give their last names, said they were looking for a community with like-minded people. “We can be angry but it’s also fun to be out with people and it’s important to have joy in your life,” Aubrey said. She said she is concerned with rising income inequality and billionaires having control over social media and society.
“I’m scared for democracy and for the people I love who are going to be targeted by [Trump’s] immigration policies, his hatred of LGBTQ+ people. I felt kind of powerless and I think just being out here protesting, being in a really welcoming community — it’s what I can do right now,” Jason said. 
“Our next few years will be tough,” Charlene Bechen, a leader with the Oregon Wisconsin Area Progressives said. “MAGA leaders will launch attack after attack, perpetuate outrage after outrage, commit Injustice after Injustice with the goal of keeping us disoriented, demoralized and demobilized. We cannot allow that.”

A ‘Forward’ band played several songs in the time leading up to the official start of the rally at noon. One of the band members — seen holding the megaphone — told rallygoers that they were there to “express our outrage at our current political situation.” 
“We’ve got some songs for you. You know what helps sometimes when you’re scared and you’re angry — Dancing,” he said.

Jim from Mazomanie said his chainsaw with “Hand Off” written on it was getting a little heavy, but it was fun to bring some smiles to faces. He said it represented “Elon Musk and his idiocy,” and said that Musk has “worn out his welcome in Wisconsin.”
“If we didn’t produce Tuesday,” Jim said, referencing the state Supreme Court election, “[it] would be a whole different deal.” 
Luis Velasquez, an organizer for Voces de la Frontera, highlighted the attacks against immigrants by the Trump administration and the issue of local law enforcement being pushed to assist with efforts by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Velasquez told the crowd that he is a DACA recipient whose parents brought him to the U.S. as a child from El Salvador, but that no pathway to citizenship exists for him.

“I’m proud of being an immigrant myself and we know that there are plenty of good stories… stories that have been ignored and abandoned that have been systematically discarded,” Velasquez said. “Here in this space today, we can say that migration is beautiful, and that here is our home for the millions of immigrants who have been here in the U.S.” 
In Milwaukee, organizers estimated 5,000 people gathered in front of the Federal Building as police blocked the road. Democratic U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore told the crowd “I feel like I’ve been born again,” and compared the protest to the civil rights marches of the 1960s.  “We fought for voting rights back then. We fought for health care rights, then. We fought for the right for our elders to live in decency. We fought for educational opportunity. And guess what y’all, when we fought, we won. And that’s one of the things that… that’s the good news. Right now we’re fighting, and we are winning.”

The Trump administration, Moore told the crowd, is “actively trying to dismantle Medicaid.” Next week, as the Republicans move to push through their budget reconciliation bill with steep cuts to programs, they need to hear from the public, she said.  
Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of the immigrant workers’ rights group Voces de la Frontera, told the crowd, “This administration has made it clear from the beginning that they are taking a page from the fascist playbook, and treating immigrants as the scapegoat for the economic hardship that they are causing. They are trying to desensitize us to their cruelty, and to the humanity of others.”

Neumann-Ortiz talked about recent ICE arrests inside the Milwaukee County Courthouse, and called on county leaders to make the courthouse a safe zone from ICE arrests. “People will be afraid to come to the courthouse if that is not a protected zone,” she said. “And we know that these local fights are our frontline battles.” This is “where we have the most power” she added, saying it is imperative to win local struggles.
Calling out Trump administration detentions of political activists and deportations without due process to a notorious prison in El Salvador, Neumann Ortiz said,  “I know you’re as clear as I am that this is not just what they are doing to immigrants. They are paving a path, because that’s what they want to do to us.”
Cesar Hernandez of Voces spoke in support of unions and attacked Trump’s claim that undocumented immigrants are a drain on the U.S. economy. “In 2022 alone, undocumented folks contributed $2.2 trillion to our economy, not to mention paying $96.7 billion (with a ‘B’) in federal, state, and local taxes.”

Community activist Vaun Mayes told the crowd, “Right now food pantries for the poor and in need are losing funding in cities like this one right here, where food deserts are prominent.” Social Security and health care are being gutted, he said, “in front of our eyes.” He denounced the erasure of Black history in schools and the rise of white supremacist ideology. “Fight back we will. Defend one another we shall,” Mayes declared. “… ‘cause we are the true patriots. And we seek a new day and a place for all Americans in this nation to thrive.”

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)About 8,000 people rallied and marched at the Colorado Capitol in Denver for one of the many volunteer-organized Hands Off! protests against the Trump administration that took place around the country Saturday. 
Several speakers including union workers, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, Democratic state Sen. Jessie Danielson and Colorado state director of GreenLatinos Ean Tafoya among other activists and concerned citizens addressed the crowd before protesters embarked on a 2-mile march through downtown Denver. Attendees held a variety of homemade as well as branded Hands Off! signs highlighting Medicaid, Social Security, fair elections, LGBTQ+ rights, public lands, veterans services, and other public services seen to be at risk under President Donald Trump.

Weiser, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, told the crowd that the Trump administration “didn’t get the memo that immigrants make America great,” which is why he joined a lawsuit challenging Trump’s “unimaginable step of thinking a Sharpie could overrule the Constitution” when he issued an executive order to end birthright citizenship.
“In America, when we stand together, when we stand on our principles, we will always prevail,” Weiser said. “We cannot be silenced.”
Colorado has joined multiple lawsuits challenging actions of the Trump administration, many of which Weiser addressed at the rally. That includes a challenge to a Trump order banning gender-affirming care for anyone under age 19 and an order that halted distribution of federal funding and grants.
“What we need to recognize is the rule of law, the Constitution — they are in the balance,” Weiser said. “And I believe as we come through this, we will come through stronger, because we will better understand why we need to fight for our critical values, for equal protection of the laws, for freedom of speech, and yes, for due process of law.”

Luna Baez, daughter of Jeanette Vizguerra, a nationally known immigration rights activist who lives in Denver and has been in ICE custody since March 17, spoke at the rally seeking support for her mother. Baez said her mother was targeted because she consistently voices her support for immigrants, transgender rights and a ceasefire in Gaza, among other issues.
“I think we could all come to an agreement that the reason she was targeted was because she chooses to exercise her First Amendment rights,” Baez said. “I’m tired of seeing this sort of barrier where people think that everyone’s fight is exclusive and we can’t all come together toward the same thing, because we’re all under attack under the same people, under the same administration.”

Jim and Pam Cosgrove came to the rally from Littleton because they’re “fed up with the direction the country is going,” Jim said. Pam said the U.S. is meant to “help the underdog,” and instead government leaders are “pissing everybody off.” 
“If you’re not outraged by it, you’re not paying attention,” Jim said. He is retired after spending 38 years as a police officer in Denver, and said this was his first time at a protest on the side of the protesters. He walked around holding a large sign that said “orange lies matter.”
“I think it’s been generations since you’ve seen this kind of public involvement in politics,” Jim said. “Probably the Vietnam War was the last time I remember seeing consistent protests of this strength. It’s a very strong message that people are not happy.”

The rally in Denver was one of more than 1,000 Hands Off! events planned Saturday in all 50 states. Organizers hosted several other protests around Colorado in Boulder, Bailey, Greeley, Fraser, Telluride, Glenwood Springs, La Junta, Durango, Grand Junction, Summit County, Fort Collins, Loveland and Fairplay.
Morgan Miransky, a volunteer who helped organize the rally, said he’s been an activist for over 30 years and felt bringing people together for a rally is the most effective way to show elected officials when people are not happy. He said a group of about seven organizations worked together to plan the rally. 
“We were expecting a good turnout, but this is better than we thought it would be here,” Miransky said. “We’re looking forward to having more people come out and join us, and we’re hoping to build this into a larger nationwide movement for resistance.”

Jenett Tillotson, a longtime supporter of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who drew a crowd of over 10,000 people during an appearance in Denver in March, said she is “tired of billionaires running our country.” She said “we would be fine” if the government taxed billionaires. Billionaires are “hoarding money,” Tillotson said, and if they were hoarding anything else, “we would call them nuts.” She stood on the lawn in front of the Capitol building holding a large homemade sign that said “tax the rich.”
“People are suffering, and income equality is the biggest that we’ve ever seen, ever,” Tillotson said. “You’re talking about why people can’t afford healthcare, because they don’t make enough money to afford health care.” 
The high turnout at the rally tells elected officials that people are upset, Tillotson said. She said protests and rallies like Hands Off! will keep growing “until they listen to us.” 
“This is our country, the people’s country,” Tillotson said. “It’s not the billionaires’ country, it’s not Trump’s country.  It’s not even Democrats or Republicans’. It’s the people’s.”

LISTEN: Hear Northwest Arkansas residents share, in their own words, why they attended the rally and what concerns they have about Trump’s policies. 			



Storms that wreaked havoc on the state this week paused midday as Northwest Arkansas residents, ranging from children to retirees, lined both sides of College Avenue and received honks of support from drivers on the busy thoroughfare. Rallygoers held signs and chanted for about an hour and a half before marching to the Fayetteville Town Center on the downtown square. 
The We the People Veto Project 2025 event was a continuation of local grassroots efforts to organize in opposition to President Donald Trump’s policies. Erin Killeen said she and a few other concerned citizens came together after the inauguration seeking to build community by hosting protests that also highlight existing community organizations that can provide local residents with information about how to become more engaged.
Killeen said their events have aligned with the 50501 Movement in an effort to amplify efforts at the national level. The 50501 Movement presented Saturday’s national day of action in partnership with the Women’s March and Hands Off. 
“It’s a way to feel less alone, but more importantly, we also want to have information so that they can plug in in a more strategic, more structured way than just coming out and protesting, so that there can be that informed, lasting change that is really needed to shift and be part of the democratic process,” she said. 
To connect local residents to community organizations and upcoming events like protests, Killeen said she and her fellow organizers have created a new website that can be a resource for those looking to engage.
Having lived abroad, Killeen said she wasn’t shocked, but disappointed to see the recent political shift in the United States, and is calling on elected officials to do their duty of upholding the Constitution. 
“Hold the executive branch accountable. Do not allow for that executive overreach that is disempowering Congress,” she said. “That is dangerous for the future and the sovereignty of this nation, freedom of individuals and it goes against what the forefathers were trying to do.”

New Jersey U.S. Sen. Cory Booker energized 78-year-old Diane Manering this week with his record-breaking speech on the Senate floor. The Fayetteville resident said she’s been protesting since the 1960s, but “nothing has been this important” for her and her kids. 
“I really found myself getting very discouraged, and I saw a lot of my friends getting very upset — [the] older generation because of our grandkids — and I’ve always been very passionate about the environment,” Manering said. “But to see what this administration is doing, harming people and the cruelty, I’m just not a cruel person. I’m a kind person.”
What federal cuts could mean for Social Security was top of mind for Trudi Rust of Fayetteville. The retired health care worker said she relies on social security to pay her bills. 
“I earned this and they’re trying to take it away and slash it by somebody that’s not elected,” Rust said, referring to Elon Musk, a special adviser to the president. “…They’re hurting us all so that they can gain money and power, and it’s not right…I live on it. I pay my bills with it, and I earned every damn penny of it. I worked for over 50 years paying into Social Security.”
The Fayetteville protest coincided with more than 1,200 “Hands Off!” rallies planned for Saturday in Washington, D.C., state capitals and scores of other cities, according to The Associated Press via PBS.
Storms forced the rescheduling of a rally planned for the Arkansas Capitol steps in Little Rock until next Saturday, April 12, according to a Facebook post by Indivisible Little Rock and Central Arkansas. Rallies had also been planned for Fort Smith, Russellville, Monticello.
In Tennessee, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth spoke to about 800 people at Pearl Cohn Magnet School in Nashville, and about 1,500 rallied at Nashville’s Centennial Park despite the threat of storms, the Tennessee Lookout reported.
In South Dakota, thousands gathered in downtown Sioux Falls as part of the 50501 Movement’s rally, the South Dakota Searchlight reported.

(Julia Goldberg/Source NM)Amid brisk temperatures and steady snowfall Saturday afternoon, hundreds turned into thousands as protesters converged at the Roundhouse in Santa Fe, one of a dozen protests planned in New Mexico as part of a nationwide “Hands Off” movement in opposition to the Trump administration.
In Santa Fe, attendees sang parodies of folk songs (“Hey, Mr. Tangerine Man); chanted (Hey/hey/ho/ho fascists presidents have to go); and cheered on speakers such as U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, a Democrat representing New Mexico’s 3rd Congressional District.
“Hands off everything we love,” Leger Fernández said, pointing at the myriad signs in the crowd. “Hands off our democracy. Hands off trans-life, hands off our union, hands off our youth, hands off our fireman, hands off our women’s health, hands off immigration, hands off elections, hands off diversity. We want our country back!”
Leger Fernández told Source the message she came to give is “indeed we are in a moral moment, and everybody here today is rising to the occasion and is showing that this is love in action: When we show up, when we stand up, when we’re in the streets, on the feet, at the town halls, making calls, at the ballot box, in the courtroom, in the classroom, standing up for what is right and standing against the Musk/ Trump extreme Republicans agenda that’s hurting everything we love.”
Leger Fernández noted some small signs victories in Congress, such as a Democratic-backed Senate resolution bucking the president’s Canadian tariffs, supported by four Republicans, and House Republicans’ recent failure to use a procedural move to block a resolution, in which nine Republicans bucked their party leadership.
“It’s a small victory,” Leger Fernández told Source, “but it shows that when we can get just a few Republicans to vote with us, we can defeat the Trump agenda. That’s why we’re holding town halls, we’re showing up at places like this. We’re holding town halls in Republican districts because we just need three Republicans to have the courage to stand with their constituents and with the Constitution and not with Trump. This kind of mass movement puts pressure on the Republicans.”

In Nashville on Saturday U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren criticized President Donald Trump’s and billionaire ally Elon Musk’s economic policies, saying they are handing the country over to billionaires at the expense of Americans’ personal finances. 
“Seventy three million Americans get Social Security checks. It is not charity,” said Warren. “Elon Musk’s plan is to fire the people who get those Social Security checks out so that fewer people are able to get their Social Security checks.”
“Does firing half the people at the Social Security agency put money in your pockets?” Warren asked. 
About 800 people attended the event, billed as “The People’s Town Hall,” held at Pearl Cohn Magnet School. The event was part of a national Democratic initiative to make inclusions into Republican-dominated states in which federal lawmakers are holding few, if any, public meetings. 
Warren specifically addressed cuts to veterans programs and public education. 
“Public schools are the investment in our future,” Warren said. “They give millions of kids in America – all of our kids – an opportunity to grow, to learn, to live independently, an opportunity to support themselves, an opportunity to contribute to this country.”

Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell spoke to the crowd before Warren took the stage, as did state Sen. Charlane Oliver, a Nashville Democrat who represents the district in which the event was held. 
Oliver referenced anti-immigrant bills moving through the Tennessee legislature, including one that would challenge Plyler v. Doe, the 1982 Supreme Court ruling that states cannot deny public education to children without permanent legal status. 
“We are fighting for a nation of the future that includes all of us,” Oliver said. 
State Democratic lawmakers attending the Nashville event included, in addition to Oliver, Sen. Jeff Yarbro, Reps. Shaundelle Brooks, Yusuf Hakeem, Gloria Johnson, Justin Jones, Bo Mitchell and Gabby Salinas. 
“It’s rare to have a leader with a mind like mine here in Tennessee,” said Sharon Dean of Nashville, of her attendance at the Warren event.
Thousands of Tennesseans turned across the state — including in Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville and Chattanooga — to protest Trump’s and Musk’s sweeping cuts to federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE.) 
Threat of severe weather didn’t deter the approximately 1,500 rallygoers at Nashville’s Centennial Park, despite confusion after event organizers cancelled the protest Saturday morning because of weather concerns.
The “Hands Off!” rallies like the ones in Tennessee were held nationwide Saturday. Indivisible, a nonprofit group founded after Trump’s first election in 2016, was one of the primary organizers of the event. 
“The Tennessee Republican Party wants to send our prayers to all the Tennessee families that have experienced loss of both life and property since this significant weather event that has impacted most of our State over the last four days.  Yet, while most Tennesseans were dealing with the aftermath of the storms and flooding, the Democrat Party chose today to continue their election complaints against President Trump which the American people rejected at the ballot box a little over 4 months ago,” said Tennessee Republican Party Chair Scott Golden in a statement.
“Political dissent, without violence, is enshrined in the 1st amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Tennessee Democrats are welcomed to continue to rehash the issues of 2024 which led to the landslide victories for President Trump and the Republican Party. Anytime Senator Warren and her brand of liberalism comes to Tennessee it improves our chances for victory in 2026,” Golden’s statement said.

Experienced rally-goers called it the biggest Minnesota demonstration in memory.
“It’s just the way we’re being treated. I worry about the VA because it’s been my doctor my whole life and they’re cutting people left and right,” said Lon Michaelson, a veteran. “We need everybody out here.”

The rally was organized by Women’s March Minnesota, the MN 50501 group and Indivisible Twin Cities. An estimated 1,300 “Hands Off” rallies were held in all 50 states Saturday.

The demonstration drew veterans groups, LGBTQ organizations, teachers, rank-and-file union members, federal employees, advocates for immigrants and thousands more outraged at Trump’s legally dubious dismantling of the federal government; steep tariffs on allies and tiny countries alike; musings about displacing the entire population of Gaza; abandonment of Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression; threats to annex Canada and Greenland; attempted erasure of Black history; and cancellation of important environmental programs and protections. 
The timing of the rally was fortuitous, coming the day after a steep drop in the stock market after Trump announced tariffs, raising fears of a worldwide trade war and recession.

At the end of the rally, singers who had formed a group over the course of the demonstration led the crowd in a performance of Les Miserables song “Do You Hear the People Sing”.

Saint Paul mayor Melvin Carter spoke near the end of the rally. He quoted Dr. Martin Luther King saying “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice,” and responded “But it does not bend by itself. We must be the benders.”

(Jordan Hansen/Daily Montanan)The sound of horns bouncing off the buildings in downtown Billings could be heard blocks away.
For two hours, the horns’ drone, coupled with the sounds of cheering, protest songs and speakers filled the area around the Yellowstone County Courthouse lawn in what one television station called the largest crowd ever assembled there.
A similar scene played out Saturday on the Missoula County Courthouse lawn, and organizers of the local events said that 19 demonstrations throughout the Treasure State were taking place simultaneously.

In Billings, residents from Yellowstone and surrounding counties held signs and lined all sides of the North 27th Street corridor for several blocks as they participated in the “Hands off our Democracy” rally.
They protested the President Donald Trump administration, tariffs, and Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, as did rally-goers throughout the state and country, and thousands at the National Mall in Washington, D.C.
Rev. Angie Dornisch, the pastor at Hope United Methodist Church in Billings, spoke about the similarities of the political climate and the Easter season as protestors “high-fived” cars that slowed to give encouragement or show solidarity.
Some waved flags from the windows.
“The followers of Jesus must care for the foreigners and immigrants because Jesus was a foreigner in a different land,” Dornisch said. “Even in our tombs of despair and destruction, I have a message: Hope and love is alive. Darkness can be overwhelming, but it will not win. Resurrection is coming.”
Other mental health advocates urged people to find strength in each other, and to attend to personal mental health, especially when the news can be upsetting or confusing.
Union members said that the American promise was under attack, and urged solidarity and resistance.
“The American promise is if you work hard and play by the rules, you can live a decent life — we have to make that promise work,” said AFL-CIO member Bob Struckman. “Trump and his minions are breaking that promise, and we’re keeping it with the tools that we have in our democracy.”
Many of the speakers said that residents must continue to gather to support democracy, object to policies they don’t like, use the First Amendment to speak out, as well as use the power of the ballot.
“We live in the richest nation on earth, at the richest time in our history, so why are we so broke?” Struckman said.
  Even dogs got into the protest at the Hands Off Our Democracy” rally in Billings on April 5, 2025 (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan).
Lance Edward, the president of the Billings Education Association, which represents 1,200 teachers in the Billings Public Schools, is an English teacher and a football coach.
“The great strength in our nation is our diversity. I am not sure we can say that word anymore,” he said. “So I will yell it.”
Donna Veraldi of the Billings chapter of the League of Women Voters said their organization is concerned about the efforts to change the access to the ballot.
“When we take rights away from others, we lose those same rights for ourselves,” she said. “If ever there were a time to fight, it is now. Knowing how to fight does not mean we know how to win. Knowing how to fight is about knowing how to lose and still fighting.”
Kris Glenn of the Yellowstone Valley Citizens Council used a historical example from the Billings area to rally the crowd.
She spoke of when Billings, home to three large oil refineries, had among the worst air quality in the nation, until citizens stepped up to demand a change.
“Real change didn’t come from the top down, it came from the bottom up. That’s us, today,” she said.
She said she was concerned that a $1 million grant to Billings to plant more trees to help reduce climate change was at risk for being cut by the Trump administration.
“Hands off our communities, and hands off our future. Our elected leaders work for us, but only if we speak up,” Glenn said.



















































































































































































































































































































Gerald Kessler, a retired government teacher at Billings Senior High, said that his thoughts were with one person who wasn’t at the rally, his father.
“Eighty years ago, he was a medic in the U.S. Army. He was neither a sucker or a loser. He saw thousands of dead men. He would be appalled by what’s happening today because he fought against fascism,” he said.
Elizabeth Klarich, one of the co-leaders of Yellowstone Indivisible which organized the event, as well as a large rally last month in Billings, said that crowd represented a diverse background of every living generation, and an array of concerns.

“It’s not right or left here, but it’s right versus wrong, and we’re here to stand up,” she said.
In Missoula, the drumming at the demonstration reverberated at least a block and a half away from the Missoula County Courthouse, where by a couple of estimates, roughly 3,000 people gathered to protest Trump’s agenda — and point to different political priorities.
Mark Sanz of Missoula held a sign that said “Nobody Voted For Social INSecurity.”
He said the idea for the sign came from a friend who contributed to the program all her life and fears it’s now in jeopardy.
“They’ll start decreasing Society Security in the name of tax cuts for the rich,” Sanz said. “Same with Medicaid. That’s what’s coming.”
Dogs wore sandwich boards that said, “Dogs Against DOGE,” and people blew bubbles that floated into the sky, and they chanted, “Good trouble,” and “Hands off.”
The crowd also chanted for Sen. Bernie Sanders. The independent from Vermont and former Democratic presidential candidate has been on a “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, and the crowd chanted, “Bernie, Bernie, Bernie” at the news he will be in Missoula on April 16.
The rally kicked off with the crowd singing, “This Land Is Your Land,” and emcee Jim Sayer asked people to fist bump each other as a reminder of connection.
“We all are together in this. We all have to look out for each other,” Sayer said.
The Montana Legislature is in session in Helena, and some lawmakers are anticipating the possible need for a special session to address potential federal cuts that affect the state budget — including those who welcome a leaner budget.
  People of all ages participated in the “Hands off Our Democracy” rally at the Yellowstone County Courthouse lawn in Billings, Montana on April 5, 2025 (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan).
Already, Montana has seen effects of the federal cuts, from the announcement this week that Humanities Montana had lost its entire federal grant that supports programs in all 56 counties to earlier cuts of U.S. Forest Service workers.
On the courthouse lawn, one sign decorated with pine trees read, “Resistance Ranger! Protect Our Public Lands!!!” Another read, “Save America! Deport Musk,” and one said, “IKEA assembles better cabinets.”
The gathering at the courthouse was the largest at least in recent years, organized by Missoula Resists, Indivisible Missoula, and Stand Up, Fight Back. Speakers talked about the importance of Indigenous rights, health care, the planet, arts and reproductive rights.
“We are not willing to be overwhelmed or torn apart,” said Rose, with Missoula Resists (Rose declined to share her last name through an organizer). “I think we might be more (unwilling) now.”
Meredith Printz, with Indivisible Missoula, said the group is new, and it believes the Congressional delegation is failing to represent Montanans on Social Security, education, and the dismantling of government agencies by Musk.
As the demonstrators cheered for change and booed Trump and Musk, drivers honked as they rolled past the courthouse, and people in the crowd snapped pictures of each other and commented on the turnout.
“What an amazing day,” said one woman at the tail end of the gathering.
When Sayer said Trump had taken office just 76 days ago, the crowd booed, and Sayer said he had to remind them anyway.
He likened Trump’s approach in office to a “demolition derby,” and he told people it is a dark time in America, but it’s also springtime, and he read a quote from Alice Walker.
“As long as the earth can make a spring every year, I can,” Sayer said.

That was what U.S. Sen. Angus King told the thousands of people who gathered on Congress Street in Portland on Saturday to protest the administration of President Donald Trump.
According to organizers, 3,000 people attended the Portland rally, which was just one of more than 20 events held across Maine as part of national “Hands Off!” actions to demonstrate widespread opposition to the gutting of the federal government spearheaded by billionaire advisor Elon Musk.
The town mall in Brunswick, where over 500 people rallied, was a sea of homemade signs. Maine Senate President Mattie Daughtry, who represents the district, was among the crowd and noted it was one of the few times in her life she’s seen “this many people gathered for something like this.”
The message, she said, is “to listen to the people.”
“A lot of the signs that I saw were about ‘Hands off our Social Security,’ ‘Hands off our libraries,’ ‘Hands off our health care,’ I think what we’re saying is, you can’t completely unravel the fabric of our society without people noticing.”

Outside the Maine State House, another one thousand people gathered. 
One attendee, Angela, who only shared her first name, said she’d never been to a protest before but felt compelled to join because she’s concerned for her kids’ future. 
“This really impacts me a lot,” she said of the Trump administration. “This changed the narrative for me, for their future.”
Angela, who made a sign featuring Dr. Seuss’ Lorax, said she grew up visiting state and national parks. “I want to bring my kids to the parks, but the parks are going to close if there is no one there to staff it.”
She continued, “We don’t have enough trees as it is. They give us clean air, that’s how we get our clean air. And they want to take them all away.”
The demonstrations in Maine were organized by local grassroots groups and individuals, though the national day of action was spearheaded by a large coalition of unions and progressive organizations including 50501, AFL-CIO, Americans for Tax Fairness, Color of Change, Common Cause, Indivisible, League of Conservation Voters, League of Women Voters, MoveOn, Our Revolution, Patriotic Millionaires, SEIU, Third Act, Women’s March, and others.

“My angst is really about the millions of people who are hurting and will hurt because of his policies,” said Roni Wegner, with Indivisible 605, which helped organize the protest. “I don’t see how it’s going to help. There is no long-term plan.”

Another attendee, Reed Boysen, said, “This is not a left or right moment, this is a right or wrong moment.”
There were also protests in Pierre and Rapid City. The South Dakota chapter of the national 50501 Movement (50 protests, 50 states, one movement) was an organizer, saying that the protests were staged to “resist executive overreach, defend democracy, and oppose the harmful policies of Project 2025.” Conservative political groups wrote and published the Project 2025 plan as a roadmap to remake the federal government during Trump’s presidency.
The 50501 movement called on South Dakotans to “remove corrupt politicians from office,” “reverse the damage inflicted” and “reclaim our rights, our government and our future.”
Since Trump took office, he has moved rapidly with billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency to fire hundreds of thousands of federal workers, cut or freeze billions in federal government spending, eliminate the federal Department of Education and take other actions that drew protesters into the streets Saturday.

The gathering drew more than 500 people. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)More than 500 people descended on the steps of the Alabama State Capitol Saturday to protest the actions and policies of President Donald.
The “Hands Off” protest Saturday in Montgomery was one of six others planned in the state and more than 500 throughout the country in opposition to the administration’s wide-ranging attacks on federal agencies and departments, attempts to deport immigrants and efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, particularly for transgender Americans.
“Freedom is at stake, our constitution and our rights, the right to just exist,” said Annie Pearl Avery, a civil rights activist, in an interview following the event. “And we have a criminal and a crooked man in the White House. And his intention is to turn us back 150 years.”
Attendees sitting and standing on the steps of the Capitol held signs disparaging Trump and billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, which has thrown thousands of federal employees out of work. Others hoisted “Hands Off posters that pertained to Social Security, education and the economy in keeping with the theme of the event.
“Today, we are standing because we have issues of every kind,” said civil rights advocate Wanda Battle to the crowd. “Look around this place, we have every set of issues that can be imagined. Today, we are telling the Trump administration–hands off.”
Since taking office in January, Trump has issued several executive orders to dramatically reshape the operations of the federal agencies and alter public policy. Speakers focused on the administration’s attempted deportations of immigrants. Trump is attempting to use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport immigrants from Venezuela to a prison in El Salvador, claiming they were a threat to public safety because they belonged to a gang.
“The story is that these were undocumented Venezuelan men who were part of a criminal gang,” said Lynn Hopkins, a minister at the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Montgomery, in a speech to the crowd. “It didn’t take long to find out, and it surprised none of us, that they were not all gang members, they were not all undocumented, they were not all Venezuelan and, for God’s sake, they were not even all men.”
The crowd also criticized Trump’s efforts to abolish the U.S. Department of Education. In early March, the agency announced that it was reducing its workforce by about 1,300, going from 4,100 to almost 2,200 employees.
“We have a lot of rural communities who are impacted,” said Mary Gannon, who attended the protest in Montgomery while visiting from New Hampshire. “We have a lot of kids who are living in poverty, a lot of kids who are dealing with food insecurity. For me, right now, defunding the Department of Education is really a concern, but it is all connected.”
Trump and Musk also drew the ire of the crowd with their attempts to downsize the federal labor force in what they claim are attempts to streamline government. They expressed concerns about funding reductions to meet their basic needs, from Medicaid to Social Security.
Attendees also criticized attacks on marginalized populations.
“I have transgender kids and adults in my church who are terrified right now, who feel they are being made scapegoats, and are worried about getting the health care they need, and are looking to move because they find their government attacking them day after day with new ways to make them a target,” said Shane Isner, a senior minister at First Christian Church in Montgomery.

(Jason Kempin/Getty Images)The nation’s historically Black colleges and universities, known as HBCUs, are wondering how to survive in an uncertain and contentious educational climate as the Trump administration downsizes the scope and purpose of the U.S. Department of Education — while cutting away at federal funding for higher education.
In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing federal grants and loans, alarming HBCUs, where most students rely on Pell Grants or federal aid. The order was later rescinded, but ongoing cuts leave key support systems in political limbo, said Denise Smith, deputy director of higher education policy and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.
Leaders worry about Trump’s rollback of the Justice40 Initiative, a climate change program that relied on HBCUs to tackle environmental justice issues, she said. And there’s uncertainty around programs such as federal work-study and TRIO, which provides college access services to disadvantaged students.
“People are being mum because we’re starting to see a chilling effect,” Smith said. “There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.”

Most students at HBCUs rely on Pell Grants or other federal aid, and a fifth of Black college graduates matriculate from HBCUs. Other minority-serving institutions, known as MSIs, that focus on Hispanic and American Indian populations also heavily depend on federal aid.
“It’s still unclear what these cuts will mean for HBCUs and MSIs, even though they’re supposedly protected,” Smith said.
States may be unlikely to make up any potential federal funding cuts to their public HBCUs. And the schools already have been underfunded by states compared with predominantly white schools.










There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.


– Denise Smith, The Century Foundation


Congress created public, land-grant universities under the Morrill Act of 1862 to serve the country’s agricultural and industrial industries, providing 10 million acres taken from tribes and offering it for public universities such as Auburn and the University of Georgia. But Black students were excluded.
The 1890 Morrill Act required states to either integrate or establish separate land-grant institutions for Black students — leading to the creation of many HBCUs. These schools have since faced chronic underfunding compared with their majority-white counterparts.
‘None of them are equitable’
In 2020, the average endowment of white land-grant universities was $1.9 billion, compared with just $34 million for HBCUs, according to Forbes.
There are other HBCUs that don’t stem from the 1890 law, including well-known private schools such as Fisk University, Howard University, Morehouse College and Spelman College. But more than three-fourths of HBCU students attend public universities, meaning state lawmakers play a significant role in their funding and oversight.
Marybeth Gasman, an endowed chair in education and a distinguished professor at Rutgers University, isn’t impressed by what states have done for HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions so far. She said she isn’t sure there is a state model that can bridge the massive funding inequities for these institutions, even in states better known for their support.
“I don’t think North Carolina or Maryland have done a particularly good job at the state level. Nor have any of the other states. Students at HBCUs are funded at roughly 50-60% of what students at [predominately white institutions] are funded. That’s not right,” said Gasman.
“Most of the bipartisan support has come from the U.S. Congress and is the result of important work by HBCUs and affiliated organizations. I don’t know of a state model that works well, as none of them are equitable.”

Under federal law, states that accept federal land-grant funding are required to match every dollar with state funds.
But in 2023, the Biden administration sent letters to 16 governors warning them that their public Black land-grant institutions had been underfunded by more than $12 billion over three decades.
Tennessee State University alone had a $2.1 billion gap with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
At a February meeting hosted by the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, Tennessee State interim President Dwayne Tucker said the school is focused on asking lawmakers this year for money to keep the school running.
Otherwise, Tucker said at the time, the institution could run out of cash around April or May.
“That’s real money. That’s the money we should work on,” Tucker said, according to a video of the forum.
In some states, lawsuits to recoup long-standing underfunding have been one course of action.
In Maryland, a landmark $577 million legal settlement was reached in 2021 to address decades of underfunding at four public HBCUs.
In Georgia, three HBCU students sued the state in 2023 for underfunding of three HBCUs.
In Tennessee, a recent state report found Tennessee State University has been shortchanged roughly $150 million to $544 million over the past 100 years.
But Tucker said he thinks filing a lawsuit doesn’t make much sense for Tennessee State.
“There’s no account payable set up with the state of Tennessee to pay us $2.1 billion,” Tucker said at the February forum. “And if we want to make a conclusion about whether [that money] is real or not … you’re going to have to sue the state of Tennessee, and I don’t think that makes a whole lot of sense.”
Economic anchors
There are 102 HBCUs across 19 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands, though a large number of HBCUs are concentrated in the South.
Alabama has the most, with 14, and Pennsylvania has the farthest north HBCU.

Beyond education, HBCUs contribute roughly $15 billion annually to their local economies, generate more than 134,000 jobs and create $46.8 billion in career earnings, proving themselves to be economic anchors in under-resourced regions.
Homecoming events at HBCUs significantly bolster local economies, local studies show. North Carolina Central University’s homecoming contributes approximately $2.5 million to Durham’s economy annually.
Similarly, Hampton University’s 2024 homecoming was projected to inject around $3 million into the City of Hampton and the coastal Virginia region, spurred by increased visitor spending and retail sales. In Tallahassee, Florida A&M University’s 2024 homecoming week in October generated about $5.1 million from Sunday to Thursday.
Their significance is especially pronounced in Southern states — such as North Carolina, where HBCUs account for just 16% of four-year schools but serve 45% of the state’s Black undergraduate population.
Smith has been encouraged by what she’s seen in states such as Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee, which have a combined 20 HBCUs among them. Lawmakers have taken piecemeal steps to expand support for HBCUs through policy and funding, she noted.
Tennessee became the first state in 2018 to appoint a full-time statewide higher education official dedicated to HBCU success for institutions such as Fisk and Tennessee State. Meanwhile, North Carolina launched a bipartisan, bicameral HBCU Caucus in 2023 to advocate for its 10 HBCUs, known as the NC10, and spotlight their $1.7 billion annual economic impact.
“We created a bipartisan HBCU caucus because we needed people in both parties to understand these institutions’ importance. If you represent a district with an HBCU, you should be connected to it,” said North Carolina Democratic Sen. Gladys Robinson, an alum of private HBCU Bennett College and state HBCU North Carolina A&T State University.
“It took constant education — getting folks to come and see, talk about what was going on,” she recalled. “It’s like beating the drum constantly until you finally hear the beat.”

For Robinson, advocacy for HBCUs can be a tough task, especially when fellow lawmakers aren’t aware of the stories of these institutions. North Carolina A&T was among the 1890 land-grant universities historically undermatched in federal agricultural and extension funding.
The NC Promise Tuition Plan, launched in 2018, reduced in-state tuition to $500 per semester and out-of-state tuition to $2,500 per semester at a handful of schools that now include HBCUs Elizabeth City State University and Fayetteville State University; Western Carolina University, a Hispanic-serving institution; and UNC at Pembroke, founded in 1887 to serve American Indians.
Through conversations on the floor of the General Assembly, and with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, Robinson advocated to ensure Elizabeth City State — a struggling HBCU — was included, which helped revive enrollment and public investment.
“I’m hopeful because we’ve been here before,” Robinson said in an interview.
“These institutions were built out of churches and land by people who had nothing, just so we could be educated,” Robinson said. “We have people in powerful positions across the country. We have to use our strength and our voices. Alumni must step up.
“It’s tough, but not undoable.”
Meanwhile, other states are working to recognize certain colleges that offer significant support to Black college students. California last year passed a law creating a Black-serving Institution designation, the first such title in the country. Schools must have programs focused on Black achievement, retention and graduation rates, along with a five-year plan to improve them. Sacramento State is among the first receiving the designation.
And this session, California state Assemblymember Mike Gipson, a Democrat, introduced legislation that proposes a $75 million grant program to support Black and underserved students over five years through the Designation of California Black-Serving Institutions Grant Program. The bill was most recently referred to the Assembly’s appropriations committee.

Denise Baum was ecstatic following a 63-35 House vote on Saturday morning to move HB 848, creating the Big Sky Rail account, over to the Senate.
The Billings Democrat is carrying a bill that would, if passed, give a state appropriation to the Big Sky Passenger Rail Authority for the first time. The authority would receive $2 million annually until a sunset date on June 30, 2031.
“I’m extremely excited,” Baum said Saturday morning. “This is such a truly momentous piece of legislation, building out infrastructure and just having people understand that the infrastructure is already there.”
If passed, the bill would support planning, outreach and organizational work. It would also help local governments apply for larger grants and help the Big Sky Passenger Rail Authority decide which places passenger rail would stop at.
The money is not going toward large capital projects or building new railroads. 
The bill got support in the Energy, Technology and Federal Relations Committee hearing from the Montana Economic Developers Association, the Missoula Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO and various local elected officials from across the state.
It also had some bipartisan support on the House floor. Rep. Ed Byrne, R-Bigfork, and Rep. Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings both urged a pass on the legislation on the floor.
“When you have issues such as this that are so extremely impactful to Montanans across the state … political party lines blur,” Baum said.
The fiscal impact led to some opposition. Rep. Neil Duram, R-Eureka, and Rep. Tom Millett, R-Marion, both spoke against the legislation, with Millett bemoaning the Legislature for spending money “like a drunken sailor.”
Two routes through Montana were selected as “preferred routes” in the Amtrak Daily Long-Distance Service Study. It was a federal nod from the Federal Railroad Administration that the routes were viable.
Much of the rail lines are already in use for freight cargo, and proponents of the bill have said repeatedly passenger rail and freight can coexist. 
The money comes from a railroad tax fund, which has been looked at as a funding source for several bills this session. House Bill 103, brought by Rep. Zolnikov, would have created funding for railroad inspections and was looking to use funding from the railroad tax fund. The bill was tabled in committee and Baum said it “unfortunately” went down.
The Legislative Services Division released a letter on that bill, which included an estimate of railroad tax revenue — about $4 million per year. The money previously went to the general fund.

Not only that, but Ballman was “more than willing to send us more information in the future,” wrote one Border Patrol agent in an email, passing along the addresses from Ballman of the three targets of immigration enforcement weeks into President Donald Trump’s second term. 
Two of the three people were ordered to be deported, according to Matt Phelps with the Border Patrol’s Targeting and Intelligence Division. 
None had been actively committing a crime, and it’d been two years since one of the three had been arrested. 
“I want to thank you for providing the information,” Phelps wrote to Ballman. “If you or any of your LEO partners have information on individuals you have encountered or encounter in the future that you suspect may be illegally present in the US, feel free to send me that information and I will research them to determine if they are valid targets for enforcement.”
Ballman responded: “good to hear. I’ll pass on your info to the rest of our patrol division. We have lots of work for you guys.”
The emails, among a trove obtained by InvestigateWest in a public records request, provide a window into the level of coordination between federal immigration authorities and the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office in North Idaho. As the federal push to deport undocumented immigrants proceeds — and as state and local agencies take different paths on how, or whether, to assist — Kootenai County has been particularly willing to join in the deportation effort.
Sheriff Bob Norris, who represents one of the more conservative counties in a state where two-thirds of voters cast ballots for Trump, has announced that he would use all of his department’s resources to help with deportations. The county jail has taken in 72 people on immigration holds, including many arrested by the Border Patrol across in neighboring Washington, where state law prohibits using jails for immigration offenses.
Since taking office, Trump has encouraged local and state law enforcement agencies to collaborate with federal immigration agents to help with deportation efforts, and several states now have agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to assist in immigration enforcement. Norris has been eager to help, regardless of whether an undocumented person has committed a state crime. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that immigration enforcement is the sole duty of the federal government and local police may assist under federal direction. Immigration lawyers and immigrant advocates warn that close collaboration between local police and federal immigration agents could undermine the main goal of state and local law enforcement, which is to deter and solve crimes.
“If somebody is undocumented and they’ve experienced a very serious crime, or seen a very serious crime, they may not be willing to come forward about that if the reality is that they would be then reported to ICE for immigration enforcement,” said Geoffrey Heeren, law professor and director of the Immigration Litigation and Appellate Clinic at the University of Idaho. 
When asked if the fear of deportation could deter victims and witnesses of crimes from reporting them and impede law enforcement, Kootenai County Lt. Jeff Howard said “it can” and didn’t elaborate.
“We’re not going to hide people who are accused of a crime one way or another,” Howard told InvestigateWest.  
The “crime” he referred to was being present in the U.S. without authorization, a federal civil offense not typically enforced by local authorities. 
“If you’re in the country illegally,” Howard said, “we’re going to notify Border Patrol.” 
‘Idaho encourages cooperation’ 
InvestigateWest reviewed a month of emails between Kootenai County deputies and federal immigration agents to understand how communication and immigration enforcement may have changed since the election. There were 393 emails between the two agencies from Jan. 1, 2025,  to Feb. 4, 2025, that show a close level of coordination between the two agencies.
In one message, Border Patrol agents asked deputies about a man from Zimbabwe with an Idaho driver’s license in the jail. In another, a Border Patrol agent offered deputies “informal training” to look for signs of “the presence of criminal aliens” and to “provide real time feedback and record checks for possible … suspects without having to go through a lengthy process from another federal agency.” 
Edward Dean, a spokesperson for the U.S. Border Patrol’s Spokane Sector, first told InvestigateWest that the agency doesn’t typically do informal or formal training with law enforcement. After he was shown the email, he shifted his stance and said the Spokane Sector “encourages” ad hoc, informal training and intelligence sharing in ride-alongs and informal meetings. 
“Not surprised this is happening,” Alycia Moss, a Coeur d’Alene immigration attorney, said in an email after reviewing some of the correspondence. “Idaho is a state that encourages cooperation with ICE and (Border Patrol) and likely will continue to.”
The emails mostly include Border Patrol agents notifying the Kootenai County jail when they’ve arrested someone and planned to place them in the jail with an immigration hold. 
Border Patrol agents have placed 72 immigration holds on individuals in the jail since the beginning of the year. This is an increase since before Trump took office, Moss said. 
“Once Trump became president, there was a significant uptick in Border Patrol holds in the Kootenai County jail,” Moss said. “So before, you’d see maybe a couple, and now you’re seeing more like a couple handfuls.” 
Norris has focused heavily on immigration since he became Kootenai County sheriff in 2020, after retiring from the Los Angeles Police Department. In public statements, he has associated Spanish-speakers with being “illegal,” said deputies would assist in deporting any noncitizens who are in the country illegally even without criminal backgrounds and suggested they all “self-deport.” 
“Criminals and illegal aliens be aware Kootenai County is a Sanctuary County for all Law-Abiding citizens of the United States who are here legally,” Norris said in a news release in February. 
In the same statement, he said deputies and Border Patrol agents would be working “in tandem” and “in the same vehicle at times.” 
Norris also made headlines in 2023 for removing library books from a public library and refusing to return them because he thought they were “disturbing.” Most recently, he threatened to arrest a woman who was protesting inside a legislative town hall and stood by while private security dragged her out of the venue. 
The sheriff’s stance on immigrants has trickled down to his deputies, the emails show. A deputy also reached out to ICE to ask about participating in the federal 287(g) program, which is a program with ICE where local police can engage in some immigration enforcement. 
“We already cooperate with you by housing inmates, but want to become a more involved partner,” wrote Kootenai County sheriff’s Capt. Jeremy Hyle. 
Kootenai County doesn’t have any formal agreements with ICE or Border Patrol, but the sheriff’s office follows the informal guidance of the National Sheriffs’ Association. In an email to sheriffs across the country, obtained by InvestigateWest, the association wrote at the end of February that ICE had logged around 700,000 civil arrest warrants for illegal entry. 
“As a result, during everyday policing activities, your personnel may encounter someone who has an ICE administrative warrant now entered into this system,” Jonathan Thompson, executive director of the National Sheriffs’ Association, wrote in the email.
He explained in the email that agencies without a 287(g) agreement could not arrest people on the ICE warrants themselves, but said they can detain them if they are arrested on suspicion of a state crime. If no crime is suspected, Thompson wrote that police should contact ICE and request that federal agents come arrest the person. If ICE agents can’t make it, he wrote, “your only real option is to collect as much information from the person as you can and release the person and ICE will have to try to find them through their fugitive operations.” 
Just three Idaho counties have 287(g) agreements with ICE: Gooding, Power and Owyhee counties. Only Owyhee County has an agreement under the task force model where officers can perform immigration enforcement. 
The Trump administration in January issued an executive order to encourage widespread 287(g) agreements between local law enforcement and ICE. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered all law enforcement agencies to enter the agreements. 
Idaho Gov. Brad Little issued an executive order in February that ordered all law enforcement agencies to consider entering 287(g) agreements with ICE. He also said “to the maximum extent possible permitted by law, state agencies shall continue collaborating with ICE” to focus on deporting undocumented people “with criminal records who pose a threat to public safety.” 
In states like Idaho that encourage information sharing with federal immigration agents, it isn’t illegal to share the immigration status of a person if it comes out during investigation of a state crime, but without a 287(g) agreement, it is illegal to serve federal immigration warrants and investigate people’s immigration statuses as local law enforcement. 
“Typically, state and local officers are not supposed to be enforcing immigration law, because that’s an exclusively federal arena, with some exceptions, so if they are going out and enforcing immigration law and investigating immigration violations without a formal agreement with the federal government to do so, that would be problematic,” said Heeren, the Idaho law professor.
Howard said typically when deputies are investigating a crime, they will ask for a person’s passport or other citizenship documentation. If deputies find out they are not U.S. citizens, they will contact Border Patrol agents.
“To see if (Border Patrol has) them in their system, and if they do, and it is somebody who crossed the border and they’re not supposed to be there, then they usually come out (and arrest them),” Howard said.
‘Not the worst of the worst’
Ballman did not appear to be investigating a state crime before giving federal officials the names of the three individuals who he thought were in the country illegally. No incident report was taken, records show. Yet legal experts say that by law, there would have had to be suspicion of a state crime having been committed, since the department doesn’t have the authority to carry out immigration enforcement without a 287(g) program.
“Based on the correspondence with the deputy, it appears he saw the potential for the need for Border Patrol to get involved,” Howard said. He said he didn’t know how the individuals were contacted by Ballman and didn’t respond to questions about the legality of turning them over to the Border Patrol.
But if there was no crime being investigated, it is unclear why Ballman suspected the three people were in the country illegally. Two lawyers who reviewed the correspondence with Ballman and federal agents said it could be illegal and at least questionable based on how he came under the suspicion that the individuals were in the country illegally. 
Moss said if he knew about the people’s immigration status through a law enforcement investigation, he can share that information with federal agents, but it would be improper to obtain and share their immigration status without an investigation for a state crime. 
Heeren agreed. He said police should not be suspecting people or monitoring people based on their perceived national origin. Officers are not allowed to target people for crimes based on their race or ethnicity.
“There are also problems with police officers engaging in warrantless surveillance of people if they don’t have reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed,” Heeren said. 
Across the Idaho border with Washington, unauthorized immigrants are protected by state law from being subjected to questions about their immigration statuses by local law enforcement. Washington state law prohibits state and local law officers from enforcing federal immigration law and from sharing non-publicly available personal information with federal immigration authorities in any noncriminal matter. Idaho has no such law. All local jails accept immigration detainees for ICE and Border Patrol. 
Little signed a bill March 27 that would make illegal immigration a state crime and would allow law enforcement to ask about someone’s immigration status if they were arrested for a separate crime. The law was immediately blocked by an Idaho district court judge after the ACLU of Idaho filed a lawsuit against it.
The cross-border clash in approaches stands as an example of the local impact of an expanded network of deportation efforts encouraged and created under the Trump administration.
“We’re seeing the administration rapidly laying the groundwork to expand mass deportation into many branches of government that had previously been detached from immigration functions,” said Jennyfer Mesa, executive director of Latinos en Spokane, a nonprofit dedicated to immigrant rights in Spokane. “We’re now seeing state and local authorities that are conducting immigration enforcement, and there’s more federal agents within Washington.”
On March 25, ICE arrested a longtime farmworker and union activist, Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez, in Sedro-Woolley. The Seattle Times wrote that ICE hadn’t responded to questions about why he was arrested, but is a Mexican citizen and was ordered to return there. His peers told the newspaper they worried he was arrested for his activism.
“We are seeing this time and time again,” Mesa said. “It’s not the worst of the worst getting arrested. It’s workers.”

But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.
“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system
In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”
