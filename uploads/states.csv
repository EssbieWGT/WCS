(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)If South Dakota is awarded the $1 billion it’s seeking from a new federal rural health fund, half of that money will be used to modernize telehealth and data-sharing efforts.
All 50 states applied to the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. Congress included it in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in response to concerns that the bill’s Medicaid cuts will hurt rural health providers. Medicaid is a federal-state program that provides health insurance for people with disabilities or low incomes. 
According to KFF, federal Medicaid spending in rural areas in South Dakota over the next decade will decrease by a projected $487 million, due largely to new work requirements in the federal law that will cause some people to lose coverage.
Half of the Rural Health Transformation Program — $25 billion — will be distributed equally to states with approved applications, regardless of each state’s proportion of rural hospitals or population. That means South Dakota will receive at least $500 million, if approved.
States hope to use rural health money to keep doctors, combat chronic disease

The remaining half will be allocated based on the number of rural residents and rural health facilities in a state, as well as the state’s spending plans and policies, among other factors. Applications will be approved by the end of the year.
A key component of South Dakota’s application is a $500 million health infrastructure modernization proposal, which would include creation of a “South Dakota Health Data Atlas.” It would allow health care systems throughout the state to access health data in one “single, accessible platform.” The atlas would address telecommunications needs, equipment, emergency preparedness and cybersecurity concerns.
“The Rural Data Atlas will enable outcome tracking at the community level, allowing providers and health departments to identify gaps, target interventions and measure impact,” the proposal said. 
The modernization effort, including grants for providers, would expand health providers’ use of electronic health records and telehealth platforms in the state.
About 77% of the state’s critical access hospitals are in eastern South Dakota, with western communities facing up to 120 miles one-way to reach care. Because of that, the application focuses heavily on regionalization, prevention, and technology and self-monitoring efforts.
In addition to the modernization effort, South Dakota’s application includes the following proposals.
Sustainability grants
$125 million to fund grants incentivizing South Dakota health care providers to explore regional assessments and partnerships to “strengthen coordination and sustainability.” Providers could also use the grants to improve professional and management services that could impact a facility’s bottom line.
Such partnerships will “drive sustainable improvements” and “allow hospitals and clinics to coordinate services, offer complementary care, and achieve measurable quality gains and strengthen financial stability,” the proposal said.
Emergency Medical Services regionalization
$64 million to incentivize the creation of regional emergency medical service hubs to reduce response times and offer professional development and improved technology. The state has already dedicated millions of dollars toward technology upgrades for emergency medical services, and issued a report on emergency medical service sustainability recommendations in recent years.
South Dakota officials hope funding for the effort will improve emergency response times and increase the emergency medical services workforce by 15% over the next two years.
New Medicaid payment model
$62.6 million to support a new Medicaid payment model that would provide more predictable revenue to health care systems, reward quality and allow facilities to maintain comprehensive services in rural areas of the state.
Recruit rural health professionals
$62.5 million to provide recruitment incentives, such as sign-on bonuses, relocation assistance and rural service stipends, to remove barriers and make rural health care positions more competitive. The program would include five-year sign-on commitments for the incentives and expand apprenticeship programs. State officials hope to recruit 500 rural professionals by 2030.
Certified community behavioral health clinics
South Dakota does not have any certified community behavioral health clinics in the state, which provide mental health and substance use services to anyone who seeks them, regardless of insurance or their ability to pay. 
Using $56.4 million, the state would establish at least one health clinic in each of the state’s behavioral health regions to improve access to care statewide. The initiative would also establish one mobile crisis team and one crisis stabilization facility per region to reduce emergency room visits and jail holds.
Chronic disease management
$45 million to improve chronic disease management across the state. That would include funding rural health care providers, pharmacies and schools to implement chronic disease management and interventions. It would also include improving remote patient monitoring technology use, such as implementing a blood pressure monitoring program and management workshops throughout the state, and offering more resources and support to caregivers in the state.
Establish regional maternal and infant health hubs
$24 million to analyze maternal health gaps — service shortages, social services and supports, workforce needs, and regulatory and payment barriers — and then fund three health care entities to create regional maternal health hubs. The hubs would use a combination of telehealth and remote monitoring technologies in addition to in-person visits to address transportation and accessibility issues in rural and tribal areas of the state.
Create a health care training and resource hub
$4.7 million to provide physicians, nurses, community health workers, emergency medical service providers, doulas and other health care workers with online training and events. Some training would be specific to rural needs — including behavioral health, telehealth, chronic disease prevention, and maternal and child health.
Strengthen community health worker numbers
$3.5 million to support the growth of community health workers in the state’s health care system, including helping with Medicaid claims and creating Medicare billing pathways for the providers. South Dakota has 180 certified community health workers, who help patients navigate health care systems due to language or cultural barriers, and the state hopes to increase that to 300 by 2030.

(By Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)This story will be updated. 
Democrat Jordan Wood has switched from running to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins to instead vie for Democrat U.S. Rep. Jared Golden’s now-open seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
After Golden announced he would not be seeking reelection last week, Wood confirmed to Maine Morning Star on Wednesday that he will instead run in that election. Wood, a former congressional aide who spent about a decade working in politics in Washington, D.C., currently lives in Bristol, which is not located in the 2nd Congressional District he’s now running to represent. He grew up in CD2, in Lewiston and Gardiner. 
On the Democratic side, Wood joins Maine State Auditor Matt Dunlap, who had launched a primary bid against Golden before the representative left the race. Little-known Louis Sigel, a former secretary for the Kennebec County Democratic Committee, is also running. Former Gov. Paul LePage is expected to be the Republican nominee, with no others yet running in that primary.
As a candidate for Senate, Wood had been campaigning across the state pitching himself as the one to replace Collins, but he did not garner nearly as much attention as Graham Platner, the oyster farmer and military veteran who made a splashy campaign launch in August. Wood called for Platner to drop out after reporting revealed controversial comments he’d made on Reddit in the past and his now-covered tattoo that resembled a Nazi symbol. 
Before returning to Maine in 2021, Wood had worked as chief of staff to former Democratic U.S. Rep. Katie Porter of California. He co-founded and previously served as executive director of democracyFIRST, a pro-democracy organization dedicated to combating growing threats to the free and fair administration and certification of elections. Wood also previously served as vice president of End Citizens United, a political action committee working to reverse the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. Federal Election Campaign Act.

The Tower Hill Hillers defeated the St. Mark’s Spartans, 3-0, November 10, to earn their third state championship title in the last four years. 
 
NEWARK — Tower Hill was a point away from earning its second consecutive state championship as the ball crossed over the net and onto the Hillers’ side of the court. Through the final moments of set three, Tower Hill seemed focused on getting the ball to the left side of its attack. The side where junior Sydney Fischer resided.  
The final play of the Hillers’ victory started with a pass from senior Lily Leung to setter Parker Lewicki who set up Fischer drifting from the far left toward the middle of the court. Fischer leaped and swung her right arm hitting the ball with a fury that resulted in her 15th and final kill of the game, along with a state championship trophy. 
Fischer scored three of the Hillers’ final five points in their 25-21 third set victory helping Tower Hill defeat St. Mark’s, 3-0, at the Bob Carpenter Center, Monday night.
“I just kind of like remember, like, this is what all the work’s for. This is what I’ve been working towards all season and it’s just like that adrenaline rush,” Fischer said postgame of her closing performance. “[It’s a] do it for your team kind of thing, like play for something bigger.”
Fischer and sophomore Cadence Davis were a dynamic duo on the outside pacing the team with 15 kills each in the championship match, but it was the play of the Hillers’ middles that provided the duo with significant support. The middle trio of Danielle Soleye, Kennedy Haskins and Madison Squire combined for 14 kills scoring points off quick tips at the middle of the net.  
“That’s what we talked about the whole time. We talked about support not just being words of support, but actions of support where, you know, we’re making good decisions,” Tower Hill head coach Michael Sachs said postgame. “Those things are huge, and I think because they look at it as supporting their teammates, I think they focus on it more and were really successful.” 
The Hillers were successful all season winning all but one regular season game. The lone loss was to Garnet Valley High School in Pennsylvania. Against in-state competition Tower Hill was undefeated. The team carried their strong regular season performance into the postseason sweeping every opponent they faced. 
The Spartans provided a strong challenge for the Hillers in the championship game never trailing by more than six points in any set. Sachs complimented the Spartans ability to execute their system and the abilities of the Spartans’ middles to attack their defense with tips.
“Their middles do a really nice job tipping,” said Sachs. “We were preparing for those tips and they still scored a lot with us on those tips, but that was a lot of what it was, was they just did their system well.”
Following the game, Sachs said the championship win was a fulfilling experience because of the players ability to step up and embrace new roles before and during the season. The ability for the team to come together was aided by veteran leaders like libero Lily Leung whose experience helped ease the transition for her younger teammates.
“I think that really being there for your team and like telling them that ‘Hey, I’ve been there too, everyone has been through that’ just really helps out and allows everyone to come together,” Leung said.
As for what she’ll remember from this championship season …

Gratz for Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers are exploring “enhanced security measures” at the state Capitol ahead of the next legislative session set for January.
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, chair of the Nebraska Legislature’s Executive Board, announced the latest effort in a Wednesday press release. Hansen said the move was prompted by “recent acts of political violence in nearby states and across the country” but listed no specific incidents motivating the decision.

Just this year, there have been multiple incidents of violence against state lawmakers across the U.S., including a fatal shooting of a Minnesota legislator, and a fire-bombing at the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion.
“The state Capitol is the people’s house,” Hansen said in the release. “We are dedicated to ensuring that all Nebraskans can enjoy it safely and participate fully in our political process.”
Nebraska’s Capitol is secured by in-house security officers through the Nebraska State Patrol, as well as cameras throughout the building. Hansen did not specify what other measures the Legislature is interested in implementing.
Other government buildings in Nebraska, including courthouses and local government offices, use metal detectors and offer fewer public entrances compared to the Capitol.
Hansen said the Legislature has been working with Capitol security and the other two branches of Nebraska state government also housed in the Capitol to determine what additional security measures are warranted.
Those conversations are ongoing, he said.
Hansen’s press release did not specify the estimated cost of such security measures. Budget constraints are poised to be a large focus of the 2026 session, as lawmakers are tasked with filling a projected budget hole that currently stands at an estimated $451 million.
Although any building-wide security changes approved by lawmakers during the 2026 session would not be implemented until at least 2027, Hansen said, the Legislature may take independent steps to enhance the security of legislative proceedings before then.
Hansen said the public should be prepared for possible security-related changes to legislative procedures in the upcoming session, scheduled to begin Jan. 7.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Legislators illegally gave themselves a pay raise this year, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in an order that strikes both their normal allowance and the hike.
Through a clause in the state budget, legislators would have received a raise of $18,000 annually through their so-called “in-district compensation,” which is meant to cover expenses outside of the Statehouse. The state Supreme Court paused those payments over the summer, before they began, as it considered the lawsuit.
Not only will legislators not get the raise, but they will take a pay cut, since the order strikes down the same budget clause that has given legislators $12,000 each year for in-district costs since 1994.
Justices question the meaning of ‘per diem’ in case over SC legislators raising own pay

“No matter how well-intentioned or long-overdue, the result of the 126th General Assembly’s increase in in-district compensation without either limiting language in the proviso or delaying implementation of the increase to the seating of the 127th General Assembly is to increase its own compensation, which our state constitution expressly prohibits,” the opinion reads.
All five justices signed onto the eight-page order.
The state constitution makes it clear that legislators can’t raise their own salary, justices wrote. Instead, any salary increase must go into effect after an election, in this case at least January 2027.
The constitution says nothing about reimbursements to cover official expenses. But the budget clause included nothing limiting how legislators could spend the funds, which are separate from the $10,400 annual salary legislators receive.
In passing the budget clause, senators argued they needed a raise to keep up with inflation causing other expenses to rise. Justices wrote that legislators have every right to increase the amount they can receive to reimburse official costs but added the clause didn’t do that.
“It cannot be denied that, over the past century, legislative service has evolved considerably from what it once was, essentially requiring year-round service both in and outside of the legislative session,” the opinion reads. “The increased demands of modern legislative service naturally could lead the General Assembly to appropriate a greater amount of public funds to reimburse legislators for official expenses incurred in carrying out their official duties.”
Sen. Wes Climer, a Rock Hill Republican, filed the lawsuit soon after the legislative session ended. He was one of 44 Republicans to opt out of the raise.
“I think this shows that Sen. Climer showed tremendous courage in bringing this lawsuit and held his fellow legislators’ feet to the fire on this obviously illegal act,” his attorney and former Sen. Dick Harpootlian said.

(Photo by Rachel Mipro/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas turned in a 60-page application last week in hopes of receiving a share of  $50 billion in federal money designed to transform rural health. 
Nearly one-third of Kansans live in rural communities, and the state’s Rural Health Transformation Plan aims to improve health in those areas. 
Federal government officials originally touted the $50 billion as support for rural hospitals that are set to lose billions of dollars after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act cut Medicaid and other federal health spending. But the program evolved into a more general focus on rural health.
The Kansas plan was developed in two months after the federal government set a tight timeline for submissions to receive a portion of $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. 
Of that amount, $25 billion will be distributed evenly among the states selected and the remaining $25 billion will be allocated based on submitted plans, said Kate Sapra, deputy secretary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Office of Rural Health Transformation. The money will be paid out over five budget periods, from federal fiscal year 2026 through federal fiscal year 2030. 
Sapra spoke at a September meeting to the team Gov. Laura Kelly appointed to develop the Kansas application, called the Kansas Rural Health Innovation Alliance. The coalition of government, nonprofit and private organizations, including the Kansas Hospital Association, the Association of Community Mental Health Centers of Kansas and the Kansas Association of Local Health Departments.
The Kansas plan focuses on improving health delivery systems, encouraging innovative care models and using innovative technologies, according to the 60-page application submitted last week.
Martie Ross, director of PYA Center for Rural Health Advancement, Overland Park, told the group at its October meeting that they had condensed a yearlong process into six weeks. 
“If I had a piece of advice for Congress, … I would have said please give us at least six months and some funds to develop this application so it’s truly reflective of state needs,” she said. “Instead we have a very short timeframe to submit the final application.” 
Ross outlined complexities of the application process and what would happen between the Nov. 5 deadline to turn it in and the federal government’s Dec. 31 deadline to award the dollars. She said the program is not a grant, but a cooperative agreement. 
“It is a negotiation between CMS and the state as to what will be within the transformation plan and what will come out,” she said. They “certainly appreciate CMS is balancing the demands of 50 applications. Our application does not stand alone on its merits. It always will stand in comparison to other applications.” 
 
The plan
In Kansas’ application, the coalition focused on the following priorities, outlined in a news release from Kelly: 

Expand prevention programs to reduce chronic disease rates, including increasing access to preventive screenings and behavioral health services.
Increase local access to primary care for rural Kansans
Build a sustainable rural health workforce to support greater access to primary care, dental and behavioral health providers and to ease health shortages. 
Increase to 100% the number of rural Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in accountable care relationships by 2031.
Use data and technology to help rural providers expand telehealth, remote monitoring and other technologies, as well as support data sharing and analysis of aggregated patient and outcome data.

Metrics are attached to each part of the plan and Ross said that if the state isn’t meeting its metrics at different points during the five-year process, CMS can withhold funds. That money would then be redistributed to states doing better, and Ross said it is important that Kansas tracks its progress well. 
The cost of collecting and tracking data is included in the administrative plan, she said. 
The proposal includes a breakdown of each of the main areas with specifics, such as embedding behavioral health providers into rural hospitals to provide services and expand access to PACE, a health care option for older Kansans who meet certain criteria. 
“At present, 34% of PACE-eligible Kansans (about 4,300 rural residents) do not have access to a PACE program,” the application said. “The state will partner with two successful PACE providers in the state to expand program availability in rural areas, one by expanding an existing program and another by establishing a new one.”
 
Political input
Kansas Republicans wanted to have input on the Rural Health Transformation Plan during a special session, but they were unable to get enough Republicans to sign a petition to hold the session. In a news release, House Speaker Dan Hawkins lamented the situation. 
“Whatever rural healthcare dollars that Santa Kelly gifts to her favored ‘children’ around the state won’t be able to be returned,” he said. “Those who refused to sign a petition played right into the Governor’s hands by giving her free rein without oversight on hundreds of millions of dollars. Sad.”
The main reason for the session was redistricting Kansas’ congressional districts, but several GOP lawmakers resisted the move.
The state’s federal delegation, led by U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, wrote a letter in support of the Kansas plan. Others signing on included U.S. representatives Tracey Mann, Derek Schmidt, Ron Estes and Sharice Davids. 
“Rural health care providers across Kansas recognize the urgent need for transformation,” the delegation wrote. “Yet, with many providers operating under persistent negative margins, they face significant barriers to making the critical investments necessary for regional collaboration, clinical integration, and modern technology solutions.”
The lawmakers said the Kansas plan will empower rural care providers and support initiatives to improve rural health.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/P5162163-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-12 09:56:36.922742

Dale Romans, a longtime Louisville trainer who has had numerous horses start the Kentucky Derby, announced his candidacy Wednesday morning. A press release from his campaign said he was joining the race “to stand up for working people across the state and fix the challenges facing our country like harmful tariffs and dangerous health care cuts – instead of waging exhausting partisan fights that get us nowhere and only divide the nation.” 
A campaign video from Romans focuses on his horse training experience and his relationship with his family. 
“I’ve been in Kentucky my entire life, and I think I know what Kentucky needs in Washington — an independent Democrat that can go to Washington, D.C., and vote for what’s right for the people of Kentucky,” Romans says in the video. 
Romans argues in the video that he would be someone not beholden to the Democratic Party and not a “puppet” for President Donald Trump, like a “Republican freshman senator would have to be.” 
Romans joins a crowded field of U.S. Senate candidates hoping to succeed longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell who is not seeking reelection in 2026.

Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen prepare for a press conference following a vote on Capitol Hill on Nov. 9, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images)I spend as little time as possible thinking about the game of politics, but the gambit was doomed from the beginning.
For the better part of a year, Democrats had been stumbling around in search of a hill to die on but couldn’t commit as a party. How do you pick just one thing to save from a democracy on fire? But by the end of September, they had firmly settled on the expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits as a deserving place for their big stand. 
Millions would suffer, financially and bodily, without the health care subsidies, congressional Democrats argued, and so as costly as a government shutdown would be for the nation the Republicans had left them with no choice. This would be the GOP’s government shutdown, not theirs, they said. But the truth is that it was always the Democrats’ shutdown, which became clear this week when it took just eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus — including New Hampshire’s own Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan — to bring it to an end. And what did they come away with for their record-setting efforts, other than relief from the pain of the shutdown itself? A vow from Senate Republicans that there would be a December vote on extending the tax credits.
In a statement Sunday far more defiant than contrite, Hassan said, “Congress has one month to engage in serious, bipartisan negotiations to extend the Affordable Care Act’s expiring tax cuts for health insurance.” Meanwhile, a clear-eyed Senate colleague, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, said, “Even if it got 100 votes in the Senate, it’s not going to go anywhere in the House and the president certainly would not sign it.”
Only one of those statements is delusional, and yet it’s the one that carried the day. The Charlie Brown-ing of the Democratic Party continues.
The aftermath of Democrats’ “never mind” moment, meanwhile, has been equally predictable: Shaheen, Hassan, and the rest of the sacrificial octet have hit the airwaves to tell their side of things and offer political cover to any and all who desire it. With a wink and nod, friends, family, and colleagues have been invited to publicly feel all of their feelings of disappointment, but only in an “I’m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here” kind of way.
If that sounds cynical, I really don’t mean to. That’s the game within the game, and always has been. The problem for Democrats is that they’re the only ones still playing.
The most important and fundamental question a society can ask itself is, “What do we owe to each other?” Traditionally, the Republican response has been “nothing” — especially when it comes to civil rights, economic equality, and a social safety net — while the Democratic role has been to clamor for some flavor of “everything.” The idea, at least theoretically, was that policy could never land on “nothing” or “everything” but rather in some amorphous middle that reflected both the ruling party’s power in the moment and the public’s appetite (or lack thereof) for progress. 
Republicans didn’t really mean we owe each other nothing any more than Democrats believed we owe each other everything, and those performances helped create the illusion of stability in the center.
But now when congressional Republicans answer “nothing,” that’s precisely what they mean. No harbor, no help, no empathy, no truth. By all appearances, Democrats seem to be waiting in vain for a return to rules they recognize — and a counteroffer that isn’t coming.
That’s why the gambit was doomed from the jump. Did Democrats really believe that Republicans in the era of Donald Trump, who above all want a government so small that it’s functionally non-existent, would fold during a soft launch of their ultimate fantasy?
On the other hand, if Democrats knew Republicans wouldn’t fold, 40-plus days of pain seems like an awfully steep price to pay just for increased public awareness of how bad things will get due to the expiring tax credits. Especially when the party of “nothing means nothing” has a thousand more manufactured crises waiting in the queue to help a reeling electorate forget the details of their broad misery.
Shaheen said she took her stand for the people and ended it for the same, applying the highest principle of public service to both her defiance and her capitulation. But in the end, nobody was served. We don’t ask our leaders to take us to the fringes of discomfort and suffering only to retreat. We ask them to lead us up to and through the pain, and only after they have clearly explained the purpose and likely cost of the full sacrifice.
Nobody thinks it’s easy to be a Democrat in Washington these days, and I wouldn’t dream of criticizing a politician for choosing empathy in this cruel age. But the only thing you accomplish with a half-hearted and ultimately empty stand is the dissipation of hope, in all its modern scarcity.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shaheenhassan-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 09:56:36.922742

Wes Moore (D) is is setting up a campaign slate to back Democratic candidates — potentially primary challengers to incumbent lawmakers — who will support his agenda in Annapolis.  (File photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s Democratic governor is looking for a few Moore lawmakers.
Wes Moore, the first-term Democratic governor, announced Wednesday the creation of the “Leave No One Behind” slate. The campaign committee will be focused on backing the governor’s agenda.
“Today we take the first step toward creating a well-funded, well-organized effort to ensure we are electing leaders up and down the ballot dedicated to creating a Maryland that leaves no one behind,” Moore said in a statement. “Together we will create a team I am eager to help elect and work with to carry out the mission we came here to do: make this Maryland’s decade.”
Moore’s press release described the slate as an “initiative geared toward electing leaders up and down the ballot in Maryland’s 2026 Democratic primary and general election cycle.”
Such a campaign slate could be used to back challengers to incumbent Democrats.
It is unclear which races the campaign might focus on.
“After a resounding 2022 victory, the Moore-Miller Campaign knows 2026 is more important than ever and is preparing to invest and organize the best legislative slate possible to ensure victory in November and beyond. In the coming months, the Moore-Miller Campaign will announce endorsements and investments in key primary and general election races across Maryland,” according to the Moore campaign statement.

Moore has suffered a number of policy initiative setbacks, including a nuclear power bill that failed to advance in the Democrat-controlled legislature. He also struggled to get lawmakers to make changes to an increasingly expensive K-12 education reform plan known as the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future.
The governor also saw lawmakers pare down what he considered an ambitious housing and jobs bill in the last legislative session, when his demand for a bill allowing the sale of beer and wine in grocery stores was rebuffed. The bill, sponsored by lawmakers, was not officially part of his legislative agenda, but he gave his support to the legislation, with didn’t get out of committee in the House or Senate.
Additionally, after Moore vetoed legislation this year to create a reparations study commission — a body Moore called redundant — a number of Democratic lawmakers were vocal about their desire to override his veto.
The announcement of the slate also comes as Moore is pushing for the possible redrawing of the state’s eight congressional districts. It faces a tough fight in the Senate, where a majority of Democrats, led by Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), oppose the midcycle redistricting. Moore would need to convince 24 of the the 34 Democrats in the chamber to break with Ferguson for redistricting to have any hope.
Moore’s efforts are not unique. Other executives have used their position to target legislators.
In 2018, at a time when Gov. Larry Hogan was seeking re-election and an expansion of Republican seats in the Senate, he endorsed the primary opponent of Sen. Steve Waugh, a first-term Southern Maryland Republican who voted to override one of Hogan’s vetoes. Waugh’s vote was unnecessary given the super-majority Democrats enjoyed in the Senate.
Hogan was successful in replacing Waugh with current Sen. Jack Bailey.
Similarly, Democratic Gov. Parris Glendening was known to speak with legislators about issues in his office where they might coincidentally spy maps showing redistricted versions of their districts, some incarnations more advantageous to the legislator than others. But Glendening also had the advantage of being a lame duck in the final months of his term.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_4303-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-11-12 09:56:36.922742

Tasha Gallup knew college could change her future—but her family didn’t think it was possible. With guidance and determination, Tasha found a path to college and specialized in sports medicine. Building the career of her dreams, she ultimately became a physician assistant.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Turning “We can’t afford that” into “I did it”: Tas[...]","Tasha Gallup and colleague Dr. Chris Vorys covering a Plymouth State University hockey game.
Tasha Gallup says that in high school, she was athletic, hardworking, and constantly thinking about what came next. She always knew that college would be the thing that would change her future for the better. “I had enough awareness to see that as hard as my parents worked, they were struggling,” she recalled. “I saw differences in families. I knew I was going to have to do something to earn my own successes. I realized that college was probably going to be the thing that helped me build the skills and knowledge to have a life where I could provide for and sustain myself.”
“If I set my mind to something, that was the hill I was going to die on.”
Sports were a big part of Tasha’s life at Spaulding High School. She played lacrosse for four years and was named a Vermont Senior All-Star when she graduated in 2000. That connection kindled her interest in a career that involved athletics. “I was always interested in sports medicine,” she said. “I thought athletic training was interesting, and I wanted to blend athletics with academics. I didn’t think I had the chops for med school, but I wanted to do something in that direction.” She was determined to figure out how to make it happen.
“We Can’t Afford That”
When she first told her mother she wanted to go to college, the response was painful. “She said, ‘We can’t afford that. It’s not going to work.’ I was dashed but I was heated. I wanted to do it, so I was going to do it.”
Tasha met with Clark Amadon, a counselor working in VSAC’s Talent Search program at the time. Clark began helping her figure out what might be possible. “I told Clark the truth. I said my parents couldn’t afford it. I was ready for him to say goodbye. Instead, he said, ‘Okay, if your parents can’t do this, there are other options. There are steps along the way.’ And I started to see it could be attainable.”
She remembers that first meeting at their kitchen table in Graniteville like it was yesterday. “Clark came to our house. He’s a tall man and there wasn’t a lot of space in our duplex…I remember him sitting at the table, and he had a laptop to help us with the documents and FAFSA. It was 1998 and laptops weren’t an everyday thing. My parents were nervous but gracious and they accepted the support and were willing to hear him out.” 
With Clark’s guidance, Tasha began to see all that might be possible for her.
Making it to Castleton
Tasha applied and was accepted to several Vermont schools. She eventually selected Castleton State College (now Vermont State University Castleton). 
When her financial aid package arrived, she was excited and apprehensive. She remembers, “it was so exciting to see that financial aid package. It felt like a true success when I had the realization that my goal of getting to college, being there, was going to happen.” 
She also recalls what it felt like to sign that first promissory note. “I took it so seriously when I signed that note. That meant a lot. My mom was nervous. She said, ‘This is for real. You have money on the line. If you’re going to do this, do this.’ I was committed. I had to get myself into a career field that could substantiate the obligation of what that loan meant.”
Learning beyond the classroom 
Tasha says that there’s no doubt, college was difficult. “I knew I wasn’t a star student. I was working hard but I was still so average. I remember my first paper in college—I got an F. I didn’t have the grammar skills I needed for success in college. I sat down with my professor because I knew I had to take responsibility for it. She showed me why the errors were errors. She said, ‘This is a comma splice.’ I said, ‘a what?’ She explained it. I knew that I had to work at it.”
Tasha began to set up structure in her days and week, and strong boundaries to make sure she had time to study, go to the library, participate in study groups, and meet with her professors when she needed help. Slowly, it started to pay off. 
In her junior year of school, her parents divorced. “Things were stressful and I needed to work more. I had four or five part-time jobs plus full-time school.” She ended up staying at Castleton for a fifth year in order to finish, taking a lighter course load those last few years to be able to balance work and school. 
“The dedication to the goal had never wavered,” she said. “I needed to take that extra time. I also knew that a bump didn’t mean the journey was over.”
Tasha proudly graduated with her Bachelor’s in Athletic Training in 2005. 
Building a career in sports medicine
After college, Tasha took on several jobs while saving up for the expense of taking her Athletic Trainer certification exam. “I worked at Dartmouth doing EKGs and exercise stress testing while studying and saving for my exam,” she said. She developed a mantra to help her stay grounded and focused: “The capability is mine to have. It’s the effort which I wish to put into it.”
After passing her exam, she spent the next seven years as an Athletic Trainer at a regional high school helping approximately 300 athletes across 26 varsity sports. Tasha notes that while it was a wonderful step in meeting her dream, she started to get the itch to go further. “I was seeing all these injuries and wanting to have more of a hand in the workup and diagnosis—I wanted to do more and be more involved in injury management.” Inspired to take the next step, Tasha decided to pursue a graduate degree that would enable her to become a Physician Assistant. 
A new chapter, despite an initial rejection
Tasha knew there were resources like VSAC that could help her. She paved the path to grad school and took the prerequisite classes she needed to apply to a Physician Assistant program while working full-time. “I burned the candle at both ends to get those credits covered,” she said.
But her first application to graduate school at Franklin Pierce University was denied. “I was so disappointed,” she remembers. She got on the waitlist the second time she applied, then got an unexpected phone call three weeks before classes started. “I got in, and I was so excited,” she remembers. But she had to move quickly to figure out financial aid, housing, and more. “I had put in the work to get this opportunity. I was not going to lose it.”
Tasha earned her Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies from Franklin Pierce University in 2017 and began working in orthopedic medicine. She got a job at a small hospital in New Hampshire as an orthopedic PA, splitting her time between surgery and seeing patients in the office. In addition to providing surgical and non-surgical orthopedic care to the patients of her community, she also stayed connected to her roots in sports medicine. Tasha worked with the Athletic Training Staff and was a part of the sports medicine team for the athletes of Plymouth State University, truly coming full circle in her dream of helping athletes manage injuries. 
Family, change, and perspective
Bristol, New Hampshire is home today for Tasha and her husband, Scott. Their nephews, ages 11 and 13, moved in with them last year. The change at home led to a change at work for Tasha. “I started practicing in family medicine, continuing with non-operative orthopedics. It has better family hours and I’m not on call,” she says.
She still misses parts of her earlier work. “I miss the rush of athletics and surgery where you are the calm and stabilization in the middle of a big storm. It was so rewarding. But when my nephews moved in, I was ready to move on.”
Looking back, she is clear that the help she got from VSAC mattered. “Clark helped me understand the steps I needed to take to secure financial aid. He came to the house, sat down with my parents, and helped us with the paperwork. Having that person who could explain it and believed I could do it—that changed everything.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)State and local law enforcement officials announced a breakthrough on a more than 25 year old cold case in Juneau this summer, thanks in part to a DNA analysis tool at the Alaska Scientific Crime Detection Lab. 
Darryl Bruce Fawcett, an Alaska Native man, was 28 years old when he went missing in 1999. His remains were found by divers in the Gastineau Channel in 2004. In July, with the help of a tool that analyzes DNA from bones, officials said they were able to compare a sample with a family member’s DNA and identify Fawcett.

“It is pretty rare, especially (with) that amount of time to have passed,” said Juneau Deputy Chief Krag Campbell, in August. “So I’m just happy that the family was able to get some closure on this.”
The forensic method is not new, but the Alaska Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory was able to adopt it with new federal grant funding, said crime lab chief David Kanaris. Forensic scientists are able to extract DNA from bones or teeth, which can be compared to DNA of a missing person or relative to make an identification. 
Previously, bone samples would be sent out-of-state for testing, usually to the University of North Texas, Kanaris said. The state may continue that practice as needed. “We saw real value in bringing on an ability to do most of the work here in Alaska, where we can,” he said. 
Cheryl Duda, a forensic scientist and DNA technical leader at the crime lab, said this forensic method is one of many that investigators use when unidentified remains are recovered. 
“For many years now, our laboratory has been able to do testing on a very wide variety of body tissues like blood, saliva, hair roots and skin cells, but all of those are very soft tissue types,” she said. “What is different about this technology that we’re bringing online is it’s a method to extract DNA from bones.”
Duda said that first, any unidentified remains reported to the state go through the Alaska State Medical Examiner’s Office, which determines first if they are human or animal. If deemed human, and a bone or tooth is recoverable, the agency will send a sample to the crime lab for analysis. The DNA is then entered into a national DNA database, the Combined DNA Index System, commonly called CODIS, where investigators can search for a match.
The database can compare the sample with samples of known missing persons, family members, or other samples that law enforcement has collected from crimes or that have been submitted by the public.   
“That’s the big first step for us, is generating this profile in the hopes of getting that match or that association in state, so that we can report those results,” Duda said. 
Jennifer Foster is a forensic scientist and supervisor at the crime lab, and said that the next step requires coordination across agencies. State employees work with the Federal Bureau of Investigation that governs CODIS, other forensic labs, and local and state law enforcement departments conducting investigations. “So there’s a lot of communication,” she said. 
Officials at the crime lab say they’re working on a list of remains to be tested from the Alaska Medical Examiner’s Office, and cases are prioritized as they come into the lab. Once DNA samples are entered into the national database, the search continues. 
“So that profile routinely searches every night,” Duda said. “It does missing persons searches monthly. Relatives of missing person searches monthly. So as long as it doesn’t need to be removed for whatever reason, it stays in there and will search.”
Austin McDaniel, director of communications for the Alaska Department of Public Safety, said the state has analyzed three more cases since August, but no identifications have been made.
McDaniel said each case of unidentified remains is prioritized as it comes in through the Medical Examiner’s office, and investigators pursue and coordinate leads for identification. He said the new tool won’t necessarily unlock the state’s cold cases.
“If pulling DNA from bone fragments would have been helpful before, you know, either the crime lab or the medical examiner could have sent that out to other labs to have it completed. So I wouldn’t say there’s, like, this huge backlog of cases that just haven’t ever been worked,” he said.
There are currently 60 unidentified persons cases open in Alaska, according to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons Database, which goes back to 1968. The most recent unidentified remains on that list are bones found in a creek on Aug. 24 in Anchorage.
McDaniel said new DNA samples also get shared with the national database by the public through commercial at-home genetic testing, which can be shared with law enforcement. “That’s usually a box people can check, something like that might happen. Or maybe we go through and have family members reach out to us and offer familial DNA samples that can be compared against,” he said.
McDaniel said local law enforcement investigators can request the DNA analysis as they pursue leads. “An investigator from any number of agencies, not just the Troopers, as they’re trying to go through and maybe work on some of these cases they might go through to reach out to a family member proactively that they suspect might be related to the decedent, and see they can collect a voluntary sample from from them,” he said. 
Kanaris, as head of the crime lab, acknowledged these are sensitive cases, especially as Alaska grapples with a crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people. Alaska Native residents are disproportionately victims of violent crime. At least 27% of the 1,268 known cases on the state’s Missing Persons Clearinghouse database, managed by the Alaska Department of Public Safety, involve Alaska Native people. 
“We have worked with the tribal liaisons, understanding that a lot of these bones may come from Alaska Native remains,” Kanaris said. “And so we want to handle these samples as sensitively as we can and be as culturally aware as we can.”
He said another benefit of having this DNA analysis tool in the state’s crime lab, is handling cases more promptly. 
“They’re going to involve less transit time. The bones are going to stay in state, and they will, hopefully, be able to be returned to the families for closure as soon as possible. That would be one of the benefits of this,” he said. 
“I’d like to see us be able to work as many of the samples, not just with bones, but across the board, with forensic science samples in Alaska, at the Alaska crime lab,” he said. “So I think this is a big step forward for us.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC07250-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 09:56:36.922742

After a rural California hospital shut down its maternity ward in 2022, pregnant women in Plumas County had to travel at least 70 miles to give birth. It was among dozens of California communities that lost labor and delivery services in the past decade. 
That may change by next year, though, after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed two new laws that seek to mitigate California’s maternity care deserts, writes CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.
Because of rising costs, staffing issues and declining birth rates, Plumas District Hospital in Quincy closed its maternity ward three years ago. Since then, patients giving birth must travel for hours either north to Susanville; south to Truckee through winding mountain roads; or even farther east to Nevada, where the hospitals are larger.
But in October Newsom signed a bill to create a 10-year pilot program allowing hospitals, including Plumas, to establish standby maternity units that operate only when needed instead of 24/7. He also signed another measure lifting some licensing requirements for birth centers to receive state approval. Typically run by midwives, birth centers accept low-risk pregnancies. At least 20 birth centers have closed in California over the last three years. 
Because of the new legislation, the hospital aims to open a standby maternity ward by next year. It also plans to open a birth center after facility leaders saw a growing demand for it: A community midwife delivered more babies at people’s homes in 2022 than the hospital did in its maternity ward, according to the hospital’s director of business development.
Lori Link, a certified nurse midwife with the hospital, said many of her current patients ask about when the birth center will open — evidence to her that the hospital’s maternity care plans are warranted because the community wants it. 

Link: “I think this is a testimony to the power of listening to women.”

The U.S. Department of Justice said Tuesday that it is investigating UC Berkeley after protestors clashed outside a campus event held by Turning Point USA, a nonprofit that seeks to promote conservative values on college campuses. UC Berkeley was the organization’s final stop of its tour, as well as its first event at a California college campus since its co-founder, Charlie Kirk, was fatally shot in September.
Ella Carter-Klauschie and Chrissa Olson of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network were on the ground, reporting that while most of the speeches during the event focused on Kirk and criticizing the campus protests, demonstrators outside chanted “Fascists out of Berkeley,” “Trump must go now,” and “F—k Charlie Kirk.” Students collided with police, who wore riot gear and held batons and projectile weapons, leading to at least four arrests.

Jess Nichol 
Jess Nichol is one of the sisters of the late Polly Klaas and an advocate with Californians for Safety and Justice


When I was 12 years old, my sister, Polly Klaas, was kidnapped from our bedroom and murdered. In the aftermath, I watched lawmakers use grieving families — ours included — to sell the public on legislative policies that had already been written. 
Polly’s name became synonymous with fear. And California’s Three Strikes law swept through the legislature.
Here’s what legislators weren’t doing: asking what would help us heal, what would make us feel safer, or what kind of system we actually wanted. 
They were looking for pain they could weaponize. And it worked. Politicians simply assumed they knew what victims wanted, and they used our grief to push an agenda that had little to do with actual safety or healing.
I’ve spent years watching how survivor voices get co-opted — how our pain becomes a tool for policies that don’t serve us. Polly’s story became shorthand for “tough on crime,” and was used to justify mass incarceration, even though research shows victims overwhelmingly prefer rehabilitation and community investment over longer prison sentences. 
The gap between what we’re told victims want and what we actually need has felt impossible to close. That’s why I’m so moved by what’s happening right now in California.
For the first time, researchers at the University of San Francisco are surveying crime victims, survivors and their family members who have participated in parole hearings for someone who harmed them or their loved one. 
The survey asks simple but radical questions: What was your experience actually like? What did you need that you didn’t get? What would have helped?
This might not sound revolutionary, but it is. For generations, legislators have claimed to speak for victims while passing laws without ever asking us what we actually think. 
What would have made a difference
This survey flips that script. It was co-designed with victims and survivors over several months, ensuring that the questions reflect our real concerns — not what policymakers assume we care about. 
It asks about what support we received (or didn’t), how we were treated by the system, what resources would have made a difference and what reforms we believe would help others walking this difficult path.
It matters enormously that victims and survivors are leading this process, not as symbolic voices brought in after decisions are made, but as co-creators. 
The survey is open through November 30th. The findings will be shared with policymakers, advocates and community leaders to ensure victim and survivor voices guide future reforms. 
I know firsthand how rare this is. When Polly died in 1993, grief counselors and victim advocates would have helped our family immensely — but those services barely existed. 
Instead, we got media scrutiny and political theater. Her story was used to justify laws that primarily incarcerated people of color for low-level crimes — the very opposite of the justice and safety those laws promised. 
If someone had asked us what we needed then, we would have said, time to grieve, mental health support and a system that recognized us as victims in need of care, not props for a political agenda.
Our experience matters — not as a talking point — but as truth that can shape what comes next.
I’ve learned through my own healing journey that real change happens through connection, understanding, and genuine accountability — not through punishment, shame, or control. 
The same is true for policy. When we create laws based on what victims and survivors experience and need, rather than on fear or political calculation, we build systems that serve healing and safety instead of systems that perpetuate harm.
For so long, I’ve carried the weight of knowing that my sister’s story was used to build systems that don’t work — that harm communities, that don’t make us safer and that don’t reflect what victims actually need. 
This survey represents something different: a chance to build policy grounded in truth rather than fear, in healing rather than retribution, in the voices of those who’ve lived through violence rather than those who exploit it.
That feels like hope. And right now, we could all use a little more of that.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110725-Polly-Klaas-NC-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-12 08:56:37.108056

Steven Horsford at the No Kings rally in Las Vegas on Oct. 18, 2025. (Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada Current)The Senate resolution that reopens the federal government without extending health care subsidies, but allows some Republicans to sue the government over the Jan. 6 investigation, is “betrayal of a bill,” said Democratic U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford.  
Horsford, who spoke virtually Monday night to the NAACP Las Vegas chapter, said he wouldn’t support the resolution to reopen the government “as proposed and written” because it didn’t restore subsidies to the Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums or reverse Medicaid cuts from President Donald Trump’s massive tax and immigration bill passed this summer.
The House, which hasn’t been in session since mid-September, is expected to reconvene Wednesday. 
The measure to end the longest government shutdown in American history doesn’t address the health care policy concerns raised by Democrats, Horsford said.
But it does add language that allows eight Republican senators who have their phone records seized during an investigation by Jack Smith, the former special counsel who was looking into the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to sue the government for up to $500,000. 
Horsford expected the Republican-led House “to rush the process” to get the bill over the finish line before more people learn of the additional provisions. 
“More details about what’s in the bill and what’s not in the bill are going to become more evident,” he said. “People are already upset and pissed with what the Senate has done. When you really drill down on what’s in there and what’s not, that’s going to make more people say, ‘what are we doing?’”
Nevada Democratic U.S. Sens. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto were among the eight Democratic Senators who broke with the majority of their caucus Monday to vote for a continuing resolution to reopen the government through Jan. 30. 
Their votes have been criticized by a broad coalition of fellow Democratic lawmakers, progressive organizers, and even the centrist group Third Way. 
Cortez Masto, along with U.S. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, had voted consistently with Senate Republicans on a continuing resolution from the beginning. 
Rosen had held out on voting on the resolution without a commitment from Republicans to extend health care subsidies. Less than two weeks into the shutdown, Rosen said to take Republicans at their word now when they say “‘trust me,’ when they violated that trust every single time, it’s a little naive on our part.”
She relented on Monday.
Nevadans who get insurance through Nevada Health Link are facing a projected average 26% premium rate hike.
Without changes, Horsford said an estimated 28,000 people in Nevada lose their health insurance with “another 100,000 seeing their rates double to the point they can’t really afford it anymore.” 
“It’s not even a permanent funding bill and does nothing to address the Republican-caused health care crisis,” Horsford said of the resolution coming to the House. 
The resolution would only fund parts of the government through the end of January. 
Because of several additions to the bill, the measure has to go through a full House process. 
“We better be offered opportunities to bring amendments both in the rules committee and on the floor and to debate before the American people why we were able to move this bill but not something to address the health care crisis,” Horsford said.
The bill is likely to pass —  President Donald Trump, who wields enormous power over the House Republican majority, has praised the bill, saying “the deal is very good.” 
“I didn’t go to Congress to cut health care,” Horsford said. “Republicans control the House, the Senate, and White House. That means if they want to pass a bipartisan bill that cuts health care, that takes away food from needy families … they can do it without me.”
Horsford was joined at the NAACP event by state Democratic state Sen. Dina Neal, who said she was “mad as hell” about the agreement the faction of Senate Democrats reached with Republicans. 
Neal said federal workers she has heard from are puzzled about why the Democrats caved to pressure. 
“If they were going to give in, then they could have done that on day four,” Neal said, referencing frustration of federal workers, adding they believe “There was no reason for us to go 40 days without getting paid if you weren’t going to hold the line.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/horsfordNK-1024x663.jpg,,,2025-11-12 08:56:37.108056

(Hoover Dam photo: U.S. Bureau of Reclamation)Nevada and six other Colorado River states failed to reach a broad agreement Tuesday on how to share the river’s dwindling water supply, missing a federally-imposed deadline after days of intense closed-door negotiations.
Despite missing the deadline, the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Reclamation indicated states would be given additional time to continue negotiations after making “collective progress.”
“While more work needs to be done, collective progress has been made that warrants continued efforts to define and approve details for a finalized agreement,” said a joint statement from the seven states, the Interior Department and the Bureau of Reclamation.
The Bureau of Reclamation – which manages water in the West under the Interior Department – initially gave states until Nov. 11 to submit a preliminary agreement for a plan that could replace the river’s operating guidelines set to expire at the end of 2026. 
The initial timeline also called for states to share a final consensus-based plan by mid-February 2026 in order to reach a final agreement in the summer of 2026 with implementation of the new guidelines beginning in October 2026.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum previously indicated that the federal government would intervene in the Colorado River water negotiations if the seven basin states couldn’t reach their own agreement.
The Department of the Interior did not respond to questions about a new deadline after states missed Tuesday’s or whether the agency would intervene.
Representatives from the Lower Basin states — Nevada, Arizona, and California — and Upper Basin states — Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming — attempted to hammer out an agreement over a two-day meeting in Phoenix but could not reach a deal to manage the drought-stricken river.
In a joint statement the seven states and federal water managers said they “recognize the serious and ongoing challenges facing the Colorado River.”
Prolonged drought driven by climate change has put immense pressure on the overtapped Colorado River which sustains agriculture in the West and provides water for 40 million people across seven U.S. states, 30 Native American tribes and parts of northern Mexico. 
“Through continued cooperation and coordinated action, there is a shared commitment to ensuring the long-term sustainability and resilience of the Colorado River system,” the joint statement said.
‘Getting down to the wire,’ conservation groups try to pump up Colorado River negotiations

State negotiators for both the Upper and Lower Basin have said they would prefer a seven-state agreement than the alternative river management options proposed by the federal government last year.
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said he believes there is still a path to a seven-state consensus, despite states failure to meet the federal deadline Tuesday.
“While the Basin States did not finalize an agreement today on post-2026 Colorado River operations, our commitment to a state-led path remains,”  Cox said Tuesday afternoon on the social media site X.
One of the biggest disagreements between the Upper and Lower Basin states is over which faction should have to cut back on their water use, and by how much.
The Lower Basin – Nevada, Arizona, and California – want all seven Colorado River states to share mandatory water cuts during dry years under the new guidelines. The Upper Basin, which is not subject to mandatory cuts under the current guidelines, say they already use much less water than downstream states and should not face additional cuts during shortages.
That disagreement prompted lawmakers in Arizona on Tuesday to call for stronger federal intervention in shaping post-2026 Colorado River operating guidelines. 
In a letter to Interior Secretary Burgum on Tuesday, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs and legislative leaders asked the federal government to include water supply reductions for Upper Basin states in any new guidelines they consider.
“This extreme negotiating posture – four of the seven Basin States refusing to participate in any sharing of water shortages – has led to a fundamental impasse that is preventing the successful development of a 7-State consensus plan for management of the Colorado River,” wrote Hobbs in the letter. 
Lower Basin states have offered to conserve 1.5 million acre-feet of Colorado River water each year under post-2026 operating guidelines on the condition that Upper Basin states share cuts if further reductions are needed during dry years. Arizona would bear the brunt of those reductions. 
“The existing Colorado River operating guidelines are near expiration, and a meager runoff season has left the reservoirs depleted once again and one bad winter away from reaching critical lows,” reads the Arizona letter.
‘Rip off the Band Aid’
The Bureau of Reclamation will still need to go through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process so they can assess the environmental impact of the plan before issuing a final decision on new guidelines for the river’s management. 
The agency plans to release draft post-2026 operating guidelines in December detailing options for how to manage the Colorado River, followed by an open public comment period. 
After two years of state negotiations, some conservation groups also urged the Bureau of Reclamation to move on to the public NEPA process without a state consensus plan.
“Rip off the Band Aid, and let the public get to work. The states don’t deserve the kid-glove treatment any longer,” said Kyle Roerink, the executive director of the Great Basin Water Network.
John Weisheit, the conservation director of Living Rivers, echoed calls for the federal government to step up.
“It is clear that negotiators cannot hash out a meaningful management regime to deal with the dwindling reservoir levels that we will likely see in the coming years,” Weisheit said. “The federal government’s deference to the states has got to stop.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/53087352100_8c77cde5dc_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-12 08:56:37.108056

(Courtesy of Lizzy Hayes)For 35 years, Charles and Linda Gill have run a family farm in Bowdoinham. While initially focused on cut flowers and herbs, they shifted to growing hemp after regulated production was legalized. The hemp-derived products they produce, such as topicals for muscle pain and gummies to assist with sleep, are each accompanied with a handwritten note from Linda when sold at farmers markets, wholesale or shipped across the country. 
“We are not in the business of these intoxicating hemp products on the market, which are the ones that are screwing it up for everybody,” Charles Gill said. “They’re abusing the system.” 
Charles Gill is referring to companies exploiting a loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill that legalized hemp production, which he thinks should be closed, as do many other hemp farmers in Maine. But they say the way the federal government has proposed to do so would not just prevent exploitation — it would decimate the industry. 
“All our current products would be banned,” Charles Gill said. “It would pretty much put us out of business.”
A provision tucked into the deal to reopen the federal government would drastically lower the allowable threshold for legal THC products. After passing the U.S. Senate on Monday, it now awaits the approval of the U.S. House of Representatives. White House officials have said President Donald Trump supports the language. 
Hemp provision in federal shutdown legislation would nullify Maine law

While hemp and marijuana both come from cannabis, hemp contains less THC, which is the compound that makes people high. Since the 2018 bill, it has been legal to sell hemp-derived THC products as long as they contain less than 0.3% THC by dry weight. This made it possible to take legal amounts of THC from hemp and turn it into intoxicating substances — the loophole that there is growing pressure to address. 
The proposal in the pending appropriations bill would prohibit hemp products from having more than .4 milligrams of total THC per container and ban these products for “personal or household use.”  
According to a summary of the bill put together by the staff of Senate Appropriations Chair U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, the language would prevent “the unregulated sale of intoxicating hemp-based or hemp-derived products, including Delta-8, from being sold online, in gas stations, and corner stores, while preserving non-intoxicating CBD and industrial hemp products.”
The new limits would also override Maine law, which limits THC to three milligrams per serving. 
There is widespread understanding in Maine, and across the country, that regulations are needed for intoxicating hemp products, which are frequently designed to mimic the design of popular snacks, candies and sodas, making them attractive to children. 
In contrast to cannabis products, hemp-derived THC products still remain largely unregulated, though earlier this year Maine passed a law that includes packaging requirements for intoxicating products that can now only be sold to people over the age of 21. 
Lizzy Hayes, an organic hemp farmer in Cornville who worked on that legislation, said, “that’s more common sense” than how the federal government could alternatively regulate these products.
Hayes, whose farm Panorama Seeds doesn’t produce hemp for intoxicating products, said under the proposed limits “that would mean that a whole package of CBD oil, which you wouldn’t be able to produce under these rules anyway, would never be an effective therapeutic dose.” 
Pointing to established and preliminary findings about CBD’s beneficial effects, Hayes said the passage of the federal changes would hurt Mainers who have come to rely on the products. 
Charles Gill similarly drew a distinction between intoxicating products and the type of products he sells. 
“If you ate a whole jar of vanilla extract, you’d get drunk too, but that’s not the intent,” he said. “My worry is that if they say that [essentially] no THC can be in CBD products, it becomes a very different product.” 
Nyeela Hueholt of Rooted Heart Remedies, a registered hemp farm in Buxton, said Congress should focus on how some companies are exploiting the current limits rather than the limits themselves. 
“The chemical processing to change a non-psychoactive constituent into a psychoactive constituent — that being illegal would be understandable,” Huebolt said. “But to put us all under this umbrella… to go back just because some people are abusing it, doesn’t make any sense.” 
As the federal government considers the provision, the state is also grappling with regulations on hemp, medical cannabis and recreational cannabis, the latter of which has greater restrictions and high taxes. 
In the state budget passed this year, the cannabis sales tax was increased — from 10% to 14% — a change that will take effect on January 1. 
When the Maine Legislature returns shortly after, lawmakers will again consider a proposal from last session that would add testing and tracking requirements for medical cannabis, which isn’t required to be tested for contaminants and potency like adult-use cannabis.

Technicians from different Utah, Arizona and federal offices inspected over 288,500 boats and performed 6,509 decontaminations of quagga mussels and other aquatic invasive species like Eurasian watermilfoil since the start of 2025, according to a release from the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources.

That’s an increase from the 6,383 boats decontaminated in 2024. But the state is overall happy with boaters’ compliance to keep invasive species from spreading in the state, said Lt. Bruce Johnson, from the Utah Department of Natural Resources Law Enforcement Aquatic Invasive Species Statewide Operations.
“We really appreciate everyone’s efforts,” Johnson said. “And while the boating season is winding down for the year, make sure to plan ahead for next year and be sure to take the mandatory education course, pay the required fees, and display the necessary decals on your watercraft, so you can be ready for another great boating season next year.” 
Currently, the only waterbody infested with quagga mussels in the state is Lake Powell, the division said in the release, however, contamination was also found in other waterbodies in Utah coming from infested reservoirs outside the state.
Idaho state officials say they haven’t found viable quagga mussels since latest treatment

The state highlighted that quagga mussels can have different negative impacts. They can plug water lines. If they get into water delivery systems, it can cost millions of dollars a year to remove and result in higher utility bills. They also remove plankton from the water, hurting fish species, damage boats’ engines and stink when they die in large numbers.
That’s why all boaters in the state are required to take a mussel awareness online course each year, and clean, drain and dry their boats before launching in other waters. Those with motorized watercrafts have to pay an enrollment fee, and get a decontamination certification if their last launch was outside the state or at a mussel-infested waterbody.
“During the winter season, there aren’t many available watercraft inspection staff at the stations across the state,” Johnson said. “So we ask boaters going to Lake Powell — or to neighboring states’ mussel-infested waterbodies — to please either have their watercraft decontaminated at that location before leaving, or to call us ahead of time if they are going to need a decontamination before their next launch.”

SB 23, sponsored by Sen. Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, would apply a special primary election to legislative and congressional districts if they are changed by the Legislature or a judge. 
Under the bill, any district affected by U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco’s order for new district lines would hold a special primary election before the end of August. There would be no special general election for the affected districts. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The primary election for the 2026 midterms is on May 19. Districts affected by the bill would only have their primaries in August. A message seeking comment was left with Gudger’s office on Tuesday. The Legislature begins its 2026 regular session on Jan. 13. 
Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled in August that Alabama’s Senate maps violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. That provision prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. 
Manasco ordered new district lines to be drawn in Senate Districts 25 and 26, represented by Sens. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, and Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, respectively.
After multiple check-ins with Manasco and lawyers with both sides, Gov. Kay Ivey said in September that she would not call a special session to redraw the map, citing a similar case in the U.S. Supreme Court, Callais v. Louisiana, in which the justices are considering whether majority-minority districts are constitutional. A ruling is expected by next summer.
Manasco then appointed the same team that redrew the state’s congressional districts in 2023 to remedy the state Senate issue. Richard Allen, the special master, recommended two maps to remedy the VRA violation.
The special master recommended three maps, ranking two as what he thought was best. Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen objected to all three recommendations, with one being “the least bad of several bad options.”
“Each of the proposed plans was drawn with a racial target,” Allen wrote in an Oct. 31 court filing. 
Allen and other state Republican leaders have consistently said that the redistricting process is racial gerrymandering on principle. In August, GOP Chairman John Wahl said the litigation is “racist by nature.” 
The map that Allen said was the “least bad” is the same map the special master, Richard Allen, said was the weakest remedy to Manasco’s ruling. Manasco ordered a second district in Montgomery that had a 50% Black voting age population, or something close to it. 
“The special master puts forward Remedial Plan 3 because, while it weakly remedies the Section Two violation, the comparison of Remedial Plan 3 to Remedial Plans 1 and 2 demonstrates the impact of modifying a third district (District 30) on the effectiveness of the remedy,” the special master wrote in his October recommendation.
The plaintiffs in the case requested that Remedial Plan 2 be adopted, according to an Oct. 31 filing. The plaintiffs said that Remedial Plan 2 is unimpeachable of racial gerrymandering and is the best remedy to Manasco’s ruling. 
Deuel Ross, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said Tuesday he had not reviewed Gudger’s legislation as of Tuesday afternoon.
“Plaintiffs object to Plan 3 both because only White candidates stand any chance of winning in Senate District 26 and because Black-preferred candidates (regardless of race) win less than 50% of the time,” the plaintiffs wrote in the filing. “Under Plan 3, Black candidates in SD26 won only three (23%) of the 13 analyzed elections and none of these wins occurred after 2018. Report at 19. Even including those wins, Black candidates lose by an average margin of over 7%.”
Should the U.S. Supreme Court rule for Louisiana in the Callais case, Alabama’s 2nd and 7th congressional districts — represented by Democratic U.S. reps. Shomari Figures of Mobile and Terri Sewell of Birmingham — could be placed in jeopardy. In 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ruling of a lower court panel, which included Manasco, that Alabama’s congressional maps denied Black voters a proper say in their governance, and ordered new ones drawn.

Remedial Plan 1 reallocates South Montgomery in Senate District 26 to Senate District 25, leaving a tail of the south-western portion of Montgomery County in District 26. The northern part of the district is extended into Elmore County, which is currently in Senate District 30 represented by Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville.
Remedial Plan 1 changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 51.6% in Senate District 25, 66.1% to 49.7% in Senate District 26 and 23.6% to 20% in Senate District 30.

Remedial Plan 3 extends Senate District 25 into southern Montgomery and extends Senate District 26 into Elmore County, which is currently in District 25.

It is a work by Toby Millman, a University of Michigan faculty member and alum, and was commissioned by the University of Michigan Arts Initiative. It is part of a larger exhibit called Visual History of the Unions.
The exhibit was supposed to open on October 16, with the various pieces displayed in high traffic areas on the ground floor. Instead, the quilt and most of the other artworks in the exhibition are in an obscure room that opened on Nov 6 for six weeks only.
Why?
Well, the title of the appliqué quilt is a tipoff: “Tahrir Coalition- March 28, 2024.” It shows a group of students gathered in the Union, with Palestinian flags, protesting the genocide being conducted in Gaza with the support of the US. It is unclear who made the decision to delay, relocate, and shorten the timeframe for the exhibition. It could have been a staff member in charge of the University of Michigan Unions, or some higher level administrator. But relocated it was.
The story of that quilt is telling. Regardless of what you think about Israel or international law or student activists, or appliqué quilt art, it is a story of obedience in advance by administrators. Of looking around for people who might stifle free speech at the U of M, and giving them what they want before they ask for it. And therefore of the moral collapse, in historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat’s words, that enables the loss of a democracy.
That’s an awfully heavy message to fold into a quilt, no?
Well, the quilt is only an issue because a university administrator decided to make it an issue. And, as likely as not, that decision was taken out of fear of outside forces.
The evidence is in a genuinely shocking new report. The American Association of University Professors and the Middle East Studies Association just released their research on the weaponization of civil rights law to stifle speech and debate on campus.
It’s amazing. It documents a surge of civil rights investigations since 2023, overwhelmingly focused on speech rather than traditional civil rights complaints such as sexual or racial discrimination.

These actions are in response to reports that make it clear that criticism of Israeli policy, rather than anti-semitism, is the focus: “All but one of the 102 antisemitism complaint letters we have analyzed focus on speech critical of Israel; of these, 79% contain allegations of antisemitism that simply describe criticisms of Israel or Zionism with no reference to Jews or Judaism; at least 50% of complaints consist solely of such criticism.”
It is legitimate to debate the relationship of Judaism and Zionism, but this is a bare-knuckle fight, not a debate about identity and ideology.
And, finally, efforts to chill campus discussion of the Middle East are part of a broader political agenda. The report finds that 78% of complaints were from right-wing advocacy organizations, including some with no campus presence, and at least 24% of investigations were opened based on complaints by actors with no connection to the school. In fact, at least 15 investigations were opened based on “complaints from a single conservative activist with no relation to any of the schools investigated!”
The fear on American college campuses is being driven from the outside. Outside agitators are at work all right, but they are overwhelmingly on the side of repression and coordination with the Trump administration.
Professor Jean Hong of the University of Michigan, at the annual Davis, Market and Nickerson lecture in honor of the fight for free speech at Michigan, spoke to the way fear works in a university. Discussing her experience as a professor in Hong Kong during the Chinese Communist crackdown on free speech there, a time when once free speakers rapidly learned the art of self-censorship, she noted that the university didn’t impose it. Outside forces in government and their allies in society did the work.
But unlike the people of Hong Kong, we do not face the full power of the People’s Republic of China. A conservative activist who files fifteen complaints is a far cry from the youth wing of the Chinese Communist Party. The threat to American democracy is a increasingly unpopular president with a thin electoral victory who has been repeatedly  repudiated by both the overwhelming majority of federal courts – and the voters who had elections this month.
Put another way, there are far more people who like American democracy than people who are willing to sacrifice it. If every little action taken by anti-democratic forces and those they cow is challenged, then over time they will be overwhelmed.
Americans often imagine that you lose your democracy when there are tanks in the streets and colonels in mirrored sunglasses taking over the TV studio. But democracies are more likely to die in subtler and superficially legal ways these days, as anti-democratic political forces take advantage of others’ weakness, careerism, and fear, and chip away at our rights.
Democracy, and a university, can die not in a coup, but one quilt at a time.

(Photo by Emily Elconin/Getty Images)Families of Black homicide victims in the United States are more likely than any other group to seek financial assistance through state victim compensation programs — and they are the most likely to be denied, according to a new study published in the peer-reviewed journal Race and Justice.
Researchers analyzed nearly 60,000 homicide-related compensation claims filed in 18 states between 2015 and 2023. They found that nearly one-third of all the denials were based on “contributory misconduct,” a discretionary policy in which officials, often relying on police reports and assessments, can deny compensation if they judge that the victim’s behavior or alleged criminal involvement contributed to their death.
Families of Black victims submitted about 46% of all claims for compensation, but made up 57% of denials attributed to contributory misconduct. The researchers note that this may reflect subjective judgments and racial biases, which disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic or Latino families.
Even after controlling for gender, state and year of application, the researchers found that families of Black and American Indian victims had lower compensation approval rates — about 82% — compared with roughly 87% for white victims and nearly 91% for Asian victims. Families of male victims and those of younger victims aged 18 to 24 were also less likely to receive compensation.
Crime victims may get fewer services as federal aid drops. States weigh how to help.

Victims of crime often face a maze of legal and administrative barriers, making it hard to secure compensation or other support.
State-based crime victim compensation programs are often at least partially funded by the federal 1984 Victims of Crime Act or VOCA, which uses federal criminal fines and forfeitures — not taxpayer dollars — to support victims of violent crime. These funds are allocated to states by Congress.
These programs provide financial relief to individuals and families affected by violent crimes, including homicide. Compensation can cover expenses such as counseling, funeral costs, emergency assistance and lost wages. But the amount of funding available to states has plummeted by billions of dollars in recent years. In response, some states have stepped in to fund crime victim programs with state dollars. 
In August, 21 Democratic state attorneys general filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s attempt to tie victims’ compensation to its immigration agenda. The administration sought to withhold funds from states that refuse to comply with federal immigration enforcement efforts. Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice quietly released its state-by-state VOCA fund allocations for fiscal year 2025. Collectively, the states and Washington, D.C. received $1.25 billion in support.
The researchers warn that barriers to accessing support may worsen financial and emotional hardships for grieving families and reinforce broader inequalities. They call for changes such as limiting denials based on contributory misconduct, expanding administrative support for applicants and standardizing data collection across states to better monitor disparities.

,California,2025-11-12 13:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,She drove a hundred miles to give birth. New California laws are bringing maternity care closer to home,Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/11/plumas-maternity-birth-center/,"Three years after closing its maternity ward, a new state law will help a rural Northern California hospital bring birth services back to the community.","In summary
Three years after closing its maternity ward, a new state law will help a rural Northern California hospital bring birth services back to the community.


At 3:30 on a July morning, Emily Meyers’ water broke. Her son was coming five weeks early. Meyers and her husband jumped in the car and raced from their home in Greenville, population 387, to Reno, Nev. where they had planned to deliver. It was a two-hour drive along mostly narrow, two-lane highways shared with logging trucks. 
They didn’t make it in time. Their son, Grant, was born in the car 13 minutes from the hospital to two stunned parents.
Along the way they had passed two other hospitals — Plumas District Hospital in Quincy and Eastern Plumas Health Care in Portola — neither of which have maternity wards. Meyers’ husband had asked if she wanted to stop at either one, but she told him to keep driving. 
“At that point I didn’t know how intense things were going to be,” Meyers said. “I didn’t feel like I could stop in the little towns if something was wrong.”
Meyers’ frantic experience exemplifies the challenges that have become commonplace for pregnant patients in rural California: Dozens of hospitals have stopped delivering babies across the state, leaving many families with no option other than to drive for hours and hope for the best.
But in the remote Sierra Nevada community where Meyers lives, hospital executives have a plan to change things. 
Plumas District Hospital, one of the hospitals Meyers sped past during labor, closed its maternity ward in 2022 after costs grew and birth rates declined. This year, it helped pass two state laws that give rural hospitals the ability to reimagine birth services. 
One of the laws, authored by Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, creates a 10-year pilot program allowing hospitals such as Plumas District Hospital to create “standby” maternity units that operate only when needed, rather than offering standard 24/7 service. 
The unit must have the ability to do surgical deliveries, blood transfusions, resuscitation and life-support measures. The California Department of Public Health will monitor and evaluate safety outcomes with the new model.
A related law relaxes some of the licensing requirements for birth centers, which are typically run by midwives and accept low-risk pregnancies. 
“Expecting moms and their families in rural California deserve better,” said McGuire, a Democrat from Santa Rosa whose district stretches north to the Oregon border, in a statement to CalMatters.
Dr. Robert Moore, chief medical officer for Partnership HealthPlan, a health insurer that covers the state’s northernmost counties, said it’s not realistic for some rural hospitals to offer maternity care 24 hours a day. The numerous closures prove that. Emergency maternity services are better than none at all, he added.
“It’s not acceptable for someone to travel two hours to the nearest hospital. The outcomes are not worth it,” Moore said. “We owe it to the rural areas of the state to fix it.”
A new birth center for Plumas County 
Next year, as a result of the legislation, Plumas District Hospital plans to open a birth center and standby maternity ward. Women who qualify and do not want an epidural will be able to give birth locally. The hospital’s on-call obstetrics team will be available to take transfers from the birth center should any complications arise that require a doctor.
Darren Beatty, chief operating and government affairs officer for the hospital, said maternity care is part of what makes a rural community vibrant, and it’s why facility leadership pushed hard to change state law over the past few years.
“We’re experiencing multiple threats in and outside of health care to maintain(ing) a rural lifestyle,” Beatty said. “We need to do our part so that Quincy can be an outlier and not continue to shrink and go away like many rural communities have.”
Nearly 60 hospitals have stopped labor and delivery services since 2012 in rural and urban areas alike, according to a CalMatters database. But in rural areas, when a hospital stops delivering babies, it is often the last option left to a community. The closest hospitals to Plumas with maternity wards are a 70-mile drive north to Susanville or south to Truckee through winding mountain roads. Many families, like the Meyers family, choose to go east to Nevada where the hospitals are farther but larger.
The Plumas District Hospital chose to open a birth center because families in the county want something different: Home births have trended upward since 2020. 
A community midwife delivered more babies at people’s homes in 2022 than the hospital did in its labor and delivery ward, said Tiffany Leonhardt, director of business development.
“That was just really a huge eye opener to us,” Leonhardt said. “There’s so many women in our community who, number one, they want it, and number two, they actually qualify for it — it’s safe for them.”
Emily Meyers said if those resources had been in place three months ago, she would have elected to give birth locally at the birth center. She and her husband likely also would have stopped at the Plumas District Hospital emergency room in Quincy. 
“A birthing center that’s 30 minutes from my house — that would be a huge relief,” Meyers said. “It was very miserable to be in labor in the car for an hour and a half. It would be nice if there were a few more options for people, and it would give me more peace of mind knowing there was more care available.”
Rural hospitals struggle to maintain labor and delivery
In 2022, the last year that Plumas District Hospital operated a maternity ward, it delivered 64 babies, barely more than one per week. When the number of births drops below 200, that’s usually a sign of trouble, Moore, with Partnership Health Plan, said.
Low volume is a common problem in rural California and one that comes with a hefty price tag. Maternity wards are often the second most expensive hospital units to run after the emergency room because they require around-the-clock staffing, and without enough births there’s no revenue to cover the service.
Plumas’ hospital also struggled with staffing issues. As a rural hospital, it needed nurses who could work in multiple areas of the hospital when women weren’t in labor; modern training has encouraged most medical professionals to specialize in a single area. 
Open nursing positions with sign-on and housing bonuses would go months without applicants, hospital leaders said. Temporary traveling nurses hired to fill on the maternity ward were unwilling to work in other areas of the hospital.
“We couldn’t throw enough money at it,” Beatty said. “We were willing to spend whatever it took to get the staffing we needed, but that wasn’t the problem.” 
Still, hospital leaders vowed to bring some birth services back to the area after closing the maternity ward. 
Plumas District Hospital kept its 24-hour operating room open and retained anesthesiologists, obstetricians and respiratory therapists on staff. Typically, when a rural hospital ends labor and delivery, it stops related services; but doctors and midwives have continued prenatal care and follow-up with moms who deliver in other cities. 
“Obstetrics really forces an organization to be very, very excellent across the board,” Beatty said. 
Birth centers gain popularity
Emily Meyers’ sister-in-law, Mary Ann Meyers, remembers when Plumas District Hospital closed its maternity ward. She had been planning on delivering her first child there in 2021 when the Dixie Fire swept through the region, burning nearly 1 million acres. The hospital was spared, but she transferred her care to a hospital in Nevada instead because of the smoke. Months later, Plumas District Hospital shut the doors to its maternity ward.
That loss complicated the birth of her second child. Mary Ann drove five hours round trip between Greenville and Reno for those prenatal appointments. 
Then, the same July day that Emily gave birth, Mary Ann found herself in labor with her third child, speeding to the same hospital. Her water broke at 2:30 a.m. She and her husband drove to Reno and had just checked into a hotel when they got a call saying Emily had delivered in the car and was also in Reno – in the Sierra Medical Center emergency room.
Mary Ann started feeling stronger contractions herself, so she and her husband rushed over to Sierra Medical too. By the time she made it up four flights of stairs to the maternity ward, Mary Ann was 9 centimeters dilated and nearly ready to push.
“We made it but I am definitely worried about next time,” Mary Ann Meyers said. “It went from zero to 100 in 40 minutes.”
Moms in the area will be excited about the new birth center, Mary Ann said. Many of her friends want natural births. Though she delivered in a hospital, she did it without an epidural.
Planned out-of-hospital births in California increased by 30% over the past decade even as birth rates overall declined, according to data from the Medical Board of California.
“If there is an emergency it’s still a little risky, but it’s good to know that there are people who are capable and knowledgeable if you need help,” Mary Ann Myers said.
Lori Link, a certified nurse midwife with Plumas District Hospital, said the plan is for obstetrics staff to routinely spend time at larger institutions, to keep up their skills. 
Link, too, is optimistic about the future of maternity care in Plumas. Many of her current patients ask about the birth center and when it will open. The plan wouldn’t be sustainable if the community didn’t want it, she said. 
“I think this is a testimony to the power of listening to women,” Link said.

(Getty)The Alabama Public Charter School Commission (APCSC) received a nearly $30 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education, Executive Director Logan Searcy said Monday.
The Charter Schools Program (CSP) grant was awarded before the government shutdown and will be used to support charter schools through sub-grants. APCSC said on Facebook that Alabama was one of six states to receive the grant.
“We support both our traditional schools and our charter schools. But what’s important here is giving choice to parents for what best fits the needs of their students. So we’re looking at options and choices, and we’re looking forward to giving them those things,” Searcy said.
According to the U.S. Department of Education’s website, CSP funds may be used to create new charter schools; replicate existing ones or spread information about charter schools. The department’s website states that there are also additional funds that can be used by charter schools to find facilities, reward charter schools that form “exemplary” collaborations with traditional schools and invest in national initiatives that support charter schools.
The U.S. Department of Education said on its website that the CSP grants total $500 million, making them the biggest investment in the program’s history. 
Searcy told commissioners during the Monday work session that 23 subgrants will be given to charter schools. 
In Alabama, replication is the process an existing charter school goes through to establish another facility not on the current campus that replicates the vision, mission, grade level, academic program or instructional model. Expansion is defined as a charter school opening another school not on the campus or approved school area without replication, or when an existing school expands its program beyond the grade levels outlined in the school’s charter contract on the same campus or approved school area.
“We will have seven new charter schools. Those grants will be three years. That will mean a planning year, an implementation year and an operating year,” Searcy told commissioners. “We will have four replication charter schools over a two-year period of time. We also have four expansion school opportunities. Those grants will last over two years and we will have eight conversion charter schools over a two year period.”
Searcy said at the meeting APCSC will work with a third-party consultant annually to evaluate sub grantee applications, conduct peer reviews and review new charter school applications.
The grant will also be used to hire personnel to support the charter schools in Alabama including a project director, a community communications specialist, an assistant finance manager and four part time roles.
The federal government shutdown has halted the award process for the commission, Searcy said.
“The availability of the grant is determined by when the government goes back. At this point, we know that we have received our G5 [Technical Review Form], we will be able to draw down the money, we have worked with enough of the people that are not furloughed to know that we have gotten that underway. That was not an issue. We’re hoping that the government shutdown will cease soon so that we can get back to the timeline of our charter school grant,” Searcy said.
Searcy told commissioners the grant would help improve the existing charter schools and allow new ones to come into the state.
“We were all on board with making this grant work for our charter schools and for our future charter schools. No one wanted this grant for extra pay. We wanted this grant because it was the right thing for Alabama,” she said.
Amanda Inabinett, APCSC’s Alabama State Department of Education liaison, said at the meeting she’s glad the grant was secured and is anticipating the government’s reopening.
“We worked really hard for this grant, and I’m just so glad to see it come to fruition. I won’t lie, It was a little scary, it was a little intimidating, but I think that we’re ready for it, and we’re really ready to get all the folks on board with us. So we’re just all waiting for that moment when they say the government’s open back up,” she said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Classroom-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-12 08:56:37.108056

The move, some say, illustrates the cultural divide between urban and rural residents of the state.  
Commissioner Tommy Caviglia, who represents sportsmen on the nine-member Wildlife Commission, said at Saturday’s commission meeting in Washoe County that he opposed sanctioning the events, where the person who slaughters the most coyotes wins cash and prizes. 
Until now, coyote killing contests in Nevada have been unregulated – neither prohibited nor sanctioned by the state. Ranching and hunting enthusiasts contend that the wanton killing reduces the population, lessening the volume of coyotes preying on cattle and mule deer. 
But studies indicate populations are higher where coyotes are hunted because of a reproductive response triggered by decreased competition for food, resulting in larger litters born to younger mothers. 
The regulation passed Saturday requires that participants have a Nevada hunting or trapping permit, and establishes the season from Sept. 1 to March 31. 
“I do think it’s in poor taste. This is a polarizing subject. I don’t believe this language provides any benefit,” Cavigilia said, adding the controversy over killing contests is “U.S. wide. This issue is not going to go away. By defining it in a regulation, I believe we’re just pouring gasoline on the issue.”
Killing contests have been banned in most western states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington. Nevada competitions are routinely organized and advertised in those states.
Efforts to regulate killing contests in Colorado and Washington failed, with both states banning the contests outright in 2020. 
The rules “are theater,” wildlife advocate Stephanie Myers said during public comment. “They make it look like the Commission is doing something, while, in reality, they do nothing to stop these brutal contests with sordid prizes.”
Former Republican State Sen. Warren Hardy, now a lobbyist representing Humane World for Animals, called the vote “an offensive” response to Humane World’s campaign for a ban. The commission’s sanction of the contests on the heels of its rejection of a ban, he said, “sets an unprecedented precedent” and tells Nevadans “don’t bring your issues forward if we disagree with them, because if you do, there’s going to be a cost, and we’re going to do the opposite of what you asked.”
Hardy says he intends to “try to get the legislative commission to reject that insulting regulation and then back to the drawing board.” Legislative action, he says, “is likely our only recourse.”
One Nevada? 
Two of Nevada’s most populous municipalities, Clark County and the City of Reno, have passed resolutions to stop the contests. The commission, however, has held firm, despite threats of legislative action, or in the alternative, an overhaul of the commission. 
Activists argue hunting and ranching interests have a stranglehold on the commission, and by extension, on Nevada wildlife. 
“It is telling that the prescribed solutions to managing wildlife regularly imposed by this commission invariably involve the death, destruction and permanent removal of wildlife species and vegetation such as pinion juniper,” commented Boulder City resident Fred Voltz. “The ‘killing is conservation’ concept so often invoked has not served our state, its wildlife, or the majority of Nevadans who do not have an irrational bloodlust and need for domination and submission of wildlife species.”
The Wildlife Commission is made up of nine members who are appointed by the governor. The commission must have five “sportsmen,” i.e. hunters, fishermen or trappers who have purchased a license in three of the past four years, one rancher, one farmer, one conservationist, and one member of the public. 
It is the “the least democratic of all state boards or commissions which provide oversight to a public resource,” Don Molde, who battled the commission for decades until his death in July, said in 2021. “In fact, I’m not sure there is another that is so tilted.”  
Hardy suggests the Legislature “should also take a look at whether the board is representative of the full state. We are certainly not stopping the fight.”
Despite the outcome of the commission’s vote, activists were encouraged that three commissioners voted against regulation – Caviglia and newest members Liz Munn, who represents conservation, and Wyatt Mesna, who represents ranching interests. In the past, only the conservation representative has voted in line with activists’ interests. 
Those interests extend beyond killing contests to include the state’s recreational bear hunt, the mountain lion hunt, leghold trapping, “and most of all, the undemocratic composition” of the Wildlife Commission, Myers wrote in an email to supporters following the meeting.  
“Tommy Caviglia was right. We are not going away,” she said. “Our numbers will swell as more residents become aware of our issues.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dead-coyotes-1024x863.jpg,,,2025-11-12 07:58:38.509283

(Photo by Jason Getz-Pool/Getty Images)Attorney John Eastman, whose residence in Santa Fe prompted protests following the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, is one of the 77 people President Donald Trump pardoned recently. That pardon protects them from any criminal legal consequences for their alleged roles in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.
According to media reports and federal prosecutors, Eastman was one of two lawyers behind the effort to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to block the certification of the 2020 election and to orchestrate slates of fake electors in several states to subvert the results naming former President Joe Biden as the election winner. 
Trump’s pardon attorney, Ed Martin, posted the undated list including Eastman on social media on Sunday evening. The proclamation from Trump offers an unconditional pardon to those named for conduct related to the fake electors, “as well as for any conduct relating to their efforts to expose voting fraud and vulnerabilities in the 2020 Presidential Election.”
Jack Smith, special counsel for the Justice Department during Biden’s term, identified Eastman, along with fellow pardon recipients Rudy Giuliani and Sydney Powell, as unindicted co-conspirators in an indictment against Trump for the president’s efforts to stay in office after losing the election to Biden. 
The pardons have no immediate effect, because, as is the case with Eastman, none of the pardon recipients has been federally indicted. But the pardons preclude future presidents from bringing federal criminal cases against Eastman and others on the list, according to Politico. 
Leading up to the indictment against Trump in which Eastman was named, federal agents seized Eastman’s cell phone after confronting him in a Santa Fe restaurant parking lot, which Eastman later sued over. 
Eastman did not respond to Source New Mexico’s inquiries via email and phone call Tuesday.
Despite Trump’s pardon, Eastman is facing criminal charges in Arizona and Georgia for his alleged part in recruiting and organizing fake electors. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases, according to local news reports. 
After entering a not guilty plea at a court in Arizona last May, he told reporters that, “I had zero communications with the electors in Arizona [and] zero involvement in any of the election litigation in Arizona or legislative hearings,” the Associated Press reported. “And I am confident that with the laws faithfully applied, I will be fully exonerated at the end of this process.”
While the pardon does not affect local prosecutors’ cases, those cases are largely stalled, according to the Associated Press.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1938433171-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 07:58:38.509283

The federal government usually provides 100% of the funding for grocery benefits in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
But Rep. Jermaine Johnson plans to file a bill ahead of the upcoming legislative session to automatically provide temporary state funding to cover the food benefits for South Carolinians in any future government shutdown or pause for any other reason.
“I was one of those kids who relied on food stamps to eat,” the Hopkins Democrat said. “I know exactly what these families are facing because I lived it. That’s why I am filing a bill to make sure South Carolina families never go hungry because Washington has failed them once again.”
The draft legislation provided to the SC Daily Gazette establishes what Johnson is calling the South Carolina Nutritional Bridge Fund, which the state Department of Social Services would administer.
In the case that the U.S. Department of Agriculture announces a disruption to the SNAP program, the state agency would work through an outside contractor to load families’ normal monthly benefits onto existing debit cards using the bridge money. This would allow families to continue using their cards to buy groceries until federal funding resumes.


The bill calls for $100 million to be set aside in the budget annually until the fund reaches a balance of $500 million.
By comparison, South Carolina residents currently receive about $105 million in SNAP benefits each month. That’s across more than 260,000 households, according to DSS data.
Under the proposal, only residents already enrolled in SNAP at the time of a shutdown would continue to receive benefits through the fund.
If the account begins running low or doesn’t have enough to fully fund benefits, the state would divide the money proportionately among recipients until depleted.
The government shutdown that began Oct. 1 resulted in a suspension of food benefits for November. In South Carolina, SNAP benefits go out to recipients on a staggered schedule over the first 19 days of each month, according to a chart provided to the Gazette.
That means anyone due their monthly allotment — which last month averaged about $190 per person — between Nov. 1 and Nov. 12 has already missed out.
With the halt looming, Gov. Henry McMaster on Oct. 28 activated the One SC Fund, the state’s disaster relief fund, to collect donations and distribute them to food banks as a way to help fill the gap. But even with a record number of people donating to the fund, the aid has been a fraction of the normal benefits through SNAP.
South Carolina has a surplus of tax collections, as well as reserves, that could be tapped to help fill the gap. But only the Legislature has the authority to spend that money. And legislators aren’t scheduled to return to Columbia until mid-January.
Sen. Deon Tedder, D-Charleston, asked McMaster to force the Legislature back, but under the rules governing the off-session, he lacks that authority too. Only the chambers’ leaders can call a special session. But even if they did, a debate on how much to spend from which account — or whether to spend anything since the USDA made clear it would not reimburse states — could drag on for weeks.
It was also unclear how DSS would distribute any state money. The state’s contract with a third-party vendor covers transfers from the federal government to benefit cards. Handling state money could require a different contract.
Johnson’s bill seeks to eliminate all of those hurdles with a law that automatically triggers a transfer. It would also give DSS the authority to make any changes needed to keep the money flowing.
At least four Democrats in the state House plan to sign on as co-sponsors. Johnson plans to submit his bill when pre-filing opens Dec. 16.
But pre-filing a bill doesn’t give it any special advantage in the session that starts Jan. 13. Johnson didn’t say whether he’s gotten support, or how he hopes to get it, from Republicans who hold a supermajority in both chambers.
“D.C. dysfunction should never decide whether a child in South Carolina eats,” Johnson said. “If Washington has lost its moral compass, South Carolina will use its own. We will take care of our own and make sure no family goes hungry because politicians in Washington refuse to do their jobs.”
The longest government shutdown in history — a record set last week — is expected to end this week. But it remains unclear when full November SNAP benefits will flow.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_4632-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 07:58:38.509283

For the first time in a while, there was real collaboration.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lt. Gov. John Rodgers: A year of balance, progress and putting Vermonters first.","This commentary is by John Rodgers, lieutenant governor of Vermont.


As I wrap up my first year as Vermont’s lieutenant governor, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about where we’ve been — and where we’re headed. It’s no secret that folks are feeling squeezed these days. Whether it’s the cost of housing, heating fuel, health care or just keeping up with everyday expenses, Vermont’s affordability crisis is real, and it’s affecting people in every corner of our state.
But here’s the good news: this year, we proved that when Montpelier is balanced — when no one party can simply bulldoze the other — we can actually roll up our sleeves and get things done. For the first time in a while, there was real collaboration.
We passed important housing and infrastructure bills that will help get more homes built, improve local roads and water systems, and start tackling the cost drivers behind so many of our challenges. We also got the train moving on long-overdue education reform. None of it was easy, but the progress we made shows what’s possible when people from different parties sit down, listen to each other and find common ground. That’s the Vermont way.
It’s easy to get discouraged watching what’s happening in Washington, D.C. The partisanship, the gridlock, the finger-pointing — it’s enough to make anyone lose faith.
But Vermont isn’t Washington. We don’t have to act like them. We can still lead with respect, with decency and with the understanding that there’s more that unites us than divides us.
It’s going to take all of us working together to get Vermont back on track. That is why I have an open-door policy in my office and spend so much time traveling around the state listening to Vermonters. I know the best ideas come from working Vermonters. We can’t view running for office as a means to grow a career, rather it must be for the purpose of serving.
As a farmer, small business owner and community servant, I’ve seen a lot. But that doesn’t mean I do not have more to learn from you.
Over the next few weeks, I’ll be traveling around the state, visiting communities big and small and talking with Vermonters about what’s working — and what’s not. I want to hear directly from you about what a nonpartisan Montpelier can do better.
Gov. Phil Scott has set a great example of steady, practical leadership that puts people first, not politics. My goal is to keep building on that — to keep finding ways to make Vermont more affordable and more livable for everyone, no matter your class, income level, ZIP code or political stripe.
At the end of the day, we all want the same thing: a Vermont where our kids can grow up, our seniors can retire with dignity and families don’t have to move away just to make ends meet. That’s what drives me every day.
We may not agree on everything, but if we keep talking, keep listening and keep working together — I believe we can get there. Because that’s what Vermonters do best.

(Photo by Erick Doxey/InvestigateWest)When Camerina Zorrozua learned in April that Washington had slashed its state funding of her Spokane-based legal aid organization, she frantically called state Rep. Tarra Simmons.
“I was so alarmed, and I asked her straight up, ‘What happened?’” said Zorrozua, the legal director and co-founder of The Way to Justice.
Simmons, the first formerly incarcerated lawmaker in Washington, has vowed to fight for other formerly incarcerated people and was the state representative who Zorrozua thought would have fought hardest against the cuts. 
In 2021, Simmons, D-Bremerton, helped secure state funding to help hundreds of thousands of people vacate drug-related convictions from their criminal records, after the Washington Supreme Court deemed the state’s felony drug possession law to be unconstitutional in a ruling known as State v. Blake. In 2023, Simmons was able to vacate her own felony convictions. In media reports, she said it felt like she had been liberated from an “invisible prison.”

But the state Legislature’s decision in April to slash funding was a blow to organizations like The Way to Justice that have been key in providing legal support to those eligible to vacate their cases. And Simmons didn’t offer Zorrozua much of an explanation. 
“She made it seem like she didn’t know,” Zorrozua said. 
In fact, emails obtained by InvestigateWest show that, behind the scenes, Simmons supported the cuts, telling her colleagues that the state was nearly done with its work despite state data showing that only 38% of all the unconstitutional convictions had been vacated as of July 2025.
“My position about Blake legal funding is that it is wasteful regardless of which organization gets it,” Simmons wrote in an email to other lawmakers, including the chair and vice chairs of the House appropriations committee, where budget recommendations are made.
“In a time where we are in a budget shortfall and making decisions about cutting services to our most vulnerable people in WA, I do not believe community outreach to try and find class members four years after the case is a priority,” she wrote.
The emails, which state lawmakers have historically fought to be exempt from public disclosure, give a peek into the decision-making that left the impacted legal aid organizations and the state agency that doles out the funds confused and scrambling. The Office of Civil Legal Aid was originally allocated around $5 million in both the draft House and Senate biannual budgets to support its Blake-related civil legal aid efforts, but in the waning days of the legislative session, the funding disappeared from the final budget.
In State v. Blake, the Washington Supreme Court ruled that the state’s simple drug possession law was unconstitutional because it lacked language related to criminal intent, effectively criminalizing even “innocent and passive possession” of drugs in violation of a person’s due process rights. The historic decision not only made Washington’s law void but also made an estimated 330,000 past misdemeanor and felony convictions dating as far back as 1971 eligible to be wiped from a person’s criminal record. The state also must refund any financial costs stemming from the convictions. The number of eligible cases is considered a significant undercount because Washington’s court system makes it difficult to gather historical conviction data.
Simmons told InvestigateWest that it wasn’t her intention to harm legal aid organizations, but given the extremely tight state budget, difficult decisions had to be made. “I’ve always fought for my community,” she said. “But my community also needs things like housing and food.”

But others have argued that the cuts were less about cost savings and more about her ongoing personal conflict with one of the state-supported legal aid organizations, Civil Survival. She served as its executive director from 2015 until she was fired from the organization in July 2024 following two separate third-party investigations that found repeated violations of the organization’s policies, according to an open letter from its Board of Directors. When the budget cuts were made, Simmons was simultaneously suing the organization, which had received around $800,000 in 2023 and 2024 to support its Blake-related work, according to state contracts. The 2023 contract was signed by Simmons.
“Those funds weren’t wasteful when she was at the organization,” said Virla Spencer, the co-founder and CEO of The Way to Justice, referring to Simmons’ time at Civil Survival. “So make it make sense.”
 Still a long way to go

On April 14, Washington state Sen. Drew Hansen sent an email to two budget analysts asking if cutting the Blake funding to the civil legal aid organizations would “do great damage.” It was two weeks before the budget was set to be finalized, during a time when every program was facing scrutiny as lawmakers scrambled to address a projected $16 billion budget shortfall.
Hansen, D-Bainbridge Island, wrote in the email that Simmons had shared with him that most of the state’s Blake-related work was “done” and that they were reaching the point of diminishing returns. Hansen, a lawyer, helped Simmons vacate her criminal record in 2023.
“I actually think my colleague may be on to something here (like, do we really need to do ‘outreach’ at the magnitudes that we’re currently doing),” Hansen wrote in an email to a budget analyst in April. “But I don’t have any expertise in this area and it’s hard for me to evaluate.”
While Simmons claimed to her fellow lawmakers that the Blake work was nearly complete, state data tells a different story.

Only 29% of eligible cases in superior courts; 10% of cases in district courts; and 36% of cases in municipal courts have been successfully vacated as of July 2025, according to a data analysis compiled by the Washington Office of Public Defense using Washington State Patrol data. The team estimates it will take another six years to vacate the remaining cases. 
In Kitsap County, which Hansen and Simmons represent, 57% of cases in Superior Court, 18% of cases in the municipal court, and 2% in the District Court have been vacated. There are approximately 6,117 cases left in the county eligible to be vacated.
Simmons told InvestigateWest that she thinks the cases that are left are for people who have either moved out of state or died, which is why she felt like the funds should be allocated elsewhere. When directed to the state data showing that only 38% of eligible cases have been vacated as of July 2025, Simmons said she still stood by her assessment. 
“Seniors need food, kids need food, Medicaid is being cut, and undocumented citizens need civil legal aid,” she said. “It just does not seem like that is the top priority.”
While some courts have been proactive in identifying and vacating eligible Blake cases, others have left it up to the individuals to navigate the convoluted system and initiate the process independently. The state has been working to streamline the process and provide more support to local courts tasked with identifying and vacating their eligible cases, but there’s still a long way to go.
The process, which has to be initiated at the court where the conviction was given, involves three distinct steps: resentencing cases that involve more than just a possession charge; vacating eligible cases off a person’s criminal record; and filing a refund request with the state’s Blake Refund Bureau once a vacate is issued, which can be anywhere from a few dollars to thousands.
Civil legal aid and reentry organizations have been critical in helping to get the word out about the historic ruling and guiding people through the legal process. According to previous state contracts, the state funding historically doled out by the state’s Office of Civil Legal Aid was specifically to fund legal services, public education campaigns and targeted services for people impacted by President Richard Nixon’s “war on drugs,” which helped fuel mass incarceration and disproportionately targeted communities of color. 
While the funding to the Office of Civil Legal Aid was cut this year, two other state agencies are still receiving funding related to Blake: the Office of Public Defense, to support counties proactively working through their Blake cases; and the Administrative Office of the Courts, which provides refunds for any legal financial obligations paid as a result of the unconstitutional conviction.
Zorrozua, from The Way to Justice, said she’s grateful for the work Rep. Simmons has done around criminal justice reforms, like helping to pass the New Hope Act, which makes it easier for a person to vacate their criminal record to improve access to housing and employment.
But Simmons is “way off base here” about Blake funding, she said.
Outreach is a critical component of Blake work, Zorrozua said. They’ve planned pop-up events, vaccination clinics and tabling at community events where they can meet people outside of a court setting to build trust.
“She’s forgetting about all of her brothers and sisters who have been through the carceral process, who don’t have the privilege to have private counsel come in and clear their records,” Zorrozua said.

In late October, Zorrozua said she assisted a man with immigration status issues who had a Blake-eligible conviction on his record. Removing the unconstitutional conviction from his record would “make a huge difference” in whether or not he wins his immigration case, she added. Since the budget cuts, the Way to Justice has had to start charging clients for its services. 
“I don’t want to wait for our clients to die to close the Blake file,” she stressed. “They are entitled to relief. They were entitled to relief years ago.”
Zorrozua said it feels as if Simmons has a short-term memory.
“Because I remember when I went into one of her campaign events, this used to be what Tarra ran on, justice for impacted communities,” she said. “She’s saying she’s focusing on immigration, housing and employment. And it’s like, how the hell don’t you see the connections between those things?”
 ‘Personal conflict’

In the email to her fellow lawmakers at the end of the 2025 legislative session, Simmons acknowledged she had a “personal conflict” with Civil Survival but stressed to her peers that she wasn’t advocating for the funding to be cut specifically from her former organization, but to all of the organizations.
Simmons was fired in 2024 from Civil Survival for repeatedly mistreating staff and violating policies, according to a statement published by the organization’s staff, and for threatening to cut off critical funding.
She later sued the organization for discrimination and wrongful termination, alleging that she didn’t receive the disability accommodations she’d requested for post-traumatic stress disorder. They reached a settlement in September 2025 for an undisclosed amount. “I got a large amount of money because they harmed me,” she said. “It’s been a very painful thing.”
Corey Guilmette, the co-executive director at Civil Survival, told InvestigateWest that they chose to settle the case with Simmons to protect the formerly incarcerated members of their staff from having to testify in court.
“We are dedicated to helping our community heal and continuing litigation that would force not only directly impacted staff members, but community members, including people in prison, to confront their trauma in a courtroom, did not advance that mission,” he said. 
Guilmette said the state funding cuts caused them to lay off staff attorneys. 
“We pretty much have to turn away two-thirds of clients, because if we say yes to any more than that, we know that we won’t be able to serve people adequately,” he said.

In the run-up to the 2020 election, all 20 Democratic presidential candidates promised voters they’d pursue bold changes to health care, such as a government-run insurance plan or expanding Medicare to cover every American.
Fast-forward to the congressional stalemate that has closed the federal government for more than a month. Democrats, entrenched on one side of the legislative battle, staked their political future on merely preserving parts of the Affordable Care Act — a far cry from the systemic health policy changes that party members once described as crucial for tackling the high price of care.
Democrats succeeded in focusing national attention on rising health insurance costs, vowing to hold up funding for the federal government until a deal could be made to extend the more generous tax subsidies that have cut premiums for Obamacare plans. Their doggedness could help them win votes in midterm elections next year.
But health care prices are rocketing, costly high-deductible plans are proliferating, and 4 in 10 adults have some form of health care debt. As health costs reach a crisis point, a yawning gulf exists between voters’ desire for more aggressive action and the political urgency in Washington for sweeping change.
“There isn’t a lot of eagerness among politicians,” said Jonathan Gruber, an economist who played a key role in drafting the ACA. “Why aren’t they being more bold? Probably scars from the ACA fights. But health care is a winning issue. The truth is we need universal coverage and price regulation.”
Voters rank lowering health care costs as a top priority, above housing, jobs, immigration, and crime, according to a September poll by Hart Research Associates for Families USA, a consumer health advocacy group.
And costs are climbing. Premiums for job-based health insurance rose 6% in 2025 to an average of $26,993 a year for family coverage, according to an annual survey of employers released Oct. 22 by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. For all the attention given to grocery, gas, and energy prices, health premiums and deductibles in recent years have risen faster than overall inflation and wages.
Democratic headwinds
The appetite for big, bold ideas to drive down such high costs has waned in part because Democrats lack political leverage, according to economists, political strategists, and health care advocates. They’ve also been burned before for backing significant changes.
After the ACA was enacted in 2010, for example, a backlash over the law — and its mandate that most everyone have insurance — helped Republicans win the House and gain seats in the Senate. In 2016, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton backed the public option, a proposed government-run plan that would compete against commercial insurance. She lost to Donald Trump.
Democrats are also outnumbered in Congress. Sweeping changes to health care, such as the creation of Medicaid and Medicare and passage of the ACA, historically have occurred when one party has controlled both Congress and the presidency. Republicans currently have all that muscle. So for now, Democrats are fighting to preserve the status quo while portraying Republicans as a threat to Americans’ insurance coverage.
If the ACA subsidies aren’t extended, many of the roughly 24 million people who buy coverage on the health law’s marketplaces will see their premiums more than double next year, according to KFF. A KFF Health Tracking Poll released Nov. 6 found that three-quarters of the public supported extending them.
“There’s no doubt people believe the current system needs reform,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist. “Protecting people from premium increases is part of that. You don’t win the future by losing the present.”
Even bipartisan legislative proposals aimed at lowering health costs have fizzled in an environment defined by political threats and partisan social media attacks.
Bills that would have improved health care price transparency and reined in companies that manage prescription drug benefits gained traction in late 2024 as part of a spending package. Then Elon Musk, who was serving as a senior adviser to President-elect Trump, took to his social media platform, X, to rally opposition, deriding the budget bill for what he asserted was excessive government spending.
GOP leaders dropped the health provisions, prompting Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) to say on X that Musk “tweeted to kill” the bipartisan health policies that Congress had hammered out.
But Democrats’ focus on health care has cut both ways. Their messaging amid efforts to save the ACA from repeal and to preserve the law’s protections for those with preexisting conditions helped the party take back the House in the 2018 midterm elections. “I still have PTSD from the experience,” Republican Mike Johnson, now the House speaker, said recently.
And voters want relief. Six in 10 Americans are extremely or very worried about health care costs rising next year, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.
Hagen Wenzek, 56, is among them. The chief executive of GI Digital, a high-tech startup, felt a pain in his calf in late summer and asked OpenAI’s ChatGPT what it might be. It suggested he could have deep-vein thrombosis, or a blood clot. He went to the emergency room and obtained an ultrasound that confirmed the diagnosis, so doctors monitored him and gave him blood thinners.
His insurance was billed $7,422, and Wenzek got a bill for $890. The average cost of an ultrasound is about $400 without insurance, according to GoodRx, a digital health platform.
“The hospital is making thousands for a procedure that costs $500. It’s kind of ridiculous,” said Wenzek, of Sleepy Hollow, New York. “I have a $40 copay just to go see a doctor for anything, and I’m on a startup budget.”
‘Defending the Status Quo’
The lack of bolder ideas to tackle spiraling costs could also work against Democrats, some critics say. Comedian and political commentator Jon Stewart, in an episode of his podcast in October, accused Democrats of committing “malpractice” by not presenting ideas to fix what people hate about the health care system. Instead, he said, they’re shutting the government down to protect a system that voters already believe is failing them.
“Once again, the Democrats are in a position of defending the status quo of policies that most people in the United States think suck,” he said. “Meanwhile, on the same day, Trump rolls out TrumpRx. Hey, I’ll just threaten Pfizer with 100% tariffs and then just open up a prescription drug outside of the middle managers and sell directly to the public at a discount.”
TrumpRx, which is intended to help patients find lower-priced drugs, and pledges by Big Pharma to lower drug prices could help the GOP with voters, though Democrats are also hammering Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the bill the president signed into law in July that reduces Medicaid spending by about $1 trillion over a decade.
Republicans are promising fixes, using the shutdown to try to leverage voter frustration. Vice President JD Vance said on Newsmax in October that “we do have a plan, actually,” in reference to a question about health care reform. (Trump has promised repeatedly that he would produce a plan to replace the ACA but never has.)
Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on CNBC in October that Trump wants to overhaul the ACA and “give people health insurance that is higher-quality and more affordable.”
The White House did not respond to an email requesting comment from Vance.
“It’s not that Democrats are focusing on tax credits to the exclusion of bigger, bolder reforms,” said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA. “If you can get the conversation on health care, if we can prevent premiums from spiking, then we can focus on why health care costs so darn much to begin with.”
But some Democrats say voters are hurting and want bigger and bolder ideas now. Earlier this year, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said on the podcast “Fast Politics” that the party needs to offer more on health care in the next election.
“I’ll tell you what people are going to expect,” he said. “They’re not going to expect us to tinker around the edge with the ACA. They’re going to expect universal health care.”
For now, at least, there are more innovative ideas in states. Oregon has established a governing board to set up a single-payer health system in which the state would take on health care financing — eliminating private insurance, premiums, and all deductibles for all residents as soon as 2027. The question is whether it will work. Vermont abandoned a similar effort in 2014.
“With the political environment we’re in, there isn’t currently an appetite for big reform, but we know it needs to happen,” said Mona Shah, the senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, a health advocacy group. “Across party lines, people want government intervention in health care and people want universal coverage. The pain point that people are feeling, the public sentiment is where we were at before the ACA.”

(Getty Images)Parents of autistic children — and ABA therapy providers — may soon encounter new usage limits, reimbursement rates and other changes as Indiana attempts to slow rising Medicaid spending.
About 20 recommendations, released Wednesday morning by a state-backed panel, could shape upcoming service shifts for thousands of Hoosiers.
“There will still be growth, just not as much, and it still protects the current ABA access for children and families who need it,” said Eric Miller, the deputy secretary and chief of staff for the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration.

Miller was among the nearly two-dozen state leaders, health professionals and others charged with evaluating “cost containment” strategies that “minimize” the negative impact on enrollees. Gov. Mike Braun directed FSSA to organize the working group in a February executive order.
Applied behavior analysis, or ABA, therapy is often used to improve communication and learning skills in children and young adults with autism or other developmental disorders.
Its popularity has surged in recent years. More than 8,000 Hoosiers rely on Medicaid to pay for ABA therapy, with most of them between three and eight years of age.
“This is something that’s very valuable — but at the same time, we know it’s unsustainable, the current cost trajectory,” said Miller. His agency, FSSA, administers the state’s Medicaid program.
Two of Miller’s own children have benefitted from ABA therapy.
Other recommendations are meant to boost quality and improve oversight, in response to a revealing federal audit.
Program updates on the way — again
Indiana’s Medicaid program began covering ABA services in 2016, spending about $21 million over the following year.
Expenditures peaked at $611 million in 2023, and dropped slightly to $445 million in 2024, after former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration set lower reimbursement rates.
His FSSA also moved to limit services.


A Medicaid State Plan Amendment, which was set to take effect April 1, would’ve capped treatment to 30 hours weekly for three years — retroactively. That would have cut off about half of the children using the service immediately.
Braun’s administration pulled that proposal.
“The governor decided this was cruel and unusual punishment, and we weren’t going to do that,” FSSA Secretary Mitch Roob said.
The agency filed another State Plan Amendment, with a July 1 effective date, that would’ve raised weekly limits for enrollees with higher needs — and applied prospectively. But it’s also getting scrapped.
FSSA plans to use Wednesday’s findings to draw up a new slate of changes.
Without intervention, costs could reach an estimated $825 million in 2029. Officials say that the state can’t afford that.

“The working group and the whole package of recommendations … is projected to reduce that annual growth rate (to) around 7%-8% instead of 13%,” Miller said.
There’s no dollar amount in anticipated savings available yet, however.
“We don’t make these choices in a vacuum, right? We provide services to 1.8 million people,” Roob said.
The agency plans to bring an ABA proposal — and a new Medicaid revenue forecast — to the State Budget Committee in December.
It could submit an updated State Plan Amendment to the federal government by the end of the year. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services must approve the modifications for them to take effect.
Key usage, rate changes
The working group recommended doing away with weekly limits and tiers of care on “comprehensive” ABA therapy, opting to instead pose a “lifetime” allocation of 4,000 hours.
That is fewer hours than the previous proposals would’ve allowed over a three-year period, but it is more flexible, Miller emphasized — and it’s not retroactive.
Once that cap is hit, enrollees would be eligible for up to 15 hours of “targeted” therapy per week.
Cuts to reimbursement rates for one-on-one therapy are likely, although the group didn’t agree on a specific number or range to endorse in the report.
“FSSA may reduce current rates for individual ABA therapy as deemed necessary to stay within the agency’s appropriated budget,” the recommendation reads.
Rates for group therapy, however, may be raised.

The state’s “significantly” lower reimbursement has driven low utilization, the working group found.
Hiking rates to “financially viable” levels would promote “one-on-one therapy time for children with the most significant needs, while providing a cost-effective, appropriate ‘step-down’ option for others.”
Decisions on rates are expected closer to FSSA’s presentation before the State Budget Committee next month, according to Miller.
Parents could also be required to get involved in their children’s therapy. The working group recommended nine to 18 hours of coaching or training per six-month authorization period.
“This therapy is usually done (outside) the home, which means the parent … can choose to be less engaged,” Roob said. “If the taxpayer’s spending that much money on helping this child, we believe that parent or caregiver needs to be engaged.”

Other recommendations seek to help children transition out of comprehensive care, when appropriate, and move on to lower-intensity or alternative forms of support.
“It’s (about) what’s next for the child … once they graduate (from) ABA therapy,” Miller said.
He recalled transition planning beginning “almost immediately” for his children, like if they’d continue being home-schooled or move on to public or private schools. Therapy activities can change depending on those goals, Miller noted.
FSSA has been following cohorts of enrollees who began therapy in 2020, according to the report, and found “no observable decline” in average weekly hours after three years of care.
Accreditation, location changes for providers
Indiana has more than ABA 320 therapy locations, per the report. The number of providers shot up by 25% between just 2023 and 2025.
The state currently doesn’t require any accreditation or licensure for ABA therapy organizations to bill Medicaid — or have any other limits on provider growth.
The working group agreed that should change.
“We really saw that there was an increased need for that oversight to ensure that the growing number of providers really are providing high-quality ABA therapy,” Miller said.
The report suggested requirements cover quality, service ratios and outcomes monitoring; risk management and patient safety; and more.
Story continues below.
EO 25-31 ABA Working Group Recommendations Final
 
The state could use an existing accreditation body like the Autism Commission on Quality, or an external vendor. Miller said there have been “pre-conversations” with ACQ.
“What I would say is, over the next month or two, we’d be putting the details out there, and then it’s probably like a yearlong process, because we’ve got to go through all the providers,” he added.
The working group also took aim at areas with overly high concentrations of ABA sites in hopes of encouraging expansion in underserved communities.
Sites are mostly in urban locations in central and northern Indiana, with “noticeably fewer” providers southwest.
Under one recommendation, FSSA would request federal approval to temporarily block new providers or sites in designated counties from billing to Medicaid. The six-month moratorium could be extended.
The agency would “evaluate the implications” to avoid unwanted consequences, like providers establishing sites in neighboring counties that serve the same areas or starting in-home ABA services.
In the meantime, FSSA would create “incentives” for providers to expand to areas with fewer options. It’s unclear what form those strategies might take, however.
“To be determined,” FSSA spokesman Marcus Barlow wrote.
Other strategies
Private insurers took some heat in the report, too.
“Evidence suggests that, in general, private insurers pay below Medicaid rates for ABA,” working group members wrote. They asserted that’s creating “perverse incentives” for providers to prefer Medicaid-covered children. And, Medicaid has to pay the difference between the private and public rates for those who have both insurance types.
Braun’s administration should consider supporting legislation to require group health insurers to adopt a rate schedule above Medicaid rates, they recommended. Group plans are purchased by employers from state-regulated insurance carriers. However, 70% of Hoosiers with private insurance have employer-funded plans, which are regulated at the federal level.
The working group additionally recommended that Indiana beef up its third-party liability processes, which the Medicaid program uses to identify and collect payments from other responsible parties — like private insurance companies. The report emphasized that those insurers are the primary payer when coverage exists, with Medicaid being the “payer of last resort.”
Under another recommendation, FSSA would work with schools on their responsibilities. When ABA is medically necessary, Medicaid or private insurance funds it, but when the therapy is a behavioral support, schools fund it. State rules and federal law guarantee disabled children the right to a free and appropriate public education.
Does the state’s Open Door law apply to the ABA working group?

The report calls for FSSA to create a dedicated program office within the agency, which could implement many of the suggested strategies.
Right now, a trio of divisions hold ABA-related responsibilities, according to the report. One is the Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning.
“Their job is to pay claims,” Roob said. “A claim comes in; they pay it, right? That’s what they’re told to do, right? They’re not told to be managing a program. They’re paying a claim.”
The new entity would have staff with clinical expertise, too.
There’s no set timeline. Miller said FSSA would start “as soon as we can find a qualified person” and build it out from there.
Several of the recommendations the program office could handle focus on improving service quality and fighting waste, fraud and abuse.
In a 2024 report, the U.S. Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General audited Indiana’s 2019 and 2020 ABA payments and found $56 million in improper payments and an additional $78 million in potentially improper payments. It recommended that Indiana refund more than $39 million to the federal government.
The audit cited problems with documentation, diagnostic evaluations, staff credentials, referrals and more. Cheaper group work was charged as more expensive individual therapies, or billed time included non-therapeutic activities like meal and bathroom breaks, for example.
FSSA is auditing the claims identified in the federal report and requiring refunds of any identified overpayments, according to the working group. The agency also initiated a program integrity review of Medicaid claims paid for ABA therapy from 2022 through 2025, and when it’s done, will make providers refund overpayments and go through compliance training.

I just love seeing their smiling, hopeful faces, watching them grow and learn, and welcoming the trust and love they bring to us every day.
At the same time, working in this field can be challenging. Babies and young children require a great deal of love and care, informed by expertise in early childhood development. Low pay is challenging for providers, and high costs are challenging for families.
But some states are looking for answers — and I believe mine has found one. New Mexico is now expanding its free, high-quality child care program so that all families can access it. It’s the first of its kind in the nation — and I hope other states will follow.
As of November 1, all families in the state are eligible for universal, no-cost child care. New facilities will be built, existing child care centers can apply for funds to improve their facilities, and child care providers will receive pay boosts.
Prior to this, our no-cost child care was available only to families with incomes up to 400 percent of the poverty line, and there were cost-prohibitive copay structures. This meant that we had to turn away many needy families.
When parents and caretakers can’t get child care, they lose work, educational opportunities, and enrichment opportunities for their kids. Or when families scrape to afford the exorbitant cost of child care, the rest of their budget — such as food, housing, healthcare, and educational expenses — suffers.
The purpose of this new, no-cost, universal child care program is many-fold: to improve early childhood education outcomes; to support parents’ ability to work; to provide child care workers with a livable wage; to increase the number and quality of child care centers; and to reduce the cost burden to families and strengthen communities.
Families will save an average of $12,000 per year with this program. That’s life-changing money for most working families. The universal program is funded by surplus revenues from New Mexico’s oil and gas industry and a portion of the Land Grant Permanent Fund — and the funds are paid directly to child care facilities.
I’ve been a teacher in the child care space for 25 years — and I’ve witnessed firsthand the problems this new program is meant to address.
I feel heartbroken each time we have to turn away a family who is desperate for care but can’t afford it. I see the positive impact our child care programs have on children, including lifelong benefits for their physical and emotional well-being and for their future educational and workforce attainment.
Former students who are now adults regularly reach out to me and thank me for all the care they remember receiving. I’m humbled by each act of thoughtfulness from these now successful adults. Recently, one family for whom I taught all five of their children invited me to be the guest of honor at a graduation for one of the adult children. I can’t put into words how special and appreciated that made me feel.
Child care centers are pillars of the community, providing an excellent start in life for our children, freeing up parents and caretakers to earn a living, and strengthening the economy and well-being of our communities. It’s a travesty that child care is prohibitively expensive — and that child care workers are woefully underpaid in the rest of the country.
Taking care of our children and setting them up for success is the best thing we can do for our families, our communities, and our nation. My hope is that all states will follow New Mexico’s lead and enact a similar, no-cost universal child care program for all families.

(Courtesy photo)Six Hoosier school communities sought to pass referendums in the most recent election. Five succeeded, and one fell short. Yet just a few weeks earlier, postcards went out to constituents all across Indiana in which state representatives touted the 5% increase in K-12 funding last session as the “highest funding level to date for Hoosier students.” 
In addition, the postcards claimed that the latest educational results prove that Indiana is leading the way by “putting students first.” To be clear, adding even one penny to last year’s budget would also produce “the highest funding level to date.” While we at the Indiana Coalition for Public Education celebrate the successes of our public schools and the hard work of educators and students, we urge Hoosiers to look beyond the glossy postcard for a fuller picture. 
While the highest dollar amount for K-12 education funding may have emerged from last session, it is not the highest level of funding we have seen. Ball State University Economist Michael Hicks has written that currently, when adjusted for inflation, “in K-12 we are spending $100 less per student each year today than in 2010.” Also, in 2024, the Education Data Initiative reported that Indiana ranks 37th of 50 states in education spending per pupil. 
Fewer Resources, more subsidies 
Alongside the lack of budget support for public schools, bills passed last session are poised to reduce public education funding. A property tax overhaul, SEA1, will cut the revenue that public schools rely upon for transportation, capital projects, and referendums. Another new law will require public school districts to share their property taxes with charter schools — publicly funded, privately run entities — further draining resources. While Indiana struggles to pay teachers a competitive salary during a teacher shortage, these priorities do not add up. 
Last session, lawmakers lifted the income cap on Indiana’s largest voucher program, making millionaires and billionaires eligible to receive taxpayer-funded subsidies for their private school tuition payments. More students are now getting a smaller piece of a shrinking education pie. Last school year alone, nearly a half billion dollars went to voucher schools, which legally don’t have to account for where the money goes. 
Literacy is foundational to all learning, and early childhood education is foundational to all educational outcomes. Yet, while our legislature gave K-12 vouchers to the wealthiest Hoosier children for their private school tuition, they simultaneously took away vouchers for child care and slashed access to state-funded preschool for many of our most vulnerable kids. 
Accountability for public school funding
While we celebrate the progress of Hoosier students and the dedication that got them back to pre-pandemic-level scores on the IREAD test, we should recognize the impact of outside dollars poured into improving reading. Much of the touted gains in literacy were made possible thanks to the $2.9 billion distributed to Indiana by the federal government to help in recovery from the pandemic and learning “loss.” Additionally, students benefited from generous private funds from the Lilly Endowment for literacy. Money does matter. 
The aforementioned postcard also highlighted Indiana as ranking third in a Parent Power category by an organization promoting “school choice.” Hoosier parents overwhelmingly choose to send their children to public schools. Parents know the value of strong public schools. It is time for them to use their voices, their power, to ensure that the state funds and supports the public schools every child deserves. It is time to ask why we must vote locally to tax ourselves through referendums when the state fails to meet its constitutional obligation to ensure our public schools have what they need—while opportunity gaps widen for Hoosier kids. 
We celebrate the recent rise in test scores, as well as the magic that happens every day in our public schools. Yet, we also look to the future with concern and hope. Public schools are the heart of our communities — places that unite us across all backgrounds, accept all students, and empower our kids to become contributing members of our society. True commitment to “putting students first” means fully investing in our public schools so that every Hoosier child can thrive.

(Photo by Getty Images)Chuck Johnson raises timely issues in his Reformer commentary, “Time to rethink human services as Trump administration dumps costs on counties.”
Minnesota’s human service system is facing a crisis, and policy makers should seize the opportunity to rethink state and county roles.  
The state-supervised, county-delivered structure we rely on today was developed nearly a century ago, in the era of pen and paper, when the most practical way to apply for public assistance was to walk into a county office and fill out forms in person. 
But the world has changed dramatically. 
Today, Minnesotans expect services that are simple, fast and accessible online — anytime, from anywhere. The county office is no longer as convenient as the phone in our pocket. It is time to rethink how we structure and deliver human services across the state.
Human services programs touch nearly every Minnesotan at some point in life. 
The system supports parents caring for young children; adults struggling with mental health or substance use; seniors who need help remaining in their homes; people with disabilities who want to live independently; and families seeking food or housing stability during difficult times. 
These are not abstract programs. They support our neighbors, our co-workers, and often our own families. A well-functioning system strengthens families and communities and reduces long-term public costs. 
But when the system is confusing, slow, or fragmented, the consequences can be profound both for the Minnesotans seeking help and for the public resources that sustain them.
The core challenge of the state-county system is the disconnect between the Legislature, state agencies and county governments. 
The Legislature writes the laws. 
State agencies interpret, manage, and supervise them. 
Counties are responsible for delivering the services directly to residents. 
Over time, layers of well-intentioned rules and safeguards have accumulated, often in response to specific concerns or headlines. Each layer adds complexity — with new forms, verification steps, or reporting requirements. The result is a system that is difficult for residents to navigate and expensive to administer. County staff who want to help people instead spend hours verifying paperwork, chasing documentation, and ensuring compliance with sometimes contradictory requirements. 
Historically, the Legislature and state agencies did not feel the urgency to invest in better county technology or streamlined administrative processes, perhaps because by virtue of their roles they do not see the day-to-day inefficiencies that seep into the county budgets. We believe that is changing, as evidenced by the $40 million investment in updating one system last year — but there are many more systems that need the same attention.
For example, counties have estimated that just four areas of inefficiency — duplicate data entry, manual renewals, inefficient programming, and manual notices sent to clients because of system errors — cost more than $23 million per year in staff time.
Compounding the challenge, Minnesota counties are facing a tsunami of new “cost shares” from both federal and state governments, and we are struggling to stay afloat. This method of reducing state and federal budgets does not reduce the overall cost of the programs. It just shifts the cost down to property taxes instead of state and federal taxes. 
These challenges are why counties agree that it is time for the Legislature to invest in a comprehensive review of state and county responsibilities. 
This review should examine which services are best delivered consistently and centrally — through statewide systems, shared technology platforms, or uniform processes — and which are most effective when localized and tailored to community needs. 
For example, eligibility determinations and routine administrative processes may be more efficient if standardized statewide. 
In contrast, services like child protection, behavioral health coordination, and support for older adults often require close relationships with local providers, schools, law enforcement and community organizations. 
The goal should not be to shift everything to one level or another, but to align responsibility with the level of government best equipped to deliver high-quality service.
Counties are eager to be partners in this work. We see the strain on frontline staff, on families navigating complex requirements, and on property taxpayers funding a system that has not been updated to match modern needs. We also recognize the commitment of the Legislature and state agencies, who share our goal of serving Minnesotans effectively and responsibly.
Our state has a history of innovation and collaboration in public service. Our state-supervised, county-administered system was the right choice for Minnesotans when it was created. 
Now, we have an opportunity now to create a more streamlined and sustainable system — one that meets people where they are, reduces administrative burden, and uses public resources wisely.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/old-personcane-GettyImages-946924536-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-11-12 07:58:38.509283

(Photo by George Wuerthner).Prescribed burning is often promoted as a magic bullet that can prevent large wildfires, but it has several disadvantages that are seldom discussed.

The presumed purpose of the National Prescribed Fire Act 2025 is to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires by investing in managing hazardous fuels. The legislation would accelerate and expand the use of prescribed burns during cooler, wetter months.
The legislation also includes a clause increasing the percentage of federal land on which prescribed burns occur each year. The legislation requires that the acreage burned be increased by 10% more than the amount burned in previous years.
While the goal is admirable—to reduce wildfire threats to communities—the assertion that such prescribed burns can reduce “catastrophic” fires is delusional. It displays the faulty expectations inherent in the legislation.
Large, so-called “catastrophic” blazes occur only when the right combination of climate and weather conditions exists. Extreme fire weather requires severe drought, low humidity, high temperatures, and, most importantly, high winds.
Fires that ignite under less-than-extreme fire weather conditions usually burn a small acreage and often self-extinguish, with or without fire suppression. In the United States, 98% of the fires never burn more than 300 acres.
On the other hand, if you have high winds—the conditions that lead to “catastrophic” blazes, prescribed burns don’t stop fire spread. Wind will blow embers over or around any area of a prescribed burn.
High winds regularly blow embers over lands without fuel, such as 16-lane freeways or across mile-wide rivers, as the 2017 Eagle Creek Fire did in the Columbia Gorge.
The second problem with the proposal is that you can’t predict where a fire will occur. On all U.S. Forest Service lands across the conterminous U.S., 6.2% of prescribed fire-treated areas from 2003–2022 encountered a subsequent wildfire in 2004–2023.
However, this statistic is deceptive. Just because a fire encountered a treated area does not mean the treatment had any effect on fire spread.
Beware of the time factor. For example, a study of smoke emissions in treated areas compared to untreated areas, showed a 14% reduction in particulate matter. However, the study focused on prescribed burns two years old or less. No one doubts that if a fire encounters a prescribed burn shortly after treatment, it can sometimes have an influence.
The effectiveness of fuel reductions declines over time. In many instances, burning or thinning promotes new plant growth. Often, within a few years, you may have more fuel than before treatment.
What grows back is dominated by “fine fuels” like grasses and shrubs. These fuels are more “flammable” than trees, large branches, logs, and other debris that may have existed prior to prescribed fire. So, prescribed burns can alter the fuel composition, increasing the likelihood of burning.
The only solution to this problem of plant regrowth is frequent burning. Depending on the plant community, one may need to reburn it every few years to preclude the creation of higher fuel loads. To be effective, you must continue the prescribed burning forever.
This means citizens must be ready to accept smoke as a nearly year-round inconvenience and health hazard.
I cannot delve into the entire flawed argument that “a hundred years of fire suppression” has led to fuel buildups or that Indian burning precluded large wildfires that proponents use to justify burns, but I encourage readers to consult my commentary on this issue.
The strategic use of prescribed burns near homes and communities may have some utility, but the advantages are grossly exaggerated. Given the many disadvantages, whether this is worth the costs is rarely discussed. Ultimately, we must address climate change, which is the underlying cause of large wildfires and hardened homes, so they are less vulnerable to any wildfire ignitions.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Wisconsin Democrats have announced a bill that would cap residential energy bills at 2% of household income. 
On Tuesday, Democrats said the proposal from Rep. Darrin Madison (D-Milwaukee) would protect Wisconsinites’ bank accounts while the state finds ways to expand clean energy production in the face of climate change and manage the increasing energy burden posed by data center developments across the state. 
“Rising energy rates are becoming an unsustainable burden on regular people in Wisconsin,” Madison said at a Tuesday morning press conference. “Our energy system still has big problems to tackle, like dramatically moving towards carbon-free electricity, or the challenge of data centers, which are currently on course to double the amount of energy creation in Wisconsin. Regardless of your stance on data centers, artificial intelligence and the role these technologies can or should play in our communities, the people of Wisconsin must have their energy burden lifted. This bill is a common sense, necessary protection for people struggling to afford their basic needs before we take further action on any of these things as legislators to address those issues.”
At the press conference, residents who have struggled with energy bills spoke about how getting power disconnected can reverberate through people’s lives, causing health problems or forcing choices between other household costs. 
“We’re doing everything we can, yet we still cannot keep up,” said Jill Sexton, a Wausau resident who is on disability assistance with a husband on Social Security. “I ended up taking a part time job specifically to cover the increase in our electric and heating bills. Nowadays, here’s our reality: Each month we choose between paying the electric bill and heat bill or filling our prescriptions. Some months I don’t buy the medication. Some months we stretch food until the very last day.”
Several lawmakers tied the bill to the national Democratic party’s growing focus on “affordability” and bipartisan skepticism of data centers. 
“We have the money. It’s all about how we prioritize where we spend it,” Rep. Ryan Spaude (D-Ashwaubenon) said at the press conference. “Folks in my district and around the state are on a knife’s edge. Many of them are just barely getting by. This bill is going to do something. It’s going to keep more money in their pockets. It deserves a hearing and it deserves to be passed by this body.” 
Legislators announced the bill just as communities are grappling with the construction of massive data centers across the state. While the centers can provide an easy source of property tax revenue for local governments, they also use a massive amount of water and energy — raising questions about the protection of local water supplies, adequacy of the state’s existing renewable energy sources and concerns that a data center-generated spike in energy use will be passed on to local ratepayers. 
Last week, Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) and Rep. Angela Stroud (D-Ashland) introduced a bill that would require data centers to cover the cost of increased energy use, mandate the development of more clean energy and ensure data center construction pays local workers living wages. 
“While our state energy system faces deep uncertainty, especially when it comes to the climate crisis, we’re responding to data centers that are going to have increasing energy demands and raise rates for many communities,” said Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) who is running in the Democratic primary for governor. “It is vital that we cap all utility payments at 2% of income so that we can protect our ratepayers and our communities first. This bill is a clear and systemic practical response to rising energy rates, and it’s one of the key cornerstone priorities of the Assembly Democrats’ affordability agenda.”
Under the rate cap bill, the Public Service Commission would be responsible for administering an energy burden relief fund. The fund would cover the difference for any household with energy costs that are more than 2% of the monthly household income. The bill would give the PSC 12 months after enactment to start the fund and three years to automatically enroll every eligible household. 
The bill would allow the PSC to prioritize households making less than 300% of the federal poverty level, only provide payments to cover energy costs for primary residences and provide a maximum energy use threshold to prevent people from receiving state aid for energy intensive home businesses such as mining cryptocurrency. 
Also, the bill would prevent public utility companies from disconnecting the service of people making less than 300% of the federal poverty level and require the PSC to annually report the number of utility disconnections.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/wisconsin-farm-with-wind-turbine.jpg,,,2025-11-12 06:57:20.618775

Scutari (D-Union) has proposed some of this before, in a bill he introduced in January that never advanced in the Senate. Scutari, who is a major supporter of legalized cannabis, did not return a request for comment on the new bill.
One of the major changes in the new measure, introduced last week, would allow medical marijuana dispensaries to apply for a license to sell recreational cannabis without municipal approval. The bill would allow this even in towns that have banned recreational dispensaries.
When New Jersey legalized cannabis, it allowed towns to opt out of the recreational marijuana industry, and about 70% of them did. Some limit sales to medical cannabis only.
The number of people enrolled in the state’s medical marijuana program has dwindled since cannabis became more readily available for people older than 21. Recreational users can purchase most cannabis products available at medical dispensaries, which was not the case when the industry launched more than three years ago.
The bill also seeks to change oversight rules for the five-member Cannabis Regulatory Commission by loosening restrictions on commissioners’ political activity and modifying rules that regulate when they can speak to people who have applications before the panel.
The measure would allow commission members and employees to attend political events with written notice by a member or the executive director. Commission members are already permitted to hold public office, but the bill has a provision explicitly allowing them to campaign for office and fundraise for those campaigns. 
Current law bars commission members from meeting with anyone who has applications or other matters before the panel except at the agency’s offices. The bill would end that ban and allow commissioners and employees of the agency to meet with people who have business before the agency at any locations designated by the commission.
While all those meetings would be required to be logged, they would not be subject to the state’s public meetings law unless they are attended by more than one person on the commission. Joshua Bachner, a cannabis attorney at Mandelbaum Barrett in Roseland, said this invites malfeasance.
“I don’t see how this is good at all, for anyone,” Bachner said. “This is opening up the floodgates for misconduct.”
Bachner also noted a provision of the bill would allow state employees and their family members to work in the cannabis industry, as long as state ethics officials or the New Jersey Supreme Court say it wouldn’t create a conflict of interest, or the “reasonable risk of the public perception” of one.
In 2023, New Jersey Supreme Court Chief Justice Stuart Rabner barred state courts employees from taking any jobs in the medical or recreational cannabis industry.
The bill would also increase commissioners’ salaries from $125,000 to $160,000 and the chair’s salary from $141,000 to $156,000.
The measure comes in the waning days of the current legislative session and Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration. Murphy, who leaves office on Jan. 20, campaigned in his first term on legalizing recreational cannabis. Voters approved legalization via a ballot question, and the first recreational dispensaries launched in April 2022.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rec_mari12-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 06:57:20.618775

(Photo by Christina Lords/Idaho Capital Sun)In some of Idaho’s more rural communities, a public library can be the only source of reliable internet, a free meeting or study place, or the only place to get a book without having to order online. 
But to build or renovate a new library can be a herculean task when relying on a limited pool of funding from the small population. A few Gem State towns are celebrating, or getting ready to soon celebrate, the accomplishment of this task thanks to the support from their communities and library grant funding. 
Kendrick, Inkom and Fernwood are a few recent examples of small communities that got a new public library. 
 Kendrick’s new library to serve Juliaetta too amid closure of old building 

The north central Idaho community of Juliaetta had hosted and strongly supported a public library for years, but the more than 100-year old building was small and inaccessible to many people, according to Latah County Library District Director April Hernandez. 
“It’s been an issue for a long time,” Hernandez said. “We had a lot of patrons who couldn’t access the building.” 
Talks began to find a new site or building more than 20 years ago, she said.

“The library board, especially at that time, felt that Juliaetta had supported the library so well, they didn’t want to move it out of town, and so they spent 20 years looking for an alternative in Juliaetta to use,” she said. 
About three miles away, in Kendrick, an old bank building came on the market. The district bought it in November 2024. 
The city of Juliaetta had sold a park and raised donations for a new library amid the start of the search for a new building 20 years ago, Hernandez said. The district received $22,000 from that account and about $10,000 in a grant from the Latah County Library Foundation. In total, the district garnered almost $43,000 in grants and donations. 
The new library, located at 501 Main St., opened earlier this month. 
The single-floor building doesn’t require a ramp and is much more accessible, Hernandez said. It also has a meeting space with a kitchenette. The library district is in the process of widening the building’s Wi-Fi so it’s usable in the adjacent park. 
“I think that’s one of the big things for those areas, is connectivity, because cell service isn’t always real great down in the valley … and then Wi-Fi is expensive and hard to get in some locations,” Hernandez said. “So having that available in a wide array around the library, I think it’s important for a lot of people to be able to have any access to Wi-Fi at all.”

 Inkom library branch opens in response to population growth in area

Inkom, located just southeast of Pocatello, has been experiencing a lot of growth in recent years, but well before that, former South Bannock Library District Director Marcy Price had been working to open a branch in the area, according to the library district’s current director Megan Short. 
The town had only been served by a bookmobile previously, according to a past commentary piece in the Idaho Capital Sun by Michael Strickland. 
Multiple deals fell through, but a land swap with the Marsh Valley Joint School District finally provided an opportunity for Inkom to get its own library, Short said. 
In 2023, the library district received a $500,000 grant from the Idaho Commission for Libraries, through a federally funded grant program. In 2024, the community voted in favor of a special plant facilities reserve fund levy with just over 60% of the vote, East Idaho News reported. 
The levy is expected to generate just over $1 million over 10 years to finance the rest of the construction project. 
The district also used unexpended savings to cover costs and received some donations. The library itself is filled with many book donations, Short said. 
“The community support has been overwhelming,” she said. “So many questions everyday about when we’re opening, what’s going on, and what we’re going to have here.” 
The library, located at 321 Holstein St., is expected to have a limited opening in early January, with a grand opening in the spring.   
The new building will have printing services, 24-hour access to Wi-Fi in and just outside the building, a private telehealth or study room, a meeting room, and computers with accessible keyboards and a large screen, Short said. 
The printer and internet access seem to be particularly valuable to rural patrons, Short said.

 Community around Fernwood rallied in support of construction of new library 

The Fernwood Library of the Tri-Community Library also serves Santa and Emida, but librarians say they’ve had patrons travel from 40 miles away to visit, State Librarian Stephanie Bailey-White said at an August Idaho Commission for Libraries meeting.  
The library had been located in a building built in 1905. Like the Juliaetta library, it had small rooms and was inaccessible to many patrons. 
Many of the residents of the northern Idaho communities are at least 20 miles from medical services, so the Benewah County Free Library District wanted to prioritize a place for telehealth visits in a new location, Bailey-White said.
A library team was formed to start fundraising, and they garnered about $50,000 and around $240,000 worth of local in-kind contributions. 
 “They had tremendous community support,” Bailey-White said. 
In 2023, the state library commission awarded the district $500,000 for the new Fernwood branch. Ground broke in 2024 on the new building and the exterior was completed in June. 
The new library, located on Isaacson Street across the highway from the Fernwood Merc., was planned to open in the fall. 
The library director for the district could not be reached for comment. 
 Latah and South Bannock libraries say they’ve largely evaded challenges under Idaho’s ‘library’ law

Libraries had been the center of hot debate in the Idaho Legislature between 2022 and 2024, culminating in the passage of House Bill 710 in 2024. 
Idaho Legislature passes bill requiring Idaho libraries move ‘harmful materials’

The law allows children or their parents to file lawsuits against public or school libraries if they obtain materials deemed harmful to minors due to the presence of “sexual conduct.” 
Short and Hernandez said their districts had received no formal complaints since the law went into effect. 
Hernandez says sometimes people don’t like what they see on the shelves, but that these complaints are also usually met with explanations about why the materials are important to others in the community. 
The district’s policy includes a requirement that the patron read the entirety of the material they plan to complain about. 
“People don’t like some of this stuff, but there’s still people in their communities that relate to these diverse materials,” Hernandez said. 
Short also said she’s gotten complaints, but no formal requests to move books. When questions have been raised about materials in the library, they usually are resolved with a discussion, she said. 
“Fortunately, my whole district has been very supported by our community,” Short said. 
One conversation centered on the classic Mark Twain novel Huckleberry Finn and its inclusion of the n-word. She explained to the concerned patron the book’s importance in America’s literary history, and that the discomfort the reader felt was part of the point. 
“She understood why we had that book in our collection,” Short said, “and kind of became an advocate for the library after that.”

(Dan Forer | Getty Images)Wisconsin lawmakers are exploring ways to make it easier for school districts to consolidate as they face  declining enrollment and financial difficulties.
There are 421 school districts in the state of Wisconsin and about two-thirds are struggling with declining enrollment. According to preliminary numbers from the Department of Public Instruction, enrollment for public school districts in the 2025-26 school year fell by about 13,600 students, representing a nearly 2% decrease from last year’s estimate. Total enrollment across school districts is about 759,800 this year. 
Reps. Joel Kitchens (R-Sturgeon Bay), Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) and Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said during an Assembly Education Committee public hearing Tuesday that declining enrollment is to blame for the financial troubles that schools are facing.
“The districts that are going to referendum all the time. It’s almost always because of declining enrollment. It just gets more expensive per student to educate those kids as the districts become smaller,” Kitchens said. “We’re not telling districts this is what you have to do or what you should do. We’re telling them this is an option for you to consider.” 
Schools in Wisconsin have seen a drop of about 53,000 students over a decade, from the 2013-14 to 2022-23 school years. Kitchens pointed to estimates from the Wisconsin Department of Administration that the population in Wisconsin is projected to drop by 200,000 by 2050, noting it will be largely due to the state’s declining birth rate.
Wisconsin’s school funding system is based in part on per pupil numbers, meaning that if fewer students are enrolled schools receive decreased funding from the state, even if a district’s overall costs may not fall. 
Kitchens said that having 421 school districts is not going to be sustainable in the long term in Wisconsin and questioned whether there is another state that “on a per capita basis has that many” school districts. 
Kitchens said the issue shouldn’t be partisan. He noted that school consolidation is something that the 2019 Blue Ribbon Commission on Wisconsin school funding supported through its  recommendations.
“Many districts have used the referendum process to increase the property tax burden on the local residents to backfill the loss in state aid revenue,” Nedweski said. “Many others have seen them repeatedly fail as property taxpayers are unwilling to raise their taxes to increasingly fund empty schools.” She noted that a recent Marquette Law School Poll found that 57% of participants said they would vote against a referendum request. “There is no referendum that can be passed or law that can be signed to single-handedly reverse decades of birth rate declines to alleviate the stresses of declining enrollment in our schools. It’s clear that a more long-term solution is needed to address these demographic challenges because the status quo is not sustainable.” 
Wisconsin has had a record number of school districts go to referendum to help meet costs. But beyond declining enrollment, public school advocates say the burden on local taxpayers asked to fund their schools through referendum has grown mostly due to the fact that state investments in public schools have not kept pace with inflation for almost two decades. In the most recent state budget, Wisconsin lawmakers provided additional special education funding, but opted not to provide any increase in general aid, leaving increased costs to fall on property taxpayers.
State Superintendent Tom McCarthy noted during the hearing that Wisconsin is currently spending the least, proportionally, in state revenue that it has ever spent on schools under the current funding formula. He noted that about 32.1% of state general purpose revenue goes to state general aid to schools, and that percentage used to be around 35%. He also said the conversation about declining enrollment and costs had to include the acknowledgement that school districts’ revenue limits have been frozen at different points over the last decade, prohibiting school districts from raising more funds unless they go to referendum to ask voters.
Nedweski said the bills would be useful tools and incentives for districts facing decisions about whether to consolidate.
“Buildings do not educate kids, teachers do,” Nedweski said. “By finding efficiencies through voluntary consolidation, districts will be able to reduce overhead and direct resources to the classrooms so that our students can continue to receive a quality education, while taxpayers receive relief on their property tax bills.”
The package of bills would take a number of steps to encourage districts to explore consolidation, including providing financial incentives.
School districts already receive additional aid when they consolidate. For the first five years after consolidation, a consolidated school district gets $150 per pupil. In the sixth year, the aid drops to 50% of what the school district received in the fifth year and in the seventh year, the aid drops to 25% of the fifth year. 
AB 644 would increase that additional state aid to schools that consolidate in 2026, 2027 and 2028 to $2,000 per pupil in the first year. The last six years would be the same as under current law. 
Kitchens said that he thought most school districts would be able to decide within a year whether consolidation is something that they want to pursue. 
“I’m very open in the future to extending that deadline, but I think to get it passed, we need to put a sunset on it, so we’re doing three years,” Kitchens said. 
Dee Pattack, executive director of the Wisconsin School Administrators Alliance, noted that the inclusion of 2026 won’t really be useful for school districts since districts that want to consolidate have missed the opportunity to do so if they haven’t decided by now for next year. She also suggested that lawmakers look at spreading out  the additional aid more gradually, saying that dropping aid from $2,000 to $150 per student creates a cliff.
Kitchens said he would look at amending the timeline included in the bill. 
Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) noted that decisions about consolidation can be emotional and personal for communities. 
“Public schools are the heart of our communities, oftentimes in rural communities, especially. They’re one of the largest employers. It’s where you have the most celebrations. There’s athletic events that are important to everyone in the communities and so this decision of consolidation is deeply complex. It’s personal for a lot of school districts,” Hong said. 
Hong, who is running in the Democratic primary for governor, questioned whether lawmakers had considered just leaving the decisions on consolidation up to local communities altogether, noting that Wisconsin law favors local control of schools. 
“That’s why it’s voluntary. That’s why we’re offering these tools. It is not mandatory. We know it’s going to be difficult,” Kitchens said, adding that Door County used to be full of one-room school houses until there was a consolidation in 1960. “When they consolidated that and formed Southern Door [County] School District, people were out there with pitchforks. It’s always going to be difficult, but we have to look at the future and what it’s going to be.” 
Kitchens noted that districts are not “clamoring” to consolidate and that the option exists as a last resort for most. 
“There are a few that are, and you’ll hear from at least one of them today that really have reached that point where they know it’s necessary,” Kitchens said. “We’re not hearing districts begging for this.” 
Joe Green, district administrator and director of special education for the Greenwood School District, and Chris Lindner, superintendent for the Loyal School District, testified about the rural school districts’ journey of consolidation, which their school boards are focused on getting done by July 1, 2028. They said it has been an emotional journey as people are attached to their schools and communities, but that it could be the best option for them. 
“It might be the thing that gets us over the hump to consolidation,” Green said of the new legislative proposal. “It might be the funding that our two districts need to put a good plan in front of our communities. It might allow us to do some small projects to make consolidation smoother. There may be small construction, or things that we need to do to retrofit buildings, if that’s the way that our facility studies go. There’s a million different scenarios out there on what consolidation can look like. But without that funding, I mean, honestly, with our two districts $150 bucks a kid is $100,000 — not gonna do much with that… it’s just not going to do much.”
Green said the districts already share bus service and that 50% of their co–curricular activities are shared. They said that the schools began sharing students and staff due to their difficulty finding adequate staff to deliver instruction in rural Clark County in central Wisconsin. 
Lindner said that consolidation could help open up more opportunities for students. “We do drama together. If we did not, we would have five to six students that would not be able to do drama because, you know, can’t do it with five or six kids,” he said. 
Lindner said consolidation could also help save money.
“Our taxpayers are paying a lot of money for our operating referendums,” he said. “We tell communities if we do not start working together more, then we will be losing.”
AB 645 would instruct DPI to provide grants of up to $25,000 to groups of two or more school district boards for the costs of a feasibility study for school district consolidation or whole grade sharing agreements. 
Another bill, AB 647, would have DPI provide four-year grants of up to $500 per pupil enrolled in a single grade to school districts that enter into a whole-grade sharing agreement, agreeing to educate students at one location. 
Felzkowski said that whole-grade sharing is a step before consolidation.
“It lets them test the waters if they ever want to move to full consolidation,” Felzkowski said, adding that middle and high schools may be able to provide more class offerings, including advanced coursework, to students with grade sharing.
AB 648 would help create new supplemental state aid for consolidated school districts to  address differences in school districts’ levies when they merge. The measure is meant to address concerns of higher property taxes for residents of low-levy districts when a consolidation takes place.
AB 649 provides the funding for the bills, including $2.7 million for grants to schools that enter whole-grade sharing agreements, $3 million to provide state aid to offset levy limit differences and $250,000 for feasibility studies. 
McCarthy of DPI noted at the hearing that there are already several legal and mechanical supports in place to encourage consolidation, and that even with those, the last major consolidation that took place was on July 1, 2018. Two K-8 districts merged to become the Holy Hill Area School District in Richfield. 
McCarthy of DPI said the slate of bills being proposed are “largely building from past efforts to support and to incentivize consolidation” and that the agency doesn’t view them as “a brand new door that’s being opened up” to solve problems.
The final bill in the package, AB 646, would study what changes should be made to Wisconsin’s school districts. Under it, DPI would hire a contractor to conduct a study of Wisconsin’s school districts that looks at current school district boundaries, potential school district consolidations, existing school district facilities, staffing levels and salary scales, the population of school-age children in each school district, and revenue limits and current overall spending. 
McCarthy said the agency is most excited about this final proposal.  He said it is similar to what Vermont has done and addresses some of the factors that are important to consider when consolidating. 
The study would culminate in recommendations for changes to school district boundaries, a survey on the conditions of school district facilities across the state, information on the current and 10-year projection of the population of school-age children in each district and recommendations for school district consolidations that promote efficiency, are geographically feasible and economically viable. 
“We probably owe it to our school partners to take a long look at what are the right geographical boundaries here,” McCarthy said. “As we’re thinking about how to manage this stuff, it might be a good moment in time to slow down and think about how do we sync some of these things up to be a more effective patchwork of schools that are serving our communities?”

As more tax cuts loom, disparate counties struggle with how to pay for elections, roads, weed control, fire trucks and even a morgue.
The post Wyoming’s property tax relief cuts deep for some, but not all  appeared first on WyoFile .","Park County’s real estate market caught fire amid the COVID-19 pandemic, as people from around the country flocked to this rural refuge. Buyers snapped up properties and sent the median sale price for a single-family home rocketing from $286,000 in 2020 to $415,000 in 2022.
As values soared, the average homeowner in this northwestern Wyoming county saw their tax bills jump over 60% in three years.
“Taxpayers tell me, ‘We don’t mind paying our fair share of property taxes,’” Park County Assessor Terry Call told the local Republican Party in January. “The problem for all of us taxpayers is the past few years haven’t been fair at all.”
State lawmakers heard homeowners’ concerns and responded with new and expanded tax breaks. This year, Wyoming’s property tax revenue shrank by about $250 million — with the Department of Revenue attributing roughly 80% of that drop, $198.5 million, to relief bills passed in 2024 and 2025. Funding collected for K-12 education dropped by $185 million, while special districts are receiving $12.7 million less than last year.
“Overall, people have been real appreciative of the exemptions.” Terry Call, Park County Assessor  
In Park County, the local school districts, county and city governments, community college, hospitals, fire departments, cemeteries and other special districts will collect about $61 million in property taxes this year. That’s down from the record $76.3 million assessed in 2023, though still up from the roughly $45 million billed in 2021.
Call has heard a handful of taxpayers express worries about how the recent reductions will impact schools and other government services, but, he said last month, “very few have said they’re not going to take the exemption because of their concerns.”
“Overall, people have been real appreciative of the exemptions,” Call said.
The state’s one-size-fits-all approach to property tax relief is playing out with notably different results, depending on the county and government entity. Some communities haven’t experienced much belt tightening, or they’ve found creative ways to collect replacement revenue. But others are eyeing cuts to everything from road maintenance to public safety to elections.

A few hundred miles to the south, in Carbon County, Sue Jones isn’t taking a property tax exemption that saved her $380 last year. As a county commissioner, Jones is witnessing the kind of cuts that resulted from putting that $380 back in her pocket. 
Ostensibly, the property tax cuts are designed to prevent Wyoming residents from having to pay more in annual costs, Jones said. But cutting property taxes has come at the expense of access to services like the library, museum and senior center in her county. 
Wyoming’s tax system, Jones said, “might need a little tweaking now and again, but you don’t just cut the legs out from under it. That’s pretty much what’s happened, and it’s a ripple effect.”
The outlier 
During a Joint Revenue Committee meeting in Gillette this spring, Campbell County Commissioner Scott Clem took the mic to critique the Legislature’s aggressive, and often confusing, approach to property taxes. Clem served in the state’s House of Representatives from 2015 to 2020. Now a county commissioner, he has serious misgivings about this year’s property tax cuts, even though his county has been insulated from the pain.

Much of Campbell County’s property tax haul comes from mineral property taxes, with coal, oil and gas production making up about 78% of the county’s roughly $4.8 billion in assessed valuation, or taxable value. 
Less reliant on residential property taxes than other counties, the Campbell County Commission passed a $145 million budget this fiscal year, nearly identical to last year’s. The Gillette City Council approved a $151 million budget, similar to the previous year. And the Campbell County School District passed a $323 million budget, a 4% increase that included the largest year-over-year jump in teacher pay in years. 
“We in Campbell County, in particular, we’re just an outlier because of our mineral wealth,” Clem said.
Campbell County has seen its assessed valuation — its taxable value of all properties that determines the value of a mill levy — drop over the last few years as coal production continues to decline. Since 2016, when hundreds of coal miners were laid off, local governments have reduced their workforce through attrition and built up reserves in case the economic bottom falls out. As long as coal is being mined, that will continue to keep property taxes lower for everybody in Campbell County, Clem said.
‘Hardship’ counties
Other counties aren’t so fortunate. 
Earlier this year, lawmakers considered, but ultimately rejected proposals to backfill local government budgets for eight so-called “hardship” counties. Big Horn, Crook, Goshen, Hot Springs, Niobrara, Platte, Washakie and Weston raise the lowest amount of revenue from property taxes among the state’s 23 counties. With no money from the state to make up for cuts, Big Horn County has responded to the drop in funds by imposing a hiring freeze.
“We’ll suffer the effects of this for years to come,” Big Horn County Commissioner Bruce Jolley said.
“At [some] point, you give up these services. You give up that road that we tried to keep nice for you.”Bruce Jolley, Big Horn County Commissioner 
Some of Big Horn County’s roughly 65 employees could be laid off in coming years to offset lost revenue. Although commissioners hope to avoid such job cuts, Jolley said, that could lead to further reductions in other areas, such as the county fair and emergency services.
The county commission also slashed its library budget from $350,000 the previous fiscal year to $280,000. In response, the library system cut employee benefits, trimmed operating hours and closed branches in Frannie and Deaver.  

Big Horn County Commissioner Bruce Jolley 
This year, Jolley doesn’t expect the county to be able to afford to crush gravel, and after an October rainstorm washed away some roads, the county’s gravel stockpile will shrink. Asphalt roads could also suffer, raising costs if maintenance is deferred to the point roads need to be replaced.
“I’m glad people are getting cuts on their property tax, I’m glad that people are getting a break,” Jolley said. “But, at [some] point, you give up these services. You give up that road that we tried to keep nice for you.”
Unfunded mandates? 
One hardship county, Goshen, now has less money to respond to new laws passed by the Legislature that require more labor. Following the raft of property tax relief measures, Goshen suffered a nearly $2.6 million drop in tax dollars collected for various local budgeting entities. 
In response, county departments were asked to cut budgets by 8.25%. For Assessor Debbi Surratt, that meant eliminating a position her office had been trying to fill. 
“It gets a little bit tough in counties like ours, where we have no minerals,” Surratt said. “We are pretty reliant just on our taxpayers to keep things going.” 
To avoid cutting staff in her department, County Clerk Mary Feagler looked to consolidate and transition from 11 polling places to three voting centers, saving her office around $30,000, or 20%, per election cycle. But community pushback prompted county commissioners to nix the idea and ask Feagler to try to cut staff before closing polling locations. Feagler, however, said she doesn’t have staff she could get rid of, especially with an election year approaching. 
These challenges are arriving just as the workload is increasing due to stricter election laws passed this year. The new statewide measures require voters to provide proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship upon registration, adding more work for county clerks and election staff. The change requires more training for election judges, too. Judges must feel confident turning away voters, even their neighbors, if the voters fail to provide necessary ID, she said. 
Replacing precinct-by-precinct polling locations with vote centers would have both cut costs and increased her office’s ability to enforce the new rules, Feagler said. Secretary of State Chuck Gray said he “strongly opposed” the change in a September statement, and the county commission there ultimately voted to reject the proposal. 
“There was a notion that property tax was going to the state, and it goes to local governments.”Gov. Mark Gordon
The true hardship from declining revenues, Surratt anticipates, will be felt over the next couple of years, when commissioners must make even tougher decisions about services. 
“The Legislature should do a better job of looking for other sources, not just putting a Band-Aid on it, and the [property tax] exemptions are just a Band-Aid,” Surratt said. “All they’ve done is muddied the water.”  Exemptions are often confusing for taxpayers to navigate, Surratt added.

Gov. Mark Gordon touched on the cascading impacts during an October town hall in Lander. 
“You’re hearing out of Casper that parks aren’t as neat as they used to be. You’re hearing out of Basin, we’re having to close libraries,” Gordon told the audience. “And these consequences are going to be larger and larger.”
What’s especially unfortunate, the governor said, is that many people misunderstood how property taxes are levied and allocated. 
“There was a notion that property tax was going to the state,” he said, “and it goes to local governments. It’s how fire departments are funded, it’s how parks are funded, it’s how roads are funded, senior centers, all of that stuff is funded from local taxes.”
Gordon remembers that even a legislator on the powerful Joint Appropriations Committee appeared confused when he said: “The state doesn’t need that property tax.”  
About 72% of property taxes this year went to public education — both K-12 schools and community colleges — with the rest earmarked for county and city levies and special districts for services such as road and bridge work, sewer lines, firefighting, recreation, museums and libraries, according to a Department of Revenue report released this year.
Gordon worries that “by cutting ourselves so close to the bone,” the state is stripping away extra layers of protection that could insulate it if the economy sours. 
More room to cut

In more flush counties, where soaring property values pinched longtime homeowners, elected leaders would like deeper cuts. 
Powell City Councilman Troy Bray — who wants to see the elimination of all residential property taxes — believes the 25% exemption has helped local residents stay in their homes while causing little impact to governments.
The new exemptions and a 4% cap saved Powell taxpayers $101,500 this year. With an overall budget of around $25.6 million, Bray called the reduction an “almost inconsequential” percentage for the city.
In the 2026 election, Wyoming voters will decide on a ballot resolution to cut residential property taxes by 50% — which would be in addition to the 25% exemption already on the books, according to the Legislative Service Office. Bray believes a 50% exemption wouldn’t have a substantial impact on governments, either, contending there are always places to cut before touching necessary services like police and fire departments.
“I refer to them as the Chicken Littles of the world, you know, ‘The sky is falling.’ “Troy Bray, Powell City Council
Bray doesn’t heed the lobbyists and politicians talking about how “horrible” the effects of property tax relief efforts will be. 
“I refer to them as the Chicken Littles of the world, you know, ‘The sky is falling,’” Bray said. “Guess what? The sky didn’t fall.”
The impacts in Park County have been uneven, as some entities are much more dependent on property taxes than others.
The Park County government missed out on $2.18 million as a result of the tax relief, according to the assessor’s figures. County commissioners reduced their spending on roads and bridges and cut grants to outside agencies to help balance the $37.6 million budget.
At the Park County Weed and Pest District, the legislative relief reduced revenue by about $182,000 within a $2.38 million budget. That’s about a 7.5% hit.
Overall, the district plans to spend about $600,000 less than it did last year. Among other cuts, Weed and Pest Supervisor Josh Shorb said they slashed a seasonal weed-spraying crew from 12 to eight members, stopped spraying weeds along county roads and ended their support of a hazardous waste collection day.

The district also reduced incentives to landowners and farmers to spray for weeds and pests. For example, instead of covering half the cost of herbicides targeting Canada thistle and Russian knapweed, the district dropped its share to 30%. The district also ended a $2-per-acre subsidy that helped sugar beet growers battle the beet leafhopper and reduced a subsidy for fall field spraying from $10 to $7 per acre.
“We really pulled our horns in. Had to,” Shorb said.
The pullback is relative, as the district will still receive about $225,000 more in property taxes than it did in 2021, before Park County’s big surge in home values. 
Shorb said the tax bump allowed the district to expand its cost share programs, catch up on deferred building maintenance and replace aging vehicles and rental equipment. Another chunk was eaten up by inflation, he said, with wages, insurance, trucks and ATVs all rising in cost. In some cases, “it was like ‘dollar in, dollar out’ almost,” Shorb said.
He worries that further tax cuts will cause the district to miss invasive weeds like medusahead, ventenata or Palmer amaranth, or leave it unable to respond to an outbreak.
“I’ve been in this job for 25 years, and this has been the most stressful year by far,” Shorb said, noting additional cuts at the federal level. “All I think about is, ‘How am I going to pay for this? How are we going to do this? What are our priorities?’”
In Teton County, where soaring property values also filled county coffers, the current belt tightening has county commissioners hesitating on building a new morgue. When Dr. Brent Blue needs to move a body from the operating table to refrigerator storage at the Teton County morgue, he uses a jerry-rigged hospital lift fitted with zip ties and climbing webbing to hoist the body bag.
It’s one of many challenges the coroner faces because of the lackluster facility. A repurposed two-car garage previously used by Teton County Weed and Pest, the morgue didn’t have a drain until 2016. The coroner had to squeegee blood and tissue from autopsies out into the driveway.
“This place was literally toxic,” Blue said during a recent tour. “It still pretty much is.”
The coroner asked county commissioners for $270,000 to start designing and planning a new morgue, which will cost millions to build. Commissioners balked given budget challenges, but ultimately agreed to spend an initial $95,000 on the project. 
Overall, Teton County’s general fund lost $6 million in revenue from property tax exemptions in 2025. The county’s loss accounted for just 14% of the total $44 million in tax revenue, spread across a variety of tax collecting entities, exempted for Teton County residential property owners. The Elk Refuge Sewer District saw the smallest hit, losing $33, while public school education accounts combined took a nearly $34 million hit. Other large revenue losses included $2.3 million for the hospital, $767,150 for Teton County Weed and Pest and $205,437 for the fire district serving the Teton Village ski resort. 
Other counties, like Sheridan and Park, responded to reductions in revenue by imposing hiring freezes. Sheridan County also spent about $1.26 million from its cash reserves and slashed spending by up to 20% in each department to make up for an estimated $1.3 million in lost property tax revenue.
A mixed bag
In Cheyenne and Laramie County, business growth is helping stabilize budgets, but also straining public safety services typically funded by property taxes. 
This year, the city of Cheyenne annexed a business park, which completely offset a potential loss of $1.8 million in tax revenue. Laramie County has yet to make any major changes or staff cuts so far, as well.

However, the Laramie County Fire Authority is facing a roughly $500,000 reduction in its operating budget this year, down to about $1.77 million. The cut forced Fire Chief Jason Caughey to place all capital projects and equipment replacement on hold. The reduced budget must now strictly cover salaries and maintain the existing fleet and eight stations. 
Caughey warned that further cuts could reduce 365-day staffing at three stations to only one. 
As a special district, the firefighting service is funded solely through property taxes and receives no sales tax revenue. The district’s ability to levy taxes is restricted by a state statute written in 1947 that sets fire protection at three mills. (For each mill assessed, Wyomingites pay $9.50 for every $100,000 their property is worth.) Though this part of the statute has not been updated since, Caughey said fire apparatus costs have tripled since 2013, and Laramie County’s services have expanded to include things like emergency medical services. 
Since 2011, the fire district’s call volume has more than quadrupled, rising from approximately 450 calls in 2011 to a projected 1,950 calls this year, with 72% of current calls being for medical services.

At the same time, Cheyenne and Laramie County are leaning on new solar and wind farms and massive data centers to backfill lost revenue from property tax relief. But Caughey said his department lacks funding to support the specialized training required to handle emergencies at such facilities. 
“Those are very large facilities that have inherent risks associated with them,” he said. “Those weren’t there over the last 30, 40, 50 years.”
Cheyenne Mayor Patrick Collins described the impact of the tax cuts as an “opportunity loss” of $1.8 million that prevented the city from hiring essential personnel, including additional firefighters, police officers and street maintenance staff. As demand for city services grows, the city needs more money, not less, to fund those services, he said.
‘It adds up’
Carbon County is enormous — nearly 8,000 square miles encompassing everything from ranches near the Colorado state line to Saratoga’s outdoorsy attractions along the North Platte River to Rawlins on Interstate 80, some 150 miles west of Cheyenne.
In a county that large, there are a lot of services. So when Carbon County faced a property tax revenue drop of more than $900,000, Commissioner Jones said, she and other county commissioners had to make difficult cuts. 
Counties are statutorily mandated to fund services such as road maintenance and the operation of a county jail, which leaves certain items off the chopping block. But the commissioners and staff chipped away where they could. They reduced courthouse operating hours, left positions vacant and went without magnesium chloride treatment on roads for dust abatement. 
The commission also imposed major cuts on what it calls outside agencies, which includes services it’s not mandated to fund. That meant eliminating funding for economic development, slashing the library system budget by 53% and making painful cuts to senior services and the museum. 
Jones felt there was confusion about what property taxes actually fund. After seeing the impact firsthand, she’s opting to decline the tax exemption that saved her $380 — a small gesture to show that the services her tax dollars support are valuable, she said. 
“I also live in a fire district, in a school district, in a soil conservation district, in the weed and pest district,” she said. “I have family buried in the cemetery district. I have a local library. I have a local senior center. Seven things that my little $380, with everybody else’s, pays for.
“I think, for those seven things and my $380, I’m getting a really good deal.”
Constituents have asked Jones if they should also decline the exemption, she said, and her answer is that they have every right to claim it. 
“By all means, take it. It’s there,” she said. “But if you don’t, and you care about libraries and law enforcement, weed and pest districts, fire districts and even cemetery districts, it adds up.”

Dick Cheney's passing functions as a Rorschach test for our ability to embrace political nuance, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post Cheney — or — What’s in a name? appeared first on WyoFile .","The mere mention of the Cheney name evokes powerful reactions from Wyomingites. It seems that nobody can discuss that name dispassionately.

Opinion

The Cheney name, instead, is laden with polarizing political overtones that issue from a part of the brain that cannot be objective, that fixates upon the bright shiny objects of our modern civil discourse. This, in my opinion, reflects poorly on ourselves as citizens, and says little about the Cheneys.
The recent passing of Dick Cheney re-animated this strange phenomenon. His critics came out of the woodwork to dance on his grave and vilify him with their voices on social media. Scant indeed were those willing to acknowledge Dick Cheney’s considerable contributions to the state and nation that he loved.
Marc Antony’s funeral oration in Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” seems fitting to remember here. “The evil that men do lives after them, the good is oft interred with their bones.” We are too prone to focus on the negative rather than the good when we talk about the Cheneys.
I worked with Congressman Dick Cheney and his capable staff in the 80s, when I served in the Wyoming Governor’s Office. Cheney enjoyed universal respect for the way he represented Wyoming in Congress. His political acumen and his ability to “work across the aisle” with Democrats to get things done for the Cowboy State as our lone congressman were particularly valuable.
Back then, Wyoming was the envy of the nation for the effectiveness of our delegation — Cheney and Sens. Al Simpson and Malcolm Wallop. They left big bootprints on history. Cheney even wrote a book, “Kings of the Hill,” a historical blueprint for how Congress can work when guided by noble personalities and true statesmen.
I’m wondering aloud how a name that was once solid gold in Wyoming could, in such a short time, draw such bile from people he once represented so ably. For a state that prides itself on a long memory and sense of history, we have a very limited perspective when it comes to the Cheney name.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)
Don’t misunderstand, I hold the entire Bush the Younger administration, Vice President Cheney included, culpable for the disastrous Iraq War. That misadventure did a lot of damage. But it does not erase from my mind Cheney’s productive years as a fine legislator, nor does it diminish his contributions to Wyoming.
Those who posthumously vilify Dick Cheney suffer from a very selective myopia if they can’t acknowledge his stature in Wyoming politics. That says more about them than it does about him.
The same can be said about the political trajectory of another Cheney, Dick’s daughter Liz, who was elected to her father’s seat in Congress. Liz Cheney’s early terms in Congress were marked by her impressive legislative record and her almost meteoric rise to a leadership position in the House GOP.
I ran against Liz in the GOP primary in 2018, and my ass-whuppin’ at the polls gave me an object lesson in the potency and charisma of the Cheney name.
Liz Cheney’s future in Wyoming politics seemed limitless in those days. She was our fair-haired cowgirl, and folks in the Big Empty adored her. During Trump’s first term, Liz voted with the president over 90% of the time.
That changed in a heartbeat when Liz broke ranks with Trump and voted to impeach him for inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Her vote, which in my opinion was an act of incredible political courage and patriotism, came at a high cost. Liz lost her seat in the next primary and became a pariah in the state that once revered her.
If Liz Cheney’s fall from grace proved anything, it proved that the Trump name is more important in Wyoming than the Cheney name. And I find that appalling.
For Trump’s name to replace the Cheney name at the apex of the Wyoming political pantheon says less about those names than it does about us as citizens.
And this turn of events calls to mind another Marc Antony quote from “Julius Caesar” when he says, “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves, that we are underlings.”

Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., one of the state’s wealthiest, best-known politicians.","Dan Osborn speaks with a reporter at a Lincoln bar on Oct. 9. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — In a downtown bar on O Street in the capital city, Dan Osborn drank a 16-ounce draft Coors Banquet Beer. 
During a sit-down interview with the Nebraska Examiner at O’Rourke’s Tavern, the occasional patron walked up to Osborn to tell him they support his bid against U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb. Some said they hope he pulls off an upset that would cause political shockwaves nationally. Osborn took a swig between answers and joked that his opponent would probably criticize him for drinking.  
The former Omaha union leader and registered nonpartisan said his second Senate bid in three years has taught him the system is “rigged.” 
“Trump was right, the system’s rigged … but it’s rigged by the big people and the people with the money that have the influence,” Osborn said. 
He means people like Ricketts, his likely opponent in the 2026 general election, a former two-term governor and the face of a prominent family of donors to conservative causes who steers the state’s dominant political operation. 
Osborn, who lost by six percentage points in 2024 to Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, has built a brand on his Navy veteran hat and flannel shirts, fed partly by hosting meet-and-greets in bars like this one across Nebraska. 
The Osborn campaign has held roughly two dozen such town halls over the past few months, reminding many of his campaign’s approach in 2024. Osborn prides himself on ‘old school politics,’ hearing from Nebraskans directly, where they live, and asking them what they want from Washington. 
“I would say the number one issue that people talk about first is the economy and the cost of everything right now,” Osborn said. 
He said he thinks his campaign should connect with people who’ve given up on politics, people who shrug their shoulders when a campaign ad comes on, who think the system wasn’t built for them and who might want better.
His closer-than-expected race against Fischer made Osborn a national political name, and his style of populism — focused on the working class, union organizing and kitchen table issues — has been talked about as a possible way out of the bipartisan screaming match that surrounds most political races. 
Republicans are taking him more seriously this time. The National Republican Senatorial Committee started its 2026 Nebraska race by running digital ads saying a social media account with ties to Osborn had liked gay porn and criticized him for his stance on the federal government shutdown. Osborn has argued Democrats were right to seek congressional leverage for extending the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits to keep health insurance premiums from sharply increasing.

Many in the public first learned of Osborn in 2021, when he lead an 11-week strike of Nebraska Kellogg’s workers as the company pushed for concessions in a new union contract despite the food company posting record profits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Kellogg’s workers secured a five-year contract that gives wage increases, a path to eliminating a two-tiered wage system and enhanced benefits.
Osborn was later fired by Kellogg’s management for allegedly watching Netflix while on the job, a step he viewed as retaliation for leading the strike. In the years since, Kellogg’s has announced it would close the Omaha plant by 2026. Fischer’s team at the time blamed Osborn for the loss of local jobs. Union leaders defended Osborn’s work and said they were working to keep the plant open.
Ricketts’ campaign constantly calls Osborn a “fake independent” and repeatedly points to Osborn receiving donations and support from Democrats as examples of what they see as his ties to the state’s largest minority party. 
Opponents hammer him for using ActBlue, an online fundraising tool that promotes itself as a tool for helping elect Democrats. They also point to his tacit support from Nebraska Democratic Party chair Jane Kleeb, who has said Democrats want to break Republicans’ hold on Nebraska politics.
Osborn and his campaign manager, John Dolan, laugh off the critiques — describing it as “comical” that the best that the Ricketts team came up with is calling Osborn “fake.”

Osborn said he uses ActBlue because he couldn’t also get on the Republican-aligned fundraising tool WinRed. Osborn added that he viewed ActBlue like PayPal or GoFundMe, as little more than a platform for donating political money, and said he doesn’t take stock in the tool being “associated with Democrats.”
Dolan, at the bar, said team Ricketts can “read into it all they f— want,” while previews of the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles flashed on TV. 
Some nonpartisan candidates in other states who have followed Osborn’s 2024 approach are avoiding using ActBlue to sidestep being associated with the Democratic Party. The fundraising platform changed its rules this year to allow use by some Independent and nonpartisan candidates. 
Osborn said he could’ve done the same, but the “alternative would be to not raise the money we need to win.” 
“You have two choices, and you can’t have the other one,” Osborn said. 
On the campaign trail, Osborn sometimes confuses Democrats and Republicans because of the way he talks about President Donald Trump. Osborn has previously said he supported Trump’s stance on China, the border and “draining the swamp.” Like many labor leaders and former labor leaders, he holds mixed views on Trump’s tariffs, he told NBC News.
He has also criticized Trump for his tax and spending bill, aka the “big, beautiful bill,” which he said would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy “off the backs of people.” 
Trump’s major legislative victory remains unpopular with Americans. Osborn says he plans to campaign on what the law actually does, which he says hurts working people. He says it cements tax cuts from the first Trump administration that primarily benefit high earners, while giving some new temporary tax breaks to workers earning less.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos polling showed about 6 in 10 Americans blame Trump for the current rate of inflation, and more than 6 in 10 disapprove of how Trump is handling tariffs, the economy and managing the federal government. A poll from NBC News indicated that two-thirds of voters say Trump has not lived up to their expectations on the economy and cost of living.
The federal government has been experiencing the longest shutdown in U.S. history, which could soon end. Osborn told Fox News Host Jessica Tarlov on her podcast that he supported the shutdown. The Ricketts’ campaign, and the NRSC criticized Osborn’s backing of the shutdown as another example of him siding with Democrats. The NRSC called him “another Democrat lap dog.” 
While Osborn said he doesn’t know everything about the shutdown, he said he would have fought for the  insurance subsidies, the tax credits at the heart of Senate Democrats’ efforts to keep the government closed until they force at least a vote on extending them.  
He also told the Lincoln Journal Star last month that the shutdown was “in line with what I’ve been saying all along,” that “we’re in this two-party doom loop.”

Until recently, Republican congressional leadership had expressed little interest in negotiating on the health care subsidies during the shutdown. Osborn said he’s relieved the shutdown appears to be headed for an end, but he remains concerned about rising healthcare costs. 
Osborn said the role of the federal government is to protect its citizens, which should include access to “access to freaking hospitals when we’re sick, because there’s no Democrat or Republican in the back of an ambulance.”
On the campaign trail, Trump has promised “the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History,” after the Biden administration saw illegal border crossings spike at the end of 2023 but start decreasing in 2024.  
Osborn said he supports stronger border security. He ran an ad in the previous cycle offering to help Trump build his border wall. He said Trump has done a good job securing the border but he doesn’t like how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Trump have been making light of enforcement. 
ICE and other government agencies have used online memes to gain attention and rile up a part of the GOP base. Homeland Security, for instance, posted an AI-generated photo of a cornfield this year with ears wearing ICE hats and a caption of “Coming Soon: The Cornhusker Clink.” 
Trump posted “‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning” with an edited photo of himself depicted as Lt. Col. Bill Kilgore from the Vietnam War film Apocalypse Now.
“Even if you think it’s funny, that is not professional coming from the White House,” Osborn said. 
Nebraska, like the rest of the country, has seen an increase in immigration detention activity, including an ICE raid on Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha earlier this year. The state expects to begin receiving federal migrant detainees in the state’s new immigration detention facility in McCook earlier this month. 
Osborn said Trump — like most administrations before him — isn’t doing the comprehensive immigration reform that’s humane and that’s going to fix the problem “because it’s an economic issue.”
He has argued for months that the “big four meat packers” benefit from having a “wide open border with no immigration policy, because they can exploit the labor, enrich themselves, and then they donate millions of dollars to candidates so they won’t do anything about it.” Trump in recent days also attacked the meatpacking industry on social media, posts applauded by many in Nebraska’s all-GOP congressional delegation, including Fischer.
Democrats have talked about Osborn as potentially offering them a roadmap back to national power and relevance, based on his outreach to many of the working-class voters party surveys show it lost touch with. 
But he doesn’t think about how his campaign fits into the bigger picture of politics. He said he “just wakes up every day and goes to work.”
People around Osborn said they see the bigger picture. Dolan, his campaign manager, said voters are tired of “the same caricature of people getting elected into government and then doing nothing.” 
Osborn said he has heard from many who say “the only way we’re going to get anything done in the country is by electing independents.”
The Osborn campaign says it plans to spend a lot of time next year on college campuses as it tries to figure out the “puzzle” of voter turnout. Osborn’s team is focused on turnout because midterm elections often have lower turnout than in presidential election years, and Nebraska’s smaller population means smaller increases in turnout can have a significant impact in close races.
“​​Ricketts is going to be on your TV and your radio,” Osborn said. “I’m going to hopefully be in your living room, in your business, and having a beer and chatting it up.”
The U.S. Senate general election is Nov. 3.

(Photo by Andrew Kennard/Wisconsin Examiner)When a prison built in the 1800s is still housing people in 2025 with the same aging infrastructure, we have to be honest, the system is broken. Wisconsin’s prisons have been in crisis for years, and for the first time in a long time, we’re seeing a small but important step toward change. 
Gov. Tony Evers recently received bipartisan approval to overhaul Wisconsin’s aging prison system and close the outdated Green Bay and Waupun prisons. The overhaul strategy includes a $15 million project investment and outlines a four-year process to reduce the number of beds, modernize facilities, and shift the focus toward rehabilitation and safety. That’s progress, but 2029 is too far away, and Evers’ plan lacks the kind of decarceration measures needed to actually reduce the prison population and make Wisconsin safer. 
The reality inside our prisons doesn’t have four years to wait. People are dying. Staff are exhausted. Families are breaking under the weight of a system that punishes more than it prepares people to come home. Every delay costs lives and wastes taxpayer dollars that could be used to help people rebuild instead of being locked away. 
I know this firsthand because I lived it. I spent part of my incarceration inside Green Bay Correctional Facility, one of the oldest and most overcrowded prisons in Wisconsin. The facility was built in 1898 with a design capacity of about 17,000 people statewide, yet Wisconsin’s prison population has hovered above 22,000 for years. That means thousands of people crammed into cells meant for far fewer. Walking those halls, you can feel the age of the place, the air thick with humidity, the bitter cold in winter, and the lack of ventilation that makes it hard to breathe. The walls are cracking, the infrastructure is failing, and the environment itself strips people of their dignity. 
Those conditions don’t make anyone safer. They don’t prepare people for reentry. They create desperation, both for both the incarcerated and the staff working inside. The best way to ensure a safer Wisconsin is to get the people who are ready to reenter society out of our prisons and into reentry. Overcrowded and understaffed prisons overtax our correctional officers and make prisons unsafe for officers and incarcerated people. In addition, understaffing makes it harder to ensure that everyone gets the programming that they need. The Federal First Step Act and CARES Act Home Confinement have both proved that bringing the right people back early can result in lower recidivism, better public safety and safer and more effective prisons. 










If Wisconsin wants to lead on justice reform, this can’t just be a construction project. ... Real reform means giving people a path forward, not just warehousing. 


I was one of the many people affected by Wisconsin’s Truth in Sentencing law, which eliminated parole and early release. That law has kept countless people behind bars longer than necessary, removing the hope and incentive that parole once provided.
If Wisconsin wants to lead on justice reform, this can’t just be a construction project. Real reform means reducing the number of people behind bars, ending excessive revocations, expanding reentry programs, and investing in housing, treatment, and mental health care. It means giving people a path forward, not just warehousing. 
According to the Prison Policy Initiative, Wisconsin imprisons about 663 people per 100,000 residents, far more than Minnesota (173) or Illinois (341). Despite years of promises to reform, the state’s prison population has remained between 21,000 and 23,000 people for nearly two decades. 
Nearly 40% of new admissions each year come from revocations, not new crimes, meaning thousands are sent back to prison for breaking supervision rules like missing curfew, losing housing, or failing a drug test. That’s roughly 4,000 to 5,000 people every year, based on Department of Corrections data. I lead a statewide Smart Justice campaign focused on ending these excessive revocations, because it’s one of the biggest drivers of mass incarceration in Wisconsin. 
Add to that the worst racial disparity in the country. Black residents are imprisoned at 11 times the rate of white residents, according to the Sentencing Project, and it’s clear that our problem isn’t just old buildings. It’s old thinking. Reducing prison beds without changing these policies is like draining a bathtub while leaving the faucet running. Until we reform supervision, expand early release and invest in reentry and community support, the system will keep refilling itself. 
Closing prisons built in the 1800s is a step in the right direction, but it has to come with urgency and intention. We can’t keep reacting; we have to start transforming. The same energy that went into passing this plan must go into implementing it quickly and with input from the people most affected by it, those who have lived behind those walls, their families and the communities most affected by incarceration. 
As we head into a new election season, this issue must be front and center for every candidate running for governor. Wisconsin deserves leaders who will move us forward, not just talk about reform, but act on it. The next administration should be judged on whether it has the courage to close outdated prisons, expand second chances, and build a system rooted in rehabilitation, dignity, and justice. 
Gov. Evers was right when he said, “We’ve got to get this damned thing done.” But getting it done means more than moving money; it means moving with purpose. Justice reform isn’t about buildings; it’s about people. 
Wisconsin’s motto is Forward. It’s time for our justice system and our next governor to finally live up to that.

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe has joined Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future as a co-chair to promote natural gas as a route to long-term energy reliability as renewable energy sources are built out, the organization announced Tuesday.
The organization promotes moving away from coal burning plants and using natural gas to reliably support solar and wind power generation. Touted as advocates for an “all of the above” energy profile, the group is expanding their reach into the commonwealth to promote gas power alongside renewable energy in hopes to bring down utility bills while cutting emissions, despite the commonwealth’s plan to eventually eliminate fossil fuels.
“As a Virginian who knows the importance of natural gas to my Commonwealth’s economy, I believe that we must come together to secure a reliable and affordable energy future,”  McAuliffe said in a statement. 
McAuliffe will lead the organization with former Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, former U.S. Reps. Kendrick Meek of Florida and Tim Ryan of Ohio and former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter. 
The group points to studies that suggest transitioning to 100% renewable energy will be cost prohibitive and meeting peak demand for energy will prove a challenge. Natural gas in conjunction with renewable sources will allow the demand to be met at a reasonable cost, the group has said. 
Reporting by the Guardian and Floodlight show that Natural Allies is backed by fossil fuel companies to appeal to young, liberal, non-White constituents. Their mission is to focus on how gas is “cleaner” than coal, yet fossil fuels remain a major driver in climate change.
Ryan said this strategy “can show Democrats they don’t have to choose between environmental progress and economic reality. We can lead on both fronts.” Environmental groups believe the messaging from the group is “greenwashing” the impacts of gas power on the climate.
Natural Allies states that they work with lawmakers to educate them on how they can marry gas power and renewable energy to meet their states’ needs. The group is largely focused on Virginia, New York, and New Jersey and stresses the significantly lower carbon emissions that natural gas emits compared to coal fired plants.
In Chesterfield, that is a common argument made in support of the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, a proposed gas peaking plant to be built on the site of a former coal plant. Hundreds of residents in the area have been fiercely opposing the plant and say they want to prevent additional pollutants being released into the surrounding communities.
Still, Natural Allies’ website reads that “Without natural gas, higher-emitting fuels like coal and oil would be needed to keep lights on. Additionally, rising energy costs will disproportionately impact vulnerable households — worsening health, education, and economic outcomes.”
McAuliffe served as Governor of Virginia from 2014-2018, before the Virginia Clean Economy Act passed in 2020 – which mandates utilities retire gas powered plants by 2050. Virginia is also one of the largest energy importers in the country and is facing a demand crisis with hundreds of power thirsty data centers on the grid and more expected.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security is asking for more than 100 state troopers, in part to fill in patrol gaps left open because of a law enforcement surge in Memphis.
Safety Commissioner Jeff Long made a request for $43.5 million to fund 139 positions for Highway Patrol officers, supervisors and support staff during budget hearings with Gov. Bill Lee. Nearly 120 of those would be state troopers.
The personnel increase would make up more than half of Long’s overall budget increase of $84.2 million, which includes $19.7 million for a department “market adjustment” to cover inflation.
The department has 300 troopers working in Shelby County, roughly 100 per shift, as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force, a combination of local, state and federal forces, including the Tennessee National Guard, which is the subject of a lawsuit.
The buildup could last for a year, although Lee has said he believes it could continue in some form “forever.”
Tennessee has more than 1,000 highway patrol officers and shifted about 25% of them to the Memphis buildup from other parts of the state. Troopers are being rotated in and out of Memphis and some adjustments will be made, Long added, but other counties are left to fill in for those working in Shelby County. 
“They’re not on skeleton crews because we’re not emptying certain areas. We’re pulling from the different areas across the state, as we do any other major operation,” Long told the Lookout. “It leaves (open shifts) somewhat for the people who are still there. That’s why we need more troopers too.”
Lee has made increasing trooper strength a priority during his two terms in office. His budget for this year added officers for a fifth straight year, roughly 370, though the state has had trouble filling all of the positions.
Asked about moving a large number of troopers to Memphis, Lee said Monday when he took office the state had about 800 troopers and was told the department needed 1,300  to be fully staffed.
The state shifted more troopers to Memphis over the past few years because of continual complaints about speeding and drag racing on the city’s interstates. 
Lee said he would evaluate whether the troopers Long requested are needed, but he added that the investment in law enforcement was necessary.
“It’s working,” Lee said. “We’re surged in Shelby County.” 
The governor called Long’s request more of a move to continue improving trooper staffing to reach his initial goal than a reaction to the Memphis buildup.

Chief Jay Johnson is accused of having a pole camera, owned and operated by the police department, installed at his Racine County home in late 2024. A 15-page criminal complaint states that Johnson put up the camera for personal use while he was in the process of divorcing his wife. 
The complaint also states that Johnson’s alleged personal use of the camera  violated the wishes and advice of Greenfield’s mayor, city attorney and members of the police department. In July, special agents from the Wisconsin Department of Justice (DOJ) Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) attended a meeting held at Greenfield City Hall to discuss a months-long investigation with city officials. 
According to the complaint, the special agents “were advised that during an internal investigation of Chief Johnson, which was conducted earlier in 2025, investigators uncovered actions they deemed as possibly criminal in nature. Outside agencies were later contacted to investigate potentially criminal violations committed by Chief Johnson.” 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Interviews with Greenfield’s human resources director, mayor, city attorney and police department staff turned up statements  that Johnson wanted to use a tax-payer funded, police department-owned pole camera at his home in Wind Lake because of  “safety concerns stemming from his divorce,” according to the complaint. Mayor Michael Neitzke said Johnson claimed to have been attempting to get a retraining order against his wife “in part because she was dating a felon,” the complaint states. Johnson claimed to have experienced harassment including a white rose being left in his driveway. The chief’s restraining order was denied, the complaint states, after which he asked the mayor about installing a pole camera. “Mayor Neitzke advised agents that he did not understand the type of camera Chief Johnson was talking about and believed it was equivalent to a trail camera or Verizon-type camera,” the complaint states. 
The mayor gave Johnson the go-ahead to install the camera, but later began to reconsider the decision. Neitzke contacted city attorney Christopher Geary, who said Johnson shouldn’t install the camera “citing legal issues with its use for personal reasons.” Geary then contacted Johnson stating that “his divorce is not related to his job,” the criminal complaint states. Johnson’s reaction was reputedly bombastic, “‘I think it’s f-ing ludicrous,’ was the exact quote,” Geary wrote in an email to the mayor. 
Johnson tried to argue that what he wanted was no different from the security former Gov. Scott Walker received during the Act 10 protests, and that a prior Greenfield police chief also had home security. “I tried to explain the difference is that the threats in those situations stemmed from the person’s public employment and/or public policy positions, whereas this is, as I understand it, an entirely personal situation,” Geary wrote in the same email, which is featured in the criminal complaint. “He didn’t appreciate the distinction.” 
The mayor said he thought that was where the issue ended, and that Johnson hadn’t installed the camera. In December 2024, however, Greenfield Police Department  Captain Chuck Fletcher was asked by Johnson about installing the pole cameras, according to the complaint. Fletcher told the DCI special agents that he had known Johnson his entire career and “considers him a close friend.” Fletcher stated that he also knew Johnson’s wife, and didn’t consider her to be an angry or violent person. Johnson allegedly told Fletcher that he wanted to keep the camera installation “low key” and discrete. Fletcher then assigned Detective Scott Simons to handle the installation, and told investigators that he did not know that the city attorney had advised against it. 
The complaint states that Fletcher communicated the chief’s desire to be “low key” and quick about things to Simons. The detective said he was asked to “change the password for logging onto the camera, as all pole cameras have a general username and password,” according to the complaint. “The camera that was to be installed at the Defendant’s residence would have a unique username and password.” Although Greenfield’s pole cameras are owned and monitored by the police department, they are installed by We Energies technicians. A camera was taken down “from a closed drug investigation,” according to the complaint. Simons told another detective that it was “being installed in another county for another investigation.” The camera was eventually installed across the street from the chief’s home. 
Some time later, Greenfield Police Association president and detective Aaron Busche “found out by accident” about the chief’s personal camera. Busche keeps track of the department’s four pole cameras, which are listed on a whiteboard by number and location. Busche realized that the camera at Johnson’s home had no documented location. “Detective Busche was told by Detective Scott Simons that the camera was loaned to an outside agency for their investigation,” the complaint states. “Detective Busche was not told what agency the camera was loaned to.”
 
Criminal Complaint_1 - Johnson, Jay A_ 2025CF005150_ Johnson, Jay A._28099053_1
 
In the spring of 2025, Busche heard that there was video feed from the mystery camera, but then realized he couldn’t log in because the password had been changed. Busche then used a “backdoor process” to access the camera feed, and realized it was the chief’s home. During a meeting with acting chief Eric Lindstrom, Simons was asked to take the camera down. 
Johnson is accused of violating Greenfield PD’s standards of conduct by using department equipment for personal gain, and omitting or even falsifying information given to staff who carried out the camera’s installation. The criminal complaint also accuses Johnson of threatening behavior towards law enforcement. In late August, it states, a person attempting to disguise their voice called the police department saying, “Hello you f-ing pigs, revenge is sweet!” The dispatcher and Busche both recognized the voice as Johnson’s. 
Acting Chief Lindstrom had also filed a complaint against Johnson with the Oak Creek Police Department, accusing Johnson of threats and harassment over Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram. One email copy says: “He’s on board, hold on tight!!!! Idiot and the ice princess will pay dearly. JJ DOJ is the man! Boom. God is good.” Another message says: “KL is on board. Friday meet with us. Ughhh. So unnecessary but he’s all in for me rn. HR and MN GOING DOWN!!!! EL is dirty so stay tuned. TY owe you!!!!” The criminal complaint states that “EL” is a reference to Eric Lindstrom who, like Busche, has also served on the Milwaukee-area team which investigates civilian deaths by police. 
The controversy raises questions about oversight of police surveillance technology, accountability for officers, and how problematic police officers climb the ranks. Community members in Milwaukee County have pushed for Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS) local ordinances, which would provide more oversight and control of police surveillance tools.
Fox6 reported that a string of disciplinary issues going back to 2013 followed Chief Johnson. The news outlet obtained documents which described Johnson, who was a captain at the time, as having issues with “failing to own decisions and initiatives by administrative staff” or “engaging in inappropriate conversations with officers.” Johnson had been accused of sharing management-level discussions or information related to subordinates, and planning a “booze cruise” and other organized parties. 
A 2015 memo stated that “he can’t be allowed to supervise,” and in 2017 he signed a settlement to become Greenfield’s emergency management coordinator with the fire department, before becoming chief. Asked by Fox6 how Johnson became chief, Mayor Neitske redirected blame to the city’s Police and Fire Commission.

(Screenshot from Youtube)After the Senate passed a stopgap funding bill that does not include extended Affordable Care Act tax credits, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet is not confident that a future floor vote in the Senate will lead to an extension.
“I don’t have confidence about how that vote is going to turn out,” Bennet said in a press call Tuesday. “I don’t expect any Republicans in the Senate to change their vote, and I don’t expect the House to try to pass that bill. We could end up being surprised by that, but I wouldn’t hold out hope for that.”
The U.S. Senate voted 60-40 Monday on a stopgap spending bill that will reopen and fund the federal government through Jan. 30 following the longest shutdown in U.S. history. Members of the House of Representatives began traveling back to Washington, D.C. this week, as the chamber will need to pass the Senate-approved measure before the government will reopen.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune promised Democrats a floor vote on an extension of the tax credits will occur in December, part of a deal struck with seven Democrats and one independent to advance the spending bill, despite it not including an extension of enhanced premium tax credits to support Americans who purchase health insurance through the individual marketplace.
The enhanced premium tax credits implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were initially set to expire in 2022, but Congress extended and expanded them with the Inflation Reduction Act. In the absence of those enhanced federal subsidies, the average cost to purchase health insurance through Connect for Health Colorado, the state’s individual marketplace, will more than double next year.
Bennet and U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, both Colorado Democrats, voted against the measure because it “did nothing” to extend the tax credits expiring at the end of the year, Bennet said. He said he thinks the Democrats who voted to pass the stopgap measure made a judgement that the downsides of continuing the shutdown overrode the benefits.
“I obviously didn’t share that judgment, but that was their judgment,” Bennet said. 
While he is “deeply disappointed” with the outcome in the Senate, Bennet, who is running for Colorado governor in 2026, said he will continue to push for an extension of the tax credits as well as broader reform of the country’s health care system. He is “recommitted more than ever” to advocating for a universal health care system in the U.S. 
The shutdown was not a waste of time because “fighting for Americans’ health care is not a waste of time,” Bennet said. But he said there is no plan B to help Coloradans facing higher insurance premium costs. 
“For months, we urged President (Donald) Trump and Republicans to come to the table and extend the tax credits — which are already existing law and simply need to be extended — to give families a little bit breathing room, to make healthcare a little bit more affordable, and they’ve refused,” Bennet said. 
Bennet declined to say if he still supports Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has faced calls from progressive groups and some Democratic House members to step down from leadership after failing to hold his caucus together in the shutdown fight.
Americans will make the judgement that Democrats continue to fight for affordable healthcare while Republicans make it more expensive, Bennet said, as Republicans have fought against the Affordable Care Act since it was first introduced. 
“We now know that we will never have an improved health care system as long as Donald Trump is our president and we have a majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate,” Bennet said.
Many major federal government operations have been shut down since Oct. 1. The Trump administration laid off many federal workers during the shutdown, a move that will be reversed under the Senate-approved measure. Bennet said his office will work to reach out and make sure workers who were laid off in Colorado know that they could be reinstated.

Founded in 2004 by brothers Charles and David Koch, Americans for Prosperity, or AFP, describes itself as a grassroots advocacy organization that supports pro-growth policies, free markets, limited government, freedom and individual liberty. 
With the opening of its local chapter, Idaho became the 37th state with a brick-and-mortar state chapter, Americans for Prosperity announced in a press release. 
Jason Lehosit, who has three decades of campaign and policy experience in the Northwest, is serving as the Idaho state director of Americans for Prosperity.
Prior to taking on his new role, Lehosit most recently worked as the policy director for Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane.

“I’m excited to lead AFP-Idaho and support Idahoans getting engaged in grassroots efforts to magnify common sense and free market values across the state,” Lehosit said in a written statement. “Idaho’s on a great path, but we can’t take that for granted. We need to keep cutting red tape, reining in wasteful spending and protecting the values that make Idaho such a great place to live, work and raise a family.”
Although the Idaho chapter is new, Americans for Prosperity has held events and done work in Idaho previously. 
In August, Americans for Prosperity held a private breakfast event in Boise with U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, to promote the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed into law this summer. Gov. Brad Little, Idaho House Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian, Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield and Boise City Councilmember Luci Willits attended the Americans for Prosperity breakfast, while about 30 protestors gathered outside the breakfast, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. The protest was organized by the Idaho 50501 movement and Idaho Women in Action, with protestors calling instead for Idaho’s members of Congress to participate in open, public town hall events, the Sun reported.  
In an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun, Lehosit said he hopes to have an office set up and running before the end of this year.

 (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)President Donald Trump pardoned Kingsport Republican U.S. Rep Diana Harshbarger’s husband, amid a string of Tennessee-related clemencies issued last week. 
Robert Harshbarger pleaded guilty in 2013 to distributing an unapproved dialysis drug in Kansas. Harshbarger, a pharmacist at the time, bought the cheaper drug from China and sold it as if it were a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
He was sentenced to four years in prison and ordered to pay restitution of $848,504, a $25,000 criminal fine and forfeited $425,000 in cash.
“My husband paid his debt both personally and financially to society,” Diana Harshbarger told Johnson City television station WHJL. “We are thrilled and grateful that the President looked kindly upon Bob’s application.”
Trump’s pardon of Harshbarger came the same day as his pardons of former state House Speaker Glen Casada and his former chief of staff, Cade Cothren. 
Casada and Cothren were convicted of setting up the secret company that tapped into the state’s constituent mail services program. Casada and former state Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty and worked with prosecutors, steered lawmakers’ business to a company secretly run by Cothren under a fake name. 
In late September, Casada was sentenced to three years in prison, and Cothren to 30 months. Smith has not received a pardon and was sentenced to eight months for her role in the scheme. She is seeking a presidential pardon, according to the Chattanooga Times Free Press.
Trump has been known for using his pardon power to benefit his allies. In October, he pardoned Changpeng Zhao, a Chinese-born Canadian founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Zhao’s company helped facilitate a $2 billion purchase of a cryptocurrency in the company that Trump’s sons own and operate.
Trump then told CBS News 60 Minutes that he had no idea who Zhao was, and only pardoned him because he was convicted as part of a “Biden witch hunt.”
Diana Harshbarger has received Trump’s endorsement in all three of her congressional elections. The president also endorsed Bobby Harshbarger, the couple’s son, in his 2024 race for a state Senate seat he won. 
Diana Harshbarger is also a pharmacist and was a corporate officer at American Inhalation Medication Specialists, where her husband sold the misbranded drugs.

Back then, it felt like just another Florida story, a fresh example of the culture war overriding reality. In hindsight, it was a preview of where the country was headed.

This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.

President Donald Trump’s second term has plunged the United States into “don’t say climate” politics. Even as horrific floods and fires unfolded around the country this year, Republicans in Congress reversed the country’s only climate plan. The administration has deleted “climate change” from hundreds of government webpages and dismissed facts about the warming planet as “brainless fear-mongering rhetoric.” Rather than pushing back, Democrats have been talking about climate change less since the 2024 election, emphasizing “cheap energy” instead.
Even if talking about climate change is politically radioactive, adapting to its effects is no longer optional. Florida tops some lists for the state most at risk from climate change, facing a combination of heat, drought, fires, flooding, and hurricanes. Miami Beach and towns in the Florida Keys have been raising their roads as the sea begins to rise. DeSantis has committed more than $1 billion to Resilient Florida, a grant program that helps local governments address some of these problems.

You don’t necessarily have to mention climate change to start adapting to it — a phenomenon now seen all over the country. PG&E is burying its power lines underground to avoid sparking fires in California’s drying forests, in the name of “wildfire safety.” After Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston, the county began buying homes that have been repeatedly inundated and relocating residents, turning their former homes into open space to absorb floodwaters.
“There’s been a radical increase in how many people are realizing that whether it’s flooding, drought, fire, air quality impacts from fire — take your example — the disasters have been getting out ahead of us,” said Katharine Mach, a professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami.
Since at least the 1980s, the public discussion over climate change has revolved around trying to get the world’s carbon emissions under control. But as time has worn on and emissions have continued to rise, it’s become much more about living with the effects of an overheating planet. A United Nations report last week found the world will soon overshoot its goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), with current policies likely to lead to 2.8 degrees C (5 degrees F) of warming by the end of the century. That’s a slight improvement from previous estimates, but still translates to an unrecognizable planet.
“We have unleashed a world where many climate impacts are now locked in,” said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director for climate and energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Because we did not act quickly enough, it’s not just about mitigation anymore. We have to adapt.”

Bill Gates, who’s long funded efforts to switch to clean energy, recently wrote an essay arguing that climate advocates have spent too much time and effort on reducing emissions, and not enough on programs that help people stay resilient in the face of increasingly dangerous weather.
“Unfortunately, the doomsday outlook is causing much of the climate community to focus too much on near-term emissions goals, and it’s diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world,” Gates wrote.
The question of how to fund efforts for low-income countries to adjust to this new, unpredictable environment has become a central concern for this year’s global climate talks in Belém, Brazil, starting on November 10. “It’s a responsibility that richer nations, major emitting nations, have been shirking for the longest time,” Cleetus said. Another recent U.N. report found that developing countries will need at least $310 billion a year over the next 10 years to prepare for the effects of climate change. In 2023, richer countries only provided $26 billion.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration has eviscerated foreign aid, stripping away development funding for poorer countries while undermining its own ability to respond to disasters at home. Cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have hindered forecasters’ ability to predict what’s coming, at the same time as the diminished Federal Emergency Management Agency has forced local governments to fend for themselves. The U.S. isn’t sending any high-level delegates to the talks in Belém, marking the first time the country will go unrepresented at the annual U.N. climate conference.
“I’ve never seen an administration be so deliberately undermining a country’s capability to be prepared and to deal with challenges like this,” said Susanne Moser, a social scientist who’s considered one of the leading experts on climate adaptation.
Billionaires like Gates are stepping into the gap. MacKenzie Scott, another influential philanthropist, recently donated $60 million to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy to help with disaster preparedness and recovery.
Experts said the new focus on adapting to a changing climate was necessary, but they said that Gates — like many before him — needlessly pitted the need to adapt against the need to cut emissions when both things can happen at the same time.
“Adaptation can actually not succeed, ultimately, if climate change goes unchecked,” Moser said. Today, the world has seen about 2.3 F of additional warming since before industrial times, but as Gates notes, it could reach 5.4 F by the end of the century.
“A 3-degree world is not a world in which adaptation can provide well-being and health,” Moser said. “It’s just simply, people are living in ruins and are trying to basically survive.”
There’s an entrenched idea among environmentalists that discussions over how to adapt to climate change distract from the core mission of cutting planet-warming emissions, what’s known as mitigation. It’s sometimes perceived as a form of giving up. But studies have repeatedly shown that talking about adaptation doesn’t necessarily reduce public support for mitigation efforts. If anything, the challenges of adapting — the high price tag of raising roads in low-lying coastal areas, or the difficulties of relocating communities out of danger zones —  highlight the need for reducing emissions. “Once you begin adaptation and you see how difficult it is, mitigation looks like a cakewalk,” Moser said.

If Florida is any indication, the two might go hand in hand. Yoca Arditi-Rocha, CEO of The CLEO Institute, a climate education and advocacy nonprofit in Florida, says that the state has made a lot of progress that doesn’t often get discussed. In fact, it’s one of the largest markets for electric vehicles in the country, and also right near the top for installations of utility-scale solar and rooftop solar.
Arditi-Rocha hopes Florida can show the rest of the country that climate action can still move forward, even if the term itself remains politically off-limits. Getting specific helps, she said: Talking about how towns need more trees for shade, or how they need to be prepared for hurricanes and heat waves, is simply practical. Then again, so is reducing carbon emissions.
“We have to shut down the overflowing bathtub,” Arditi-Rocha said. “We cannot be mopping the floor forever.”

Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., listens during his event at the Washington County Fairgrounds. Oct. 19, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)ARLINGTON, Neb. — The attendees of an October steak fry at the Washington County Fairgrounds hint at the history and reach of Nebraska Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts’ political operation.
The list last month included Gov. Jim Pillen, most of the state’s congressional delegation minus U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, Oklahoma U.S. Sen. Markwayne Mullin and about 100 GOP supporters. 
Speakers emphasized Ricketts’ impact on the state and why they think his reelection is vital for conservatives in the state, highlighting his time as governor and his help in passing President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”
“If you like the way this game is played in Nebraska, where we have a majority of Republicans at the table,” U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., told the crowd, “We need you there for Pete Ricketts.”
Ricketts is a force in state politics. His endorsements and opposition carry weight, having helped elect a governor and flip legislative seats. He has used his own money to influence Nebraska politics and has a political team behind him that is known for its no-holds-barred approach to campaigning.

“Conservative leadership matters,” Ricketts told the crowd. “Conservative leadership delivers.”
In two terms as governor, Ricketts reshaped the Legislature and state law. He pressed for passage of tax and spending cuts, managed the COVID-19 pandemic and focused on improving the efficiency of state agencies, efforts he has since tried bringing to Washington, D.C., and the federal government. 
Ricketts helped fund a successful ballot measure banning abortions after the first trimester, amending the state constitution in 2024. His family financed efforts to restore the death penalty through a successful 2016 ballot initiative after the Legislature repealed capital punishment and overrode his veto as governor. 
In Congress, Ricketts has wasted no time building relationships and using his financial connections to rise into the role of vice chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He serves on several Senate committees, including the Budget Committee.
And he has sponsored bills that would establish guardrails for stablecoins — essentially a regulatory framework for some cryptocurrencies — and another to make it a federal crime to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion without parental consent. He also introduced bills to eliminate federal taxes on Social Security and military retirement benefits.

Ricketts first ran for the Senate against U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., in 2006. He lost what was then the most expensive race in state history. In 2023, Gov Jim Pillen appointed Ricketts, whom Ricketts had supported, to replace former U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., after Sasse had resigned to lead the University of Florida.
Ricketts last November easily won a special election to finish the final two years of Sasse’s term over Omaha Democrat Preston Love Jr. 
Now, Ricketts is looking to win his first full six-year term but faces a different challenger than in past races — a populist. Former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn, a registered nonpartisan, has challenged Ricketts for his Senate seat, setting up a race that will be watched nationwide.
President Donald Trump’s brand of populism is a driving force in modern politics. Osborn has tried to build a new labor-based populism, one grounded in working-class needs and contrasting with the wealthy.  
Ricketts argues his tilt with Osborn is not a broader ideological fight. He says it’s just another race. 
“We’re just going to run a campaign like we always do … I’ve been in elected service for over 10 years … I’ve got a track record of delivering for Nebraska,” Ricketts told the Examiner at The Door Sports Bar & Grill in Fremont after his Sunday steak fry. He drank a soda, saying he doesn’t drink on Sundays.  
Ricketts has dealt with offshoots of Trump populism for years. The Nebraska Republican Party’s leadership team loyal to him was ousted in 2022 in favor of one more faithful to Trump. Ricketts tussled with Trump in a 2022 proxy war for governor as Ricketts backed Pillen and Trump backed multistate agribusinessman and Trump donor Charles Herbster.
The Ricketts family, who are major donors to conservative causes, have a complicated relationship with Trump. They opposed Trump in the 2016 GOP primary. In 2024, Marlene, his mother, donated to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the Republican primary. His father, Joe, donated to Trump after the 2024 primary. But Pete Ricketts has said he supports the Trump agenda of lower taxes and less regulation, and his brother raised money for the national GOP.
This year, Ricketts said he’s going to contrast his conservative record of results against what Osborn “says he is and what he actually stands for.”  He and his team have relentlessly tried making the case that Osborn is secretly a Democrat, describing his nonpartisan approach as “fake.” 
Ricketts said “people are smart” and “can see through” Osborn. Osborn is a former Omaha labor leader whose state voter registration records show has been a registered nonpartisan for more than a decade.
Osborn lost to U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer in 2024 by six percentage points. His closer-than-expected race against Fischer has made Osborn a national political name, and a race that Ricketts acknowledged will be “tough.” 
Osborn and his campaign have tried  making the case that Ricketts and the billionaire class now run the country, alluding to the wealth of the senator’s family that created the company that became TD Ameritrade and owns Major League Baseball’s Chicago Cubs. Ricketts’ financial disclosure forms list him as a millionaire.

Ricketts said one of the top issues in the race will be inflation, adding that former President Joe Biden’s “failed policies” are to blame, but that Trump is working with Senate and House Republicans to lower energy prices. He pointed out that gas prices are lower now than during the Biden presidency. Ricketts also is banking on getting rewarded by voters for the tax cuts in Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”
It makes tax cuts from the first Trump administration permanent, cementing most of its benefits for higher earners. It also introduces some new temporary tax breaks for workers earning less. Ricketts said he could talk about the “fantastic bill” for an hour, “because there’s so much in it that is really good.” 
He pointed to the provisions of the bill, including no tax on overtime and tips and the increase in the child tax credit, as examples of how Republicans who passed the law are helping working families. 
“They’ll see that and the next year, when they start filling out their taxes. They’ll start getting bigger refunds …they’ll see the impact,” Ricketts said. 
State and national Republican strategists have acknowledged the poor polling of Trump’s new tax law but said focusing on specific provisions, such as new temporary tax breaks for workers earning less, could help improve public perception of it. 
Osborn recently attacked Ricketts for his long opposition to medical and recreational marijuana. Currently, the state is slowrolling two voter-approved laws legalizing and regulating medical cannabis.
Ricketts said his position on marijuana has “always been very clear.” He made national headlines in 2021 by saying, “If you legalize marijuana, you’re gonna kill your kids. He has argued that approving cannabis for medical use is a step toward legalizing recreational use.  
Trump has been more permissive about cannabis, including saying during the 2024 campaign that he would like to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III, which would loosen federal regulations around it.  
Ricketts voted this week — along with seven Senate Democrats and one independent — to reopen the government after the most extended federal shutdown in U.S. history.  Ricketts said the Democrats played politics and had harmed everyday people. 
Democrats sought to extend the enhanced tax credits set to expire by year’s end for individuals who buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. 
Ricketts told the Examiner that Democrats are holding the government up for “pandemic-era subsidies,” and Republicans are willing to talk about it after the government reopens. He didn’t answer a direct question of whether he would support or oppose efforts to extend the tax credits.
Ricketts said he would earn the votes of Nebraskans like he has before. 
“I think that’s what this race is going to be about [is] how we’re actually delivering for the American people and how Democrats failed … Osborn is a Democrat, and he wants their failed policies,” Ricketts said. 
The U.S. Senate general election is Nov. 3.

Roger Wicker to help an indigenous group in his state gain federal recognition as a tribe.
Republican Sen. Thom Tillis told a reporter from NOTUS that his block on four Mississippi nominees is due to negotiations with Wicker, Mississippi’s senior senator, over federal recognition of the Lumbee and other issues unrelated to the nominees themselves. Wicker serves as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which has enormous sway over the legislation in which the Lumbee tribe would be recognized.
“Roger’s one of my favorite people here, and, you know, it’s just a matter of using the leverage people use every day here,” Tillis said. 
Wicker’s office did not respond to a request for comment. 
The Lumbee is a group of indigenous people in North Carolina that has been seeking federal recognition as a tribe for over a century. But other federally recognized tribes have opposed the effort. 
Tillis has been a vocal supporter of federal recognition for the Lumbee. He is not running for reelection in 2026, so next year will be his final opportunity to secure a bipartisan bill for the indigenous people. 
President Donald Trump has also supported federal recognition for the Lumbee. 
Most of North Carolina’s congressional delegation supports federal recognition of the Lumbee. Language granting them federal recognition was added to the House version of the Pentagon’s annual spending blueprint. 
But language about the Lumbee was not included in the Senate’s version of the blueprint. 
Tillis also said he is negotiating with Wicker over other issues, but he declined to say what the issues were.  
In August, Trump nominated Robert Chamberlin and James Maxwell, both justices on the Mississippi Supreme Court, to vacant federal judgeships in northern Mississippi. Trump in July nominated Scott Leary and Baxter Kruger, his choices for U.S. attorney for the Northern and Southern districts of Mississippi, respectively.
None of the four nominees responded to requests for comment. Both Wicker and Mississippi’s other U.S. senator, Cindy Hyde-Smith, support the nominees, though neither is a member of the Judiciary Committee.

(Photo by Kevin Wurm for ProPublica)It’s never been easy to qualify for Social Security disability benefits. Christopher Tincher knows this firsthand.
Tincher began his working life in a coal mine in Aflex, Kentucky, as a teenager in the 1980s. As mines across the region shuttered, he turned to scraping grills at a Hardee’s, then cleaning office buildings at night, then stocking shelves and changing tires at a Walmart in Arkansas. Later, he was hired by a nearby town’s wastewater department. Often, he had to wade into sewage to fix equipment and clean out feces, needles and tampons entering the treatment facility.
In 2017, some of that liquid got into his work boots, which didn’t fit properly and had caused blisters to form. It soaked into his flesh, infecting his right foot all the way to the bone. Doctors cut his leg off below the knee so the infection wouldn’t spread.
Tincher was now a manual laborer on one leg, but he was denied disability benefits by the Social Security Administration the following year. On average, 65% of applicants are rejected, though some successfully appeal.
In Tincher’s case, it was partly because he was 48, and the agency’s rules give priority to disabled workers in their 50s, who are officially deemed to be nearing advanced age and therefore less able to switch careers or develop new skills.
Tincher got a prosthetic leg and went back to work, this time for a medical supplies delivery company. He did this for seven years, frequently in pain, he said. His other leg was almost always in a cast, due to further infected blisters and diabetic nerve damage, and his eyesight was rapidly deteriorating.
This February, he applied for disability again. He was desperate; he was in a wheelchair, and he’d had to move in with his son’s family in Cabot, Arkansas, because he couldn’t pay the rent on his trailer. And there just weren’t other, less physically demanding jobs available locally for someone with his experience: “About the best job I could’ve got would’ve been a door greeter at Walmart, but I don’t think they have those anymore,” he said.
Tincher is now 55, and reaching that age marker helped him qualify, in June, for just over $1,500 a month in Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. A three-time Donald Trump voter, he was approved just in the nick of time.
That’s because the Trump administration is rewriting the disability eligibility rules, ostensibly to modernize the program, in ways that will make it even harder for aging blue-collar workers like Tincher to get benefits. Hundreds of thousands just like him would become ineligible for aid.
These changes would fall disproportionately on some of Trump’s most loyal supporters in red states. Most affected would be 50- to 60-year-olds without a high school or college education who have, for decades, toiled in physically grueling jobs, including coal mining, logging, and factory and construction work. The five states where the highest proportions of people rely on these benefits are West Virginia, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi and Alabama. Unlike New York, California and a few others, these states do not have their own disability insurance programs for workers to turn to amid federal cuts.

“The Trump administration does not think that simply being 50 years old is a disability,” said a senior administration official who would speak only on condition of anonymity. In the 1970s, when the current rules were written, the official said, many more jobs involved manual labor, but in the internet age that isn’t true anymore. Workers in their 50s with physical injuries are thus receiving disability benefits “when they don’t need to be,” given that they could get a more sedentary job in the modern economy.
The administration has also justified cuts like these on fiscal grounds: The federal budget deficit is massive, the Social Security retirement system could become insolvent in less than a decade and savings need to be found.
But the disability program is paid for, via payroll taxes, by its own trust fund, separate from the one for the retirement program. So reductions in disability payments would not help the retirement system stay afloat. Indeed, cutting eligibility for disability could result in more disabled workers claiming retirement benefits early, actuarial experts note, which would only increase pressure on the retirement system. Meanwhile, the money in the disability fund, which is projected to remain solvent through at least the end of this century, would just sit there, unused.
The Trump administration’s upcoming proposed regulation would make two hugely consequential changes to the Social Security Administration’s disability system, according to four SSA officials with knowledge of the plans. First, it would modernize the job listings that Social Security’s disability adjudicators and judges use to decide if there’s work available in the U.S. economy that a manual laborer could do despite physical impairments — like a low-skilled desk job at a computer or driving for Uber or DoorDash. Second, the new rule would almost entirely remove age as a criterion, in most instances making a 50-plus-year-old like Tincher no more eligible for assistance than a 20-something.
Under the current system, eligibility for benefits ticks up at ages 50, 55 and 60, as workers become more medically vulnerable and less adaptable. Disability adjudicators use a series of grids that consider an applicant’s age, work experience and education level to determine whether they may have the skills to do another, less strenuous job. (The adjudicators make a yes-or-no decision on eligibility; each person who qualifies then receives a set amount based on their lifetime earnings. Once the person starts receiving Social Security retirement benefits, they no longer receive disability payments.)
The regulation that would undo this framework is slated to be formally proposed by December, according to a federal bulletin, although that deadline could push into next year, multiple officials said. The draft, which is based in large part on a plan that the first Trump administration tried to enact in 2020 before running out of time, still needs to be reviewed and edited by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. After that, it will undergo the standard process of allowing the public to submit comments and objections.
But in its current form, the regulation would slash at least 830,000 people’s eligibility for disability benefits, according to an initial estimate from the Urban Institute, an economic policy think tank. As many as 1.5 million could lose eligibility over the next decade, including the widows and children of workers. Disability attorneys and experts familiar with who most relies on the program contend that the numbers could be considerably higher.
Separately, the Trump administration is preparing a proposed regulation that would eliminate or sharply cut the Supplemental Security Income benefits of roughly 400,000 extremely poor and disabled people. This second regulation would reduce support for adults and children with severe disabilities who are living in low-income households, as well as elderly people living with their adult children on tight budgets.
Barton Mackey, a spokesperson for the Social Security Administration, confirmed in a series of emailed statements that the Trump administration is working on what he called “improvements to the disability adjudication process.” These changes would ensure that the disability system “remains current” and can be more efficiently administered, Mackey said, while also promoting “dignity in work.” (Mackey did not respond to a question about the change to the SSI program.)
Further “speculation on any proposed rule prior to it being published,” he said, “only serves to misguide public discourse and stoke fear in those who rely on disability benefits for economic stability.”
White House spokesperson Kush Desai, in response to detailed questions, said that “President Trump will always protect and defend Social Security for American citizens” and pointed to Trump’s recent remarks commemorating the 90th anniversary of Social Security.
Retirement benefits — the largest and most popular of Social Security’s programs — would not be cut under the new regulation. But union leaders and advocates for older Americans said that the likely changes to disability eligibility for aging workers would undermine the financial and retirement security of working-class people and their families. Those who are denied benefits in their 50s would be forced to draw down any savings they have, which could lead them to apply for Social Security’s retirement benefits at age 62 instead of 67. That, in turn, would diminish their and their spouses’ monthly benefit amount by up to 30% until the day they die. Losing eligibility for disability would also block these workers’ access to Medicare, which they’re currently eligible for at their age precisely because they’re disabled.
Disability benefits frequently save recipients from bankruptcy, foreclosure and homelessness, according to research by University of Chicago economists and others.

George Piemonte, a former president of the National Organization of Social Security Claimants’ Representatives, has spent 30 years working on disability cases across the South. He emphasized that that’s where these disability cuts would be most acutely felt. “They call it modernizing the program, but that’s political speak,” Piemonte said. “This is a matter of life and death. If these workers don’t get their benefits, some of them are not even going to live to retirement.”
Social Security officials under both Republican and Democratic administrations have long agreed that the disability program needs to be modernized in some practical ways.
For example, disability adjudicators continue to use a Dictionary of Occupational Titles, created in the 1930s and last updated in 1991, to determine whether there are jobs that exist in “significant” numbers in the national economy that an applicant with declining “residual functional capacity” could still do. The DOT, as it is called, is almost comically outdated: It includes “pneumatic tube operator” but not web designer. (Reporting by The Washington Post has helped bring attention to these issues in recent years.)
Under President Barack Obama, the Social Security Administration and the Bureau of Labor Statistics undertook a yearslong effort to replace the DOT with what would be called the Occupational Requirements Survey, an updated catalog of modern occupations as well as the levels of physical exertion and cognitive difficulty that each job can entail. Field economists surveyed employers across the country, asking how often their employees typically had to climb stairs or lift items of various weights and so on. That detailed dataset now exists, but it isn’t widely used yet; the new regulation would require its implementation.
“So, the technical part of all this has sort of already been accomplished,” said David Weaver, a former top Social Security Administration official who helped to develop the survey, known as the ORS, during the Obama years. (Weaver is now a professor of statistics at the University of South Carolina.)
“But,” he added, “conservative economist types want to also make it harder for certain workers to get disability benefits, which would be a policy choice.” The complexity of the potential changes — the draft of the Trump regulation is hundreds of pages long and has been called the “mega reg” by insiders — has helped to mask this, Weaver and others said.

“Simplifying and Modernizing the Disability Adjudication Process” is how Mark Warshawsky headlined his written remarks when he testified in 2023 before a congressional subcommittee examining the issue. Warshawsky, an architect of the disability overhaul during the first Trump administration as the deputy commissioner for retirement and disability policy at the Social Security Administration, testified that the current system wrongly “presumes a workforce with low levels of education which is largely involved in physical labor, works long hours, has little flexibility in work schedules, low adaptability, little access to assistive technology, never works from home, and retires early fairly often.” He also said that increasing eligibility starting at age 50 is not very scientific; for starters, it’s unfair to 49-year-olds. (Warshawsky, who is now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, declined an interview request from ProPublica.)
Warshawsky was unable to get the disability regulation across the finish line before Trump lost the 2020 election. But Russell Vought, the powerful head of Trump’s Office of Management and Budget and one of the originators of Project 2025, picked up on this first-term agenda item and has pursued it again this year.
The disability restructuring was “Russ Vought’s No. 1 priority for the Social Security Administration from Day 1,” said Leland Dudek, who was acting commissioner of the agency from February to May. In February, Dudek said, his staff met with Vought’s staff on multiple occasions; together, they “dug up what was done four years ago,” he said, indicating that the new proposed rule will be similar to a 2020 draft that was leaked to the press. (The senior Trump administration official said that Dudek is “disgruntled” and that the disability changes are no more of a priority for Vought than the rest of the administration’s “deregulatory agenda.” In the past, Vought has publicly pressed for fewer veterans and others to receive disability benefits.)
To opponents of the forthcoming regulation, including many still inside the Social Security Administration, Warshawsky and Vought’s conception of the modern economy neglects the fact that workers like Tincher grew up in a different world. They started their working lives at a time when most people didn’t have personal computers, when it wasn’t as common to get a high school education and when physical labor offered a path to eventual retirement security. To switch the rules now pulls the rug out from under them just as they’re reaching their most vulnerable years, officials and experts said.
“I believe disconnects occur when more highly educated policy people do not fully understand or appreciate what workers in physically demanding, labor-intensive occupations, such as longshoremen, have gone through,” said Steve Rollins, who was deputy associate commissioner of the Social Security Administration’s Office of Disability Policy during the latter years of the first Trump administration and associate commissioner through the Biden administration. Rollins oversaw the agency’s work on modernizing the disability program from 2019 to 2024.
What’s more, vocational experts said in interviews, even if 50- or 60-year-old former coal miners or factory workers are denied the disability benefits they say they need, they’re still likely to retire early, a finding backed by recent research. After all, if they try to get a desk job — assuming one is available in their rural or exurban community — they may feel they don’t have the education or training for it, and they may also be subject to age discrimination in the hiring process. As Michelle Aliff, a certified rehabilitation counselor who testifies at Social Security disability hearings nationwide as an impartial vocational expert, put it: “An oil field roustabout in his 50s isn’t going to just sit down at a computer for work without additional training.”
The Trump administration’s plan to transform the U.S. disability system, once finalized, would interact with other cuts to the social safety net that the president and Republicans in Congress have already authored. For example, under legislation dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and signed into law by Trump, work requirements will be added to Medicaid; people with disabilities will largely be exempt, but the best way to establish eligibility for that exemption is to qualify for Social Security’s disability program, which would become harder under the new rule. A disabled worker could instead turn to Obamacare’s individual exchanges for insurance coverage, but Republicans are allowing the tax credit that makes those premiums affordable to expire.
Tincher feels lucky he applied when he did. Being approved for disability has meant his copays are covered, he can finally afford groceries and he has time to help watch over his grandkids. Still, he also feels a tinge of guilt. “I wish every day I could still work,” he said. His dad, a coal miner, once told him to work until the day he died. “Having to ask for help is hard especially for men to do, men of my generation.”
All Tincher would say to the officials pushing the changes to the disability program, he said, is “you don’t know until you’re here, at this point in a working life.”

(Photo by Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Voters just approved the Vibrant Bond package, authorizing nearly $1 billion for construction across Denver. It’s the role of the Denver Auditor’s Office to provide oversight of that construction: Fair contracting and prevailing wage enforcement keeps projects on track, protects workers, and levels the field for responsible firms. Labor compliance is a core project risk that the Denver Auditor should track in real time.
Large bond packages attract bidders, including some who cut corners. Misclassification and wage theft distort bids, punish rule-followers, and often lead to delays and overruns. The answer is to embed labor oversight in construction delivery rather than chase violations after the fact.
Start with certified payroll in a usable format. Require machine-readable certified payroll every pay period for all bond-funded work, including for subcontractors. The Denver Auditor’s office can publish project and contractor-level compliance summaries while protecting personal data, and sample classifications, hours, and rates against wage determinations and project records. These are capabilities this division has already shown they can do effectively, so they should seek to standardize that work in this bond.

Do unannounced field checks, too. Short site visits can be used to confirm worker classification, overtime, apprenticeship utilization, and safety. Log findings promptly and route corrective action through the contract. This protects the interests of workers and taxpayers. Short site visits deter violations with minimum disruption.
The City of Denver should also tie payments to compliance. Make retainage release contingent on documented wage compliance through closeout for primes and subs. If findings or unpaid damages remain, retainage is held. This aligns incentives with following the rule of law on wage and labor topics.
It is also critical that the city protects the voices of workers on these publicly-funded projects. Maintain a multilingual reporting channel with anonymous tips and post anti-retaliation rules and wage rates at every site entrance. When workers know their rights and have an avenue to report, issues surface early and projects are more successful.
The city should also consider community workforce benefits for large bond projects. Set measurable goals for apprenticeships in partnership with labor unions, support local hiring, and incentivize participation for small or disadvantaged businesses in our community.
Finally, build in more proactive construction auditing practices. As vendors are onboarded, require a short compliance briefing prior to work beginning. Cover information about wage determinations, record-keeping, and audit standards. Start clean by setting clear expectations. Prevent findings instead of just reporting them later after the damage has already been done.
This approach is fair to everyone. Workers get the pay the law requires. Responsible contractors compete on execution, not shortcuts. Taxpayers get projects that finish without avoidable time delays or cost overruns.
This bond package will shape the future of our parks, streets, and public facilities. If managed well, it will also build trust. The Denver Auditor has an opportunity to show what strong construction oversight can do to support workers and contribute to success. Let’s hold this Vibrant Bond and ourselves to the high standards that the people of Denver deserve from their leaders.

Dozens of community members asked the Detroit school district on Tuesday night to update its sanctuary policy and train all staff on how to interact with immigration enforcement.
Speakers at the board meeting also asked the Detroit Public Schools Community District to protect students outside of school buildings and provide more transportation options for families with immigration concerns. Community members asked for in-school counseling for students at risk for immigration enforcement, referrals to legal services, and more resources for language acquisition classrooms.
Kristen Schoettle, an English language teacher at Western International High School, told the board DPSCD’s 2019 “Sanctuary District” policy needs to be updated.
“As we all know, a lot has changed since 2019,” she said. “We have to do more than simply say ICE isn’t allowed in school buildings.”
The concerns were raised as federal immigration agencies have ramped up enforcement, including arrests of parents and teens outside school buildings. Last week, a child care worker was dragged by federal agents from the Chicago center where she worked.
Though dozens showed up to address the districts’ policies around immigration concerns, the board asked for three representatives from the group to each speak for up to six minutes.
Some speakers ignored the board’s request and made additional comments in support of protecting immigrant students and families. The board did not stop them from speaking.
Chair Corletta Vaughn offered pamphlets on immigration resources to those at the meeting.
“You are not alone and we are 100% in support of all of our students and families,” said Vaughn.
The district’s sanctuary policy requires the superintendent’s office and general counsel to sign off before staff allow immigration agents with warrants to enter school property or access student data.
In January, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said the district would begin training principals, assistant principals, guidance counselors, attendance agents, and security guards on the protocols. Community members want all staff to be included.
“We want to know who has been officially trained,” said Heidi West, a teacher at Academy of the Americas. “Do our secretaries and security guards know what to do if ICE is right outside or trying to get in?”
West said she and many other staff members feel unprepared and want training.
“This is the very least we should be doing to be proactive and make sure everyone is protected,” she said.
Schoettle said other public school districts, including in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, have mandatory training for all staff, regular “Know Your Rights” presentations and in-school counseling.
Schoettle told Chalkbeat that better communication with bilingual families is needed in the district. A robo call sent out by the district last month intended to quell rumors about immigration actions in the community caused “chaos,” she said.
Schoettle said the call only went out in English and it was misinterpreted by families, creating confusion and fear. The next day, about 15% of her class was absent, she said.
Frank Espinosa, another teacher at Western International, asked the board to provide better transportation for undocumented students and families with mixed immigration status.
As the district explores ways to use additional state funding to get kids to school, Schoettle said DPSCD should invest in more ride shares for families with immigration fears.
“There are undocumented parents who risk their safety every day to take their kids to school,” she said.
Vitti responded to the speakers’ concerns Tuesday night, saying any changes to the sanctuary policy would have to be made by the board, adding he would assist them administratively.
No members of the board responded to the speakers’ concerns after the public comment.
The school system has enrolled more newcomers and English learners in recent years. Last school year, there were more than 7,400 English learners, which represented 15% of the district’s students.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration ended a policy that deemed schools and day cares “sensitive locations” protected from immigration enforcement.
The administration’s immigration enforcement policies and increased arrests have impacted Detroit families, prompting fear in neighborhoods and schools for months.
In June, hundreds gathered at a board meeting to ask school leaders to decry the immigration arrest of DPSCD student Maykol Bogoya-Duarte, an undocumented teen from Colombia. After hours of public comment, the board reversed course and made a statement asking for Maykol’s release.
Days later, he was deported.
At October’s DPSCD board meeting, Vitti responded to several people who asked the district to provide “Know Your Rights” immigration enforcement training for students.
“I’ve certainly heard today the need for training and information sessions for our families that are fearful of ICE,” he said during the meeting. “I’ll work with the team and legal counsel to determine what exactly we can and can’t do, but obviously, as a district, we want to do everything we can in support of our students and our families.”
Vitti added that the district has never been contacted by ICE or given information to the agency.

Are they commodities in a market built around relapse and reimbursement, or are they part of our shared infrastructure — something we maintain and strengthen because our communities depend on it? (Getty Images)I entered Genesis Recovery Center in Grayson because of my alcoholism by choice, not by court order.
The building looked worn, a physical manifestation of the lives inside, stitched together, imperfect, but still standing. In a culture where things are increasingly disposable, it’s reassuring to find a place that values repairing over discarding — a kind of micro-service economy where both the building and the people are mended rather than thrown away.
Genesis is part of Recovery Kentucky, a statewide network of 16 long-term, peer-run recovery centers created through a partnership among the Kentucky Housing Corp., the Department of Corrections and local nonprofits. The program began in 2005 to reduce homelessness and addiction-related incarceration by offering free community-based recovery housing. Participants stay six to 12 months, work, attend meetings and mentor newcomers. Funding comes from state and federal grants rather than private insurance, so care doesn’t end when coverage does.
What makes Recovery Kentucky distinct is that it’s peer-run. People who’ve already completed the program help operate it — supervising chores, leading groups and mentoring newcomers. Staff members aren’t outsiders with clipboards; they’re graduates who’ve stayed to give back. That structure builds accountability no policy memo can. When someone stumbles, it’s often another resident, not a professional, who helps them stand up again. It also builds leadership — many graduates go on to work in treatment, social services or re-entry programs, carrying that ethic of peer support into other corners of the state.
The public model looks different from the insurance-driven programs many Kentuckians know. In those settings, a person’s length of stay often depends on the reimbursement schedule, not readiness. Recovery Kentucky trades paperwork for accountability. Residents cook, clean and answer to one another. It isn’t glamorous, and neither is addiction, but the approach builds something sturdier than abstinence: belonging.
The difference matters as Kentucky debates how to sustain and expand treatment access. Private networks such as Addiction Recovery Care (ARC) have grown quickly through Medicaid billing, and some now face federal scrutiny over documentation and profit motives. ARC, now being acquired by the Florida-based company Ethema Health Corp., shows how out-of-state investors are moving into Kentucky’s recovery industry. Recovery Kentucky moves more slowly and on a smaller budget, yet its results show up in jails, shelters and workplaces. A graduate who stays sober, gains employment, and mentors others is one less person cycling through emergency rooms or court dockets.
The real question is how we see people in recovery. Are they commodities in a market built around relapse and reimbursement, or are they part of our shared infrastructure — something we maintain and strengthen because our communities depend on it? One model extracts value through billing codes; the other creates value through belonging and contribution. The return on investment isn’t measured in profit margins but in families kept whole, jobs filled, and neighborhoods made steadier.
We already treat bridges and highways as investments that connect towns. Recovery Kentucky shows that people can serve the same purpose. When someone rebuilds a life, they also rebuild the capacity of their community — the workforce, the tax base, the shared belief that improvement is possible. The infrastructure metaphor isn’t just symbolic; it’s economic. Every graduate who stays sober and working keeps public dollars from being spent on jail beds, foster care and emergency rooms.
This isn’t an argument for one model over every other. Kentucky needs multiple paths to recovery. But the public, peer-run system offers lessons policymakers shouldn’t overlook: consistency, community ownership and low cost per participant. The programs rely on modest state support, and that funding is a fraction of what relapse and incarceration cost taxpayers.
When politicians talk about rebuilding Appalachia, they usually mean roads and broadband. Those things matter, but none of them last if the people who live here can’t participate. Recovery is infrastructure. It rebuilds a workforce, a family, a sense of purpose. And like the old building in Grayson, what’s been repaired by hand often lasts the longest.
If Kentucky invested in recovery infrastructure the way it invests in highways, how many lives and towns could we reconnect?",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2164284264-1024x833.jpg,,,2025-11-12 05:57:11.691483

(Photo courtesy of Norfolk International Airport)Richmond resident Brianna Curry didn’t expect her trip home from a veterinary conference in Hawaii to include shivering at Chicago O’Hare International Airport in a sundress. Her connecting flight to Norfolk was canceled Monday morning — one of thousands scrubbed nationwide as the federal government shutdown rippled through the aviation system.
“They rescheduled for the next day,” Curry said. “It’s 20 degrees in Chicago and I only had Hawaii clothes.”
After pleading with exhausted airline staff, she snagged the last seat on a later flight — just as her co-worker, initially stranded on standby, was called aboard moments before takeoff. The pair landed in Norfolk hours behind schedule but grateful to be among the lucky few who made it home.
As the shutdown stretches through its sixth week, air travel across the country — and in Virginia — has begun to buckle under mounting pressure. 
Over 11,000 Federal Aviation Administration employees have been furloughed nationwide, while more than 13,200 air traffic controllers are reporting to work without pay, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Even before the shutdown, Virginia was navigating a shortage of controllers at nine airports statewide. 
The FAA has ordered a gradual nationwide flight reduction to maintain safety standards amid worsening staffing shortages. 
A 4% cut took effect Friday, ramping up to 6% Monday and projected to reach 10% by week’s end at 40 major airports, including Washington Dulles International and Ronald Reagan Washington National.
Controller shortages led to average delays of four hours at Chicago O’Hare and 45 minutes in Las Vegas on Monday. The FAA warned that similar disruptions could spread to cities including Philadelphia, Nashville and Atlanta.
 Virginia’s airports holding on — for now

Virginia, home to about 1,110 air traffic controllers — among the highest concentrations in the nation — has so far avoided major slowdowns. 
Officials at Richmond International Airport said Monday that while a few flights were delayed or canceled, the disruptions were largely “related to mandatory flight reductions” at other airports.
“At this time, RIC has not been directly affected by the federal government shutdown or by any associated flight reductions,” the airport said in a statement. Federal workers with the FAA, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection remain on duty, officials said.
The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority — which oversees Dulles and Reagan National — said its locally managed operations such as parking, concessions and public safety remain unaffected. But it warned that “the staffing of essential federal services such as security screening and air traffic control is unfunded and could affect flight schedules or security checkpoint wait times.”
Both agencies urged passengers to check flight statuses before heading to the airport and to arrive early — two hours before domestic flights and three hours for international departures.
 Safety first, officials say

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said in a statement that the agency’s flight reductions are meant to “maintain the highest standards of safety” in the national airspace system.
“My department has many responsibilities, but our number one job is safety,” Duffy said. “This isn’t about politics — it’s about assessing the data and alleviating building risk in the system as controllers continue to work without pay.”
Bedford said the agency is monitoring operations closely and “will not hesitate to take further action to make sure air travel remains safe.”
The FAA has also restricted visual flight rule approaches, parachute operations and photo missions near facilities with critical staffing shortages. Commercial space launches and reentries are now confined to overnight hours.
 Controllers working without pay

For Virginia’s more than 1,100 controllers, the shutdown has meant continuing one of the most stressful jobs in government — without a paycheck. Many have taken on second jobs or dipped into savings to cover bills, according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
“This is the erosion of the safety margin the public never sees, but the American public relies upon every day,” Nick Daniels, the union’s president, said in a news conference Monday.
Daniels previously said controllers are “working ten-hour days and six-day workweeks due to the ongoing staffing shortage, all without pay,” warning that the situation “creates substantial distractions for individuals who are already engaged in extremely stressful work.”
“For this nation’s air traffic controllers, missing just one paycheck can be a significant hardship,” Daniels said. “Asking them to go without a full month’s pay or more is simply not sustainable.”
He called on Congress to “pass a clean continuing resolution to immediately end the government shutdown, ensure that all individuals who have not been paid during this prolonged closure receive their compensation, and then engage in bipartisan negotiations on other pressing issues facing our nation.”
On Monday evening, the U.S. Senate narrowly approved an agreement on a continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government and end the shutdown, after seven Democrats — including U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia — and one independent joined Republicans to advance the measure. 
The deal, which keeps agencies funded through early January, now heads to the House, where swift passage is expected after weeks of mounting pressure from federal workers and the aviation sector.
Virginia already entered the shutdown crisis with a staffing shortfall in its air‐traffic control workforce.
According to the FAA’s 11-year workforce plan, the commonwealth was missing 133 certified professional controllers across nine facilities as of early 2025 — including 15 at the Norfolk Tower and 33 at the Potomac TRACON.
 TSA stretches thin

At the nation’s airports, Transportation Security Administration officers — among 64,000 federal employees nationwide — are also working without pay. A TSA spokesperson cautioned in October that “an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports.”
“TSA will continue operations to keep the traveling public safe,” the spokesperson said. “We kindly ask for our passengers’ patience during this time.”
The TSA’s lost and found office at Reagan National has closed due to staffing limits, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority said, urging passengers to “be extra mindful of your belongings in the security screening area.”
 Federal workers feel the squeeze

The shutdown’s toll extends far beyond airport terminals. The federal government employs about 147,000 Virginians — from defense analysts in Northern Virginia to meteorologists in Blacksburg — making the state among the hardest hit economically.
For federal aviation workers, the strain is both financial and emotional. Many controllers and TSA employees say morale has plummeted as they balance safety-critical responsibilities with the uncertainty of missed paychecks.
TSA and other federal workers saw their first zero paycheck Oct. 24. As Tuesday marked their second pay cycle without pay, some have turned to food banks and credit unions offering emergency loans.
But for now, Virginia’s airports remain mostly operational — a testament to the thousands of unpaid workers who keep planes moving and passengers safe. However, officials warn that the system’s resilience has limits.
“We are the rope in this tug of war game that we shouldn’t be the rope,” said NATCA President Daniels. “This has nothing to do with us… The real story is that America’s air traffic control system is falling further behind because of this shutdown.”

(Leon Neal/Getty Images)Continuity gaps within Virginia’s artificial intelligence registry are raising concerns about transparency, oversight and the implementation of standards across state government, state researchers said Monday. 
JLARC provided lawmakers an update on the registry as part of an ongoing review of the Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA), which services 65 executive branch agencies, security, project management, procurement and information technology planning for the commonwealth. The registry’s purpose is to track and approve state projects that would use AI technology.  
Researchers said that as of Oct. 31, VITA approved 90 out of about 182 cases that were submitted by state agencies frustrated with the agency’s process guidance and the registry using multiple systems that are “not well coordinated.” VITA said the total approved registry AI cases increased to 112 at Monday’s meeting.
“One theme that emerged through all of these conversations is that VITA does not have one singular voice around AI for agencies,” said Kimberly Sarte, associate director for ongoing oversight and fiscal analysis for the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC). “We heard the different teams within VITA may have different answers to the same question depending on when they were asked.” 
Sarte added that VITA is working to establish a “centralized AI information role, which will also bring them in line with our peer states.”
Example of AI use in Virginia. (Photo courtesy of VITA)
VITA was required to establish IT security standards under an executive order signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Jan. 18, 2024.
From the order, VITA created Virginia’s AI registry for agencies to submit potential AI use cases, or projects, for review and approval by VITA. Cases are approved based on whether there is a “positive outcome for citizens,” according to the state standards published by VITA.
The state standards also require agencies to examine alternative technologies and processes before choosing AI, to develop a regulatory impact analysis, and to clearly state whether AI will make recommendations or decisions on behalf of users. 
Sarte said the AI tools Smartling and CoPilot Chat have been made available to all executive branches.
Some of the approved 90 cases include the Virginia Racing Commission using meeting transcription for hearings, the Department of Corrections improving facility monitoring and security and VITA developing a chatbot to help users navigate its website.
However, the problem researchers identified is that case status is not updated regularly, and some agencies are unclear about which types of use cases to include and are not reporting them.
Researchers are also unclear whether the cases not entered into the registry comply with state standards.
Sarte said VITA is working to address some of the frustrations including developing an AI resource team to reduce inconsistent guidance.
Bob Osman, chief information officer for VITA, did not directly address the frustrations expressed by agencies. However, he did say the registry is a key part of the agency’s approach to AI oversight.
On Monday, Osman presented a chart that indicated that the use of AI is accelerating. AI is currently being used to help the Department of Transportation determine when roads need to be paved, to aid the Department of Quality review and approve water permits faster and help VITA create programs faster with fewer mistakes, improving government technology tools more efficiently.
“If you look at the results, we’ve come a long way in terms of where we got started, and in terms of the number of use cases (that) are approved in Virginia,” Osman said, “and we’re finding more and more use cases as agencies look at opportunities and try to learn about ways of taking advantage and harnessing this really powerful technology.”
He added that “every job is going to involve some kind of AI. There’s just no way around it.”
Relatedly, Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, who represents Virginia, and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley from Missouri introduced bipartisan legislation called the AI-Related Jobs Clarity Act. The bill aims to track jobs lost to AI as part of a broader effort to increase transparency about AI use in government. 
Under the proposed legislation, major companies and federal agencies would be required to report AI-related layoffs to the U.S. Department of Labor, which would compile them into a publicly available report.
“Good policy starts with good data,”  Warner said in a Nov. 5 statement. “This bipartisan legislation will finally give us a clear picture of AI’s impact on the workforce – what jobs are being eliminated, which workers are being retrained, and where new opportunities are emerging. 
The goal is to “make sure AI drives opportunity instead of leaving workers behind,” Warner said.

The Legislature’s Judiciary Committee has a work session scheduled for 1:30 p.m. to discuss LD 1009, the proposal from Rep. Chad Perkins (R-Dover-Foxcroft) that would provide an avenue to restore certain rights for a person convicted of a nonviolent felony after they have repaid their debt to society. The legislation, which was carried over from the first session, stipulates that those rights can’t be restored until 10 years after any imposed sentence is completed. 
The committee held a public hearing for the bill on May 1, during which the Department of Public Safety came out against the measure due to limited resources that would make it difficult to take on the additional workload it would require. While the judicial branch testified neither for nor against the proposal, a representative pointed out that there is not a current digital mechanism for the department to communicate this sort of information with the courts nor does the bill leave room for any judicial review. 
During the public hearing, Perkins was asked if he would support an alternative approach, such as reclassifying those nonviolent crimes. However, he declined saying there needs to be some price to bring justice for victims but said he is open to amending the process for one’s rights to be restored, so long as it maintains the intent of the bill. 
As of Tuesday afternoon, there were no amendments listed on the committee’s website.
The committee held two work sessions back in May, but didn’t take action on the proposal and carried it over to the next session, which technically starts in January. 
The bill isn’t the only gun reform that the committee is slated to revisit. It also opted to wait to take action on proposed legislation regarding the state’s 72-hour waiting period for firearm purchases because of an ongoing lawsuit over the law. 
A bill that would require the Department of Public Safety to adopt rules specifying minimum security requirements for gun shops, LD 1821, was also carried over from last session.

(Photo by Graham Moomaw/ Virginia Mercury)A provision significantly limiting the sale of intoxicating hemp products made its way into legislation to reopen the federal government just a day before the Senate approved the bill. Its inclusion follows years of pressure from states and the marijuana industry.
While states continue to expand access to legal marijuana, a separate market of hemp-derived intoxicants has blossomed. The products, from drinks to gummies, are sold in gas stations and smoke shops. Critics say some companies have exploited a legal loophole from 2018 to manufacture products that get people high — without the safety regulations and taxes facing the legal marijuana industry.
That’s led dozens of states to limit or ban certain intoxicating hemp products. Most states also have pushed for federal changes, though some farm states worry the pending federal bill — which the House is expected to vote on as soon as today — goes too far.
A bipartisan group of 39 state attorneys general recently urged Congress to clarify the federal definition of hemp, arguing that the underregulated industry threatens public health and undermines law enforcement.
Texas lawmakers this year approved a strict ban on intoxicating hemp, but that measure was vetoed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. The governor raised constitutional concerns because federal law allowed the products, but he then issued an executive order increasing state agency regulations, including age restrictions.
This summer, Florida regulators seized tens of thousands of packages of hemp products that failed to meet new child protection standards, including child-resistant packaging, marketing restrictions and enhanced labeling rules. In Tallahassee, the state Senate approved a ban on hemp-derived THC products, including beverages, but that measure died in the state House. A similar effort last year was vetoed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who said it would harm small businesses.
Last month, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation strengthening state enforcement of its ban on intoxicating hemp products. Similarly, Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine declared an emergency last month in an executive order banning intoxicating hemp products for 90 days while lawmakers debate potential legislation.
Missouri hemp businesses fear new federal THC limits will destroy the industry

Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is the primary psychoactive component of the cannabis plant. The 39 state attorneys general argue manufacturers are manipulating hemp to produce synthetic THC that can be more intoxicating than marijuana.
“In this way, legal, nonintoxicating hemp is used to make Frankenstein THC products that get adults high and harm and even kill children,” the attorneys general wrote.
Hemp-derived gummies and beverages are sold without consistent age restrictions or labeling regulations and oftentimes resemble candy. During his announcement, DeWine showcased brightly packaged intoxicating hemp products that resembled name-brand candy products.
“Certainly, it’s easy to see how a child will confuse this product with real candy and eat a few gummy bears and ingest enough THC to require hospitalization,” he said, according to the Ohio Capital Journal.
Though it has faced mounting restrictions in the states, the hemp industry says the federal change poses an existential threat.
On Monday, the U.S. Hemp Roundtable said the legislation pending in Congress would wipe out 95% of the nation’s $28.4 billion hemp industry.
“The language will force patients, seniors and veterans who rely on hemp products to break federal criminal law to acquire them,” the trade group posted online.
Jonathan Miller, general counsel for the organization, said the industry has been pushing for regulation rather than outright prohibition. He acknowledged the problem of bad actors, but said those can be addressed with strong regulations like those that exist in Kentucky and Minnesota.
“These are good examples of states that have put together robust regulations. But we need to see that at the federal level, and we’ve been supporting legislation to do that for the last seven years,” he told Stateline.
Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, Kentucky’s senior senator, said he included the hemp measure in the bill to close an unintended legal loophole and that the measure would still allow farmers to grow hemp for fiber, oil and drug trials.
But fellow Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul said the move would “eradicate the hemp industry” and could override some state laws. Paul offered an amendment to remove the hemp provision but failed.
The hemp loophole
Hemp derives from the same cannabis species as marijuana, but is legally defined by its lower levels of THC, the psychoactive component of the plant.
While marijuana remains illegal under federal law, Congress sanctioned hemp in the 2018 farm bill to allow an agricultural market for hemp-based textiles, animal feeds and human wellness products centered on cannabidiol, or CBD, products. The farm bill allowed cultivation of hemp plants with a THC concentration of 0.3% or lower by dry weight.
But that threshold has become essentially meaningless, said Katharine Neill Harris, a fellow in drug policy at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.
That’s because manufacturers have found ways to convert legal hemp plants into potent forms of synthetic marijuana. Aside from the potential of creating very strong products, she said the process requires the addition of solvents and other ingredients that raise many safety questions.
Kratom faces increasing scrutiny from states and the feds

“With marijuana products, you can get some very potent products,” she said. “But the psychoactive components to THC are naturally occurring. It naturally occurs in that natural amount. You’re not doing a whole bunch of manipulation to increase the potency of the product and adding ingredients.”
Harris has tracked the growing number of states regulating the industry: Six states and the District of Columbia now ban all consumable hemp products with any amount of THC. In 24 states, intoxicating hemp products are permitted, though 15 of those states allow only low-potency products.
But even states with strict regulations still must contend with legal online markets.
“There’s a big part of that activity that you can’t control as a state when something is federally legal, and so that’s one thing that they’re asking for is federal leadership on this issue,” she said. “I think there is a big demand for some sort of industry standards.”
If approved by Congress and signed by the president, as expected, the new hemp legislation will likely have uneven impacts across the states.
For example, the change likely won’t dramatically alter the legal landscape in Alaska, where the regulators have banned all intoxicating hemp products. Marijuana businesses complain those products are still being sold, despite the ban.
But in a state like Nebraska, where lawmakers have been unsuccessful in limiting intoxicating hemp, the change could drastically alter both consumer access and business sales, depending on enforcement.
On Monday, Paul said the federal legislation would wipe away hemp regulations in many states, including Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine and Utah.
“The bill before us nullifies all these state laws,” he said.
‘Running with knives’
The hemp industry has argued that a lot of the opposition to it stems from marijuana businesses looking to protect their own markets, noting that campaigns for restrictions are often more organized in states that have legalized marijuana.










Everybody is using hemp as a cover to basically sell intoxicating drugs.


– Andrew Mullins, president and executive director of the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association


But producers of intoxicating hemp are looking for market access without the associated safety regulations and tax structures states have created for marijuana, argued Chris Lindsey, the director of state advocacy and public policy at the American Trade Association for Cannabis and Hemp, an organization representing the legal marijuana industry.
“They want to have some kind of regulatory framework that’s somehow different than the one that states already have [for marijuana],” he said.
His organization cheered the Senate’s efforts “to address the dangerous proliferation of unregulated synthetic THC products.”
Lindsey said hemp-derived products can contain contaminants, including pesticides. Many hemp products can be sourced cheaply overseas, he said, and with lax oversight, there is no system to recall tainted products here.
“To me, that’s like running with knives,” he told Stateline.
Floridians react to federal legislation that could ‘devastate’ state’s hemp industry

The Missouri Cannabis Trade Association recently purchased hemp products from gas stations and smoke shops from across the state to test them in an effort to show they need more regulation.
In its “Missouri Hemp Hoax Report,” the organization said independent testing found 53 of the 55 products purchased were actually intoxicating marijuana well above the legal limit of THC. Third-party lab results also showed some of the products contained pesticides and heavy metals.
Those results underscore that the products should face the same rules as legal marijuana does, said Andrew Mullins, president and executive director of the cannabis trade association. State law requires marijuana to be grown and manufactured in Missouri, mandates lab testing and allows for sales only at licensed dispensaries.
“In my mind, if it’s marijuana, which most of this is, then it should be regulated like marijuana,” Mullins said.
He said calling the unregulated products “hemp” is akin to someone selling whiskey and calling it corn: “Everybody is using hemp as a cover to basically sell intoxicating drugs.”
Mullins acknowledged the confusion among policymakers and law enforcement. But he said there are already laws — including those against trafficking marijuana without a license — that could help address the issue.
Catherine Hanaway, a Republican who was sworn in as Missouri’s new attorney general in September, has vowed action on unregulated hemp products, particularly THC beverages that are booming in popularity.
“Our focus is on the health and safety of Missourians,” James Lawson, her deputy chief of staff, told the Missouri Independent last month. “This is an unregulated industry that makes untested, unknown substances available to the public without any oversight, including children where we think it’s particularly detrimental.”

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)New Ohio legislation that would require doctors to read a legal statement before medication abortions telling patients they can sue them could create a new barrier to constitutionally protected abortion care, experts say.
The Republican-led Ohio Senate Bill 309 would require health care providers who prescribe drugs to induce an abortion to also provide a statement and written information to patients about their ability to sue their health care providers, before the drugs can be prescribed.
The statement included in the language of the bill would read that “the state of Ohio wants you to be aware that you and your family may hold the manufacturer, distributor, your health care provider and the health care facilities financially accountable” if the patients dies, is injured, or suffers complications.
Providers, facilities, and manufacturers would also be held liable for “debilitating side effects” such as rupture of unknown ectopic pregnancy or infection “if the provider doesn’t address the side effect,” or “if the medication fails to terminate the pregnancy which results in a failed abortion or requires surgical intervention.”
Doctors, researchers, and advocates alike say the bill could bring a chilling effect to the relationship between doctors and their patients.
“I think it could be really damaging to the physician-patient relationship,” said Dr. Tracy Griffith, and OB/GYN at University Hospitals and a member of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. “It feels like it’s designed to produce mistrust.”
Griffith said she and other doctors are already trained to provide the risks of any medication they prescribe, and to have conversations about what’s best for the individual patient with whom they’re working.
The training extends to treatment of any complications that might arise, and always has, according to Griffith.
The new measure in the Ohio legislature wouldn’t address any supposed issues with the medication itself that anti-abortion groups and anti-abortion lawmakers bring up.
“This bill isn’t going to improve the safety of this medication, it’s not going to improve the medical advice I give them,” Griffith said.
“It’s going to scare providers away from providing the medicine or scare patients away from this option.”
Conducting a medication abortion before providing the statement of legal liability could result in lawsuits from the patients, the maternal grandparents if the patient was a minor or died during the procedure, and the “father of the unborn child, if the father is married to the woman” at the time of the medication abortion, according to the bill.
The pregnant person’s next of kin could also sue the providers, facilities, and drug manufacturers if the person dies “due to the abortion or a complication related to the abortion.”
Those suing due to the medication abortion could ask for three times the cost of the medication, along with “damages for injuries and loss.”
The fact that the legal liability is singularly targeted at medication abortion is a giant red flag for Griffith, in a state that has constitutional protections for abortion care but also has a Republican-majority legislature who has produced several bills to try to further regulate reproductive health care.
“There is no other field of medicine where we’re talking about potential criminalization of care,” Griffith said.
Anti-abortion lobby group Ohio Right to Life released a statement saying they approve of the bill.
“Women who are facing a difficult choice should be given all the information they need to make such a critical decision,” said Ohio Right to Life Executive Director Carrie Snyder, in a statement.
“It is our hope that more women will see the dangers of abortion pills and make the decision to choose life, for their baby and themselves.”
The medication abortion option has been proven to be a safe one, with studies showing very rare rates of serious medical problems, even when administered through telehealth.
The rates are comparable or safer than over-the-counter pain relievers.
A 2024 study published in the journal Nature Medicine found that, of more than 6,000 medication abortions obtained through telehealth studied in the research, 97.7% “were complete without subsequent known intervention or ongoing pregnancy after the initial treatment.”
The study also found that 99.8% of the medication abortions did not include “serious adverse events.”
A 2015 study in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology studied women in the California Medicaid program who had an abortion, and found less than 1% of patients sought emergency room care for an abortion-related complication after the procedure.
For medication abortion specifically, the study found a “major complication rate” of 0.16%.
In comparison, about 1% to 2% of users of pain relievers like Advil and Aleve “experienced a serious (gastrointestinal) complication during treatment,” according to a 2013 study.
Epidemiology professor Alison Norris has already spent time in the Statehouse providing data for lawmakers on bills that could directly and indirectly impact reproductive health care and abortion medication.
She is ready to do it again for the newest measure.
“Holding medical providers who offer abortion care to a different standard is illogical,” Norris told the Capital Journal.
The professor is also the co-principal investigator for the Ohio Policy Evaluation Network (OPEN), a group of professors and academic researchers throughout Ohio and other states specifically focused on researching abortion and contraception policy impacts.
“We know that when there are a large number of regulations, it creates an environment in which it’s hard, sometimes impossible, to provide the standard of care that we want to,” Norris said.
With a standard of care that already includes providing patients with the risks and benefits of treatment and the likelihood of complications, Norris said “creating a complicated legal milieu makes it harder for providers to provider their care in the very best way.”
Because the safety of medication abortion has been so scientifically proven, Norris said, it would be better if more and more providers were able to offer the care, rather than regulating the treatment in a way that discourages use.
“The evidence is that it’s common, it’s safe, it’s very acceptable for people,” Norris said. “There’s all kinds of people for whom that is the best care, and we should be reducing the barriers to excellent care.”
Clinics like Planned Parenthood in Ohio are, at this point, used to legislation that attempts to regulate around the constitutional amendment 57% of Ohioans approved in 2023, and they see this as yet another “political attack.”
“This is another example of lawmakers not listening to the constituents’ will,” said Lauren Blauvelt, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio.
“It demonstrates that these are not lawmakers who are invested in serving their communities … but their own interests.”
The new legislation has been referred to the Ohio Senate Health Committee, but has not yet had a hearing scheduled.

Photos courtesy of candidatesA Democratic challenger focused on health care and housing and a local Republican business owner have officially qualified to compete in a special election to fill a vacant House seat in northeast Georgia.
Republican Mack “Dutch” Guest IV and Democrat Eric Gisler are on the ballot for the House District 121 special election on Tuesday, Dec. 9. Early voting starts Monday, Nov. 17.
The December special election was called after the abrupt resignation of Republican State Rep. Marcus Wiedower from Watkinsville, who stepped down to focus on his work as vice president of external affairs at the real estate firm Hillpointe. The district, which covers parts of Clarke and Oconee counties, is considered conservative-leaning, with Wiedower winning his last election with 61% of the vote.
Gisler, a tech executive and small business owner who challenged Wiedower in 2024, said he feels he has a chance to flip the seat in the special election after Georgia and national Democrats outperformed in the November elections and flipped two seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission in a landslide, winning statewide constitutional offices in Georgia for the first time since 2006.
“Reaching out to the same people, Democratic voters who voted last week, and thanking them for that, and asking them to turn out one more time to vote for me, and I think that gives us a real shot at winning this election,” Gisler said.

Gisler’s platform centers on increasing access to health care, addressing housing affordability and strengthening voting rights.
He said in an interview Tuesday that federal cuts to programs like health insurance and education are being ignored by state leaders.
“We need to look at innovative ways that the state of Georgia can step up and increase access to health, whether that’s financially or even just geographically,” Gisler said, pointing to the impending expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies that is likely to significantly increase the number of uninsured Georgians.
And Democratic Party of Georgia Chair Charlie Bailey echoed the sentiment in a statement.
“Democrats won this month’s PSC races not just in traditionally blue counties, but in swing counties and even deep-red counties that voted upwards of 60% for Trump last year. It’s proof positive that when Democrats invest, organize, and compete everywhere, we can’t be counted out anywhere,” Bailey said.
Democrats overperformed in every county in the state in this month’s off-year special elections except two: Webster and Miller counties. Those results were also influenced by municipal elections that favored Democrats.
Democrats rush to seize momentum after Georgia victories built on affordability messaging

Carmen Bergman, director of the House Republican Caucus, downplayed Democrats’ confidence in a statement, saying that Republicans have a “year-round political operation” and aren’t “relying on any real or imagined waves to guide electoral outcomes.”
“If Democrats think they can ride momentum into House District 121, they’re going to find the tide’s gone out,” Bergman said.
Republicans control 100 seats in the 180-seat chamber.
In a press release announcing his candidacy, Guest framed his campaign around local concerns. His core priorities are improving transportation, strengthening education and keeping communities safe. Guest helps run LAD Truck Lines, a Watkinsville-based transportation business, has served as president of the Oconee County Rotary Club and entered the race with endorsements from Oconee County Commissioner Mark Thomas and Sheriff James Hale.
“I want to focus on the issues that matter most to the people who call this district home,” Guest said in a statement. “In Atlanta, every decision I make will be for our families, for our businesses, and for our values.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)This is the second in a three-part series on New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability care system. You can read Part I here, and Part III will be published on Friday.

THEY CALL IT the disability cliff.
When young people with intellectual and developmental disabilities finish high school, they lose access to the extensive services provided by public school special education programs. Most parents work, and while that allows them to help support their adult children financially, their absence creates a care void that is not easy to fill.
Over many months, the Bulletin has explored abuse and neglect in New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability system through court filings, law enforcement documents, state records, and conversations with lawyers, advocates, and family members. Breakdowns in care in recent years have led to many instances of preventable harm — sometimes fatal harm — and left in their wake devastated families who wanted only to give their children opportunities for a good life but found tragedy instead.
Those tragedies often begin at the precarious edge of the disability cliff — and that was the case for the Weidlich family.
‘Looking for a body’
When Stephen “Stevie” Weidlich Jr. aged out of high school in 2017 at Crotched Mountain School for Students with Disabilities in Greenfield, his father, Stephen Weidlich Sr., saw few options.
Weidlich worked full time and Stevie’s mother wasn’t involved in his life. He considered trying to get designated by the state as an in-home care provider of state services, which would have allowed him to receive some Medicaid funding as Stevie’s caregiver. Such arrangements typically cost the government a fraction of what placement in a residential facility costs.

However, the family felt discouraged about pursuing that path when an employee of PathWays of the River Valley, one of 10 agencies designated by the state Department of Health and Human Services’ Bureau of Developmental Services to coordinate care for people with disabilities, stopped responding to their inquiries on the matter, Weidlich said in a recent interview. 
The one option that remained was to place Stevie in a home run by PathWays with a live-in caregiver, a service people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are legally entitled to receive through Medicaid and other state and federal dollars. 
Within a few years, Stevie would become a casualty of that system. In December 2022, police knocked on the Weidlich family’s door in Unity to tell them Stevie’s body had been found in the woods behind the home of his caregiver.
At the time of his death, Stevie, 26, was living in Allenstown with PathWays employee Douglas Onkundi.

The Bulletin would like to speak with you. Please email wskipworth@newhampshirebulletin.com or send an encrypted message via Signal to WillSkipworth.80.

As a live-in caregiver, it was Onkundi’s responsibility to ensure Stevie, who had physical, developmental, and intellectual disabilities, was given 24/7 care. However, according to documents from a state investigation obtained and being made public for the first time by the Bulletin, Onkundi wasn’t actually living in the home at the time of Stevie’s death. He told police he was living in Manchester, and would return to Allenstown to give Stevie his medications. In his stead, investigators learned, Onkundi was paying another man to live in the home and care for Stevie with part of his PathWays paycheck and pocketing the rest. The man had no formal training and was not officially authorized by Pathways or Stevie’s family. Neither Onkundi nor the other man were criminally charged.
In conversations with state investigators, PathWays managers said they’d told Onkundi on multiple occasions only trained staff can work with the people in their care. However, according to the report, Onkundi said there was “an unwritten rule that everything was OK unless PathWays said otherwise.”
On Dec. 18, 2022, security camera footage from a neighbor shows Onkundi leaving the home in the morning and returning around 8 p.m. the day Stevie died, per the report. 
Investigators were told Stevie had locked himself in the bedroom and that when Onkundi returned, he used a ladder to climb up to the window and discovered the glass was broken and Stevie was gone. Onkundi told state investigators he searched for Stevie, who had a history of fleeing, before calling police.

It was too late. A police dog found Stevie’s body in the woods behind the home. There was evidence of hypothermia and a blunt force injury to Stevie’s ribs consistent with either a fall or a blow to the chest, the police report said. It was a cold night with snow on the ground.
Weidlich said Onkundi called him after the death and what he said infuriated him even more. 
“Stevie was not mobile,” he said. “He was in a wheelchair. He can only crawl. (Onkundi) told me when he noticed Stevie was gone, he got in his car and drove around looking for Stevie. How does that make any f—ing sense?”
Onkundi told him they were looking for “the body.”
“You were looking for a body or you were looking for Stevie?” he said. “Obviously, if you were looking for a body, what does that say? You weren’t looking for a live person.”
‘Daddy, I can’t see’
Stevie was born in Long Island, New York, in 1996 and spent his early childhood there. Weidlich said Stevie had “an awesome sense of humor,” and the whole family remembers him as fun-loving and a jokester. He was 9 years old when his disabilities began to emerge.
“One day, I’m getting ready to go to work,” Weidlich said. “And he comes down from upstairs holding onto the wall. He goes, ‘Daddy, I can’t see.’ And I’m looking at him, and he’s got one eye at me and one eye off.”
The family rushed Stevie to the hospital, where they learned he had a type of growth called a cavernous malformation inside his brainstem. He had emergency brain surgery the next day to remove the growth.

The surgery was successful, but it affected Stevie’s equilibrium and required him to start using a wheelchair.
In 2006, the family relocated to Unity, New Hampshire, where Weidlich’s father lived. Stevie had been “falling between the cracks with school,” Weidlich said, and his wife was struggling with an opioid addiction.
“I decided to fall back, regroup, put my wife in rehab, and we found this place,” he said. “I moved everybody up here.”
In New Hampshire, Stevie was able to regain the ability to walk without a wheelchair through rehabilitation services. However, about a year later he started losing his balance again, so the Weidlichs brought him to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, where doctors discovered the growth was returning. The family brought Stevie back to New York for a second surgery in 2010. This time, doctors clipped a nerve.
“So he went into it being able to walk,” Weidlich said. “And came out of it not being able to walk anymore.”
Stevie was diagnosed with mild intellectual and developmental disabilities, and he began having behavioral issues.
“The second surgery affected him much more,” Weidlich said. “He’d have anger issues, and he’d just be frustrated.”
After Stevie left Crotched Mountain in 2017, PathWays placed him with a live-in caretaker named Prashanna Sangroula. Weidlich’s work schedule made him unable to give his son the 24/7 care he required, so PathWays provided residential care. Stevie and several others with disabilities lived happily in a house with Sangroula and Sangroula’s family. The young man would come home to Unity every other weekend and on holidays. The family loved Sangroula.
When the Sangroulas moved to Virginia, however, PathWays needed to find a new live-in caregiver. With Stevie’s behavioral issues and need for constant supervision, Weidlich said he was under no illusions about just how challenging that would be.
For a while, Stevie bounced among temporary caretakers until PathWays found him a more permanent home with Onkundi in Allenstown in October 2021.
Stephen Weidlich Sr. served in the army during the Persian Gulf War, something his son always admired about him. Stevie, who made this art project for his father, wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps and join the military himself. Crystal Weidlich, his stepmother, said: “He’d always joke, ‘They’re gonna build me a mecha-suit so I can walk and fight.’”
‘A lack of consequences’

The state investigation from the Bureau of Adult and Aging Services concluded that Onkundi had committed neglect. However, the bureau didn’t finalize that finding until November 2024, nearly two years after Stevie’s death. Onkundi is now legally ineligible to be a caregiver of people with disabilities, but in the nearly two years between Stevie’s death and that finding, he would’ve been legally permitted to work for PathWays or another agency. It’s unclear whether he did so. Onkundi did not answer the Bulletin’s phone calls, voicemails, or text messages.
PathWays didn’t respond to the Bulletin’s requests for an interview or comment. 
No criminal charges have been filed against Onkundi and the Attorney General’s Office concluded its investigation into Onkundi, the office told the Bulletin. The case has been kicked back down to the Allenstown Police Department, which doesn’t have legal authority to file manslaughter or murder charges but does have authority for lesser offenses. The Attorney General’s Office refused to answer the Bulletin’s questions about the case because the investigation is ongoing at the local level.

“Investigations of this nature can take time and may move between local law enforcement, county prosecutors, and this office depending on the circumstances,” Michael Garrity, director of communications for the Department of Justice, wrote in an email. “Investigating agencies cannot rush to judgment, but follow the evidence and the facts wherever they lead. Any prosecution must be supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. That standard is imposed on us by the law and professional ethics.”
Weidlich and Stevie’s stepmother, Crystal, now feel left in the dark. 
When he learned there would be no murder or manslaughter charges, Weidlich was angry. Allenstown police seemed serious about the investigation and kept them updated early on, he said, but as the attorney general got involved and time passed, they heard less and less. Still, he’s holding out hope that Allenstown police will file some sort of charges.
In the meantime, Weidlich has filed a lawsuit against PathWays and Onkundi, among others.
There were other apparent lapses in oversight, too.
The Incapacitated and Vulnerable Adult Fatality Review Committee is a board of experts established through state law to review concerning deaths of vulnerable or incapacitated people, evaluating if there were any failures in state policy or practices that led to the death. The board then makes recommendations on how to prevent future similar deaths.

Both co-chairs of that committee, Vanessa Blais and Francesca Broderick, told the Bulletin Stevie’s death was never brought before the committee. Agencies like the Bureau of Aging and Adult Services and Department of Health and Human Services — which both knew of the death and have representatives on the committee — aren’t legally obligated to report deaths to the committee. They’re merely encouraged. Still, when the Bulletin told her about Stevie’s death, Blais said she was shocked it hadn’t been brought to her committee.
Attorneys Kristin Ross and Cristina Rousseau, who are representing Weidlich in his lawsuit and have represented multiple families in this system, said tragedies like Stevie’s are symptomatic of a broken system.
“Really what we see is a lack of accountability and a lack of consequences when things go wrong within the area agency system, and frankly I think that starts at the top,” Ross said. “There are regulations that are supposed to be being followed, but what we find is they’re not, and there’s no consequences, and there’s a very laissez-faire attitude about the fact that they’re not being followed.”
Cristina Rousseau
In Stevie’s case, Rousseau noted the entire investigation focused on Onkundi.
“But you know what has never happened in any of the cases we’ve been involved (with)?” Rousseau said. “The area agencies are not investigated. They are the ones that have all of these duties, and when it comes to violations that have occurred, nobody looks at PathWays.”
Rousseau and Ross also point to what they consider a perverse financial incentive within the system of care.
“Something that we’ve seen is a pushback against allowing immediate family members to become the approved in-home care providers,” Ross said. “And instead a push towards individuals outside of the family.”
Agencies and caregivers earn significantly more money providing residential care than day services. According to PathWays’ contract with Onkundi, acquired by the Bulletin, Onkundi was paid more than $5,000 per month and more than $62,000 annually to care for Stevie. Had he been providing day services, he would’ve been paid about $1,400 a month and $17,000 annually, according to the contract.

“Everyone is always so concerned about waste, fraud, and abuse,” Ross said. “We are literally giving the state evidence of waste, fraud, and abuse within our very own state agency system, and nobody’s doing anything about it.”
Rousseau said the absence of state action is perplexing.
Kristin Ross
“You would think that somebody in the state would maybe want to take a look at this,” she said. “But they don’t even look at it. They just continue to pay and engage and give contracts to these area agencies after these issues have come to light. … The fact a civil lawsuit ends up being the vehicle to get answers for a family whose son died and froze to death in the care of somebody approved by the state tells me we are dealing with an incredibly broken, broken system.”
Before Stevie went to live with Onkundi, he told a case manager some of his hopes for the future, all of which were outlined in the service agreement as things for him to work toward with the help of his care team. He wanted a job, his own apartment near his family, and a romantic relationship one day.
 “You know, he wanted to have a girlfriend,” his father said. “He wanted a normal life.”

The Senate votes Thursday. If all goes as planned, the legislature will put four bills on the desk of Gov. Ned Lamont by Friday, setting the stage for the Democrat to formally launch his campaign for a third term with a degree of momentum, if not without challenges to address in the regular session in February.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Tuesday he will open the session with a debate on the revised version of House Bill 5002, an omnibus housing bill Lamont unexpectedly vetoed in June after the regular session, siding with Republican opponents and infuriating Democratic supporters.
“It will start bumpy, and it will land more smoothly,” Ritter said of the day. He noted that any measure pressuring suburbs to allow more multi-family housing “remains kind of an issue that divides the parties, frankly, in our chamber.” No Republican voted for H.B. 5002.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, forecasted more than a little turbulence, as did Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield.
“I think tomorrow is going to be a barn burner,” Candelora said Tuesday. “It is one thing to go into session to address a potential emergency — and that being the federal shutdown and the loss of programs that impact Connecticut residents. And I think that Republicans stepped to the plate to meet that moment and to help our residents. It’s a whole other thing to start pushing agenda items that not only aren’t emergent in nature, but I think were already hotly contested in the regular session.”
The special session coincides with the U.S. House returning to Washington after nearly a two-month absence to vote on reopening the federal government, a step that takes away the sense of urgency, at least among Republicans, to empower the governor to subsidize federal hunger, nutrition and home heating programs.
Despite opposition by President Donald J. Trump to states offering alternative funding during the shutdown, leaders of the Republican minorities in the General Assembly had voiced support for giving Lamont authority to spend state funds for SNAP and WIC food assistance and LIHEAP heating funding.
“I don’t think you’re going to get as much bipartisan support on this funding now that the shutdown is ending and SNAP is restored,” Harding said.
Prior to the shutdown, Democrats had urged the governor to call a special session to increase state budget reserves in anticipation of needing to meet federal cuts that were passed in July in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but will not be felt fully until after the midterm elections in 2026.
One of the bills up for a vote Wednesday will give the governor emergency authority to exceed the spending cap and raise the ceiling on the state’s rainy day fund by $500 million. It now has $4.3 billion, the maximum allowed by the statutory limit of 18% of the general fund.
With the shutdown in mind, the bill gives Lamont authority to draw from the budget reserves within certain parameters until the regular session begins on Feb. 4.
“Look, the $500 million is a safety net. ‘On again, off again.’ You never knew what the federal government was doing,” Lamont said. “That was loud and clear when it came to SNAP. We had six different directives in seven different days. Maybe they’re going to solve the shutdown over the next 48 hours. Little less need for the $500 million at that point, but at least we have the backstop if we need it.”
Decisions on how to use the $500 million most likely won’t be made until the regular session. 
Even if federal funding of SNAP is restored, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act tightened the eligibility requirements, most likely denying about 10% of the 366,000 recipients aid over the next three months. A more expensive loss to address are expiring subsidies that make health insurance affordable on the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act.
Those could cost $350 million annually, Ritter said at a press conference Monday.
“So, you got to be more careful about the Big Beautiful Bill cuts, but we’re going to make sure that nobody vulnerable gets left behind,” Lamont said Tuesday after a press conference at Waterbury Hospital.

A third bill scheduled for a vote Wednesday would enable UConn Health to purchase and make improvements at Waterbury Hospital, then operate it under a public private partnership. The fourth bill was a legislative catch-all, with provisions on childhood mental health, a funding mechanism for a cancer fund, and limits on how Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can operate around courthouses and access health data.
The immigration measure is expected to get pushback from Republicans, who have accused Democrats of hindering federal law enforcement operations.
Lamont and Comptroller Sean Scanlon, who helped negotiate the Waterbury deal, said the state must do more to stabilize affordable health care.
With Lamont’s support, Scanlon has been working on a public health insurance option, reviving an effort Scanlon first made as a state lawmaker in 2019. The governor and comptroller promise to roll out details in the near future, most likely with an eye towards legislative action next year.
“There’s two prongs in health care right now: The cost of delivering it costs too much, and the insurance that covers that care is covering too little,” Scanlon said. “And the small group market that helps a lot of people insure, that is dying. And so I think what the governor’s strategy is going forward is a multi-pronged approach to make sure that everyone in Connecticut has access to care through affordable insurance, and that everyone that goes to use that insurance can get affordable, low cost, but high quality care.”
Candelora complained Tuesday that lawmakers would be returning to Hartford on Wednesday without seeing fully vetted legislation. Lamont and Democratic lawmakers released a summary of the housing bill on Friday.
He objected to a provision that would allow housing to be built as of right in commercial zones.
“You know, local zoning is there for a reason, but we are prioritizing housing over commercial needs that help support a tax base, but also enhance the quality of communities,” Candelora said.
House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said the revised bill allows for greater influence than the original over housing that could go in commercial zones.
“We did it with parameters” suggested by local officials, Rojas said. One change, he said, is that housing can be built as a right in commercial zones, but not as a conversion of existing commercial buildings.
In vetoing the original bill, that was one of the provisions Lamont had applauded.
“Commercial ‘as of right’ makes really good sense to me,” Lamont said. “Rather than have an empty, underused office building, people can convert that, do that, you know, more quickly and readily. But I think we have to do it the way that people buy in.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0522_SR_Session_180-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 05:57:11.691483

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star) Five hundred in Ogunquit, another 700 in Damariscotta and Portland, and a packed theater in Bath last week. Despite a running list of foul-mouthed controversies and staffing defections, Graham Platner is still drawing crowds — and Maine’s political establishment needs to recognize why.
It’s possible that voters have more tolerance for bigotry — or at least bigoted language — in a predominantly white, rural state. But I don’t think that is what is going on here, and the impulse among outsiders to dismiss Platner’s popularity this way ignores a much more urgent dynamic that captures how many voters are feeling right now: fed up.
To recap, in Platner’s most publicized comments, made in Reddit forums spanning nearly a decade — reported in local and national outlets days after Democratic Party-favorite Maine Gov. Janet Mills entered the race — he’s been shown to dismiss military sexual assaults, question Black patrons’ tipping habits, demean LGBTQ+ people, and criticize police officers and rural Americans, while advocating for the potential need to take up arms against facism. 
And there’s the question of the tattoo, which he said he got in 2007 while partying with fellow Marines overseas, and the ongoing ambiguity over when he realized it closely resembled a Totenkopf, the symbol of the Nazi Schutzstaffel, or SS, police unit. 
For many, these symbols and statements are beyond the pale and underscore how little is known about the man who does not have a political record to lean on when making the case that those views do not represent the person he is today.
But reporting on thousands of other comments that Platner made between July 2009 and November 2021 paints a more complex picture.
In the posts, the oyster farmer coarsely rails against racism, facism, American imperialism and the political establishment. 
He said homophobia is “indefensible” and described the military’s discriminatory treatment of same-sex spouses as “pretty goddamn disgusting.” According to socialist magazine Jacobin, he blasted a Republican U.S. House candidate for saying that police will only shoot a Black person who “needs to be shot,” calling him a “racist motherf***er,” and complained that no one cared about handgun violence because “nobody really gives a sh*t about things until it’s well spoken white kids getting hurt.”
There are many such examples.
‘Washington need not apply:’ How Mainers are evaluating controversy-laden Graham Platner

And for many Mainers, who are not just reading mainstream political coverage of the old posts but who are listening to his speeches and statements today, they have an alternative view of Platner, and it is one they have decided they can still get behind.
“I needed to question this notion of: Is he authentic or not?” South Portland resident Frank Smith recently told reporter Emma Davis. “When I heard his responses, I mean, he owned what happened. He dealt with it honestly. He didn’t misdirect or obfuscate, and I think that says a tremendous amount for an individual, especially politicians.”
For Platner’s fans, these events have become part of a narrative, in which a regular (ie. white, straight) American Joe sacrificed himself for his nation and came home broken and disaffected; who gradually healed with the help of community, connection and Veterans Affairs benefits, and is now taking on the establishment, which is bent on destroying him.
His candidacy does not fit in a very tidy box, but it is telling that many of his supporters find his past statements abhorrent and still prefer him to the Democratic Party status quo.
A look at Janet Mills
In an Oct. 20 social media post, community organizer Safiya Khalid highlighted why she is sticking with Platner, articulating a theme I’ve seen voiced repeatedly — that his popularity has almost as much to do with Mills as it does with him.
“The truth is the bar in politics has been set low for a long time, not because of new candidates like Graham but because those already in power keep failing to deliver real change,” wrote Khalid, who in 2019 was the first Somali-American elected to the Lewiston City Council and later stepped away from politics due to racist comments she was subject to both during her campaign and later from within her own party. 
“I am choosing to support someone who is not part of the same political machine, someone who might not be perfect but is willing to fight for something different,” she said. “Maine deserves new energy, real accountability, and a leader who actually listens.”
Mills, whose record includes many mainstream bonafides like fighting for abortion rights and expanding health care access, gained national prominence for taking on the Trump administration over its attacks on transgender students. But a closer look at her policies reveals how time and again she angered many Democratic voters.
Khalid pointed specifically to the governor’s 2021 veto of a bill that would have closed the Long Creek Youth Development Center, the state’s last youth prison, as well as more recent actions such as postponing her decision on a bill that would restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, and coming out against a ballot referendum to institute a red flag law, which ultimately passed last week with 62% of the vote.
But Mills has blocked even more popular proposals, such as legislation to restore tribal sovereignty to the Wabanaki Nations, not just breaking from Democrats but a growing bipartisan consensus that it’s “the right f***ing thing to do,” as Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Troy Jackson put it.










I am choosing to support someone who is not part of the same political machine, someone who might not be perfect but is willing to fight for something different.

The governor has also vetoed more than a half dozen bills that would improve labor standards — including multiple efforts to include farmworkers in the state minimum wage, a measure that finally passed this spring — which is likely what drove labor groups to recruit Platner to run against her.
Mills also axed several proposals to reform the state’s criminal code at a time when the public defense system is in crisis and hundreds of low-income Mainers are being held in jail without representation.
In a recent column about Platner, Shay Stewart Bouley, a writer and former elected official who runs a Boston-based racial justice organization (and who has written for Maine Morning Star), wrote that while his comments “are bad, racism is ultimately about power and privilege that favors white people and exploits and oppresses Black folks and other people of color.” She notes that Mills “has an actual track record when it comes to communities of color and marginalized folks … that is far less than stellar.”

Even the issue that propelled Mills into the national consciousness, transgender rights, the governor argued was more about states’ rights and later said Maine’s policy allowing trans girls to compete in girls’ sports was “worthy of debate” — not exactly a ride-or-die pronouncement.
Mills has built her Senate campaign around her record of standing up to President Donald Trump, the accomplishments of her two terms in the Blaine House, and her ability to win a statewide race — something only four other Democrats have done in the past 50 years. No small potatoes. 
But, she’s only managed to issue milquetoast critiques of U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican and her actual opponent in the race, and doesn’t have much to say about the broader system or structures that enabled this moment.
And then there is the issue of age. Mills is a septuagenarian and, if elected, would be the oldest incoming freshman senator in history. And while no one is questioning her ability to lead, she represents an era of politicians seen as out of touch at best and, at worst, complicit in defending the status quo that helped propel Trump to power.
“I’d like to see politics more in the hands of younger generations of people,” Bill DeLong of Biddeford told Davis. “It’s not working right now.”
‘A new kind of politics’?
Regardless of your political leanings, it has been a tough few years for the vast majority of Americans, and I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that there is an absence of hope. 
It is in that void that Platner has been able to flourish. With a platform focused on ending the influence of money in politics, enacting Medicare for All, increasing taxes on billionaires, passing federal anti-discrimination legislation, developing federal child care policy, implementing congressional term limits, taking on Pentagon waste and corruption and ending “pointless” wars including what he described as the genocide in Gaza, among other positions, he’s struck a nerve with young people and other voters who have felt ignored by leaders of both dominant parties.
“Everyone in Maine — Republican or Democrat, Trump supporter or progressive — when you walk around this state, you ask any working person in the state, ‘Do you think that you live in a system — a political system, an economic system — that has your best interest at heart?’ Nobody says yes to that,” Platner told the crowd during an October town hall event in Collins’ hometown Caribou. 
Another Senate candidate drops out to endorse Mills as Platner controversies stack up

Platner has said he wants to build a movement that can help organize people around a “new kind of politics.” And he’s painted himself as the former Marine who can take a beating from the powers that be to help usher in that era of change.
Much to the chagrin of national Democratic leaders looking to pick up Maine’s Senate seat in the midterm elections, the primary is proving to be a bigger headache than they likely anticipated. But it is the same dynamic playing out across the country, with voters on the left increasingly dissatisfied with the same old playbook and the same old people.
For Mainers, the Senate primary race cuts too close to other elections in recent memory where it felt as if an invisible force was pushing back against the tide of popular sentiment, such as President Joe Biden’s attempt at reelection in 2024, or former Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon’s failed bid to oust Collins in 2020, or even Hillary Clinton versus Bernie Sanders — who won the state’s 2016 Democratic presidential caucus by a landslide. Maine voters are sick of being told who to vote for.
There are others in the race, namely former congressional aide Jordan Wood, but state leaders shouldn’t have been so quick to clear the field for Mills, leaving voters with a choice primarily between someone with too much baggage and too little experience, and someone they see as having helped build the system they are now buckling under.
Platner has said this campaign “is not just about beating Susan Collins” or “flipping the Senate back to a Democratic side,” but rather “it is about building in the state of Maine an organized working class power that we have not seen in generations.”
Whatever happens with the campaign, it seems that his candidacy has already given voice to some deep frustrations among voters. Leaders would be wise to listen.

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)The United States was founded on the idea that government exists to serve its people. To do this, government must deliver services that promote the common good. When the government shuts down, it fails to meet its fundamental purpose.
While government shutdowns are not new in the U.S., most have lasted less than a week. At 40 days, the current shutdown may well be on the way to an end this week, as enough Senate Democratic caucus members have voted with Republicans on a measure to reopen the government. But it will remain the longest in the history of the nation.
When the government shuts down for such a long time, it inflicts hardships, anxieties and irritations on its citizens. You might wonder why elected officials allow lengthy disruptions to happen.
It is common to blame the politicians for the shutdown. However, as a philosopher who researches democracy, I think the fault lies also with us, the citizens. In a democracy, we generally get the politics we ask for, and the electorate has developed a taste for political spectacle over competent leadership.
American democracy has grown increasingly tribal, leading us to become more invested in punishing our partisan rivals than in demanding competent government. We are infatuated with the spectacle of our side dominating the other.
Understandably, politicians have embraced obstruction. They have learned that deadlock can pay, because they have the support of their voters in behaving this way. Politics is no longer about representation and policy, it’s now about vanquishing and even humiliating the other side.
 
More fervent, not better informed
To see this, we must examine polarization. Let’s start by distinguishing two kinds of polarization.
First is political polarization. It measures the divide between the U.S.’s two major parties. When political polarization is severe, the common ground among the parties falls away. This naturally undermines cooperation. That Republicans and Democrats are politically polarized is certainly part of the explanation for the shutdown.
But that’s not the entire story. As I argue in my book “Civic Solitude,” the deeper trouble has to do with belief polarization.
Unlike political polarization, which measures the distance between opposing groups, belief polarization occurs within a single group. In belief polarization, like-minded people transform into more extreme version of themselves: Liberals become more liberal, conservatives become more conservative, Second Amendment advocates become more pro-gun, environmentalists become more green, and so on.
Importantly, this shift is driven by the desire to fit in with one’s peers, not by evidence or reason. Hence, we become more fervent but no better informed.
Additionally, our more extreme selves are also more tribal and conformist. As we shift, we become more antagonistic toward outsiders. We also become more insistent on uniformity within our group, less tolerant of differences.
 
Animosity and obstruction
The combination of intensifying antagonism toward those on the “other side” and escalating cohesion among those on “your side” turns all aspects of life into politics.
In the U.S. today, liberals and conservatives are heavily socially segregated. They live in different neighborhoods, work in different professions, vacation in different locations, drive different vehicles and shop in different stores. Everyday behavior has become an extension of partisan affiliation.
Ironically, as everyday life becomes politically saturated, politics itself becomes more about lifestyle and less about policy. Research suggests that while animosity across the parties has intensified significantly, citizens’ disagreements over policy have either remained stable or eased. We dislike one another more intensely yet are not more divided.
This paints a grim portrait of U.S. democracy. Note that this condition incentivizes politicians to amplify their contempt for political rivals. Politicians seek to win elections, and stoking negative feelings such as fear and indignation are potent triggers of political behavior, including voting.
Consequently, when citizens are belief-polarized, animosity and obstruction become winning electoral strategies. Meanwhile, politicians are released from the task of serving the common good.
 
Channeling contempt

It is no surprise that discussions of the shutdown have consistently focused on blame.
The Republicans, who hold the congressional majority, have sought to score points by depicting the shutdown as the Democrats’ fault. Several official websites maintained by the federal government included statements denouncing the shutdown as strictly the doing of the Democrats. Their aim has been to channel citizens’ frustration into contempt for the Democratic Party.
At the beginning of the shutdown, House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed that there was “literally nothing to negotiate” with congressional Democrats.
But there’s the rub. Democratic government is fundamentally a matter of negotiation. Neither winning an election nor being a member of the majority party means that you can simply call the shots. The constitutional procedures by which our representatives govern are designed to force cooperation, collaboration and compromise.
Thanks to polarization, however, these noble ideals of political give-and-take have dissolved. Cooperation is now seen as surrender to political enemies. That’s very clear in many Democrats’ outraged reactions to the eight senators from their caucus who have now voted with Republicans to end the shutdown.
Meanwhile, more than 1 million government employees haven’t been paid, many crucial government services have been interrupted, diminished or suspended, and, with the Thanksgiving holiday approaching, travelers are experiencing flight disruptions. While there may be an end to the shutdown on the near horizon, any deal could simply postpone crucial policy debates and could well end in another shutdown in the new year.
The key to avoiding this kind of failure is to become a citizenry that demands competent government over partisan domination.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)If Ohio was a wholly owned subsidiary of Trump World, faithfully executing the corrupt orders of an unforgiving boss, would Ohioans even blink an eye? 
Trumpian taskmasters in the Ohio Statehouse already execute public policy based on the dictates of the MAGA king. So, what is the difference? 
Unquestioning obedience to the convicted felon drove Ohio Republicans (with obliging Democrats) to intensify congressional district manipulation and give Trump the gerrymandered advantage he demanded ahead of the 2026 elections. 
The boss also ordered red states to make it harder for voters to cast ballots in the midterms. Less turnout is less threatening. Trump fears the results of a referendum on his regime. 
The Ohio Senate is in his corner. 
State Sen. Theresa Gavarone, as usual, leads the anti-voter brigade on the pretense of election integrity. 
She doesn’t even come up with new excuses to erect barriers to voting anymore. 
The Bowling Green Republican, behind one of the strictest voter ID laws in the country, longs to get on right-wing radar by going more extreme than MAGA Republicans in Congress to disenfranchise voters with made-up election fraud remedies unsupported by evidence.  
Last week, the Ohio Senate passed one of Gavarone’s bills in record time. But Ohio Senate Bill 293 was a rush order from Trump World. 
It came with an explicit warning: get rid of mail-in voting or risk the wrath of Trump’s Department of Justice in court. 
The only U.S. president who conspired to overturn an election he lost, with lies about widespread mail ballot fraud, is laying the groundwork to delegitimize another election with the same fantastical and false claims about vote-by-mail fraud. 
He is again sowing baseless doubts about secure mail-in voting systems used by nearly 1 in 3 Americans in 2024. 
All it took for Ohio Senate Republicans to go along was a little federal pressure/extortion. 
For no compelling reason, they voted to stop counting legitimate mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day in Trump-friendly legislation that mirrored his legally shaky executive order in March. 
The EO decreed ballots received post-election invalid and commanded voters produce birth certificates or passports as proof of eligibility — to create unwarranted obstacles for millions of Americans who simply want to vote. 
Gavarone co-sponsored correlating legislation, Ohio Senate Bill 153, to impose the same burden on Ohioans. 
It appears to be on the fast track for passage. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Meanwhile, Ohio Senate Bill 293 is headed to the Ohio House to become another voter suppression law in the state. 
It would arbitrarily eliminate the mail-in ballot “grace period” in Ohio and cause legal ballots to be thrown out. 
But the eminently absurd Gavarone insisted, “we want all valid votes to count, and the process needs to be done on Election Day” or we will turn into pumpkins at the close of polls. 
Republican lawmakers who previously shortened the deadline (from 10 to four days) in which those late-arriving ballots, postmarked by Election Day, were counted now embrace Trump’s edict not to process any ballot received past Election Day — lest unchecked power be checked by incoming ballots. 
In 2024, almost 10,000 mail-in ballots from eligible Ohio voters arrived in the four-day window that would be eliminated in SB 293. 
That’s 10,000 citizens, enough to flip a race, summarily disenfranchised. 
Tough luck if you’re a registered voter in good standing, particularly one who is elderly or disabled or lives in rural areas, and postal delays beyond your control cancel your vote. 
It’s crazy. Over a million Ohioans used mail-in ballots to vote in the last presidential election. That’s about 17% of the nearly 5,900,000 votes cast. 
More registered Republicans voted by mail in Ohio in 2024, than Democrats did. 
Voters 65 and older, Ohio’s biggest age demographic, were far and away the biggest users of mail-in voting, returning roughly 520,000 ballots by mail a year ago. 
Why not vote from the convenience of home and bypass lines at the polls? 
Voting by mail, which surged to record rates in the 2020 election, is still pretty popular and a majority of Americans favor allowing the option to make it safer, easier and more reliable for people to cast ballots. 
They don’t buy Trump’s ravings about mail voting fraud which, in truth, is exceedingly rare. 
But after Democratic victories in off-year elections last week Trump again railed baselessly about “rigged” mail voting and called on congressional Republicans to ban it outright “except for military, far away military, and people that are very sick.”  
He is seeding the ground for rejection of midterm election results he doesn’t like in a throwback to 2020. 
We’ve seen this movie before. 
Ohioans should know the part their Statehouse politicians are playing in the Trump sequel, how they dutifully execute legislative assaults on voting rights (or else) to enable rule by fiat not the ballot box.
So is the Statehouse is working for Trump World instead of us? 
Mia Lewis, of Common Cause Ohio, asked Trumpian taskmasters directly in recent testimony against SB 293. 
“Senator Gavarone often asks, ‘Isn’t even just one instance of fraudulent vote too many?’ Of course. It could theoretically skew the result. Luckily, this is so vanishingly rare it has not had and could not have had any impact. But if someone who is eligible to vote — who wants to vote, does everything legally to vote — if they have their voted ballot cast aside uncounted, isn’t that too many, Senator Gavarone?”

The first vehicle in Storrs was a 4.5-horsepower Mobile Steamer, driven in 1904 by a mechanical arts instructor at the nascent Connecticut Agricultural College. Within an hour of parking on campus, he’d already received a citation.
The second sentence is, of course, completely false – but given the sensitivities surrounding parking on college campuses, maybe you paused for a moment and entertained that it might contain a nugget of truth.
That’s OK. Parking permits and enforcement on the University of Connecticut’s campuses isn’t the stuff of groundbreaking scientific research, high graduation rates, or championship athletic banners. But it’s a necessary piece of the puzzle that helps UConn achieve those and other goals, and an obligation we approach in the spirit of ensuring fairness amid space constraints.
A recent op-ed in this publication expressed opinions about the process as it relates to commuter students, calling it “punitive and costly” and “an important revenue source” for the university.
Let’s break down the revenues. UConn Parking Services is self-supporting, with its operations funded solely by permit sales, event parking fees, and citation payments. It doesn’t draw from tuition or state funds, and has no impact on academic operations, deficit mitigation, or other parts of the university budget.
However, it does move the needle in a notable way: Net proceeds are transferred annually to the university specifically to help fund financial aid, to the tune of more than $500,000 in a typical fiscal year. Many millions of dollars have been paid to UConn over the years, and in turn allocated to needy students through their financial aid packages.
Gross proceeds from citations, permits, and event parking fees go directly to operation and maintenance of the parking system and repayment of the UConn 2000 bonded debt used to build the South Garage.
In terms of fairness, parking enforcement is necessary to help ensure that UConn’s students, faculty, and staff have access to the spaces for which they bought permits. People who either park without permits or repeatedly violate the rules are taking spaces away from those who reasonably expect to use them.
None of this is to say we’re not sympathetic to the stresses of our students, of course, given the classes, work obligations, and other duties that so many of them juggle. In fact, to encourage voluntary compliance, thousands of the citations issued each year are warnings that carry no fines.
The new “boot” wheel immobilizer deployed this year at Storrs has also received attention, but it’s simply a helpful way of addressing cases when a driver has allowed more than $200 in fines to accrue.
Even then, the driver can simply and immediately pay by phone or online, receive a code to release the boot, and be on their way within minutes with directions to return the boot to a drop box open around the clock.
People who receive citations can also file appeals online, in person, or by mail – and if they are denied, they can appeal that denial if additional facts are available that might be pertinent.
We also work closely with our partners in the Windham Region Transit District regarding on-campus and regional bus availability; with the state Department of Transportation for the U-Pass that lets students ride its public transportation services without fares; and with UConn Police in their efforts to help ensure the safety of pedestrians, bicyclists, and scooter users.
A lot has changed since 1904, when Professor J.N. Fitts introduced the automobile to Storrs.
About 13,000 parking spaces are now on campus, with about 85% of them in use during peak periods. Since that demand can be unevenly distributed across campus, we recently launched the new Modii Smart Parking Finder on our website.
Simply put: It’s very reasonable for students, faculty, and staff with permits to expect access to one of those spaces. But to help make that happen, it’s necessary for UConn to consistently enforce parking rules, getting non-complaint vehicles moving so permit-holders get what they’re paying for.

In a YouGov poll of Connecticut votes released on Nov. 6 , acting to solve the housing crisis with real solutions was found to carry with it are likely to receive a 30 point net favorability boost. In other words, voters are watching Connecticut fail to act on the boiling housing crisis, and (when given the choice), they are voting for leaders who will.
In case you missed it, Connecticut just had an election. While there was much focus on some larger races that flipped seats, let me focus on just a few smaller races that prove this poll result is worth more than the paper it is written on:

In Fairfield, a town artificially divided over several controversial 8-30g projects, voters decisively backed a pro-housing slate for the Planning and Zoning Commission. The result flipped the board to a Democratic majority and ousted noted NIMBY activist Alexis Harrison, who has long denied the obvious truth: Connecticut has a shortage of homes.
In Newington, the recently re-elected mayor was accosted while door knocking to do something to improve the housing shortage. Newington has for decades been a “build nothing, deny everything” kind of town. That is no longer politically palatable.
Manchester: Mayor Jay Moran was just re-elected with 70% of the vote. Why? He has a vision for more housing and a better safer Main Street. A small faction of residents want to cling to the past, have launched petitions, lawsuits, public pressure campaign. And through it all Mayor Moran has not backed down, rather he has stood firm in his vision of a better future and is widely admired for it.

This dynamic extends far beyond Connecticut:

In New York City, voters approved three ballot measures to speed permitting and construction of new housing.
In Cambridge, MA, the city council passed a significant reimagination of their city’s zoning in early 2025 to welcome new housing and provide a price relief valve. This election, seven incumbents who passed that reform were re-elected with the vice mayor, the primary champion of that reform receiving the most votes. One of the challengers just elected was a recent college grad who ran on going even further on addressing the housing crisis.
In Salem, MA all seven candidates who ran on a platform of housing affordability were elected, including 5 first time candidates. This is after the city recently abolished parking mandates for new residential buildings just a few weeks before the election
Famously anti-development Marin County, CA has a housing zoning ballot measure leading in early vote counting.

There are hundreds of other examples across the country of exactly this dynamic. Politicians who care about housing affordability, housing choice, and can not only articulate it well but act on those beliefs are widely lauded and rewarded with electoral landslides.
I remain struck by a speech recently given by the Governor of North Dakota, Kelly Armstrong at the YIMBYtown conference held in New Haven. There he said, and let me paraphrase: There is a difference between a political discomfort and a political liability. Sure you might get yelled at but society doesn’t work without there being enough housing. You just need to state clearly why it is necessary and pursue it.
If there is one thing both polling and election results is clear about, action taken to solve the housing supply crisis will be handsomely rewarded.

A commission studying the possibility of changes in Maryland held its first hearing Tuesday. (Screenshot)The first meeting of the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission on Tuesday was short and to the point — if the point was that there are still a lot of questions surrounding the commission’s work and not much time to answer them.
The five-member commission met virtually for a little over a half-hour in an organizational meeting that included almost 20 minutes of a primer on the Census from Maryland Department of Planning officials.
They spoke in general about shifts in state population from the 2010 to the 2020 Census, and the changes since then in annual Census surveys — although Planning Deputy Secretary Kristin Fleckenstein said the newer numbers cannot be used for redistricting. Any redrawing of congressional boundaries would have to be based on the actual 2020 Census numbers, the same data that was used for last redistricting, in 2022.
Most of the rest of the commission’s brief meeting was spent discussing the number and format of meetings, with Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), a commission member, asking if the panel planned in-person meetings and how many. He noted that the last redistricting commission, in 2021, was required to “go to all parts of the state to maintain … constitutional validity.”
U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), the commission chair, said meetings for now would be virtual, with people given the opportunity to testify, while the commission worked to secure locations for in-person meetings if necessary. Alsobrooks said she hopes to get in two more meetings before Thanksgiving, including one scheduled for 4:30 p.m. this Friday.
In this first round of hearings, Alsobrooks said, the commission is just planning to listen to voters to see how they want the state to proceed with redistricting, if they want it it to proceed at all..
Moore defends redistricting as effort to ensure fairness; Republicans prepare to go to court

“Working together over the next month or so, we’re going to listen to Marylanders from across the state on whether Maryland should redraw its congressional lines, and what that map would look like,” she said at the outset of the meeting.
Without setting a specific timeline, or other hearing dates, Alsobrooks said she hoped the commission could work “quickly, to give the governor and the legislature the time they need to should they choose to draw new lines.”
The panel will have to work quickly: The General Assembly convenes two months from Friday, with the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays to work around in that time.
Alsobrooks said the commission would decide Friday how many in-person meetings will be held. Those meetings, she said, will be to “solicit feedback from Marylanders regarding whether or not they want this redistricting to happen.”
Both Alsobrooks and Fleckenstein said there are no proposed new congressional maps for people to respond to, that any such documents would not come until it’s been decided that redistricting is the way to go.
That is far from a settled question among lawmakers, who would have to approve any new district maps.
Redistricting is typically done ever 10 years, after the decennial census, when the number of seats in Congress is redistributed among the states based on their populations, and the states redraw districts to reflect population shifts within their states.
That tradition was upended this year when Texas, at the urging of President Donald Trump, redistricted midcycle to create a map that is expected to give Republicans five more seats in Congress after the 2026 elections. Other states soon followed suit, both Republican and Democratic, with pressure from the national parties for states to get on board.
Some Maryland lawmakers have talked about redistricting since earlier this year, when Texas made its move. But Gov. Wes Moore made it official last week, when he appointed the commission to study whether Maryland’s congressional maps are fair — acknowledging that he was motivated in part by the “attack on our democracy” by the GOP redistrictings.
In Maryland, there is little to gain for Democrats, who already hold seven of the state’s eight House seats. That has been pointed out by critic, who say the state has much more to lose if its redistricting plans are rejected by a court or if the new boundaries weaken any of the seven seats that Democrats now hold. That could result in the party actually losing seats to the GOP, critics say.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
One of those critics is Ferguson, who circulated a letter recently on behalf of his 34-member Democratic caucus saying it was opposed to a mid-decade redistricting. But Moore and supporters have vowed to press on.
Cumberland Mayor Ray Morriss, the only Republican member of the commission, asked at the end of Tuesday’s meeting what exactly was broken with the districts that needs to be fixed.
“Has anybody stated what the actual problem is that we’re looking to fix?” he asked. “I’m all in here, but I’m trying to figure out what the problem is.”
Alsobrooks said that’s the goal of the first round of meetings, to hear from Marylanders who will look at the current maps and weigh in on the current configuration of maps.

Negotiations among California and the six other basin states now will continue into next year, as Arizona ramps up the rhetoric, demanding a firmer federal hand in the talks.","In summary
The federal government often makes deadlines on the Colorado River, but — in recent years — rarely has enforced them. Negotiations among California and the six other basin states now will continue into next year, as Arizona ramps up the rhetoric, demanding a firmer federal hand in the talks. 


After two fraught years of negotiations amid dire projections for the Colorado River’s reservoirs, California and six other states that rely on the river’s water have yet again failed to reach a deal — despite a federal deadline. 
“While more work needs to be done, collective progress has been made that warrants continued efforts to define and approve details for a finalized agreement,” the states said. The written statement released Tuesday included no details about how they plan to manage the river after the current rulebook expires at the end of next year. 
Officials at the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the federal stewards for the river under the Department of the Interior, have threatened to impose their own plan in the absence of a deal. 
“Two years. And the lack of progress, in light of how perilous the conditions are on the Colorado — it’s unacceptable,” said Mark Gold, former director of Water Scarcity Solutions at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a board member of the Southern California water import giant, the Metropolitan Water District. 
The federal government frequently sets deadlines on the Colorado River, but it almost never enforces them. 
Negotiations now continue in advance of another, February deadline for a seven-state deal. Scott Cameron, acting head of the Bureau of Reclamation, said in June that the goal is to “parachute” the states’ agreement into the ongoing federal planning process, in time to finalize a plan by May or June next year. 
Yet the states remain deadlocked even as the agreements that currently govern the river near expiration. 
Elizabeth Koebele, a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, suspects that relationships between the states have become too fractured, and water too scarce, for deadlines to effectively motivate the warring states.  
“We have less water, and it’s caused more rippling problems,” Koebele told CalMatters. “You’re cutting a smaller pie, for more people.” 
Federal pressure or state collaboration?
A major conflict has been over how much each basin must cut back their use of the overtapped river, to close the ever-growing gap between dwindling supply and ravenous demand. 
California, Arizona, and Nevada in the lower basin offered in March 2024 to cut their use by up to 1.5 million acre-feet of water per year, depending on reservoir conditions. They urged Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico upstream to share any belt-tightening beyond that, but the upstream states balked — saying that their water users must already conserve water when dry conditions shrink the river’s flows. 
Becky Mitchell, Colorado’s Upper Colorado River Commissioner, said that the states “remain committed to collaboration grounded in the best available science and respect for all Colorado River water users. We are taking a meaningful step toward long-term sustainability and demonstrating a shared determination to find supply-driven solutions.”
But Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has pressed the Trump administration to be more forceful in state negotiations. In a letter Tuesday to Trump’s Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Hobbs and Arizona legislative leaders called the upstream states’ negotiating position “extreme.” 
“We find it alarming that the Upper Basin States have repeatedly refused to implement any volume of binding, verifiable water supply reductions,” the letter said. 
Experts say there’s no time to waste; even the time it takes to develop a new plan for the river may be too long for its dwindling reservoirs. The Colorado River basin is suffering a climate change-fueled megadrought, and the basin’s major reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, are each less than one-third full. 
California’s Colorado River use is on track this year to hit its lowest since 1949. Still, projections show another dry winter may yet send Lake Powell plunging below the levels needed to generate power by December 2026. 
The problem is that even when it rains or snows, runoff is disappearing into thirsty soils before it reaches the river. The paltry runoff keeps driving up estimates of the conservation required to stabilize the basin and its reservoirs. 
Jack Schmidt, director of the Center for Colorado River Studies at Utah State University, and others have urged more urgent conservation in order to protect operations at the dams and ensure that water can be released from Lake Mead and Lake Powell. 
“We continue to drag our heels on not implementing additional cuts right now. That’s our fear: if it doesn’t snow this winter, we’ll really compromise the system,” Schmidt said. “We might get bailed out by a more decent winter, but that’s betting on a whole lot of hope.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/081322-Colorado-River-Water-Drought-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-11 22:58:05.275237

Michael Jackson (D-Prince George's, Calvert and attends a Prince George's County Council meeting Oct. 21. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Sen. Michael Jackson became Col. Michael Jackson at midnight Tuesday, taking over as superintendent of the Maryland State Police and kicking off a scramble to fill his District 27 Senate seat which represents parts of three Southern Maryland counties.
The transition marks the end of more than 10 years in the legislature for Jackson, almost five of which have been spent in the Senate. It also marks a return to law enforcement for Jackson, who served as president of the local Fraternal Order of Police from 1997-2002 and as Prince George’s County sheriff from 2002-2010.
“This is bittersweet,” Jackson said Tuesday as he packed up his Senate office — his photo had already been removed from the General Assembly website by Tuesday afternoon.
“There’s much more good work to be done .. always in the public safety arena, particularly with policing,” he said. “I’m proud of the work done as a legislator. I’m going to work hard for the state police. It’s the government police agency that keeps the entire state safe.”
Jackson, 61, takes over for Col. Roland Butler, who retired Nov. 1. Butler became the department’s first Black superintendent when he was sworn in in 2023 — over the objections of Jackson and three other Prince George’s County senators.
Opponents argued during a difficult confirmation battle that Butler had not done enough to promote diversity and address complaints of racism and discriminatory treatment of Black officers during his lengthy career with the agency, including time as chief of the Field Operations Bureau.
The U.S. Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation in 2022 into complaints of discrimination against Black and female applicants in the police agency’s written and physical hiring tests. Last year, the State Police agreed to pay $2.75 million to settle claims by 48 failed police applicants. Even though Justice determined any discrimination was unintentional, the State Police also agreed to revamp hiring tests and offer jobs to at least 25 of the 48 failed applicants.
Since the Maryland case was settled, however, President Donald Trump’s (R) administration has signaled that it intends to walk away from similar suits around the country.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Jackson said that as superintendent, he plans a “step-by-step” assessment of the agency that include any lawsuits and other concerns. But he wants troopers to know that he is “not in the head-hunting business. I’m in the service business.”
“We have to be very careful not to make folks who are within the agency working hard every day …being blamed for whatever is going on,” Jackson said Tuesday. “We’re going to address any concerns that are out there. We’re going to make a full assessment.”
To help build relationships and assess resources that may be needed, Jackson would like his former legislative colleagues to visit the 23 state police barracks. He also said he would like to improve on the department’s community engagement, which he said he did during his tenure as Prince George’s County sheriff.
“You’re not going to just see [state troopers] writing tickets on the side of the road, or dealing with accidents, or dealing with Homeland Security matters or intelligence matters,” he said. “You’re going to see us in the community again.”
Musical chairs
Jackson will serve as acting secretary until he can be confirmed by the Senate. But his Senate seat comes open Wednesday.
In the Senate, Jackson served on the Budget and Taxation Committee, where he chaired the Pensions Subcommittee and the Public Safety, Transportation and Environment Subcommittee. Selection of his replacement will include input from each of the three county Democratic Central Committees in the district, Prince George’s, Calvert and Charles counties.
District 27 Dels. Kevin Harris and Jeffrie Long Jr. have so far expressed interest replacing Jackson. Harris represents District 27A, which includes parts of Prince George’s and Charles counties, and Long represents District 27B, which covers parts of Prince George’s and Calvert counties.
It will be up to the three Democratic Central Committees to nominate a replacement for Jackson and send that name to the governor.  They have 30 days after the seat comes open Wednesday to conduct interviews and nominate a replacement.
The Charles County committee has already scheduled a special Nov. 22 public hearing to discuss Jackson’s seat, while Calvert County’s next monthly meeting is set for Nov. 20 online, but it was not clear if the open Senate seat would be on the agenda. Prince George’s central committee usually meets on the third Tuesday of every month, but no meeting date has been posted online as of Tuesday.
According to an Oct. 21 letter from the Maryland Attorney General’s office, each central committee has one vote on the Senate nominee. “If two [central committees] select candidate A and one selects candidate B, the name of candidate A is sent to the Governor,” the letter said, but if each settle on a different candidate, all three names go to the governor, who makes the choice.
Jackson declined to say Tuesday who he supports as his successor, but said he will announce it soon.
“I’m not just going to let that go because they’re representing me, my family and my grandkids,” he said. “I’m hoping that these guys can come to some sort of consensus and figure out who’s going to be the one.”
If Long and Harris remain the only two candidates, Jackson said he’d let the central committees know his choice.
“I’ll say, ‘Hey, I’m leaning toward this one versus the other. I love both of them. They’re both great for the district. I just think right now, it’s better to have this particular one,’” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sen.-Michael-Jackson-10-21-2025-cropped-e1762907420700-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 02:58:13.614676

(Photo by Jessica Kourkounis for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star)More than four months after state lawmakers’ deadline to pass a 2025-2026 budget, a deal may be taking shape at the Capitol in Harrisburg.
Following hours-long meetings of both the House Democratic and Senate Republican caucuses Tuesday evening, reports emerged from multiple sources of a tentative agreement to a $50.1 billion budget, with some details still to be ironed out.
The final price tag is roughly $1.4 billion less than what Gov. Josh Shapiro asked for in his February budget address, and just shy of the $50.3 billion proposal House Democrats passed last month in an attempt to move closer to Republican demands.
Republicans have been firm that they want a budget that will not eat into the state’s $7 billion rainy day fund, while Democrats pushed to increase spending, primarily on education.
Late Tuesday night, the Republican-controlled Senate also convened to advance a handful of code bills directing spending related to education, human services and capital projects. There was no discussion of the contents.

Both the House and Senate are scheduled to meet Wednesday morning.
The movement on the budget came after a long impasse, which appears to have been broken, at least for the moment, in recent discussions between Gov. Josh Shapiro, and top legislative leaders – Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana), Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland), House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) and House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia).
Even a hint that the budget impasse may finally be resolved was welcome news for Pennsylvania counties, school districts and social service providers.
Many that rely on state funding have had to dip into savings or cut spending to make it through the impasse. 
For some organizations that are contracted to provide human service programs funded by the state, it’s meant accepting low-interest loans from state Treasurer Stacy Garrity’s office. It was part of an effort her office established to help social service providers like rape crisis centers and domestic violence survivor support programs continue operating through the deadlock. 
Still, the 4.5% interest on the loans was too much for some service providers. The Senate, however, has passed a bill that would allow the Treasury to forgive the interest on the loans, though the House has yet to act on it.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pennsylvania-Capitol-rotunda--1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-11 22:01:29.790374

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)They may not be in uniform anymore, but the group of veterans that gathered Tuesday at the War Memorial Plaza in Baltimore said they still felt called to serve.
The veterans gathered to rally about President Donald Trump’s repeated threats to send federal troops into the city. They said veterans must again defend democracy, but this time in their own cities.
“Every major step towards justice in this country – freedom, opportunity, equality – was carried forward by men and women who served,” said Bobby LaPin, an Army veteran, local business owner and social media figure. “Now once again, it’s veterans who must stand and defend this nation, not from enemies abroad, but from racism and fascism and corporate corruptions that is growing here at home.
Bobby LaPin, an Army veteran and a Baltimore social media figure, said veterans must fight against the use of federal troops in American cities. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)
“When we raised our right hands and took an oath, it wasn’t to a politician, it wasn’t to a party, it was to the Constitution of the United States,” he said. “That oath did not expire when we took off our uniforms.”
LaPin was one of 10 veterans at the Baltimore demonstration, which was part of a nationwide demonstration called “Vets Say No,” organized by About Face Veterans, a veteran-led anti-war advocacy group.
“It’s a day to send a message,” said Clifford “Buzz” Grambo, a retired chief petty officer of the Navy, at the rally. “We can say it any day, but it’s Veteran’s Day. So obviously it carries a little bit more weight. Hopefully a lot of the civilian world will see it and start speaking out more.”
The “Vets Say No” demonstrations were organized in cities that already have federal troop presence and in cities, like Baltimore, where Trump has threatened to send troops. The administration has already deployed National Guard members to Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland, Chicago and Washington, D.C.
As with other cities where he has deployed, or threatened to deploy, troops,  Trump said he was doing so in response to surging crime in the cities he called crime “hellholes.” Local officials said that not only does Trump not have the authority to order Guard troops into cities, they are not the way to deal with crime and are not welcome.
In Baltimore, both Mayor Brandon Scott and Gov. Wes Moore said there is still work to be done to fight crime, but that rates of gun violence and homicides have fallen sharply. Federal help is welcome, they said, but not a military presence. That was echoed by vets at Tuesday’s rally.
Tim Eppers said a military “occupation” of Baltimore by National Guard troops would not solve the city’s problems. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).
“The National Guard has an honorable mission – disaster relief, rescue, rebuilding. That service, that protection, that’s what soldiers should do,” said Tim Eppers, a former Army sergeant. “But when they’re deployed in cities like ours, it turns our protectors into enforcers and citizens into suspects.”
Eppers said sending soldiers into Baltimore does not solve problems that the city faces, and resources should instead go into schools and education, mental health services and other programs that support communities.
“The idea of sending a National Guard in cities like Baltimore is wrong. It’s the wrong message, the wrong method and the wrong kind of mission,” Eppers said. “You can’t deploy your way to peace.”
“Every time we send soldiers into our own neighborhoods,” he said, “we’re sending a message, and that message says ‘we don’t trust you. We’ll control you before we’ll take care of you.’ That message destroys the very trust that keeps our communities safe. Baltimore doesn’t need an occupation, it needs opportunity.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_nov11_veteransdays_vetssayno3_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-11 22:01:29.790374

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah and six other states along the Colorado River blew past their deadline Tuesday to reach a new deal on managing the dwindling river, but negotiations aren’t over. 
“We will continue to engage with our partners across the Basin to develop a framework that protects water users and the system as a whole,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Tuesday afternoon on the social media site X. 
The river contributes 27% of Utah’s water supply, and provides water to 40 million people across the U.S. and Mexico. Drought, overuse and hotter temperatures tied to climate change have all combined to shrink its flow. 
The federal government had said it would step in and make its own plan if states failed to reach broad consensus by Tuesday, but the states agree they don’t want that to happen, Cox said.
5 things to know as the clock runs down on Colorado River talks 

“While the Basin States did not finalize an agreement today on post-2026 Colorado River operations, our commitment to a state-led path remains,” the governor said. 
The U.S. Department of the Interior did not respond to questions from Utah News Dispatch Tuesday evening about the timeline and whether it would intervene. The current agreement runs through late 2026. 
The federal agency and Utah’s negotiator Gene Shawcroft issued the same prepared statement, saying the talks yielded “collective progress.” They did not give any details on sticking points. 
The seven states, the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which manages water in the West, all “recognize the serious and ongoing challenges facing the Colorado River,” their statement says. “Prolonged drought and low reservoir conditions have placed extraordinary pressure on this critical water resource that supports 40 million people, tribal nations, agriculture, and industry.” 
They said the states and federal agencies share a commitment to ensuring the river’s long-term sustainability. 
“While more work needs to be done, collective progress has been made that warrants continued efforts to define and approve details for a finalized agreement,” the statement says.

The four Upper Basin states — Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming — and the Lower Basin states of Nevada, Arizona and California presented competing plans to the federal government last year. 
The Upper Basin states have sought to fend off mandatory cuts in dry years, saying they generally use much less than they’re allocated. The Lower Basin states have insisted that all seven absorb cuts in dry years. 
In part to prepare for the possibility of mandatory cuts, Utah has been investing in measuring and monitoring water use in recent years. 
In 2023, the Legislature set aside $1 million for a Colorado River measurement infrastructure project and $650,000 in ongoing yearly funding, according to the Utah Division of Water Rights.

Republicans have overwhelmingly swept all four of the state’s U.S. House seats ever since former Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, narrowly lost his re-election bid in 2020. 
But Tuesday, the morning after a Utah judge again ruled in favor of anti-gerrymandering advocates who have spent years suing the Utah Legislature over redistricting, those groups celebrated what they called a victory in a drawn out battle for fairness in a state where Republicans have long kept a strong grip on state and federal representation. 
Utah judge faces impeachment threats after ordering congressional map with 1 Democratic seat

To the plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit — which include the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, the Campaign Legal Center and a handful of Salt Lake County voters — Monday night’s court ruling wasn’t about Democrats versus Republicans, but rather fair representation. 
“There will be many who will try to frame this victory through the lens of partisanship. Some will co-opt this as a win for their party, and others will see it as a loss,” said Emma Petty-Addams, co-executive director of the nonpartisan group Mormon Women for Ethical Government. 
However, she said the court case has always been about standing firmly against gerrymandering “no matter which party initiatives or benefits from it.” 
She said it’s always been about restoring Proposition 4 — a ballot initiative Utah voters narrowly approved in 2018 to create an independent redistricting process with neutral map-drawing requirements. 
In 2021, the Utah Legislature undid that initiative and turned the commission into an advisory body that lawmakers could ignore. But the courts ruled lawmakers acted unconstitutionally when they repealed and replaced it, and they’ve since restored Proposition 4 as law.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)
“Today, the people of Utah are getting what they voted for seven years ago. A fair map,” Petty-Addams said during a news conference Tuesday morning. “Utah is a special place. At a time when politicians are rushing to gerrymander their states for political advantage all over the country, a cross-partisan group of Utah citizens — Republicans, Democrats, independents — are finally seeing the fruits of their persistence and years-long commitment to do the opposite.” 
Still, the new court-ordered map will have major implications for the two-party dynamics in Republican-dominated Utah. 
Next year — if 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson’s ruling holds — Democrats will have a strong chance of winning the 1st Congressional District under the map the judge ordered to be used for the 2026 elections. Gibson sided with the plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit and rejected the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature’s preferred map, which would have created four Republican-leaning districts. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

The Legislature’s preferred map, known as map C, would have been more competitive for Democrats when compared to the 2021 congressional map that Gibson voided in August as the result of an unconstitutional process — but Republicans would have likely still dominated all four seats. 
Under the court-approved map, known as the plaintiffs’ Map 1, District 1 is concentrated around the state’s urban core. 
A recent map analysis by the Better Utah Institute —  a nonpartisan nonprofit that is related to the progressive advocacy group Alliance for a Better Utah — said the plaintiffs’ Map 1 would create one safe Democratic district and three safe Republican ones, with District 1 estimated to be 42.7% Republican and 52.7% Democratic, with a 10-point margin in favor of Democrats. 
Utah’s Republican legislators have long favored a “slice of the pie” approach to redistricting, or mixing urban and rural voices into all four congressional districts. But the judge rejected the Legislature’s preferred map and instead chose the plaintiffs’ Map 1, writing in her ruling that redistricting expert evidence and testimony showed the Legislature’s map was an “extreme partisan outlier” that exhibited “pro-Republican bias.” 
Republicans argue the plaintiffs’ map was gerrymandered to favor Democrats — but the plaintiffs’ attorney, David Reymann, said expert evidence showed that a map of its nature is “the natural result of Utah’s political geography, where you have a large proportion of the minority party concentrated in a single place.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)
“That is not a partisan gerrymander,” he said. “A partisan gerrymander is taking a state’s political geography and manipulating it so you don’t have the natural result.” 
Reymann said Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature has long preferred mixing urban and rural voices in their redistricting maps as cover for “cracking” Salt Lake County, where most of the state’s Democrats are concentrated. 
“The urban-rural mix was always a canard that the Legislature spread that had no textual support of Prop 4,” he said. “The voters didn’t say we want a mix of urban and rural. That was always just a justification to crack Salt Lake County.” 
Utah’s Republican legislative leaders are likely to continue fighting Gibson’s order in court — and some GOP legislators have threatened to try and impeach Gibson — but barring a successful appeal, the plaintiffs’ Map 1 is the most likely to govern congressional boundaries for the 2026 election. 
Candidates can begin filing their bids in January. Already, some potential Democratic congressional hopefuls are lining up. 
McAdams, a former Salt Lake County mayor and Utah’s last Democratic congressman, recently invited his supporters to a formal campaign launch party scheduled for Thursday, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. 
Sen. Kathleen Riebe, D-Cottonwood Heights, has also said she’s exploring a congressional bid.
Though it’s likely they’ll both want to run for the 1st Congressional District, it’s not yet clear what district they’d file to run in. In bids for the U.S. House, candidates aren’t required to live in the district where they run for office.

The state Department of Social Services said it hopes to load the rest of the money onto payment cards later, after the federal government shutdown ends.
The state department said it followed Saturday guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service, which directed states to issue 65% of benefits. But the state department said that because recipients’ benefits are calculated by household based on federal rules, “amounts received by beneficiaries will vary.”
US Supreme Court maintains temporary freeze on full SNAP benefits for November

South Dakota typically distributes Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments on the 10th day of the month, which was Monday. The benefits were delayed because of federal shutdown-related chaos affecting the program that helps 42 million Americans, including 75,000 South Dakotans, afford groceries. It takes about $15 million of federal funding monthly to cover benefits in South Dakota.
On Thursday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to pay the program’s full November benefits, despite the ongoing government shutdown, which was caused by Congress’ failure to pass a spending bill on time.
On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture told states it was releasing full November funding for SNAP, and the South Dakota Department of Social Services said it would pay full benefits Monday.
Later Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the order from the lower court, which the Trump administration had appealed. The South Dakota Department of Social Services reacted Saturday by saying it had “paused implementation of its plan to provide full benefits.”
Monday night, the U.S. Senate passed a bill that could end the government shutdown, but the bill still needs approval from the House and a signature from President Trump, which is expected later this week.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court extended through Thursday its pause on the lower court order that had directed the Trump administration to pay full November benefits.

Gary Stubblefield of Branch during a town hall in Charleston discussing the proposed Franklin County prison on Nov. 7, 2024. (Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Members of Ozark’s city council unanimously voted on Monday against starting discussions with the state to potentially supply water for a planned 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County.
City Councilor Randy Melton told the Advocate Tuesday that the vote didn’t mean they wouldn’t talk to state officials at all — merely that those working on the prison would have to be the ones to initiate those talks.
The council approved a resolution earlier this year opposing the prison project, which blindsided and angered local officials and residents when it was announced in 2024. Opponents to building the prison in Franklin County have criticized Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, her staff and the Arkansas Department of Corrections for not consulting with the local community prior to purchasing an 815-acre property near Charleston for the prison last year.
Those opponents have argued nearly from the start that the site was unsuitable due to the lack of an available workforce and uncertainties about whether local infrastructure could support a large prison. State officials who participated in the search have disputed these claims.
Sanders said as recently as last week, however, that the Franklin County site remains “the best location in the state.” In remarks minutes after filing for reelection, she said “everybody wants to fight over the location, but the real question, the real fight should be, how do we do a better job protecting our state?”
How to supply the prison site with drinking water — or whether it was possible to supply water in the first place — has been an open question in recent months. Groundwater well testing at the property produced far less water than what would be needed for the facility, the Advocate found earlier this year, and the city of Fort Smith said its water system did not have the capacity to serve the prison.
Well testing documents for Franklin County prison contradict prison contractor

Ozark said in its previous resolution that the city didn’t have the capacity to provide water to the prison either.
“We decided last night that if the state is really serious about contacting us, that we need to hear from somebody in an official capacity, either from the governor’s office or from the prison board, or somebody, besides just hearsay,” Melton said Tuesday.
The matter was on the Monday’s council agenda because Ozark Mayor Roxie Hall had been told the state required a letter from her asking to start discussions before they would talk to the city, but Melton said he still didn’t know who told her that.
“My question was, you know, who was it [the call] from? Was it an actual official or whatever that wants us to basically say that we’re willing to talk with them?” Melton said. “We never did find out anything about it. …. There was no names mentioned or anything. So basically, to me, it’s just hearsay.”
Hall did not return a voicemail from the Advocate left at Ozark City Hall Tuesday afternoon.
Melton agrees with residents from nearby Charleston that the prison site selection was handled poorly. However, Ozark’s looming water infrastructure needs meant the city council couldn’t simply ignore the state if it comes knocking with offers, he said.

Just maintaining the city’s current level of service will require $22.9 million, he said — with total needs projected upwards of $90 million.
The city has been working to figure out how to fund the needed infrastructure through either the local sales tax or increases to water bills, but even small increases could be hard on Ozark residents and those who rely on its water system, Melton said.
“We are a very poor community,” he said. “That’s why I feel we have to at least see what [the state] has got to offer. We can’t say no without any conversation.”
But Melton stressed that if the state did initiate discussions, it doesn’t mean Ozark would agree to allow the prison to draw from its water system.
Prior to the city council meeting on Monday, Republican Sen. Bryan King of Green Forest said during a press conference at the state Capitol in Little Rock that state officials were attempting to “try and bribe” Ozark into using their water system.
“Extortion is happening behind the scenes, as Sen. [Gary] Stubblefield said, to try and bribe them with your tax dollars,” King said.
Stubblefield represented the area where the planned prison will be built and was one of the prison project’s most outspoken opponents. He died in September just weeks after accusing prison proponents within state government of extorting lawmakers who voted against a $750 million appropriation to fund the prison’s construction by threatening to withhold state funds and grants from their districts.

“When folks drive by, that’s somebody’s loved one, and it’s a good way to keep their memory alive,” said Learing, a retired Air Force veteran.

All six of the veterans who were honored lost their lives in combat. The ceremony at the South Dakota Military Heritage Alliance was a continuation of the state’s Fallen Heroes Bridge Dedication program. It was launched in 2019 by then-Gov. Kristi Noem’s administration to dedicate bridges to South Dakotans who were killed in action or classified as missing in action.
Gov. Larry Rhoden attended Tuesday’s ceremony.
“Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction,” Rhoden said, quoting former President Ronald Reagan. “We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected and handed on for them to do the same.”
The program has a committee that meets annually in April and selects veterans to honor and bridges to dedicate. An application form is available online.
The state’s Department of Veterans Affairs said more than 50 bridges had been named in honor of South Dakota veterans before Tuesday’s ceremony. The department said more than 3,000 South Dakotans have died while serving in the military. 



Bridge dedications
The South Dakota veterans honored on Tuesday:

Navy Water Tender Second Class Porter Rich: Served on several battleships and was killed aboard the USS Oklahoma during the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941, the same year he was married and his son was born. The Porter L. Rich Bridge is on U.S. Highway 14, about 2 miles east of De Smet.
Navy Machinist’s Mate Second Class Milton Muller: Served on the USS Leary and died when the ship was torpedoed in the North Atlantic on Christmas 1943; his body was never recovered. The Milton L. Muller Bridge is on state Highway 38 bridge, east of Montrose.
Army Cpl. Harvey Henle: The paratrooper jumped into Normandy on D-Day and was killed by sniper fire in France 10 days later. The Harvey H. Henle Bridge is on state Highway 11, about 2 miles north of Brandon.
Army Sgt. Alvin Erpenbach: Fought in North Africa and Italy, and was twice wounded, the latter being a landmine that killed him in 1944. The Alvin W. Erpenbach Bridge is on state Highway 42, about 8 miles west of Ethan.
Army Pvt. Marvin Gunderson: Landed on Okinawa, Japan, in 1945 and was killed in action two days later. The Marvin L. Gunderson Bridge is on state Highway 19, north of Parker.
Army Pfc. Leland Nielson: Was stationed in the Philippines and was wounded by a Japanese sniper in 1945 and died of his injuries the next day. The Leland L. Nielsen Bridge is 11 miles north of Volin on state Highway 19.

Today, VTDigger launches its Thanksgiving member drive in partnership with the Vermont Foodbank. 
Between now and Thanksgiving Day, our goal is to inspire 1,200 members to chip in and help feed Vermont neighbors in need, while keeping fact-checked local news free for everyone. Will you join us?

Donate and send 3 meals

Every gift this season does double duty: it sustains VTDigger’s nonprofit newsroom and sends three meals to a neighbor through the Vermont Foodbank, thanks to support from our partnership sponsor, The Richards Group.
VTDigger has partnered with the Foodbank every year since food insecurity began rising sharply in 2020. The organization now distributes 25% more food each year than it did before the pandemic. 
But this year, the need is greater still.
In addition to the expected increase in food assistance needs as the temperature drops and utility bills creep up, changes in federal nutrition funding and the ongoing government shutdown have created uncertainty and put new strain on Vermont’s food assistance network. And some 14,000 Vermonters could lose food benefits in 2026 when new federal rules take effect.
At VTDigger, our reporters track policy shifts at the state and national level and their local impacts on real people so Vermonters can stay informed.
When you give, you help us report the facts with care and depth, and today, you’ll also put meals on Vermont tables.

Our student reporters were there,Ella Carter-Klauschie and Chrissa Olson,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/2025/11/uc-berkeley-turning-point-fights-arrests/,"While protesters chanted against the conservative ideals of Turning Point USA, event attendees laughed and danced inside the hall of one of the most liberal universities in the nation.","In summary
While protesters chanted against the conservative ideals of Turning Point USA, event attendees laughed and danced inside the hall of one of the most liberal universities in the nation.


A few hundred feet apart, yet worlds away politically, furious students at UC Berkeley protested the final stop of the conservative organization Turning Point USA’s “American Comeback Tour,” hosted Monday night on what is known as the nation’s most liberal campus. 
The event drew many older attendees who at various moments danced to “YMCA,” laughed, and held moments of silence for the late TPUSA leader Charlie Kirk. 
Outside the event, students, most of them far younger than the attendees inside, faced off with police in riot gear, with physical fights prompting arrests. One man was taken to a hospital after being struck in the head.
On Tuesday morning, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon announced the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division would investigate the event. Attorney General Pam Bondi also tweeted that the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force would be launching a full investigation of what she called “violent riots at UC Berkeley.”
In a statement, UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof said the university is conducting a “full investigation” and “intends to fully cooperate” with the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force to identify “the outside agitators responsible for attempting to disrupt last night’s TPUSA event.” 
During the event, a large police presence held back protesters several hundred feet away and held up batons and projectile weapons. The UC Police Department, private security, and law enforcement from Alameda County and San Francisco were staged at Lower Sproul, a plaza in front of Zellerbach. The event was strictly monitored, with bags, food, beverages, signs and flags prohibited. 
Law enforcement had already begun in the early morning, with the UC Police Department arresting four students at midnight for felony vandalism for trying to attach a giant cardboard bug to Sather Gate at the campus entrance as a protest against the TPUSA event, as reported by the Daily Californian. 
The event occurred exactly two months to the day after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the founder of TPUSA, who was shot on a Utah university campus while he debated students about his political viewpoints. 
Two student reporters for CalMatters were at the event. Here’s what they saw both outside and in.

Outside, 4:30 p.m.
Protests were just beginning in Sproul Plaza, a central area on campus, while Lower Sproul Plaza, the area in front of Zellerbach Hall, was entirely barricaded by law enforcement. Surrounding campus buildings had closed as early at 12:45 p.m., causing student group meetings to be cancelled or moved to Zoom. 
Unable to walk straight to Zellerbach Hall, the hundreds of protesters moved down Bancroft Way toward the campus’s Student Union, where event attendees lined up to enter the barricaded space in front of Zellerbach. A fight broke out between two men, one of whom was selling “Freedom” shirts. Their altercation and subsequent arrest briefly shut down the street. 
Inside, 5:30 p.m.
Inside the event, attendees, most of whom were not students, filed in wearing red MAGA hats and “Freedom” shirts. As they took their seats, they danced to “Born in the USA,” “YMCA” and “Here Comes the Sun.” 
Outside, 5:30 p.m. 
A panic briefly ran through the crowd when a car on Bancroft Way began to backfire, mimicking the sound of gunshots, causing some attendees to duck and run as smoke filled the air. No one was injured, and the majority of protesters continued to chant and bang on the barricades in front of almost 20 UCPD officers holding up their batons. 
Inside, 6:30 p.m.
Jobob Taeleifi, a comedian and friend of Kirk’s, kicked off the event, followed by John Paul Leon, UC Berkeley’s Turning Point USA chapter president, who announced the entrance of Christian apologist and Kirk mentor Frank Turek. 
“When a bullet soared through the air, an assassin took the life of a courageous man,” Leon told the crowd. “The sad truth is, the left are not your friends. They will mock and dehumanize you just so they can laugh at your corpse … To all those protesters outside, I have one thing to say: It is clear to us which side is winning when your side becomes the violent agitators.”
Taeleifi, Leon and Turek all focused much of their speeches on criticizing the protests outside. Turek called Kirk a “martyr” and recounted his experience watching Kirk die. 
“I’m never going to forget Charlie’s lifeless eyes looking back right past me,” Turek said. 
Comedian Rob Schneider, who spoke after Turek, thanked “antifa” for their “welcome.” Schneider spoke about his experience at the Saturday Night Live 50th anniversary event, did impressions of God and said, “God said Trump’s my guy.”
“There is an attack on Western civilization and the United States is the last bastion of hope,” Schneider said. “As Charlie Kirk said, if you do not assimilate, it is an invasion, and that is what we’re experiencing.” 
Outside, 6:30 p.m.
Two people who were arguing began to fight. One was detained by the police.
The protest mostly congregated around one barricaded entrance to the event. Some were there in response to calls put out by UC Berkeley student activist groups like Students Organizing for Liberation, Young Democratic Socialists of America and Jewish Voice for Peace. In addition to the large number of students, protesters also included people who did not attend UC Berkeley – groups like SF Bay Activists held a “dance party” protest. 
Away from the epicenter of the shouts and chants in front of police, many hung back just to watch and observe. 
One student protester, Asha Genett, said she attended because she disagreed with Turning Point’s support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions, which she called “human rights abuses.” 
“I think that conversation between conservatives and liberals or leftists is important,” Genett said. “I don’t think the way that TPUSA strives to engage in that is productive or helpful. I think it’s inflammatory.”
Chants varied between condemnations of TPUSA’s conservative ideals, to calls for them to leave campus. Protesters shouted, “Fascists out of Berkeley,” “Trump must go now,” and “F— Charlie Kirk.” 
Protester Court Freund, a UC Berkeley master’s student who identifies as a Democrat and libertarian, said he disagreed with TPUSA on everything but free speech.
“My perspective is that TPUSA and other organizations I strongly disagree with, as long as they’re not espousing direct harm to someone on campus, they should be here and have a right to be here,” he said. 
“By closing them out from our campus, which is supposed to be a hub for intellectual debate, so many progressives just want to shut out the other side,” Freund said. “By doing that, they automatically lose a large percentage of people.”
According to Mogulof, a 45-year-old male attendee of the TPUSA event was struck in the head with a glass bottle, and was transported to a nearby hospital for a laceration to his head. 
Inside, 8:10 p.m.
A line of attendees filled the entirety of the aisle waiting for their chance to ask a question as Schneider hosted a Q&A with Turek, author Andrew Doyle and philosopher Peter Boghossian to conclude the event.
Jackie Jones, a student and comedy club co-president, asked Schneider if there are things comedians shouldn’t joke about, to which Schneider replied that it is a comedian’s job to “challenge” people and push boundaries. He also praised Louis C.K., who admitted to sexual misconduct allegations in 2017, calling him a “genius.”
Outside, 8:45 p.m.
Protesters circled Lower Sproul to block exits, facing off with police behind barricades as attendees left the event. Surrounded by protesters, attendees gradually exited, some yelling back and engaging in arguments. The protest wrapped up a little after 9:30 p.m. By the end of the protest, four people had been arrested, according to Mogulof. 
“These people can’t be negotiated with,” said student and event attendee Matthew Edgar of the protesters outside. “They would celebrate if I died. It’s nonsensical. I’m going to walk out of here, and I’ll probably have virtually no friends coming out of Berkeley.”

(Getty Images)An Idaho legislative task force is looking to amend Idaho’s child custody laws after months of hearing emotional testimony about high-conflict cases from parents and family members caught in these disputes.
“We knew going into this, this was going to open up a can of worms,” task force co-Chair Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, said Monday. ”But we had so many compelling stories that were coming forward that, you can’t ignore it, and there does need to be oversight.”

The Child Custody and Domestic Relations Task Force met for what’s likely the second-to-last time on Monday at the Capitol to discuss main takeaways from the five meetings it held across the state starting in July. The task force cannot pass legislation but may provide recommendations to their fellow lawmakers. 
The members hope to meet once more to make final recommendations regarding some of the topics, including additional training for those involved in the system, better recognition of patterns of abuse and violence, avoiding lengthy delays in processes that are supposed to be temporary, and more effective use of local law enforcement to uphold court orders.
The document of primary topics was generated using AI from transcripts of the prior meetings, members said Monday. 
 Additional training on domestic violence and abuse

Legislators discussed adding bans on “coercive control,” which is a pattern of behavior that abusers may use to manipulate or trap their partners, to Idaho’s domestic violence laws. 
“I think that would be an easy thing to put in, and I think it would help give some clarification,” task force co-Chair Sen. Tammy Nichols, R-Middleton, said.

She also said she’d like to see more training for judges on manipulation in domestic violence situations. 
Task force members also considered ensuring that in-person mediation sessions in custody conflicts aren’t required in cases of documented abuse. 
“Maybe we bring in the digital stuff into that, where you don’t have to be in mediation with your abuser if there is documented abuse,” Scott suggested. 
Sen. Carl Bjerke, R-Coeur d’Alene, noted that other states have passed legislation modeled after a federal law known as Kayden’s Law, which includes requirements that judges consider child safety in custody decisions and mandates training for judges to better recognize domestic violence. 
Legislators in Utah passed a version of the law in 2024, after 16-year Om Gandhi was killed by his father during a court-mandated visit in Salt Lake City amid a contentious custody dispute, Utah News Dispatch reported. 
 Easing financial imbalances between parents

To address financial imbalances, task force members suggested implementing a process for a parent in a child custody dispute who has far fewer resources to ask the court to require the parent with more money to pay attorney fees for both parties. 
Rep. John Gannon, D-Boise, said he’d prepared draft legislation to create the process. Gannon is a civil attorney.

“I think this could help to prevent using the legal system to bully the other, weaker party,” Gannon said. “And I think that there could be some real good results, because the party with resources would have some incentive to maybe minimize the litigation, and both parties would come together and be more likely to resolve the dispute.” 
In cases to terminate parental rights of one parent, the state removed the right to public defense in 2025 legislation.
Bjerke described Gannon’s proposal as a “great place to start” to help improve fairness to some of these cases. 
“Having the ability to look at exactly what is being expended for each party and trying to make it as equal as possible, it shouldn’t be that one person wins a case because their resources are greater,” Bjerke said. 
 Time restraints on temporary orders

Legislators spoke at length Monday about how to constrain temporary custody or visitation orders, which are meant to be short-term court directives allowing one parent to assume temporary custody prior to a full custody hearing. The orders are meant to be used in situations of abuse or neglect. 
Lawmakers said use of the orders are being drawn out, sometimes for months or years.

“I feel like we have legalized kidnapping,” Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, said. “… One of the most sacred rights, that we don’t give, that a parent has, because that comes from the Lord, is their ability to have and raise their children. And then when we legally take that right away, when there’s nothing criminal that can be pointed to, I believe that is certainly a disservice by the justices, certainly disservice by legislative branch, and I would say the executive branch also. I would hope that this committee will work to remedy this particular part.” 
Lawmakers considered implementing a 30-day limit on temporary orders in which there’s no criminal allegations. 
Gannon, however, said 30 days seemed too short in some cases. 
Bjerke said that the extended time on temporary orders is likely driven by delays and backlogs in the court system. 
“If we want to provide something more like a 30-day temporary order, how much more of the system do we create to accomplish that?” Bjerke asked “… None of us want to grow government and to further fund things, but at the same time, we’re not going to be able to take care of this stuff, or a lot of it, without some enhancements made to our current judicial system.”
 Better use of law enforcement for custody orders

Some task force members also hope to utilize police more to enforce custody orders. It is a criminal offense to violate a court order regarding custody, such as keeping the child too long, but lawmakers said Monday they are hearing law enforcement officers are hesitant to step into what seems more like a civil matter. 
Officers often refer parents back to civil court for enforcement, legislators said. 
Scott asked members if the Legislature should clarify that law enforcement has authority to enforce family law.

Bjerke argued that may put officers in the middle of contentious custody disputes. 
“We just don’t have the bandwidth in our current law enforcement system to do this,” he said. 
Ehardt disagreed, and said that law enforcement handles “domestic problems” daily. 
Sen. James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, said that the Legislature may need to implement some type of database so police could access the most up-to-date custody orders if called to enforce a violation. 
Task force members have not yet set a meeting date to share proposed legislation. 
Members said that, because the area of family law is complicated, often involving emotional or high-conflict cases, there may be a multi-year effort to make changes. 
Rep. Marco Erickson, R-Idaho Falls, suggested the group put together an assessment of gaps and a five-year plan. 
“There’s still going to be some low-hanging fruit that we could potentially do right away, but this is not a next-session process,” Erickson said. “Obviously, we know this could be up to five years, but if we were to develop something like that, a process in a five year plan, we can start to fill those gaps, put in the pieces of legislation, have the proper conversations with our community partners and the people that would be implementing this on the ground, so that way we’re not causing this massive chaos in the lawyers or in the courts.”

""Our feeling is that, if we force this level and degree of change on our districts and our (supervisory unions), it simply won't work,"" task force member and former superintendent Jay Badams said.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
The majority of Vermont school redistricting task force members endorsed a proposal on Monday that would incentivize voluntary mergers of the state’s 119 school districts. Most of the committee also opposed a new school district map based around centers for career and technical education.
The nearly 170-page proposal approved by the body is a more detailed plan than the rejected career and technical education map, developed by Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, and Dave Wolk, Gov. Phil Scott’s appointee to the task force. That plan adhered more closely to the guidelines around Act 73 — that is, to draw a map of borders for new school districts.
But the approved proposal, in a way, flouts Act 73’s directive that the task force deliver at least one and no more than three new maps by Dec. 1 for the Vermont Legislature to consider in the upcoming legislative session, which starts in early January. Members of the task force who supported the proposal said it was the only responsible way forward, and argued that plans to reform the public education system would not work if school districts were forced to merge.
“We’re speculating in thinking that large scale district consolidation is going to somehow save money,” said Jay Badams, a task force member and former superintendent. “The research that we’ve consulted indicates, at best, that it might and it might not. To put the system through that much radical change for the possibility that there might be savings sure seems like a lot to ask of our communities.”
The proposal, developed by task force members Badams; Jennifer Botzojorns, a retired superintendent for the Kingdom East School District; and Rep. Rebecca Holcombe, D-Norwich, lays out a 10-year plan where districts would be incentivized to merge to access state construction aid, and to coordinate on developing regional high schools.
The proposal is a synthesis of two previous plans, one that centered redistricting around regional high schools, and another that emphasized using regional BOCES, or a board of cooperative educational services, which are used in other rural states to help school districts collaborate on services.
Five regional cooperative service agencies would be layered over the state’s existing 119 school districts and 52 supervisory districts and supervisory unions to help those entities share services like transportation and special education.

Slide via School Redistricting Task Force
“The key to this is voluntary participation,” Badams said. “Our feeling is that if we force this level and degree of change on our districts and our (supervisory unions), it simply won’t work.”
Wolk questioned whether their proposal meets the directives set out by Act 73.
“What’s been presented is some kind of voluntary collaboration, which I’m sure could and would and should happen,” he said. “But is it a map as directed to us by the Legislature?”
Holcombe replied that the “responsible thing is to say, that’s actually not responsible, but here’s some other things you could do instead.”

Deep disagreements
The votes taken on Monday, and the discussion around the two proposals, highlight deep disagreements among policymakers around the intent of Act 73 and foreshadow a difficult Legislative session to come. 
Task force members throughout their seven meetings thus far have pointed to the lack of time to thoroughly develop plans for the kind of systemwide transformation that Act 73 envisions.
“If I had to give my advice to the Legislature, it would be, ‘It’s not ready,’” Badams said on Monday. “If we gave them a map just to give them a map, we just wasted a lot of our own time doing this stuff.”
He continued, “I think that’s the recommendation: Here’s the best we could do, this gets us started and lets us start making some headway.”
But Vermont Education Secretary Zoie Saunders did not appear to support that approach. 
During a presentation to the task force on Monday, Saunders said their plan for voluntary mergers did not align with the intent of Act 73 “because it does not recommend a specific map that would satisfy the parameters of your charge as the redistricting task force.”
Also, she said adding regional service areas on top of the education system’s existing structure would create “an additional layer of bureaucracy and also cost.”
“Given that we have challenges hiring for the critical roles we have now within our system, and then maintaining the central office, and on top of that building in another layer of a BOCES, I think it does create some additional complexity for the system,” she said.
Task force members pushed back against this, and pointed to research from other rural states that show the mechanism would help the state save money.
Rep. Edye Graning, D-Jericho, the co-chair of the task force, said she was “incredibly distraught when the secretary came in and said misinformation about having our cooperative service agencies being an extra layer of bureaucracy.”
“That’s not what they are, and that’s not what they do, and I don’t want that to derail the process,” Graning said.

‘Hard to stomach’
Wolk and Beck’s proposal was the first proposal to be floated, at the task force’s halfway mark. 
The map — now discontinued, at least as far as the task force is concerned — used career and technical education regions as an organizing principle. 
That plan would create seven supervisory districts, concentrated in the northwest and southeast regions of the state, and seven supervisory unions with 21 school districts contained within them in southern Vermont and in the Northeast Kingdom.
The proposal would increase access to career and technical education opportunities, while “respecting historical patterns” in school choice, Beck said on Monday.
“The map is not perfect,” Wolk said. “I doubt any map that we came up with, given the timeline, would be perfect. The Legislature, understandably, will have their way, as they should.”


In her presentation, Saunders said theirs was the “only proposal that aligns with the intent of Act 73.”
But members of the task force raised a number of concerns, specifically around the size of the map’s proposed district in Chittenden County. Nearly 22,000 students would be consolidated into a single district there under the plan.
Several members questioned why much of the state was being asked to merge into single supervisory districts, while other areas retained the supervisory union structure.
“I’m trying to figure out the logic behind why some regions should do mass mergers, and some regions are going to be asked to do absolutely nothing, really,” Holcombe said.
Other members further criticized the proposal, arguing it preserved school choice in areas with prominent private schools, called independent schools in state law.
“I think the care taken to preserve tuitioning choice in some regions, and the lack of care taken in larger school districts … is really hard to stomach,” Graning said on Monday.
The majority of task force members voted against sending the proposal to the Legislature for consideration, with only Beck, Wolk and Rep. Beth Quimby, Caledonia-3, voting in favor.
Badams, in a strong rebuke, said he didn’t “want to hand the Legislature a map that gives that pathway after hearing what I heard today from the secretary.”
“If that ends up being used as the way to chop up the state and force the mergers,” he said, “I don’t want to personally vote to put that forward.”
With a final report due in December, the task force will meet for the last time on Nov. 20 to refine the report and its proposal before submitting it to the Legislature.

Only about 3,000 remain and about 85% of the American meatpacking industry is controlled by four companies: JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield. The other 20% of that market share is held in part by small and very small meat producers scattered across the country, including some in Montana.
About half of small and medium meat processors have disappeared in the last 20 years, and a decades long University of Illinois study found the average length of a meat processing business surviving was 9.7 years. Between inspections, startup costs and other factors, it’s not an easy business to get into or keep afloat. 
This is true for much of the agricultural industry, and many small businesses have disappeared as corporate America has exerted its will on farmers and ranchers. About 70% of the consumer’s dollar went to cattle producers in 1970, with the other 30% going to processors and retailers. Cattle producers now get about 30% of the consumer’s dollar, according to Farm Action.
Additionally, about 98% of America’s beef is processed in just over 50 plants. Beef processing co-ops have been created around the state in an effort to help give beef producers more options, but there’s another problem too — employees.
That’s the place some educators in Montana are looking to step in. Fergus High School in Lewistown, for example, has a robust agricultural education program. It’s also part of the Central Montana Career and Technology Education Academy, a public charter school that was set up this year to connect students with skills and knowledge needed to work in agriculture.
 ‘A dying art’

Logan Turner, one the teachers at Fergus High School, put it pointedly.
“Kids aren’t really getting into it,” he said. “Cutting meat is kind of a dying art.”
His goal has been, in part, to help change that trend. The technical academy seeks to bridge a gap of  agricultural knowledge. Beyond meat cutting, classes at the school include farm business management, fabrication and science classes geared toward teaching about soil health among others.
Turner grew up on his family’s farm outside Missoula and quickly decided he wanted to be a teacher. There’s an urgency for him too, with worries, among them a feeling no one knows where their food comes from and the world’s growing population. 
“We’ve always been faced with this big issue as agriculturalists,” Turner said. “2050 is right around the corner, and there’s going to be two billion more people on the face of the planet, and how are we going to feed them all? I think it all starts with education and understanding … and so I felt like being an educator probably was the best way for me to contribute.”
Only about three percent of the food Montanans eat is produced in the state. There are options for eating local food, but they can sometimes be hard to find. 
Having kids learn about these could also help them enter the workforce with more ideas about what they want to do, which is one of the goals of the program. Orin Johnson, the Central Montana CTE Academy director, said they also want to get students as close as possible to certification in a variety of careers.
“Every kid doesn’t learn the same way,” Johnson said. “And some really do strive and need to be hands on, and it’s about finding a way to create opportunities that they can be hands on.”
Students at the school have shown interest and it’s included partnerships with Future Farmers of America and the Montana Farmers Union, which gave the meat processing program two grants totaling about $13,000 over the summer.
“We do a lot of meat processing at my house because my dad loves hunting, and so we do a lot of wild game,” said Shyanne Ricks, a student at the school who’s gone through the program. “And so doing the meats class really helps with seeing the whole process, not just wild game.”
Ricks, along with Tori Rindal, a freshman at the school, and the other Lewistown agricultural education teacher — Jared Long — went to the Montana Farmers Union Annual convention and spoke about the program.
Rindal said she’s hoping to take the meats class next year. Long pointed out agricultural education is broad and students can take many different paths.
The program offers five pathways: welding, natural resource and conservation, meat processing, animal science and agricultural mechanics. There’s a variety of classes within those, both Long and Turner explained.
“The common misconception is that it’s just cows and plows,” Long said. “So that’s really our job, we feel like, is to open doors to kids that they might never have.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-3871-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-11 18:57:17.561776

Jerry Moran of Kansas and members of the U.S. Marine Corps were aboard the USS Intrepid on Veterans Day for ringing of the Nasdaq Exchange’s opening bell.
Moran, the Republican chair of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, said the ceremony was an opportunity to honor people such as his father, Raymond Edwin Moran, who served in the U.S. Army in North Africa and Italy during World War II.
“Across America, from the prairies of my home state of Kansas to the skyline of New York City, people are expressing their gratitude and respect for those who serve our country today and for those who served our country in the past,” the senator said.
Moran continued: “Our country needs role models, needs to see what those who put country above self — or above politics or above party — what difference they made, and we need to role model ourselves after them.”
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, was in Overland Park to recognize Veterans Day on Tuesday by returning a set of stolen medals, including a Bronze Star, to a Vietnam veteran. Davids’ mother served in the U.S. Army for 20 years.
Meanwhile, Moran and U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, voted for Senate legislation making investments in military infrastructure at Fort Riley and Fort Leavenworth.
The budget bill included $26 million to build a new air traffic control tower at Fort Riley. The measure included $8.1 million to improve security infrastructure and to improve the equipment staging area at the Army base’s intermodal railyard.
At Fort Leavenworth, the Senate included $8 million to construction a new fire station to improve response times on the post.
Marshall said the U.S. Department of Defense bill, which was sent to the U.S. House, included $1.9 billion for construction, operation and maintenance of military family housing. It featured $1.3 billion for renovation, and construction of barracks and dorms, as well as $1.3 billion for projects to improve military hospitals, schools, child development centers and other facilities, he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Jerry-Moran-veterans-day-ship.png,,,2025-11-11 18:57:17.561776
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-11 23:19:17+00:00,CT Mirror,Chris Murphy used to be a lead negotiator. That’s changed in 2025.,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/11/chris-murphy-negotiator-government-shutdown/,"Murphy, previously a key negotiator, said on striking deals: ‘I just don’t think that’s the job right now. The job is to save the democracy.’","Chris Murphy was known as a lead negotiator during the Biden administration, tackling thorny political issues like gun safety and immigration. But as a group of congressional Democrats struck a bipartisan deal to end the government shutdown, the Connecticut senator was notably not involved — and openly critical of the negotiations taking place.
In an interview from early 2024, as the Senate was taking a vote on an immigration bill he helped craft but that ultimately failed, Murphy said he was proud of “my developing role as a negotiator and dealmaker in the Senate.” But as the Senate took a series of votes to pass the shutdown deal on Monday night, the Connecticut senator was seeing things very differently. 
“I just don’t think that’s the job right now. The job is to save the democracy and that involves a lot more fighting and drawing hard lines than it does negotiating,” Murphy said in an interview near the Senate floor as lawmakers passed the government funding package Monday night. “I think there’s a danger to bipartisan dealmaking today in a world where it ends up giving some level of endorsement to [President Donald Trump’s] campaign to destroy our democracy.”
“There’s still room for negotiation, but only with Republicans that are willing to actually stand in the way of his corruption,” he added. “Unfortunately, there don’t seem to be any Republicans right now that are willing to protect our democracy and thus you don’t have negotiating partners.”
That’s a marked change from the past couple of years when Murphy seemed to revel in his role as a key negotiator for some of the more politically fraught issues coming before Congress.
In 2022, he secured one of the biggest policy achievements of his career with the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which brought modest changes to gun laws after  pushing for reforms for a decade. Several months after, he was part of a negotiating group on the Electoral Count Act, aimed at preventing future interference in certifying election results and avoiding a repeat of the Jan. 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol.
A year later, Murphy waded into a more unconventional policy area for him when he became the lead Democrat trying to hash out a border deal to unlock support for then-President Joe Biden’s national security package. The deal seemed like it would get the backing of nearly two dozen Senate Republicans, but most of that support quickly disappeared when Trump, who was a presidential candidate at the time, came out against the bipartisan legislation.
It was, as they say, a wake-up call for Murphy.
“In 2022, when we negotiated the gun bill, we didn’t have to deal with Trump. It mattered what he was going to say about it, but we didn’t have to negotiate with him,” he recalled. “Now you have to negotiate directly with him. By the time we got to 2024, he was starting to take control of the party. I saw the transition.”
Murphy doesn’t know how the Democratic side of the shutdown negotiating group came together, and shook his head when asked if he had been interested in getting involved. But he said he spoke with those colleagues over the past few weeks and discouraged them from making a deal that contained only a promise to vote on enhanced health care subsidies, rather than a guaranteed extension.
Murphy, who became a prominent voice on gun control following the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, has become even more of a national figure since last year’s election. He is frequently mentioned as a potential presidential contender in 2028 — or moving higher up the ranks of Senate leadership — and has grown into a prolific fundraiser. He has nearly $11 million in his campaign account, even though he will not need to tap into that for his own race since he’s not up for reelection until 2030.
But he has more recently focused on his political action committee, American Mobilization Project. His PAC has made political contributions to some of his colleagues and other Democratic candidates, but has also contributed money to efforts and groups pushing back against the Trump administration rather than tied to an election. Some of that money has gone to organizing groups like Georgia Youth Justice Coalition for Action, Project 26 Pennsylvania, and Down Home North Carolina.
His ascendance in the Democratic Party hasn’t come without sharp criticism from Republicans inside and outside of Washington.
Murphy has tangled with the White House over the past year and the president himself, who has posted on his preferred social media platform, Truth Social, to take jabs at the senator.
And Republicans back in his home state have also been critical of his more visible role in the Democratic Party. 
Connecticut Republican Party chairman Ben Proto argued Murphy’s evolving role in the party “gives him a huge platform, takes fundraising prowess to another level and gives him an opportunity to be even more hyper partisan, particularly if he’s in the minority.”
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, remembers his time serving in the state legislature while Murphy was a state senator. At a recent meeting speaking to Connecticut’s Young Republicans chapter, Candelora placed the blame for the shutdown on Democrats for digging in on their health care demands. And he singled out Murphy, painting his transformation as someone who has moved away from policy in pursuit of politics.
“Unfortunately because we live in such a blue state, our [congressional] delegation feels that they have the ability to do that without coming to the table. And I was around and worked with Sen. Murphy at the time,” Candelora said. “I watched the evolution of an individual who used to be principled and believe in policy to evolve into a political creature that has become the fundraising machine for the Democrat Party nationally, and it’s at the expense of the state of Connecticut.”
But Murphy’s frustration and criticism is not limited to Republicans. The three-term senator has become one of the most outspoken Democrats to take aim at his own party, especially when it comes to reassessing their messaging as a party after major losses in 2024 and their response to the Trump administration.
That frustration was especially evident this week. Murphy and U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., both opposed the bill that would reopen the government because it made no guarantee to extend the policy at the heart of the fight: expiring health care subsidies.
Blumenthal similarly wasn’t part of the shutdown negotiating group and warned  against accepting a deal that fell short on health care. Like Murphy, last week’s electoral victories bolstered his belief that Democrats should have stood firm on their demand that an extension of Affordable Care Act enhanced premium subsidies — that are set to expire at the end of the year — must be in a funding agreement.
Blumenthal, who’s been involved in his own bipartisan negotiations on legislation like the Kids Online Safety Act and some of his foreign policy work, said he’s close with a few of the Democratic negotiators and had been talking to them in recent weeks throughout the shutdown.
“I didn’t discourage them from talking. I would never discourage an attempt to reach a bipartisan solution, but anything that failed to adequately address health care would be a nonstarter for the caucus, and was going to be heavily criticized,” Blumenthal said.
The latest rift over the shutdown deal put a spotlight back on the divisions within the Democratic Party that were brewing earlier this year. When government funding was close to running out last spring, Senate Democratic leadership faced blowback from the base for providing enough votes for Republicans to keep operations going through the fall.
Murphy said he worries that Democratic defections on major pieces of legislation ultimately gives Trump more leverage and power. Democrats split on a short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, twice this year.
On top of that, he pointed to Democratic votes for the Laken Riley Act, which requires U.S. officials to detain any immigrant without legal status who has been arrested, charged or convicted of specific crimes, and the GENIUS Act, which regulates a type of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins. Senate Democrats didn’t get a vote on an amendment to the latter bill, which sought to block elected officials like the president from personally profiting. Trump signed both bills into law earlier this year.
“I think it’s really harmful to have our party regularly split like this. This is the fourth major instance this year … where a minority of Democrats worked with Republicans to pass legislation that allows Trump to get away with a lot of corruption and illegality,” Murphy said. “At the very least, there should have been more people in that room, but we also have to find a way as a party to stop being split over and over again.”
Murphy has had a long political career that began at the age of 25 when he ran for the Connecticut House of Representatives. He went on to serve in both houses of the state legislature before he unseated a Republican congresswoman in 2006. He has served in Congress ever since, moving over to the U.S. Senate after the 2012 election.
Now, at the age of 52, he acknowledges the trajectory of his time in elected office and how he’s moved away from his dealmaking days from just a few years ago.
“I just think 2025 is fundamentally different than any other year that I’ve been involved in politics,” Murphy said. “I think I would be committing sort of political malpractice if I was operating this year like I’ve operated in the past.”
Responding to criticisms from Republicans who’ve known him for years, Murphy said he’s proud of his work with GOP lawmakers during his time in Connecticut’s General Assembly and on Capitol Hill. Yet, he’s unsure of more dealmaking in the near future.
“I wish that there were more opportunities for good bipartisanship,” he said. “But right now, those avenues aren’t available.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25302675892581-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-11-11 18:57:17.561776

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)A security company has dropped its lawsuit over Washington’s new sales tax on services weeks after filing it.
It’s unclear why. 
The development came after Security Services Northwest brought a suit against the state at the end of September. The voluntary dismissal, signed by a Thurston County Superior Court judge Nov. 4, was without prejudice, meaning the company could refile its lawsuit.
The Sequim-based firm and its lawyer didn’t respond to requests for comment. The state’s Department of Revenue and attorney general’s office weren’t sure why the company backed down. 
Security Services Northwest’s lawsuit centered on Senate Bill 5814, a contentious measure Democratic lawmakers passed this year to bring in $1.1 billion in the two-year budget that began July 1, and over $2.6 billion over four years. The law was part of a suite of new and increased taxes and fees Democrats pushed through to fill a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall. 
It took effect Oct. 1.
The law expanded taxes on a number of services, including security services. Others covered by the tax law include live presentations, information technology and temporary staffing. Over 90,000 companies are expected to pay under the law.
The levy on investigation, security and armored car services makes up $127 million of the anticipated four-year collections, according to the Department of Revenue.
In its complaint, Security Services Northwest argued the state didn’t give the company enough time to “adapt to and implement internal controls and procedures to ensure that proper sales tax is charged.”
The Department of Revenue issued guidance on companies’ obligations, including on Sept. 12 for security services. Included in the tax are private investigators, bounty hunters, security guards, fingerprinting, background checks, missing person tracking and lie detectors and polygraphs.
Security Services Northwest provides security officers, remote video monitoring and security alarm installation. It’s been in business since 1977.
The agency previously said it notified all businesses set to pay the new tax via letter or email between Aug. 13 and Aug. 22. Notices of the changes were also issued in late July. The department also hosted listening sessions with companies. 
Security Services Northwest also took issue with the tax itself, calling it a “direct tax on public safety” in a press release. And it argued the state was taxing security services unfairly compared to other professional services. 
The law, which legislators relied upon to help fund a $77.8-billion two-year operating budget, faces other legal threats.
Cable giant Comcast sued separately over a provision targeting digital advertising services. The company says the statute violates federal law because it doesn’t apply the tax to all advertising services equally.
The state has asked a Thurston County judge to dismiss the lawsuit, but this case is still pending.
The advertising services tax is projected to bring in $475 million over the next two budget cycles.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1683-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-11 18:02:03.399091

(Courtesy, Allyson Mathis)The retired park ranger who spotted graffiti last week in Arches National Park says she’s worried bare-bones staffing in the government shutdown is making it harder for the park to find out who’s responsible for the vandalism and clean it up. 
Allyson Mathis was hiking with a friend Nov. 5 in Devils Garden, a popular hiking area with arch and spire formations, when she spotted white paint on several rocks in the shape of hand prints, a smiley face, other shapes, and writing that said “Grug.” 
“It was so obvious that it was new, and so I’m like, ‘Shutdown-related damage. This is not good,’” Mathis said Tuesday. “When rangers are out there visible, I think people are more likely to respect the park.”

The vandalism illustrated yet another impact of the shutdown that has sidelined about 9,000 National Park Service workers who are not collecting paychecks while furloughed. The closure also halted scientific monitoring of landscapes and wildlife, said Mathis, who lives in Moab and previously was a park ranger at Grand Canyon, Canyonlands and Capitol Reef national parks.
Utah’s parks have remained open during the lapse, with the state chipping in $8,000 per day since Oct. 4 to keep visitor centers running. A slim staff of rangers is working, with a focus on keeping sightseers safe. 
“Their ability to investigate has been impaired this last number of days because they’re not fully staffed, and so they’re focusing on taking care of that life, health and safety,” Mathis said. 
She noted national parks sometimes ask the public for information to help them get to the bottom of vandalism, but that doesn’t appear to have happened as of Tuesday.

On the same hike last week, Mathis also spotted used toilet paper near the graffiti and saw someone walking a dog on the hiking trail, which is prohibited in Arches. 
The Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, a nonprofit organization of former park service employees and volunteers, said the graffiti shows why the parks should be shut down for the time being. 
“We continue to call on the administration to close national parks during the shutdown until adequate staffing and protections can be restored,” the group said in an Instagram post. “Our parks don’t run themselves; they rely on dedicated public servants to keep them clean, safe, and unimpaired for future generations.”
Mathis told Utah News Dispatch she’s hopeful those who want to see national parks protected will get in touch with their representatives in Congress. 
Said Mathis: “I hope that we come together and we make it very clear to our congressional group of representatives and administration that we love these places and we want them protected.”

“I’m relieved the Supreme Court let this one go,” said Kyle Harshey, who is married to the Rev. Christopher McAbee, associate rector at St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church in Jackson. “I don’t believe the person you love is up for debate.”
More than two-thirds of Americans say that same-sex couples deserve the same rights and protections as people in traditional marriages, according to Gallup polling. Among Democrats, that support has risen this year to its highest level, 88%, while the support among Republicans has fallen from 55% in 2021 to 41% this year.

In Mississippi, support for same-sex marriage is 54%, according to a 2024 report by the Public Religion Research Institute, but the state is also home to nearly 6,000 same-sex marriages, according to 2020 U.S. Census data. 
In June, the Mississippi Baptist Convention passed a resolution calling for the Supreme Court to reverse its decision on same-sex marriage, just as justices did in reversing its historic ruling on abortion.
The Rev. Shawn Parker, executive director of the Mississippi Baptist Convention Board, said they are disappointed the Supreme Court didn’t take up the issue.
“Our convictions are that everybody should be treated with kindness, but we believe that God designed marriage for a man and a woman for life,” he said. “That serves as the context for raising children. That serves as the fabric of society.”
While there is a legal aspect to marriage, the convention’s concerns center on the sanctity of marriage, he said. “It was ordained by God in the beginning.”
These days, society disregards “God, the creator, more and more,” he said. “We’re becoming more self-focused, which is detrimental to society and ultimately detrimental to each of us. We should be God-focused and other-focused.”
Everyone looks to an authority, he said. “That authority might be my own opinions, popular culture or science or some other source, but we choose to start with the authority of God as the creator and his word and his revelation.”
The Catholic Church remains opposed to same-sex marriage, but the late Pope Francis in 2023 allowed priests to bless same-sex couples in a pastoral capacity for individuals who love one another.
The United Methodist Church in 2024 repealed its prohibitions on its ministers officiating at same-sex weddings, a factor that has led to more than 6,000 congregations leaving the denomination.
The Episcopal Church has been performing same-sex marriages since 2015. Harshey and McAbee married three years later.
McAbee said he and many others are elated over the Supreme Court decision. “I’m also feeling that it’s very important for us in the LGBTQ community to not gloat in our victory, but to remember there are so many other Americans facing injustices,” he said.
Many are being hurt by health care cuts, and “undocumented people are being terrorized by ICE,” he said.
It is a time to pause for thanksgiving, “but also a moment to remind myself that this is part of an effort to create justice for all people,” he said.
On Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear the petition filed by Kim Davis, a former Kentucky county clerk who drew national attention for refusing to issue same-sex licenses because of her religious beliefs. She defied court orders to issue these licenses until a federal judge jailed her for contempt of court. In 2018, she lost a reelection bid.
She wanted justices to overturn an order that has required her to pay more than $300,000 in damages to the couple denied the marriage license. She also wanted the Supreme Court to overturn its 2015 same-sex marriage ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges.
Justice Clarence Thomas was among the four justices who dissented in that opinion. He has called for reversing that decision.
Harshey said he believes Davis’ religious beliefs present “a distorted view of Christianity,” which in reality are a “shield for discrimination,” he said.
While he is “personally thankful” for the outcome, he said Monday’s action is far from the end because some justices still want to reverse the 2015 decision.

Most of the 600,000 people in the state who get SNAP benefits will receive up to 65% of their typical payment, per guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Those beneficiaries “should begin to see those payments over the next few days,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.
Conflicting court rulings and actions by the Trump administration have resulted in whiplash for people who rely on the program to pay for groceries. USDA officials first advised that funding for SNAP would not be available at all in November due to the federal government shutdown, prompting food banks to ramp up operations for an influx of new visitors.
The shutdown tug-of-war over SNAP benefits: a timeline

After a coalition of states sued, a federal judge then ordered the federal government to fully fund SNAP using available contingency money, which the Trump administration then immediately appealed. States, including Colorado, began sending full payments to people late last week before the U.S. Supreme Court issued an administrative stay of the court order. The USDA then issued a memo on Sunday directing states to send the partial payments, and called any full payments to SNAP recipients unauthorized, requesting that states “immediately undo any steps taken.”
About 32,000 Coloradans received full SNAP payments last week before the administrative stay. Polis said that Colorado has not reversed those payments because they were authorized at the time.
“Nothing is preventing the Trump administration from fully funding SNAP benefits. They are simply choosing not to,” Polis’ statement said. “The fastest way to clean up this mess would be for the federal government to drop its court appeals.”
Colorado lawmakers on the Joint Budget Committee approved a request by Polis to infuse the state’s food banks with cash while SNAP benefits were paused so they could buy enough provisions to meet increased demand.
The U.S. Senate approved a bill on Monday night to fund the government until the end of January. It would fully appropriate SNAP benefits for the year, however, avoiding another lapse should the federal government shutdown again. The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the bill in the coming days.

State Reps. Stephanie Young (D-Detroit), Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor), Sharon MacDonnell (D-Troy), Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor) and Regina Weiss (D-Oak Park) introduced a resolution at the end of October calling on the Wayne County Airport Authority to halt plans to open a cigar bar and restaurant within DTW, citing the negative health impacts alongside an EPIC-MRA poll from June which found 77% of voters opposed the effort. 
Though the resolution was referred to the House Government Operations Committee, which is generally considered a graveyard for policy, the southeast Michigan Democrats’ are not the only officials speaking out against the cigar bar, with the Wayne County Commission voting to formally oppose a cigar lounge within the airport. 
The plan has also drawn opposition from the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights, the Center for Black Health and Equity and the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council.
“Everyone – including travelers and those who work at the airport – deserves the right to breathe clean, smoke-free air,” Molly Medenblik, Michigan government relations director at the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network said in a statement. “Travelers shouldn’t have to worry about being exposed to secondhand smoke – especially when the evidence is crystal clear that it poses serious risks to a person’s health.”
In order to move forward with the proposal, the airport would also need an exemption from the state’s smoke-free indoor air law, which took effect in 2010. 
Matt Morawski, director of communications and external affairs for the Wayne County Airport Authority said in an emailed statement that the request for proposals for a cigar bar in DTW’s McNamara Terminal was developed in response to “interest from the community and local businesses, especially as it relates to the international nature of the airport.”
As part of their proposal, bidders will be required to provide an air handling and ventilation system and facility design to reduce smoke exposure to the fullest extent possible, Morawski said. Proposals are due in February 2026. 
In a letter to the Wayne County Airport Authority, leaders from Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights, the Center for Black Health and Equity and the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council pointed to a 2012 study from the Centers for Disease Control which found that allowing smoking in designated areas and ventilated rooms was ineffective in eliminating exposure to secondhand smoke.
“No community group, employee organization, or public health expert has asked for a cigar lounge.” Cynthia Hallett, president and CEO of Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights, said in a statement. “Airport employees should not have to choose between their health and their paycheck, and travelers should not be forced to walk past clouds of toxic smoke on their way to their gates. The Wayne County Airport Authority should align itself with public sentiment and public health guidelines and maintain a 100% smokefree DTW.”

Roy Cooper said he doesn’t support legislation that passed the U.S. Senate on Monday night to reopen the government, siding with a majority of Senate Democrats that opposed any bipartisan deal that did not address rising health care costs.
That legislation now heads to the U.S. House, where a vote expected Wednesday will likely have narrow margins. Two of North Carolina’s four House Democrats have already indicated they will vote against it.
A standoff that spanned 41 days ended Monday when a group of eight senators, including seven Democrats, broke ranks to pass a Republican-led spending package. Cooper, the presumptive Democratic nominee for the open Senate seat in North Carolina, criticized the decision in a statement Monday.
“Working families are struggling and any deal that lets health care costs continue to skyrocket is unacceptable,” Cooper said. “It’s absurd this shutdown ever happened and that Republicans used hungry children as political pawns. Washington needs to do its job and come together on a bill that tackles costs and protects health care for North Carolinians.”
Democrats in Washington had pushed for any bill ending the shutdown to also include an extension of tax credits that reduce premium costs for those who pay for health care through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Those tax credits expire at the end of the year; if they do, premiums will spike for millions of enrollees.
Senate Republicans have agreed to hold a vote on the issue separately next month, but passage is not guaranteed.
Democratic North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein, asked about the shutdown agreement during a news conference Tuesday, called Congress’ decision “inexcusable” as he compared it to North Carolina lawmakers’ failure to reach an agreement on funding Medicaid.
“Folks deserve access to health care,” Stein said. “That’s why the active work by Congress and the administration to deprive people of subsidies for the Affordable Care Act insurance plans … or the willingness of the General Assembly to refuse to fully fund Medicaid, putting at risk the entire system, is inexcusable.”
“We’ve got to be focusing on what matters to people’s lives,” Stein said. “That’s what government needs to do in Washington, that’s what government needs to do here in Raleigh.”
U.S. House to vote on shutdown agreement. Will NC Democrats oppose it?
It remains to be seen whether any House Democrats will join their Senate colleagues in support of the bill.
The offices of two of North Carolina’s four House Democrats — U.S. Reps. Alma Adams and Valerie Foushee — did not immediately respond to requests for comments Tuesday on how they planned to vote. Rep. Deborah Ross’ office referred NC Newsline to her comments on social media.
And U.S. Rep. Don Davis, viewed as one of the most moderate Democrats in the House, said in a statement he was “reviewing” the Senate agreement, but did not say which way he would vote on it.
“I am focused on ending the government shutdown responsibly and addressing the high cost of living families are facing,” Davis said. “The shutdown has made life harder for many families in eastern North Carolina and rural America, where resources are already limited.”
Ross and Foushee, meanwhile, have both signaled that they would oppose the measure as currently written.
Ross wrote on social media that the Senate agreement “is a bad deal for North Carolina.”
“It is a betrayal of hundreds of thousands of NC families on the verge of losing their health care,” she added.
And Foushee noted that House Speaker Mike Johnson had not yet pledged a vote on ACA subsidies like the Senate.
“I’m ready to find a solution to address the health care crisis and open the government — but this deal doesn’t do that,” Foushee wrote on social media.
Shutdown agreement creates political crossroads for Democrats
The shutdown legislation puts vulnerable Democrats in a precarious political position.
If they support the deal, they can tout having reopened the government after the longest shutdown in history — but leave themselves open to criticism from voters who see health care costs as a top issue.
Voting against the agreement, meanwhile, keeps them among a majority of elected Democrats. But it leaves them open to attacks from Republicans who, despite the GOP’s trifecta control of Congress and the White House, are likely to accuse them of trying to prolong a shutdown that temporarily cut off food benefits for low-income families and halted pay for federal workers and North Carolina’s large military communities.
That calculus is more difficult for a Democrat like Davis, who could already face a severe uphill battle for re-election in a redrawn district. And while Cooper has no primary opponents ahead of his 2026 campaign against Michael Whatley, he will face scrutiny in the general election for his stance on the shutdown as he attempts to win over moderate and conservative voters.
The Senate GOP’s campaign operation has already taken aim on the issue, tying Cooper to progressive Democrats in a statement.
“Roy Cooper stayed silent on the shutdown for over 40 days, then when he finally took a position, he came out in lockstep with Bernie Sanders and AOC,” said Nick Puglia, regional press secretary for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

WILMINGTON, Del. — For more than a generation, the Kalmar Nyckel has been more than a tall ship on the Christina — it’s been a living symbol of Delaware’s story and a place where people find each other as much as they find history.
That community spirit will be on full display Thursday, Nov. 13, when the Kalmar Nyckel Foundation celebrates a major milestone: 1 million volunteer hours logged since 2000, powered by the more than 250 men and women who sail, teach, repair, greet and guide as part of “The Tall Ship of Delaware.”
The foundation will mark the moment with a special “Join Our Volunteer Crew! Tours, Chili & Brew” event from 4 to 6:30 p.m. at the Copeland Maritime Center, 1124 E. 7th St. in Wilmington, capped by a ceremonial cannon blast at 6 p.m. to honor the millionth recorded hour. Admission, parking and chili are free; a cash bar will be available, and free ship tours will be offered from 4 to 5 p.m. Registration is required online or by calling (302) 429-7447.
The milestone underscores what many Delawareans already know: Kalmar Nyckel is as much a cultural gathering place as it is a historic replica ship.
“Reaching 1,000,000 hours is such a testament to the hard work and dedication to our amazing organization,” said Captain Sharon, who manages the year-round volunteer program and has been part of every tracked hour. “We have great shipmates who can be counted on to make anything happen on both ship and shore.”
The millionth hour was entered by sailing crew member Paul Deevy, now affectionately known aboard as “The Million-Hour Man.” Deevy will help fire the celebratory cannon from the ship’s deck Thursday evening as guests watch from the dock and the Maritime Center balcony.
Built as a full-scale replica of the 17th-century Swedish vessel that helped establish the colony of New Sweden in 1638, Kalmar Nyckel has evolved into a floating classroom, an ambassador for Delaware and a familiar backdrop for school groups, festivals, tours and waterfront events. Each year, the Kalmar Nyckel Foundation reaches more than 33,000 people through sails, dockside programs, classroom visits and community events that blend maritime history with lessons in science, economics, geography, math and teamwork.
Behind that public presence is a deep reservoir of civic commitment. Volunteers contribute roughly 40,000 hours a year — rigging sails, restoring woodwork, leading field trips, telling stories of Delaware’s early settlers and welcoming visitors from across the state and around the world.
“Come for the sailing, stay for the community of great people,” has become a mantra among volunteers, and the foundation emphasizes that no previous sailing or maritime experience is required. Prospective crew members can enroll in a Winter Crew Training course or a condensed live-aboard spring program, where they learn seamanship, safety, history and teamwork through lectures, hands-on practice and mentoring.
“The Kalmar Nyckel Foundation’s programs come to life because of our volunteers. They make the heart of our foundation beat,” Captain Sharon said. Each season, the ship travels more than 2,400 nautical miles to ports along the East Coast, carrying Delaware’s history and hospitality with it — and building strong ties among its crew.
For Delaware, the ship has become a unifying cultural touchstone: a link between past and present, city and riverfront, students and educators, longtime residents and newcomers, all woven together by the people who choose to give their time.
Those who cannot attend Thursday’s celebration will have additional chances to connect. The foundation will host Volunteer Open Houses with two-hour introductory programs at 10 a.m. on Nov. 22, Dec. 6 and Jan. 3, 2026, at the Copeland Maritime Center.

Alan Luzzatto has long opposed any development on a corner of Wheeler Nature Park in South Burlington. For the last five years, he has met with neighbors, signed petitions and tried to speak with the developer to suggest alternatives.
He was also one of the residents within 750 feet of the blasting area to receive a pre-blasting inspection notice from a survey company hired by Maine Drilling & Blasting that is expected to work on the parcel. Blasting is supposed to begin in November and expected to last through January.
“I never understood how a development could be built upon a legally standing nature park,” he said.

Neighbors have for years opposed a plan by owner JAM Golf LLC and BlackRock Construction to build a 32-unit mixed housing project with roadway and utility access on an undeveloped 6.9-acre parcel at the intersection of Dorset Street and Park Road in South Burlington. The site is directly adjacent to the 110-acre Wheeler Nature Park — widely considered a local treasure for its sweeping views of the Green Mountains.
The recent blasting notices to build on undeveloped land that has bedrock signal an end to the yearslong fight. No work permits have been pulled yet for any site work to take place at 550 Park Road, according to city officials. Ben Avery, vice president of development at BlackRock, declined to comment.
Although the Wheeler Nature Park was purchased and preserved in perpetuity for light recreation by the city more than 35 years ago, the 6.9-acre parcel was created as part of a settlement with JAM Golf in 2015 and is now privately owned, city documents note. 
BlackRock Construction won development review board approval to build on the land in 2021 and cleared the state’s Act 250 permit in July 2022, but the permit was soon appealed by a group of 125 neighbors and the Neighbors Committee to Stop Neighborhood Blasting.

The case has lagged through the courts since, until June, when the Vermont Supreme Court dismissed the latest arguments opposing the housing project. More than 500 residents then signed a petition calling on the City Council to buy back the parcel or encourage landowner JAM Golf  to donate it back to the city.
“While I am a fervent advocate for conservation, after this almost two decade process, there is nothing that the City can plausibly do at this point to halt that development,” City Councilor Andrew Chalnick wrote in an Oct. 19 email to petitioners.
“We are keenly aware that many people are paying close attention to the plan for development of this neighborhood and that a petition was submitted to the City Council to seek alternatives,” Planning and Zoning Director Paul Connor said. 
He added that the city has been committed to being “even-handed and transparent” throughout the project. 

“As the approved 32-home neighborhood at 550 Park Road moves towards its construction phase, we will continue to do the same,” he said. 
City Council members did not respond to a request for comment, but neighbors are making a last ditch effort to stop shovels from going into the ground.
There are very few places like the nature park in the city, said Rose Goddard, who lives less than a mile away from the slated development. 
“I call it the crown jewel of South Burlington,” she said.
The South Burlington Land Trust’s board voted unanimously to support the petition, according to board President Rosanne Greco.
“It is an open land that ought to be preserved because of its natural resources, fertile soils, wildlife habitat,” she said. “… I think we need it in our lives.”
The development, according to Greco, a former city councilor, will almost certainly adversely affect the groundwater and soil at the Wheeler homestead nearby that features a historic home with master gardens, community garden plots, walking trails and a dog park.
“There are so many reasons not to destroy natural open spaces like this that it almost doesn’t need explanation. But of course it does because most people don’t think this way,” she said.

Goddard said she voted years ago for the city to keep the parcel as part of the nature park instead of the land swap that eventually took place and has paved the way for development.
“The horse is out of the barn,” she said. “I feel very sad for the future generations.”
The suburban development will destroy the wide trail, obscure the last remaining views of the Green Mountains from Dorset Street and endanger wildlife in the park, the petition states. 
“I don’t understand why the support is not there with so many people interested in saving the park,” said Jeanne Zagursky, one of the organizers of the effort to protect the parcel slated for development. “It’s not logical to me. I feel like there’s something not right with the system.” 
When blasting last happened in the area earlier this year, it was loud, constant and terrifying, she recalled. 
“Every single time your heart jumps and animals scramble and you’re just hoping that your basement’s not cracking. It’s not good,” she said.
“Unberarable” and “incessant” drilling measured up to 90 decibels when luxury homes were built in 2023 — also by BlackRock — on a section off Long Drive that had extensive ledge underground. 
South Burlington recently approved standards for review of bedrock removal during development. These include limiting drilling and blasting to between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., The Other Paper reported.
The fight against the development has left the 78-year-old Luzzatto dispirited. 
“I’ve given up. That’s the sad part of it. We pretty much tried everything,” he said. “And frankly, we are all worn out.”

(Stock photo by hapabapa/Getty Images)An interesting thing happened in New Mexico on Monday.
Lawmakers, angry over the federal government’s insistence it can’t pay November federal aid for food stamps, held a special legislative session to approve the use of up to $163 million in state funds to help cover the lapse through the holidays if needed. Acting Gov. Howie Morales (D) swiftly signed the bill.
Leaders coming together to help their most vulnerable constituents through an emergency — what an idea!
Things are different on this side of the country, where our state’s leaders have opted not to use emergency funds for the same purpose. It’s not that we don’t have the money. It’s that our leaders believe this is President Donald Trump’s problem to solve, not theirs.
Gov. Phil Murphy (D), speaking to reporters last week the day after Democrats trounced Republicans at the ballot box, said Trump fighting not to pay out federal aid for food stamps is “cruel” (food stamps, or EBT, are bureaucratically called SNAP, for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program).
“They’re sitting on about $6 billion, and they’re choosing to allow people to go hungry, 800,000 New Jerseyans. That’s a choice that they’ve made,” Murphy said.
He’s referring to a roughly $6 billion federal fund that is supposed to pay out food stamp benefits in the event of a government shutdown, like the current one. Trump initially refused to tap that fund, then gave some to states to deliver to SNAP recipients, and now wants some money back.
You know who else is sitting on a $6 billion emergency fund? New Jersey. The current state budget has a $6.7 billion surplus, but Murphy did not tap it to cover the cost of food stamps even as Trump seeks to deny the funds.

“No state in America, including New Jersey, can step into the shoes, the financial, existentially important shoes of the federal administration, in terms of whether it’s health care premiums, whether it’s Medicaid, SNAP. So we’ll do our best. As you’ve seen with SNAP, we’ve taken a whole range of steps, but the federal government is the big gorilla on any program like health care or food stamps. We’ll do our best at the edges, but we need Congress and the administration and Washington to step up and do their part,” Murphy told reporters Monday.
If New Jersey decided to fully cover food stamps for a single month, it would cost about $170 million. That’s 2.5% of the surplus. The budget is $58.8 billion.
Murphy’s successor, Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D), sides with the governor.
“Our state budget is very tight. There’s a lot more work we need to do to address affordability issues, including in utility costs, health care costs and housing costs. So at a minimum, the federal government has to do what it’s legally now required to do, and support the SNAP funding,” Sherrill said in Newark last week.
I understand that food stamps are a federal program and it’s incumbent on the federal government to pay for them, and that New Jersey footing the bill is not a long-term solution. I also understand that the federal government may reopen in days, potentially making this specific problem moot (or not, depending on Trump’s mood). But the food stamp chaos is wreaking havoc on the lives of our poorest residents, and Trenton owes it to them to do more than start a SNAP task force or deploy the National Guard to help food banks.
Craig Mainor is executive director of United Community Corp., which runs seven community refrigerators and three food pantries in Essex County and serves about 10,000 meals a month to the county’s low-income residents. Mainor said he saw a “huge increase” in the number of people seeking help from his nonprofit when aid for food stamps was halted at the start of the month.
“There has been an eye-opener for some folks who thought that they would never need it, but now need it. Even when they were collecting SNAP benefits, they didn’t necessarily have to go to the shelters or the food distributions. But now that that’s been cut off, they find themselves in line, taking off from work for some of them. Some of them are seniors who are now forced to stand in line,” he said. “The eye-opener is that at any moment we can all be in a line for food.”
That may all be sorted out in days, either with the federal government reopening or the U.S. Supreme Court deciding not to side with Trump on this matter. But we should not forget that, with a monsoon raging, the state sat on a $6.7 billion rainy-day fund and didn’t use one cent of it to help with the deluge.

Organizations such as the National Hispanic Health Foundation, National Hispanic Council on Aging, League of United Latin American Citizens, MANA and the American Diabetes Association sent letters to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and several state lawmakers this week asking that they take action during the session, which begins in January 2026. The letters encourage lawmakers to help expand access to chronic disease treatments, particularly for people who belong to historically disadvantaged communities.
“Over the past decade, the state has seen the steepest rise in obesity rates in the nation — a ten-point surge that has pushed adult obesity to 36.3%,” a statement from the organizations reads. “This growing crisis falls hardest on those already confronting health inequities: Hispanics, African Americans, and Native Americans, as well as women, particularly those in low-income households.”
According to a 2023 report by the Health Equity Coalition for Chronic Diseases, managing the underlying causes of obesity and the conditions the disease causes create significant out-of-pocket costs that “rose by 37% over the last decade—and that’s just for those with private insurance,” the report reads. 
The report notes that 45.6% of Hispanic adults in the country live with obesity — the second-highest rate among minority groups following non-Hispanic Black adults. The report adds that particularly among Hispanic residents in the U.S., higher rates of obesity are linked to a lack of access to healthy, affordable food; safe spaces to exercise; and stable, affordable housing.
According to a report by the Childhood Obesity Intervention Cost-Effectiveness Study (CHOICES), the overall prevalence of obesity among New Mexico adults was 42.8% in 2020. The highest rates were recorded among Hispanic and Black adults, low-income residents and women. The report projects the overall rate among adults in the state will increase to 51.8% by 2030.
“New Mexicans on Medicaid deserve access to breakthrough obesity therapies that will not only save lives, reduce costs, and help dismantle long-standing inequities in care, but also improve outcomes across the state,” the organizations’ letter states.
The American Diabetes Association notes that addressing the disease of obesity requires “person-centered” treatment that includes various screenings, intensive behavioral therapy, access to Federal Drug Administration-approved medications and access to bariatric or metabolic surgeries when recommended by a health professional.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ozempic1731962374.jpg,,,2025-11-11 18:02:03.399091

BRATTLEBORO — Plans are moving forward to set up an emergency overnight shelter this winter to fill what organizers say is the need “to offer a warm and welcoming overnight space for adults during the coldest months of the year.”
More than 50 people gathered at the Beloved Community Church — the congregation formed by the collaboration of the First United Methodist and First Baptist churches — on Town Crier Drive for a meeting that outlined plans for the overnight shelter, which would be housed at the church between Dec. 1 and March 31.

“It’s wonderful to see human decency in action,” said Ralph Howe, pastor of First United Methodist Church.
Initial setup costs for the Beloved Winter Shelter are being funded by a grant from the state’s Extreme Cold Weather Shelter Program. According to its website, the ECWSP “is designed to support community-based emergency shelter operations during periods of extreme cold for individuals experiencing homelessness who have no other safe housing option.”
The ECWSP grant will cover staffing and operating costs for 20 of the coldest nights this winter, kicking in when temperatures plummet below 10 degrees Fahrenheit. But organizers say they intend to have the new shelter open for the other 100 nights and are in the process of fundraising to cover those costs, estimated at $222,000. So far, about $77,000 has been raised.
The shelter would run in a similar way to the Winter Overflow Shelter that existed in the former sanctuary of the First Baptist Church on Main Street for about a decade, until 2017.
The new shelter would be open every night from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m., with capacity for eight people most nights, with up to 15 cots allowed on the 20 coldest nights. Organizers say they are trying to get an exemption from state regulators to have 15 cots available for all 120 nights.
The cots, which will be set up in the church’s fellowship hall, would be available each night on a first-come, first-serve basis. There would be no overnight storage of belongings, and guests would be required to take everything with them when they leave.
Organizers say it will be run as a “low-barrier” shelter for guests over the age of 18. Alcohol, drugs or weapons will not be allowed, and anyone who leaves during the night cannot check back in. “We’re trying to get as many people in here as we can,” said Eileen Glover, a member of the shelter’s steering committee. “We’re not going have lots of strict guidelines. It’s for the people with the most need on the coldest nights.”
Unlike the former First Baptist shelter, no meals will be served. Instead, snacks and beverages will be provided. Another difference is that there will be a mix of paid staff and volunteers running the shelter each night. Training will be provided for everyone involved with the shelter, with an emphasis on what organizers described as “de-escalation, first aid, and mental-health awareness.”
Filling the need
Last winter, the state’s hotel shelter program was winding down and the shelter spaces run by Groundworks Collaborative were at maximum capacity. In the absence of an emergency shelter set up by the town, Cristina Shayonye and other Brattleboro community members raised and spent $3,000 on motel rooms to get people off the streets during the coldest nights.
While this effort succeeded in helping some people, Shayonye said it was “hectic and unsustainable,” and a more permanent solution is needed. At the same time that a shelter site was being sought, a community center on 69A Elliot Street opened in the spring to serve as a daytime downtown gathering place.
Started by Katie Bachler and Scott Berzofsky, 69A is open Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and offers free coffee, tea, water, Wi-Fi access and various gear and supplies (including tents, sleeping bags, flashlights and clothing). It was designed as a place to relax and regroup, with “restrooms, music, and people to talk to,” according to a 69A flyer.
Several of the people involved with 69A, including Shayonye, are part of the Beloved Shelter steering committee. They see the Beloved Shelter as an extension of the resources they’ve been providing on Elliot Street. “We were looking for a place to open its doors to us, and we couldn’t find one last year,” said Shayonye. “And this church, the Beloved Community Church, opened its doors to us this year, and this [ECWSP] grant came along. With an actual location and the grant money, we won’t have to put people in motel rooms this winter.”
Glover, one of the sheter’s steering committee members, said the Beloved Shelter organizers have been working with organizations in other local communities. “They’ve gratefully shared their documents with us so we weren’t building everything from scratch,” she said. “We are figuring out what the structure is going to look like, how we are operating, what the safety and procedures are while we are here.”
Training will be provided for shelter volunteers, including spending time at 69A to learn more about the people the shelter will be serving.
Thinking creatively
Organizers stressed that the Beloved Shelter is not specifically connected to Groundworks. “We are collaborating and are in constant communication with the other organizations in town that provide services, but this is its own entity with its own fiscal sponsor,” said steering committee member Elizabeth Moriarty.
“We are educators, clergy, activists, parents, psychiatric nurses and neighbors — people who are connected to this community and deeply care about it who are wanting to connect with our other neighbors,” she continued. “We work in deep partnership with other agencies, elected officials and other people of goodwill, but we are an ad hoc collective.”
Groundworks Executive Director Libby Bennett said at the meeting that the nonprofit’s overnight shelter is often full and presents more barriers than what the Beloved Shelter is planning.
She noted that the state programs to offer shelter in motels “have been pared way down, so that is basically for families,” she said. “We’re down to just one motel in town that can take single people. So that’s where this shelter comes in.”
This program is far from adequate to meet the problem at hand, the organizers said. The Beloved Shelter will be “one option that didn’t exist last winter,” said Shayoyne. “There needs to be more than this.”
“The problem is systemic and vast, and we need different pieces and creative solutions that defy categories,” Moriarty added.
Skyberry House, a Brattleboro nonprofit that has been operating what it calls “a house of hospitality” modeled on the Catholic Worker houses started in the 1930s, is the nonprofit fiscal agent for the new shelter, Moriarty said. She said donations will be handled through Skyberry with complete openness and accountability about budgeting and spending.
“We want to do this because it’s needed,” Moriarty said, “and we want you to be a part of it because we can’t do it by ourselves.” Shayoyne said it’s about “neighbors helping neighbors, and when you have more than you need and you see someone who doesn’t have enough at all, then you pitch in and share.”
“That’s what kind of shelter it is,” she added.

Those interested in serving as paid overnight hosts or shelter staff, or serving as volunteer to help set up the shelter at the beginning of the evening and cleaning up in the morning, can contact the steering committee at belovedwintershelter@gmail.com.
Donations for the shelter can be mailed to Beloved Winter Shelter, in care of Skyberry House, P.O. Box 360, Brattleboro, VT 05302. Be sure to make checks payable to Skyberry House, with “Beloved Winter Shelter” written in the memo line.

The Iowa Board of Regents announced Tuesday afternoon that Cook, North Dakota State University president and one of two finalists for the Iowa State University presidency, has been chosen to lead ISU after President Wendy Wintersteen’s retirement in January.

Cook told ISU community members during a public forum last week that returning to ISU would be like coming home, as he grew up in Ames and completed his undergraduate education at the university. He said at the time he would not come back just to “reinvent the wheel” if selected, but to build on the legacy Wintersteen left and bring ISU to new heights.
Wintersteen announced her plans to retire in May, after which the board of regents contracted with AGB Search and formed a committee to review candidates. Working with a timeline described by AGB Search Managing Principal Rodrick McDavis as “very, very, very tight,” the presidential search committee spent the summer creating a presidential profile and going through applicants, eventually narrowing down a pool of 78 people to eight semifinalists.
Of the four finalists selected for in-person interviews and public inquiry through forums, only two ended up coming to campus last week — Cook and Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Dean Benjamin Houlton.

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana and federal officials are taking legal action against Smitty’s Supply Inc., seeking fines and penalties that could exceed a billion dollars for years of environmental violations and the recent industrial fire and mass spillage at its petroleum products plant in Tangipahoa Parish. 
An attorney for private litigants worries that such a high amount, if awarded, could become an obstacle for neighbors and local businesses seeking their own reparations. 
The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, filed their lawsuit against Smitty’s Supply on Nov. 5 with a federal court in New Orleans. They allege a long list of violations of the federal Clean Water Act and similar state laws and regulations for incidents going back nearly five years. The infractions culminated with the Aug. 22 explosion at the Smitty’s Supply facility in Roseland.
“Plaintiffs ask this Court to hold Defendant accountable for unlawfully polluting the Nation’s and the State’s waters, and to require Defendant to take all appropriate measures to prevent future spills or discharges,” the lawsuit states.
Attorneys for Smitty’s Supply have not responded to a request for comment.
Its Roseland plant, which bottles and manufactures a wide variety of oils, fluids and petrochemical products for distribution to automotive and industrial retailers, was almost completely destroyed in the August disaster. Storage tanks and drums holding as much as 11 million gallons of hazardous substances caught fire, with some exploding. The fire took two weeks to fully extinguish while millions of gallons of oil and chemicals stored at the plant contaminated public land and waterways, reaching as far as 47 miles downstream on the Tangipahoa River, according to the EPA. 
Flowing through a series of ditches and channels, the hazardous substances entered the river through at least four separate points of entry, the lawsuit notes. 
The EPA estimates cleanup crews have recovered oily waste and petroleum-based materials totaling 11 million gallons, which matches the facility’s storage capacity, from nearby ponds, rivers and drainage channels.
Clay Garside, an environmental litigator with the New Orleans-based Waltzer, Wiygul & Garside law firm, said he’s concerned the government’s lawsuit could leave little money for Tangipahoa residents and other private litigants with claims related to the disaster. Garside represents the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, an environmental advocacy group planning to sue Smitty’s Supply.
“To the extent they have to pay penalties, it takes away available funds to compensate folks,” Garside said. 
Neither the U.S. Department of Justice nor Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill’s office would offer further comment on the case.
Shortly before the government filed its complaint, Garside said U.S. Department of Justice attorneys contacted him to ask about Louisiana Environmental Action Network claims and to confirm a filing deadline, adding that he expected its lawsuit to be filed before his. 
Companies are rarely made to pay the maximum penalties in these kinds of cases, Garside said, but even lesser fines can lead a company like Smitty’s Supply into bankruptcy.
The state’s claims in the lawsuit carry significantly lighter penalties of up to $32,500 per violation per day. 
Smitty’s has filed its own lawsuit, blaming the disaster on two other businesses — the New York-based Fulton Thermal Corp., whuch manufactures industrial boiler tanks, and Baton Rouge’s J&M Boiler Combustion Control Services, which installs and maintains the tanks. Smitty’s alleges the boiler malfunctioned, exploded and caused the fire but hasn’t said how or why it malfunctioned.
State and federal environmental officials have been unable to determine what started the fire but discovered numerous violations of laws and environmental regulations they allege could have prevented the disaster or mitigated its impacts.  
They accuse Smitty’s of violating the federal Clean Water Act, the Louisiana Water Control Law and Louisiana Water Pollution Control regulations, among other regulations. 
The agencies allege the company failed to implement EPA-required plans for oil spill prevention and emergency response and repeatedly failed to comply with other laws regulating pollutant discharges during the years leading up to the fire.
Lawsuit details prior violations
The state and EPA complaint cites hundreds of previous wastewater discharge, pollution reporting and permit exceedance violations going back three years, as well as seven separate chemical spills since 2021 that reached offsite and contaminated public areas. 
One occurred July 21, 2024, involving 950 gallons of hydraulic oil that spilled from a burst railcar transfer line. While cleaning up the initial spill, the oil spilled a second time when the facility’s oil-water separator tank overflowed. It went into a ditch along U.S. Highway 51, flowed into a nearby creek and then to a private pond, creating 14,000 gallons of contaminated material that had to be removed, the complaint states. 
Another spill the following month, on Aug. 30, 2024, involved a 55-gallon drum of Navilan Yellow 73, a dye added to other fluids for the purpose of detecting spills and leaks. The dye spilled into a drainage ditch along Highway 51 and migrated to a pond on private property. It’s unclear if it was the same pond that had been contaminated the month before. 
The lawsuit discusses some of the impacts the most recent incident had on the Tangipahoa River, which flows into Lake Pontchartrain, though officials have said the contaminants were blocked before reaching the lake. The incident shut down a 47-mile-long section of the river, which only recently reopened after being closed to the public for over two months. 
“Defendant’s unauthorized discharge … was toxic to human, plant, or animal life or significantly increased health risks due to exposure to the substances or consumption of contaminated fish or other aquatic life,” the filing states.
Recovery and cleanup efforts in the area are still ongoing more than two months after the incident, and the court filing points out that oil and other hazardous substances on the site still pose risk. 
“As of the filing of this Complaint, the cleanup of the discharge is ongoing, but there is still a threat of another discharge if there is a significant rainfall event,” the lawsuit states. “Although a temporary storm water collection is in place at the Facility, it may not be able to withstand significant rainfall.”
One of the EPA’s claims carries a potential penalty of up to $7,093 per barrel of oil discharged. With 11 million gallons of waste recovered, that penalty could total as much as $1.8 billion if the court finds the company acted with “gross negligence or willful misconduct” and awards the maximum fine. Potential penalties for the other claims listed could reach hundreds of millions.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-11 21:42:12+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT officials, hospital staff celebrate UConn takeover of Waterbury Hospital",Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/11/ct-uconn-health-waterbury-hospital-sale/,"Some took the opportunity to slam the hospital’s current owner—formerly private equity-backed hospital operator, Prospect Medical Holdings.","Over 100 people gathered Tuesday morning at Waterbury Hospital to celebrate the hospital’s acquisition by the state’s flagship medical institution, UConn Health. The announcement marks the culmination of a years-long saga to find a new owner for the facility, which has, at times, seemed on the brink of closure. 
Elected officials and executives called the moment a “restart” for the hospital. A few also took the opportunity to slam the hospital’s current owner — the bankrupt, formerly private equity-backed hospital operator, Prospect Medical Holdings.
“We have finally reached a point where we are going to invest in people over profits. Goodbye Prospect,” UConn Health Board Chair John Driscoll said, eliciting cheers and applause from the crowd. 
In 2022, Prospect signed a deal to sell Waterbury Hospital, along with its two other Connecticut facilities, Manchester Memorial and Rockville General, to Yale New Haven Health for $435 million. But the deal was mired in setbacks and litigation. 
In August 2023, a cyberattack crippled operations at Prospect’s facilities around the country. In 2024, Yale New Haven Health and Prospect Medical sued and countersued each other over the true value of the hospitals. In January 2025, Prospect filed for bankruptcy and, by the following month, Yale officials said a deal appeared “impossible.”
Over the last six months, state officials have been hard at work to negotiate Waterbury Hospital’s purchase by UConn Health. The deal would save Waterbury Hospital from closure and help support Gov. Ned Lamont’s goal to improve the financial sustainability of UConn Health, state and hospital officials say. 
“It wasn’t easy. It took a little navigating to get this done over the last six months,” Lamont said. “But this is a good thing for Waterbury, a really good thing for Waterbury Hospital, and it’s a good thing for the UConn Health system generally.”
The acquisition is structured as a “public-private partnership.” Waterbury Hospital will be part of the UConn Health network, but remain private. 
Last week, the state submitted a $13 million bid to purchase the hospital, including $4 million for the operating assets and $9 million for the real estate. The state will also assume a limited set of the hospital’s liabilities, bringing the deal’s total value up to $35 million, according to the terms laid out in court documents.
Prospect originally paid $31.8 million to acquire Waterbury Hospital in 2016. While the state is purchasing Waterbury for less than half of what it was worth almost a decade ago, the facility will require deep investments to address significant quality issues. 
During a special session of the state legislature this week, lawmakers will vote to approve $390 million in bonding over a five-year period to support capital investments in Waterbury, as well as Bristol Hospital and Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam, which the state is also in talks to acquire. 
Some level of forgiveness for the taxes Prospect owes the state will also be a part of the deal. Court records show that Prospect owes the state $127 million in hospital provider taxes going back more than three years. However, those negotiations are happening separately and not explicitly included in the bid submitted last week. 
The bonding package on the agenda for the special session beginning on Wednesday has widespread bipartisan support, Comptroller Sean Scanlon said. 
“Every single legislative caucus leader has supported this project, and you’re going to see a massive, overwhelming bipartisan vote in favor of this on Wednesday and Thursday. Democrats and Republicans all understand this,” Scanlon said.
Joe Polletta, R-Watertown, said he would vote ‘yes’ on the bonding package, and thanked Lamont and Scanlon for their commitment to finding a solution.
“A lot of folks ask: What’s going to happen to the hospital? What’s going to happen to my job? What does it mean for health care in this area?” Polletta said. “This is going to solve that problem.”
Hospital employees, who were overjoyed by the announcement, said investments in the hospital should go towards infrastructure and technology upgrades, as well as supplies and staff.
“I’m tired of looking for IV pumps, working cardiac monitors, a chair to sit in. I mean, literally something that simple,” Marilyn Anthony, a registered nurse who has worked at the hospital for over 20 years, said. “And staff. I want staff.”
Anthony, who is 65, said she put off her own retirement so she could stay on board after the state’s acquisition to help rebuild the hospital’s operations.
Lamont said another goal of the partnership is for the expanded UConn Health network to help provide broader access to high quality, low-cost care. State employee and retiree health plans will incentivize participants to go to UConn Health and Waterbury Hospital, where, Lamont said, “you get the very best value there is.” 
When asked whether he supported a public option in Connecticut, which Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, called for during a press conference Monday, Lamont joked that he had “concepts of a plan.”
“I refer to it as the ‘Connecticut option,’” Lamont said. “One step at a time, but obviously we’d like to incentivize people and give them an opportunity to play into this preferred network. And state employees would be a big piece of that.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lamont-waterbury-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-11 17:01:47.619149

Free.,The shutdown tug-of-war over SNAP benefits: a timeline,"Jacob Fischler, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/shutdown-tug-war-over-snap-benefits-timeline,,"Payments for November for the nation’s main food assistance program have been delayed during the government shutdown, amid a confusing mess of contradicting guidance from the Trump administration and a flurry of court orders in two cases at every level of the federal judiciary.The off-and-on freeze of benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, that serves about 42 million people, was among the most consequential effects of the record-setting shutdown. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans use SNAP to help buy groceries.Lawmakers, advocates and judges all repeatedly called for urgency to restore the program to keep Americans from going hungry. Yet the dizzying back-and-forth continued, often leaving both states and families at a loss.While the shutdown is likely to end this week, the legal fight continues over the responsibilities of the federal government, which funds SNAP, and the states that administer the program.Here’s a timeline of events over 42 days since Congress failed to appropriate new funding for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1:Sept. 30, 2025: On the brink of the current shutdown, the Trump U.S. Department of Agriculture publishes a plan for how its various programs will be affected.

“All I know is love one another and be good to each other,” he said.
The centenarian was born in rural Sallis, in central Mississippi’s Attala County, on Sept. 18, 1923, the seventh of eight children. His father was a sharecropper, and he spent his childhood farming with his family and went to school part-time.
Anderson now lives  in Goodman in Holmes County. One of his daughters, Dorothy Falls, is retired and takes care of him. His home is right next to his two-acre garden and a restaurant owned by his son Ricky, called Rick’s Drive Inn. Anderson still spends time in his garden.

In 1943, Anderson was sent to Fort Eustis in Virginia for training after being drafted to the Army during World War II.
He said he spent six months in basic training and combat training. However, he was discharged after training and never saw combat. To this day, he doesn’t know why.
“They shipped everybody out but me,” he said. “I never did understand it. They didn’t tell me nothing. They just gave me a discharge.”
Anderson’s experience in training does provide him with a respect of the military. He said he wanted to express his appreciation to all veterans as they are honored on the national holiday.
After training, Anderson returned to being a farmer while also taking on various jobs across the country to support his wife, Annie Lou, and their eight children. He and Annie Lou married the same year he went to training.

Anderson’s jobs spanned from Memphis to Chicago and more. But he has always come back to his home state.
“I guess I like Mississippi better than I did anywhere else,” he said.
Anderson became a custodian and later bus driver at Goodman-Pickens Elementary School, retiring in 2005. He was ordained as a deacon in 1947. Annie Lou passed away in 1993, after 73 years of marriage. 
In 2023, the year Anderson turned 100 years old, the Mississippi House of Representatives adopted a resolution to honor him for his service.
The resolution says Anderson “shot the (large) 40MM guns and remained a steadfast and brave soldier for the United States of America.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/07141936/James-Anderson-1.jpg,,,2025-11-11 17:01:47.619149
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-11 21:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"With SNAP funding in flux, Hartford grocer worries of economic impact",P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/11/snap-funding-grocery-business-economy-ct/,"Federally-mandated changes to SNAP could push many shoppers off the rolls, creating uncertainty for small businesses like Grocery on Broad.","For the past year and a half, the Grocery on Broad has helped fill a gap for residents of Hartford’s Frog Hollow neighborhood. 
In an area known as a “food swamp”, where food can be purchased but quality and healthy items are limited, the nonprofit grocery store has become a key source for fresh produce, meat and pantry staples, enabling families to buy foods they once needed to travel out of Hartford to get.  
But the first week of November saw a change: fewer shoppers came in to make purchases at the beginning of the month, usually the busiest time for the small grocer. 
“There are definitely people who would normally be shopping who simply cannot,” said Ben Dubow, the executive director of Forge City Works, the nonprofit that operates the Grocery on Broad and Fire by Forge, a popular Hartford restaurant. 
The change in traffic was the result of the 42-day-long federal shutdown, the longest in U.S. history. As congressional lawmakers grapple with funding the government, the pause in funding is having significant effects on the national economy, with thousands of federal workers furloughed or working without pay, flights grounded due to staffing shortages, and consumer spending slowing down as discretionary money dries up. Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office found that the shutdown could cost the US economy as much as $14 billion.
For Dubow, some of the biggest difficulties and points of concern have come from changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Once known as food stamps, the federal nutrition program supports some 42 million Americans — including 360,000 Connecticut residents — who cannot afford food, by supplementing the grocery budgets of low-income workers or in some cases, covering food costs entirely.  
Federal funding for the program lapsed for the first time ever on Nov. 1, as the Trump administration argued that, with the shutdown in effect, it could not spend emergency funds to extend benefits into November.
With more than half of their shoppers reliant on SNAP, the lapse immediately raised concerns for Dubow and the staff of the Grocery on Broad. 
In the short term, Dubow said he’s worried about what lower shopping activity could mean for both consumers unable to pay for much-needed groceries and for the store’s inventory, especially the fresh items that have spent a little more time sitting on the shelf instead of being used in fresh meals. 
In the long term, he worries about what the lapse could mean for the economy, particularly the larger supply chain the store fits into.
“The food ecosystem is really complex and has a huge economic impact,” he said. “It helps create jobs and sustain jobs within an industry that actually can provide good jobs to people.” 
That concern over SNAP funding has transformed into a sense of uncertainty in recent days, as federal courts have weighed in on the Trump administration’s argument that it could not fund SNAP in November. That argument has been found lacking as courts have called for the program to be fully funded, even as the administration continues to push back on doing so. 
Connecticut officials meanwhile, recently ended their debate over the best way to plug the funding hole, with Gov. Ned Lamont announcing last week that the state would immediately restore funds for SNAP recipients, enabling them to fully use their benefits in November. That money has already been disbursed even as the Trump administration tries to pressure states into pulling the funding back.
Nationally, the matter could end soon: In the past 48 hours, a Senate majority has moved to end the shutdown, with the House expected to vote this week.  
Ending the shutdown would remove some of the worries that have weighed on Dubow recently. But more broadly, the community he’s working to serve still faces longstanding issues around food security and affordability, issues that have been amplified as inflation and tariffs continue to eat into consumer spending and as SNAP faces federally-mandated changes that could push millions of Americans off of the rolls in the coming months. 
The shutdown, he fears, could be a preview of issues likely to crop up in the future.  
“We’re asking people to sometimes make life-and-death type decisions about where they’re spending their very limited dollars in a world where everything’s getting more expensive,” he said.  
The SNAP lapse has had ripple effects on broader economy — including on those who aren’t in the program
In recent weeks economists have highlighted that SNAP affects more than those directly enrolled. 
That’s largely for two reasons. First, SNAP contributes a significant amount of the money spent at grocery stores nationwide — roughly $8 billion a month according to some estimates. Second, SNAP money is well-known to have something economists refer to as a multiplier effect: for every $1 of SNAP money spent, it produces somewhere between $1.50 and $1.80 in economic impact. 
Grocery stores are just one beneficiary of that impact. According to federal data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in 2023, SNAP benefits produced some $124 billion in sales at 262,000 retailers. Roughly half of that spending was at major retailers like Walmart, Kroger and Costco. An additional quarter was at supermarkets.  
SNAP has an even bigger impact on small independent grocery stores in rural or food insecure areas, which often have a limited customer base and narrow profit margins. The consistent spending of SNAP recipients at these stores can be the difference between them staying open or shutting down entirely.
The National Grocers Association, which represents independent community grocers, acknowledged as much in a statement released last month. “With SNAP fueling over 389,000 American jobs and generating $1.54 in economic activity for every dollar invested in the program, grocers’ staffing and inventory are planned around benefit cycles,” said NGA President Greg Ferrara. “A lapse in funding could lead to reduced employee hours, perishable food losses and declining sales.”
In a region like New England, where roughly $364 million dollars of SNAP funding circulates through the economy each month, that loss could be expensive as families tighten their budgets even further to pay for groceries. 
Even with restored SNAP benefits, headwinds remain
Restoring SNAP benefits won’t completely erase the issue. 
Food prices have risen considerably, roughly 3.2% from August 2024 to August 2025, according to federal data. That inflation, along with the continued impact of tariffs on imported goods, means that people are spending more to keep their pantries stocked.
At the Grocery on Broad, prices are kept in check through a sliding scale discount system where shoppers self-report their income and are then given a corresponding discount on items purchased at the store. Dubow notes that in recent months, more people are coming into the store to take advantage of the discounts, a sign he says of a growing difficulty affording things. 
And with the increased strain, Dubow notes that he is worried about the SNAP program. The program is slated for a number of changes as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law in July; New work requirements and a looming shift of some administrative costs from the federal government onto states could force millions of people out of the program. 
The pain is expected to be pronounced in Connecticut, with families in the state projected to lose an average of $200 a month in benefits under the changes — one of the hardest hits in the country. 
A recent analysis from The Hamilton Project, an economic policy initiative at the Brookings Institution, notes that the structural changes to SNAP will likely blunt the program’s ability to help the nation respond to recessions, as people will struggle to access benefits that could help them weather an economic downturn.
If that happens, the economic effects could be felt by a larger group than SNAP recipients alone — like the small businesses that serve many people who use SNAP to pay for food. 
For now, Dubow is focused on supporting his store’s patrons, and encouraging people across Hartford to take advantage of the Grocery on Broad. And he’s been encouraged by how the state government and a network of nonprofits and community organizations have addressed the funding lapse, working quickly to maintain access to food for vulnerable people in the state. 
But he said he hopes that as the immediate SNAP crisis nears its end, more people begin to see how valuable the program is. 
“This has targeted economic impact,” he said of SNAP. “When it goes away, the negative impact it has is not just on individuals who can’t eat and kids who can’t eat. It really impacts small businesses and farmers and the whole system.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WBC_5408.jpg,,,2025-11-11 17:01:47.619149

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s multi-billion dollar hemp industry is in jeopardy of collapsing due to federal legislation approved by the U.S. Senate on Monday night, and both proponents and critics are only now grasping the significance of what is at stake.
As part of the “continuing resolution” to reopen the federal government, the Senate has passed a measure that, according to a Senate Appropriations Committee bill summary, “Prevents the unregulated sale of intoxicating hemp-based or hemp-derived products, including Delta-8, from being sold online, in gas stations, and corner stores, while preserving CBD and industrial hemp products.”
If approved by the House of Representatives later this week and then signed by the president, the measure would go into effect in 365 days.
“Everyone in the hemp industry knew the government would eventually close or tighten the loophole, but I think many felt that there would be some form of working with the industry to effectively regulate,” says Zack Kobrin, a Fort Lauderdale attorney with the firm of Saul Ewing who works in the hemp and cannabis industry.
“The reaction from many is that they are surprised it was such a sudden and sweeping measure. I think for those that are cowboys, they will just maximize on making as much as they can until they can’t. I think for those hemp operators that were trying to work with regulators and trying to follow the rules, this will be a real blow.”
 ‘Big Cannabis’
Carlos Hermida, who runs two hemp shops in the Tampa Bay area, alleges that the alcohol and cannabis industries were successful in getting Congress to enact the legislation.
“It’s abundantly clear that the American Distilled Spirits Alliance, Beer Institute, Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S., Wine America, and Wine Institute — Big Alcohol combined with Big Cannabis, such as Trulieve & Curaleaf — have spent ridiculous amounts of money on lobbying to put tens of thousands of small business owners like myself out of the hemp industry for their own bottom line,” he said in a text message.
“The most un-American thing about all of this is the move towards total market control by a few rather than competition. Money in politics is destroying every aspect of commerce.”
Total sales from hemp businesses in Florida run in the billions of dollars, according to a 2023 analysis from Whitney Economics. That report said the industry employs approximately 104,000 workers earning in excess of $3.6 billion in annual wages.
That’s led in part to a growing rivalry between the hemp and cannabis industries in Florida that was exposed last year, after members of the hemp industry contributed financially to groups working to defeat a proposed constitutional amendment that would have legalized recreational cannabis in the state. A request for comment from Trulieve, the state’s biggest medical cannabis operator, was not returned.
When news of the proposal surfaced last month, Cornbread Hemp co-founder Jim Higdon urged Florida’s congressional delegation to defend Florida’s hemp economy.
“Florida’s hemp market supports thousands of jobs, from growers to beverage distributors,” he said in a press release on Oct. 6. “Banning hemp products would devastate that progress. We ask Florida’s congressional delegation to protect this legitimate, regulated industry that Floridians overwhelmingly support.”
Florida lawmakers passed a measure during the 2024 legislative session that would have banned the sale of Delta-8 and imposed regulations on other intoxicating hemp-derived products, a measure described by Kobrin at the time as “a massive blow to the industry.”
However, it was vetoed by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Anti-drug organizations in Florida are hailing the vote in the U.S. Senate.
“I’m extremely excited that they’re closing the loophole, because this has been going on since 2018 when the farm bill was first passed and left this gaping loophole where these products came in under the radar, and they’re proliferating in gas stations, smoke shops, convenience stores, and now I’m seeing in Circle K, specifically the THC beverages,” says Ellen Snelling with the Hillsborough County Anti-Drug Alliance.
“They’re everywhere, and I feel like they’re trying to normalize this hemp-THC, all because of a loophole.”
Snelling remains concerned, though, because if even the measure is signed into law by President Trump, it won’t take effect for another year.
“That’s a long time, because we’re still seeing children and adults going to the emergency room after ingesting these products, so I would like to see the state address it because even though they have some regulations in Florida, I don’t think they’re strong enough, because I’m still seeing very high-THC products in gas stations and convenience stores,” she said.
While Florida has not restricted hemp-derived THC products, Delta-8 THC has been banned in 17 states and severely restricted in seven more, according to the National Cannabis Industry Association.
The Legislature returned to Tallahassee earlier this year to once again tackle the issue. Speaker of the House Daniel Perez created a “combined workgroup” on hemp consisting of 24 members from two separate committees chaired by Rep. Michelle Salzman, R-Escambia County, that convened during the first week of the 2025 legislative session.
Members concluded after meeting three times that they did not want to pass any legislation that would kill what has become a billion-dollar-plus industry in the state, but they also agreed they needed to implement more regulations on the product.
However, unlike the 2024 session, they failed to produce any final bill for consideration, as there were significant differences between the House and Senate versions.
A state bill on hemp in 2026?
Salzman weighed in on the federal legislation Tuesday.
“I’m encouraged to see the Senate include hemp-related language as this bill moves to the U.S. House,” Salzman wrote on X. “My focus has always been on commonsense safeguards that protect Americans while supporting responsible industry. This is another step in that ongoing conversation, and I look forward to continued collaboration as the process moves forward.”
The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has conducted inspections of hemp retailers and manufacturers across the state this year to ensure compliance with child-protection standards for hemp products. A spokesperson for the agency declined to comment on the pending federal legislation.
Last month, 38 attorneys general from both political parties sent a letter to the Senate and House appropriation chairs calling on Congress to clarify the 2018 U.S. farm bill’s definition of hemp “to ensure intoxicating THC products are taken off the market.”
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier was not among them.
Kentucky U.S. Republican Sen. Rand Paul filed an amendment Monday to the continuing resolution package that would have stripped the hemp language, but it failed on a 76-24 vote.

(Photo courtesy of Consulate General of France in Atlanta)Before he sold furniture in South Carolina, Cecil Hart survived a German U-Boat attack and fought to liberate northern France during World War II.
For Hart’s service during the war, he received France’s highest honor in a ceremony earlier this year. Hart died Oct. 30, just over a month after receiving the medal, at 100 years old, said his son, Curtis Hart.
Originally from a cotton farm in Pacolet, a small town in Spartanburg County, Cecil Hart enlisted in the Army in 1943 as an ambulance driver.
“One day, he was working that farm, and the next day, he was in France,” his son, Curtis Hart, told the SC Daily Gazette on Tuesday.
Fighting in World War II
Growing up, all Curtis Hart knew about his father’s time in the war came from the military yearbooks his father kept. Although Hart asked his father questions about his service abroad, like many World War II veterans, he didn’t want to talk about it, Hart said.
That changed when Cecil Hart, in his 90s, went on an Honor Flight trip to Washington, D.C., his son said.
For years, Cecil Hart resisted a friend’s invitations to go on the trip because he didn’t like having too much attention on himself. Knowing how much Hart would get out of the trip, the friend finally told him, “You can go peacefully or another way,” Curtis Hart recalled.
During the several days Cecil Hart spent in D.C. with other veterans, he toured monuments and received thanks for his service. Cleaning out his father’s house over the past week, Curtis Hart found all the pamphlets and other memorabilia his father received on the trip, which was unusual for a man who didn’t much like clutter, he said.

“I think that was the first time in his life that he really realized what he’d been a part of,” Hart said.
After he came home, Cecil Hart began to talk a little more about his experiences during the war. But it was after he learned about the application for the Legion of Honor Medal that he really started to open up, Curtis Hart said.
“It brought back a lot of memories he had about the war,” Hart said. “Some were good, and some were not good.”
Curtis Hart thought many of his memories were better left forgotten, his son said. The veteran recalled having very little food to eat and seeing fellow soldiers suffering from illness and injuries.
At one point, Cecil Hart survived an attack from a German submarine that killed most of his division while crossing the English Channel, according to the Consulate General of France in Atlanta, which presented the award. He fought in northern France on D-Day, in an invasion that left an estimated 4,000 Allied troops dead, with more wounded or missing.
Hart left the Army in 1946, having earned the rank of private first class. He received a number of medals for his service, including a Good Conduct Medal, which recognizes excellent behavior and efficiency, according to the consulate.
Hart also received the WWII Victory Medal, which was given to all veterans who fought in the war; the American Theater Ribbon, given to soldiers in WWII who saw active combat or other dangerous conditions; and the European-African-Middle Eastern Theater Medal, for those who served in that area, with one Bronze Service Star, according to the consulate.
“We were very proud to be able to add a French Legion of Honor Medal to this list,” said Anne-Laure Desjonquères, the region’s consul general.
Even though his father often found it difficult to recount his experiences, Curtis Hart was grateful to learn more about his father. In the months leading up to the ceremony, the younger Hart listened to his father’s stories, taking notes so he would remember everything that happened.
To see his father recognized “meant a tremendous amount to us, mainly for his sake,” Hart said. “We were really happy for him.”
The Legion of Honor Medal
Cecil Hart’s daughter-in-law accepted the medal on his behalf during a Sept. 12 ceremony on Hilton Head Island because Hart, who died of congenital heart failure, was too sick to attend. The consulate tailors ceremonies to each veteran’s wishes, and Hart asked for a small recognition with friends and family, Desjonquères said.

The award, which Napoleon Bonaparte established in 1802, recognizes both French citizens and foreign nationals who contributed to France or upheld its ideals. For about 20 years, French officials have worked to track down World War II veterans who fought on French soil to recognize their part in ending the war, Desjonquères said.
“Our objective is to show that France doesn’t forget what it owes to the veterans who fought to liberate our country and Europe,” Desjonquères said.
Notable recipients of the award include Dwight Eisenhower, the World War II general and U.S. president; and Josephine Baker, the performer, World War II spy and Civil Rights Movement activist.
For the most part, the consulate hears about veterans through word of mouth, Desjonquères said.
In Hart’s case, Best Defense Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to supporting military veterans, let the consulate know that Hart might be eligible for the award, she said.
A consulate employee reached out to Hart’s family and began processing an application for Hart to receive the award. Each application undergoes a vetting process to ensure the veteran really did fight in France, which is sometimes as simple as looking at discharge records and sometimes requires reviews of old photographs or first-person accounts, Desjonquères said.
When it comes to those who fought in World War II, the consulate works as quickly as possible, keeping in mind veterans’ advanced ages, she said.
An estimated 45,000 of the more than 16 million Americans who fought in the war were still alive going into 2025, according to the National WWII Museum in New Orleans.
Around 750 of those veterans live in South Carolina, the museum estimated.
Life after the war
Just as abruptly as Cecil Hart headed to France in 1943, he went straight back to work in South Carolina, Curtis Hart said.
For a while, Cecil Hart had a job hauling feed and seed in Spartanburg, his son said. There, he met his lifelong wife, then Betty Crosby, who walked past on her way to and from her office every day.  Hart was embarrassed every time he saw her because he was always dirty from the hard work, their son said. The two remained together for 63 years, until she died in 2009.
Eventually, Hart got a job selling furniture and dedicated the rest of his life to that career. He opened Stuckey Brothers & Hart Furniture in Beaufort with a friend in 1965, then gradually expanded to four stores in Spartanburg and Beaufort counties, Curtis Hart said.
“He was one of those guys that that was all he did,” said the son, who lives on Hilton Head Island. “He didn’t play golf. He didn’t have a hobby. The furniture store was his hobby.”
Even after Cecil Hart sold the stores so he could retire, he continued helping out at his son’s furniture store, his son said. He stayed remarkably healthy, living independently and regularly driving across the state even at the age of 100, Curtis Hart said. For all 70 years of his life, he received nothing but unconditional love from his parents, he said.
“I was very fortunate for him to be my dad,” Hart said. “We had an incredible relationship.”
Tantamount to all else in Cecil Hart’s life was his faith. Hart was an active member of multiple Baptist churches during his lifetime, most recently First Baptist Church of Hilton Head Island. He believed that if he lived a humble and helpful life, he would spent eternity in heaven, Curtis Hart said.
“We rejoice in that, that he’s in heaven today and we will see him again,” Hart said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/67EED0C9-972A-4F4F-8C93-F6B9216571D4remotecf7dd2842915fa92e754221ecde1ae8921811c86-1-original-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-11 17:01:47.619149

But it wasn’t until the state legislative auditor, Michael Waguespack, informed the New Orleans City Council in October that the deficit was in the range of 160 million dollars that the degree of the crisis became clear.
To meet the city charter requirement of submitting a balanced budget by the end of the year, the City Council is currently negotiating a loan from state officials. The loan would be repaid over six months. As a condition of receiving the loan, the council will need to agree to greater financial oversight from the state.
In addition to acquiring the loan, the council is considering cost-cutting measures including layoffs, furloughs, and cuts to city services.
While it will be necessary to make structural changes in city government to eliminate waste and improve efficiency, too many cuts in vital services such as sanitation, police, and street maintenance will reduce the quality of life for residents.
If the city is to maintain basic services for its residents, it cannot cut its way out of a crisis. It needs to grow its way out of a crisis. The best way to reduce a budget deficit is to bring in new revenue. Since voters don’t trust the city government to manage the tax revenue they are receiving now, there is no chance the voters would agree to increased property tax or sales tax rates.
The only reliable way to increase tax revenue coming into the city coffers is to grow the economy and attract new business into the city. To avoid future deficits, the city will need to diversify its economy beyond the traditional reliance on tourism, hospitality and river port operations.

From a marketing perspective, if you want to dominate a market, you need to be the first, the best, or the biggest. It is even better to offer a product or service that is unique, or at least rare.
Many public officials talk about the need for economic diversification. But few give specific or concrete proposals. I’ll give one here.
Corporations conduct location analysis before considering moving to a new city. In addition to factors such as crime, schools, traffic, airline flights, and cultural resources, a major factor they analyze is vulnerability to disasters. Companies don’t want to put their employees and physical assets at risk.
While the flood control infrastructure has greatly improved since Katrina, New Orleans still gets low marks on vulnerability, and this hurts its competitiveness. New Orleans should not only have infrastructure to withstand the next hurricane, but flood control systems to guard against the common neighborhood flooding that still happens during a heavy thunderstorm.
The city has a large critical mass of civil and environmental engineers, hydrologists, urban planners, architects, and construction managers who are experts in flood control. They are spread out among private industry and university sectors. If given sufficient government authority, they have the knowledge to solve the flood control issues.
However, the key here is not only to solve the vulnerability problem to make the city a more attractive business location. The key is to also market and sell these solutions.
The example that New Orleans should follow is not Houston or Atlanta. It is Amsterdam. The capital city of the Netherlands is located below sea level and has a history of catastrophic flooding. However, over the last 50 years or so, Amsterdam turned this weakness into a strength and then a product and service to be sold.
Through specific green infrastructure strategies, (Amsterdam constructed more canals than Venice), the city’s engineering and construction firms solved their own flood control problems, then began strategically marketing these services to other cities and private industry.
Amsterdam, a city culturally similar to New Orleans in terms of tourism, hospitality, and port operations, created an entire niche industry around civil engineering and construction firms that specialize in flood control and coastal restoration. These firms employ tens of thousands of people and generate billions in revenue.
An incentive program to attract those types of firms to New Orleans, and hold the ones we have here, would help create a U.S. niche, capitalizing on unique expertise that we already possess locally.
This is one economic growth idea. There are many other innovative ideas floating around the city. The point is that we need to focus our energy on growing the total size of the pie, rather than only focusing on which pieces we should cut.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Most of New Jersey’s House delegation opposes the stopgap funding bill expected to come before them on Wednesday that would end the record-breaking federal government shutdown.
Seven of the state’s nine House Democrats said they will vote against the funding package, and another two have issued statements critical of it because it would not extend subsidies for health care plans bought on the individual marketplace. Premiums for those plans will rise 174% next year if the tax credits expire before 2026 as planned, state officials have said.
Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11), who was elected governor of New Jersey last week, on Sunday said the deal would force New Jerseyans to pay more for health care.
“Making this deal is malpractice — we have more than 9 million people in New Jersey who are counting on us to fight for them, and instead Washington is putting them in harm’s way. Not on my watch,” Sherrill said.
Democrats jockey to replace Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill in Congress

It’s unclear whether Sherrill will travel to Washington, D.C., to cast a vote on the funding bill. The first in a series of votes to consider the measure is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. The U.S. Senate approved it in a 60-40 vote on Monday.
Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-05) said it’s a “serious concern” that the bill does not include the extended subsidies, but he has not said whether he will vote against the measure. 
“If Congress fails to act, 4 million Americans will lose their health care because they just can’t afford their premiums. That’s unacceptable,” Gottheimer said Monday.
The other seven Democrats in New Jersey’s House delegation have said they will vote against the deal.
“All Americans deserve access to affordable, quality health care. Full stop. This deal doesn’t deliver the results that Americans are rightfully demanding and if it comes to the House, I will be a hard no,” Rep. Rob Menendez (D-08) said Sunday.
Both of New Jersey’s senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, voted no on the measure Monday.

(Photo by Amanda Watford/Stateline)The Federal Communications Commission voted to roll back limits on how much companies can charge incarcerated people and their families for phone and video calls.
The 2-1 vote in late October reverses rate caps the FCC adopted last year under a 2023 law that allows the agency to set limits on prison phone and video call rates. Critics say the rates are kept high by limited competition among major providers such as Securus Technologies and ViaPath.
Under the new interim rules, phone calls will cost up to $0.11 per minute in large prisons and $0.18 per minute in the smallest jails. Video calls will cost up to $0.23 per minute in large facilities and as much as $0.41 in small ones.
Only three states — Florida, Kentucky and Oklahoma — currently have rates above the new rates, meaning most prison systems across the country are already below the previously adopted 2024 rate caps.
The new 2025 rates will take effect 120 days after being published in the Federal Register.

In June, the FCC had abruptly announced a two-year delay in implementing the 2024 rate caps after receiving complaints from local sheriffs and prison telecom companies. Republican attorneys general from 14 states also filed a lawsuit last year challenging the commission’s authority to limit how much prisons and jails can charge for phone calls, arguing that the rules deprived correctional facilities of needed funding.
Republican Commissioners Brendan Carr and Olivia Trusty, both appointed by President Donald Trump, supported the rollback. Carr argued the previous caps limited facilities’ ability to recover safety and security costs, such as monitoring calls, leading some to scale back or eliminate calling services altogether. Trusty said the 2024 rules “did not always strike the right balance,” and cited “unintended consequences” like service disruptions in some facilities.
At least one small jail — in Baxter County, Arkansas — ended phone services earlier this year in protest of the lower rate caps.
Democratic Commissioner Anna Gomez, appointed by President Joe Biden, voted against the order and called it “indefensible.” She said the decision gives monopoly telecom providers “the authority to increase the costs for families to maintain critical connections with their loved ones in prison.”
New York becomes latest state to offer free phone calls in prisons

Advocates for incarcerated people condemned the vote.
“These changes are a betrayal of the families who entrusted the FCC to protect them from the notoriously predatory correctional telecom industry,” Bianca Tylek, the executive director of Worth Rises, said in a news release. Worth Rises is a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the prison industry.

Some research suggests that incarcerated people who maintain consistent contact with loved ones are significantly more likely to succeed upon release and are less likely to reoffend.
The FCC’s latest decision comes months after New York joined California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Minnesota in offering free phone calls in state prisons. Colorado’s policy won’t take full effect until 2026.
At least two states — Maryland and Missouri — considered legislation this year to make prison and jail calls more affordable. Maryland’s proposal to make calls free in state prisons did not pass, but Missouri enacted a law in August capping phone call rates at no more than 12 cents per minute in correctional centers.

(Photo by Paul Souders/Getty Images)Ever since serving on Governor Palin’s Mitigation Advisory Group back in 2007, almost twenty years ago, I’ve been engaged in the pressing challenge of addressing climate change. I knew back then as I watched the Mendenhall Glacier rapidly retreat, that climate change was very real and that the trajectory for devastating impacts only went in one direction. I also understood the steepness of the rise in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and how our capacity to flatten the curve rests with our ability to rapidly reduce emissions. While many countries have made much progress in transitioning to renewable energy and in increasing energy efficiency, the world is still barreling toward the warming threshold of 2.0-degrees Celsius that was set by 194 countries in the Paris Agreement. Sadly, Typhoon Halong is the latest devastating storm related to climate change in Alaska. It strikes at the heart of Alaska.
The present disaster is hard for Alaskans, and has me thinking again of ways we can forestall such tragedies. I’ve written before about how reducing methane emissions in the state is a way Alaskans can make a difference in the face of a global threat. The present disaster returns me to that hope.
As noted by an article in the Alaska Beacon, researchers recently completed a comprehensive climate impact study that looked specifically at the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. The article summarized the study’s findings: “Coastal erosion, permafrost thaw, sea-level rise, intrusion of saltwater into freshwater systems – are combining with storm surges to dramatically transform the coastal area, damaging communities and the food resources that have sustained Yup’ik people for centuries.” The evacuation of some 1,500 residents of villages including Kipnuk and Kwigillingok confirm this tragic conclusion that climate change is disrupting life in an area that defines the essence and richness of village life in Alaska. It saddens me deeply. 
A 2021 marine heatwave triggered  the loss of 10 billion snow crabs and the closure of the once-lucrative Bering Sea crab fisheries. Now we know that warming seas are the culprit behind the crash of chum salmon on the Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers. From the Yukon to Kodiak, from the Arctic to Ketchikan, Alaska’s coastal fisheries must now confront the dual threat of heat waves and ocean acidification.  
Knowing this on top of learning that village life in the entire Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta is facing an existential threat makes me feel like Frodo in Lord of the Rings. Looking out at the devastation of war, Frodo laments being the ring bearer and says, “I wish it need not have happened in my time.” That’s exactly how I feel when staring down the painful reality of climate change in Alaska. In the movie, Gandalf replies, “So do I and so do all who live to see such times. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.” 
Even though Alaska alone cannot solve the climate crisis and save Alaska’s Native villages, we can do one key thing in the time that is given to us. Alaska can make a big difference by addressing methane leaks. Methane, also known as natural gas waste, traps 80 times more heat than carbon-dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere. It is also important because industrial emissions from Alaska’s oil and gas operations account for approximately 60 percent of Alaska’s total 2019 greenhouse emissions. Altogether, I take this to mean that even though Alaska’s total emission contribution may be small on the global scale, Alaska can still make a significant difference because we have plenty of methane. 
According to research done by a team of scientists from the Environmental Defense Fund and several U.S. universities, halving methane emissions by 2030 could slow the rate of global warming by more that 25 percent and start a path to prevent an additional .5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100. Furthermore, according to the International Energy Agency, the oil and gas industry could eliminate around 70 percent of its methane emissions with existing and well-known technology. Taken all together this means that taking action on methane is not only hugely significant in addressing the climate crisis but eminently doable. 
By statute, the state considers any non-emergency release of oil and gas through venting or flaring in excess of one hour as potential “waste.” Consequently, we already have one key tool in the toolbox. Now would be the time for the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to take its statutory obligation seriously and begin reining in non-emergency flaring and venting of methane. Some people think that flaring methane doesn’t happen on the North Slope, but here’s a satellite image showing large volumes of methane flaring.  

Untitled document-2 
As I read about the disruption to Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, I am reminded that reducing methane emissions is what we could do with the time that is given us.

(Screenshot)The Washington-based anti-tax Club for Growth is trying again to turn up the pressure on Indiana’s Republican legislators to support a new round of congressional redistricting.
The organization announced Tuesday it would be airing a 30-second ad on TV network stations and Fox News in Indianapolis this week.
That is just ahead of lawmakers returning to the Statehouse on Nov. 18 for their annual Organization Day meeting — and the Dec. 1 start of a two-week redistricting debate amid uncertainty over whether enough Republican legislators support redrawing the maps they approved four years ago.
The new TV ad leads with news video about Gov. Mike Braun calling a special session for redistricting and mentions the redistricting action in the Democratic-led states of California, Illinois and Virginia.
It does not mention that President Donald Trump started the fight by pushing Texas Republicans to redraw its congressional map to squeeze out more GOP-friendly districts ahead of the 2026 elections. The ad also doesn’t include Republican redistricting moves in Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina.
Supporters want Indiana lawmakers to craft a map with all nine Indiana congressional districts favoring Republicans based on 2020 census data. The current split is 7-2 in favor of the GOP.
Club for Growth President David McIntosh
The Club for Growth ad urges viewers to call an Indiana Senate phone number and tell legislators to “stand with Trump, pass new maps now.”
The organization did not reply to a request from Indiana Capital Chronicle for an interview about its pro-redistricting ad, which follows a similar one about a month ago.
Club for Growth President David McIntosh told The Indianapolis Star that it had already spent more than $1 million to support Republican redistricting efforts across the country.
McIntosh said the group is “going to spend what it takes” to boost the current 7-2 Republican advantage in Indiana’s U.S. House delegation.
“Our message is, to the Republicans, man up and get in the game,” he told the Star.
McIntosh was an eastern Indiana congressman in the 1990s and was the unsuccessful 2000 Republican nominee for governor.
The Club for Growth inserted itself into Indiana politics in early 2023 by criticizing former Gov. Mitch Daniels as an insufficiently conservative “old guard Republican” as the organization sought to keep him from challenging then-U.S. Rep. Jim Banks for the 2024 GOP nomination for a U.S. Senate seat.
A group called Fair Maps Indiana, which has deep ties to Trump, launched this week what it called a six-figure advertising effort in favor of the redistricting push. That includes digital, cellphone, television and mail ads.
The pro-redistricting campaigns come as a recent statewide poll of 800 registered voters, 51% didn’t want redistricting now — with 45% “strongly” opposed. About 39% supported the prospect, but just 23% “strongly” backed it.
The poll was sponsored by the group Indiana Conservation Voters, which has led an anti-redistricting campaign since soon after the possibility emerged in August with Vice President JD Vance’s first of two trips to the state to push the issue.
Megan Robertson, the executive director of Indiana Conservation Voters, called the pro-redistricting campaigns the product of Washington consultants trying to stir up voter anger.
“People are fired up and they’re fired up about this redistricting scheme because they see it for what it is, which is cheating,” Robertson told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “You got a bunch of guys from Washington, D.C., trying to bully our legislators and Hoosiers are telling them not to do it.”

Sears,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/11/11/budget-concerns-resurface-as-state-faces-projected-1-4-billion-gap-for-coming-year/,"Lawmakers will be briefed Wednesday on a $1.4 billion budget gap they could face as they head into the 2026 legislative session, roughly times larger than the amount predicted in April.","Legislative budget analysts are warning of a $1.4 billion budget gap for fiscal 2027, driven by federal economic policies, that is projected to grow to almost $4 billion over the next five years. (Chart courtesy Department of Legislative Services)Lawmakers will be briefed Wednesday on a $1.4 billion budget gap they could face as they head into the 2026 legislative session, roughly times larger than the amount predicted in April.
The briefing for House and Senate fiscal committees by the Department of Legislative Services blames the projected cash shortfall on national economic pressures, chiefly inflation and the rising costs of goods and services to state government as well as the ever-increasing costs of Medicaid. Additionally, the state is seeing other costs driven by tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on imported goods.
The new comes after a 2025 legislative session where Gov. Wes Moore (D) and the General Assembly were able to close a $3.3 billion structural deficit through a combination of one-time fund transfers, tax increases and budget cuts. When they wrapped up the session in April, they expected the conversation over the fiscal 2027 budget would include a manageable $300 million structural deficit.
State fiscal leaders said the new numbers are clearly concerning, but they also caution that this is just the first in a series of economic forecasts before they have to settle on a fiscal 2027 budget.

“What they’re going to present tomorrow is sort of the worst-case scenario, literally at a point in time,” Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) said in an interview.
House Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) said fiscal leaders are “sort of surprised, but we’re sort of not.”
“We did what we could do in Maryland to resolve this for fiscal ’27 but we don’t control the national climate, and we don’t control all the fiscal uncertainty that our nation, frankly, is facing,” Barnes said.
The numbers presented tomorrow are subject to change. The Board of Revenue Estimates will update its revenue forecasts in December and again in March.
“The whole thing is concerning — losing up to $1.5 billion in revenue based on the negative actions of a federal government,” Barnes said. “It’s not just concerning that we’ve lost the $1.5 billion. It’s pretty concerning that they’ve [the Trump administration] only been in office 10 months.
“I think it’s something we’re all just going to have to hedge and do our best and try to continue to protect the programs that get to people and help people and sustain us over these next few years,” he said.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) on Tuesday said Democrats were once again “blaming the Trump administration for Maryland’s growing fiscal disaster.”
“The truth is, this crisis was created here at home — by reckless spending, failed leadership and political posturing,” Hershey said. “Instead of confronting the state’s looming multibillion-dollar deficit, the governor is consumed with national politics and partisan redistricting schemes.”
The impact of the federal government shutdown, now in its seventh week, is not included in the briefing documents reviewed by Maryland Matters, and may not be fully known until the Board of Revenue Estimates releases a final estimate in March.
The new projections do account for the expected loss of state revenue due to an increase in the deduction for state and local taxes that was part of a signature tax package proposed by President Donald Trump and passed by a Republican-led Congress this summer.
House Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel). (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
A 2017 law passed during Trump’s first term set the deduction at $10,000, which benefited Maryland to the tune of about $300 million more each year.
The new deduction — $40,000 — erases that advantage. The Board of Revenue Estimates in September projected the state will lose $118 million in the current year as a result of the change, more than $71 million in fiscal 2027 and another $30 million the following year.
Revenues begin to tick up for three years starting in fiscal 2029, but nowhere near the amount to offset the $300 million annual gain under the 2017 law.
The Board of Revenue Estimates projected a small 1.7% increase in revenue for fiscal 2027. Weeks later the record-setting federal government shutdown began. The briefing documents also note that Maryland has lost more federal jobs this year because of federal workforce reductions than any other state.
The combination is causing many to be pessimistic about the Board of Revenue Estimates December update, the last revenue forecast before Moore delivers the budget to the legislature in January.
An ever-expanding decade-long set of K-12 education reforms, known as the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, will exhaust a trust fund account that had been set up to fund the reforms. Those costs will drive billions in projected out year deficits. The program will then have to either be pared back or paid for using billions in general fund revenues or higher taxes.
One solution likely not on the table in an election year is a discussion of tax increases or other so-called “revenue enhancements.”
The state has a rainy day fund of roughly $2.3 billion, about $800 million more than the 5% required by law. The 73-page briefing report notes that lawmakers could reduce the deficit by using $815 million in rainy day funds, a one-time fix that does not resolve the gaps that grow over the next five years of the forecast.
But dipping into the fund brings its own share of concerns. First, there is a looming budget crunch forecast for post-election fiscal 2028, when the structural budget deficit is projected to be nearly $3.2 billion. It grows from there to nearly $3.5 billion in fiscal 2029 and roughly $4 billion in fiscal 2030 and 2031.
Additionally, there are constant concerns about how bond rating agencies will view tapping the fund.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Maryland boasted for more than 50 years about a triple-A bond rating from the three bond rating housed, but that changed this spring when Moody’s downgraded the state’s credit rating. Two other firms — Fitch and Standard & Poor’s — continued to give the state their highest rating. Both raised concerns about the costs of state government programs, including the Blueprint and pensions.
There are also concerns about the potential for a recession.
Mark Zandy, a national economist who has consulted with the General Assembly, listed Maryland among nearly two dozen states that are in danger of falling into recession if not already in one. That analysis was released prior to the ongoing federal government shutdown.
The report will also contain roughly $700 million in deficiency spending. The amount is spread over two years, fiscal 2025 and the current year. Barnes and Guzzone said higher than expected ending budget figures for fiscal 2025 coupled with a cash surplus will erase that gap.
“Generally, I am optimistic. I certainly know that we’ll figure it out,” Guzzone said. “Some of these things are out of our control. They will be what they will be, and we will work hard and figure it out, and we will have a balanced budget, and that I know.”

Bryant pleaded guilty in 2008 to killing three people and shooting another during a string of 2004 burglaries primarily in Sumter County. In a last-ditch appeal in state court, Bryant’s attorneys argued his original attorneys did not present evidence that his mother’s heavy drinking while pregnant and childhood sexual abuse affected Bryant’s development.
Bryant’s attorneys argued that evidence may have been enough to change the sentencing judge’s mind in giving Bryant the death penalty for one of the three killings.
The state’s highest court disagreed.
Bryant’s original attorneys told the judge about the sexual abuse Bryant survived as a child, as well as his struggles in school and his history of addiction and other mental health issues, reads a Monday order signed by all five justices.
Experts testified that Bryant’s use of insecticide-sprayed marijuana and methamphetamines caused brain damage and that he was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder during the time of his crimes. Questions about whether Bryant’s mother drank heavily during her pregnancy with him, hindering his development, came up during Bryant’s sentencing. However, his mother refused to tell even his attorneys whether that was true, according to the order.
Without cooperation from Bryant’s mother, testing for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder likely would have come back inconclusive. Even if Bryant did receive a diagnosis, it would do little to bolster his case, since other mental health issues likely impaired him in similar ways, the justices wrote.
The brutality in the killing that led to Bryant’s death sentence outweighed his state of mind at the time, the order reads.
“By any stretch, (Bryant) demonstrated a high level of planning, decision making, and calculation in the course of his eight-day spree,” the justices wrote.
During those eight days, Bryant broke into multiple homes, stealing guns and ammunition along with electronics and money. He shot a fisherman, Clinton Brown, in the back, though Brown survived. Bryant picked up two victims, Cliff Gainey and Chris Burgess, in his truck before shooting them and leaving their bodies by the side of the road. Bryant received life sentences for their murders.

In the middle of his crime spree, Bryant broke into the Sumter County home of 62-year-old Willard Tietjen and shot Tietjen to death. Bryant used Tietjen’s computer, smoked his cigars and cigarettes, and answered his phone to tell Tietjen’s wife and daughter he had killed Tietjen, according to court documents.
Police found Tietjen’s body with cigarette burns on it, including in his eyes. Bryant left notes written on the walls, including, “Victim number four in two weeks, catch me if you can,” with some letters written in blood, according to court records.
That was the crime that caused a judge to sentence Bryant to death.
Unless a higher court or the governor intervenes, Bryant will be the third person in the state put to death by firing squad since legislators added the option in 2021. He will be the seventh executed in the state since the process resumed in September 2024, following an unintended 13-year hiatus.











Nationwide, there have been 41 people executed so far in 2025, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. At least six more, including Bryant, are expected to be put to death before the end of the year.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-11-11 16:03:32.212983

Three years ago, the trio became United States Citizens. His two youngest children were born in the United States and were already citizens.
“It’s important to honor the veterans,” Francois said, telling the Phoenix why he was at the parade. He shared that shortly after becoming a U.S. citizen he went to enlist in the U.S. Army Reserves. But he was nearly 40 years old at the time, beyond the 37-year-old age cut off.

Hundreds of people lined up along Monroe Street to watch the parade. Not everyone was there for the parade, though. Petitioner gatherers with clip boards in hand looked for registered voters willing to sign a proposed constitutional amendment to allow adults to recreationally use marijuana. And some parade onlookers were selling food, including hot boiled peanuts, two bags for $10.
The parade featured Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps from area high schools as well as high school marching bands and Florida State University’s Marching 100.

“Unexpected” pardon puts to rest what has become an ordeal in and out of the court over transgression in Grand Teton National Park. “IT’S FINALLY OVER,” Sunseri posts.
The post Trump pardons Grand Teton speed-runner Michelino Sunseri’s shortcutting offense appeared first on WyoFile .","The ordeal over Michelino Sunseri’s 2024 shortcut on the Grand Teton — which spurred a federal trial and garnered Congressional notice — came to an unexpected conclusion Monday when President Donald Trump pardoned the speed runner. 
It was an appropriately unexpected ending to an incident that snowballed into something Sunseri never could have imagined, he noted in a Monday Facebook post alongside images of the pardon.
“Seriously. You can’t make this stuff up,” he wrote. “It’s only fitting that something this absurd from the start ends in an equally surreal way.⁣”
Sunseri was attempting an out-and-back speed record on the 13,775-foot crown of the Teton Range on Labor Day 2024 when he cut a switchback,  opting to take what some call the “old climber’s trail” down the mountain. 
That choice proved hugely consequential. Because of it, the arbiter of alpine speed records, Fastest Known Time, refused to acknowledge Sunseri’s scorching 2:50:50 time as the new record. The trail transgression ignited a high-profile debate about alpine-sport ethics and what constitutes overcriminalization in national parks. Park rangers cited Sunseri, which led to a two-day trial in a federal courthouse in Jackson.

Sunseri’s legal team also did extensive advocacy to raise awareness of what they say are outsized penalties for federal misdemeanors. That included talks with Wyoming’s U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, who agreed that cases like Sunseri’s represent a problem of overcriminalization that Trump targeted in a May executive order. 
Those efforts resulted in Sunseri’s case landing on Trump’s radar, defense attorney Alex Rienzie said. Still, the pardon was unexpected, he said. 
“I feel happy for Michelino,” Rienzie said. “He can finally put this behind him and we can all move on to more productive pursuits.”
Sunseri echoed that sentiment. 
“I’m absolutely, incredibly grateful,” he said on Facebook. “But, it never should’ve gotten this far.⁣ This case was a massive waste of taxpayer money and government energy from the start — something that should’ve easily been resolved back in September 2024 when I offered community service to close the trail for good. Unfortunately, instead of working with me, the system tried to make an example of me.”
The shortcut felt around the world
During his speed attempt, Sunseri cut a switchback to avoid hikers on the designated route. He described his decision in a Strava report shortly after the feat, writing that “If I had to make this choice again, I would 100% make the exact same choice.” 
Some previous record holders also had taken that shortcut, but Sunseri was the first to face formal consequences. Fastest Known Time rejected his submission due to the offense. Shortly after, Grand Teton National Park rangers cited him for violating 36CFR2.1(b), which prohibits “leaving a trail or walkway to shortcut between portions of the same trail or adjacent trail in the national park.” The citation carries a maximum penalty of $5,000 and six months in jail.
Grand Teton rangers have reportedly struggled for years to keep people off of the old climber’s trail, a faint singletrack with small signs near the top and bottom that read “short cutting causes erosion” and “closed for regrowth.”

Supporters of ultra runner Michelino Sunseri have created stickers, T-shirts and music videos under the label #freemichelino to protest what they say is an over-harsh penalty for his switchback-cutting infraction on the Grand Teton.

When offered a plea bargain of a misdemeanor conviction, a five-year ban from the national park and a fine, Sunseri opted to challenge the charges. The penalties were too steep, he argued. That led to the May trial.
Meanwhile, the court of public opinion also weighed in. Sunseri supporters made T-shirts, stickers and social media posts accusing the National Park System of a heavy hand. Others, including Jackson Hole athletes, said Sunseri was setting a poor example of trail stewardship as a sponsored athlete.
Over the day-and-a-half trial, which unfolded in the Clifford P. Hansen Federal Courthouse in Jackson before Magistrate Judge Stephanie Hambrick, eight witnesses took the stand. They included professional athletes and older climbers who had scaled the peak hundreds of times, park rangers and a trails management expert. 
A fitting punishment?
During the trial, attorneys zeroed in on the historic conversation around and use of the switchback-cutting route; the procedures by which park rangers discern whether a citation is appropriate; the private conversations Sunseri had regarding his route and the semantics around trails considered either “established,” “maintained” or “designated.” 
The lawyers’ arguments centered on whether the Park Service properly notified the public of the closure and fairly cited Sunseri.
In a September decision, Hambrick sided with the prosecution when she determined the trail closure was valid and the park properly communicated the closure, and thus Sunseri was guilty.
Sunseri’s team appealed that ruling, arguing the decision gives park superintendents power well beyond what the Constitution affords them. 
But on the eve of sentencing, Sunseri’s team struck a deal with newly appointed U.S. Attorney for Wyoming Darin Smith. The deal would dismiss the misdemeanor charge from Sunseri’s record if he completed community service and an educational class.

“U.S. Attorneys have discretion to make prosecutorial decisions based on what they feel is in the best interest of the public and the justice system, without consideration of outside influences,” read a statement Smith’s office sent to WyoFile in October. “This decision is not a rejection or criticism of the good work of the National Park Service, the Court, or the parties in this matter. It is an evolution of what is right and was made to preserve prosecutive and judicial resources while upholding the best interests of the public and the justice system.”
Hageman had previously voiced her opinion that agreed Sunseri’s proposed penalties did not match the crime. Along with Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, she penned a July letter to acting U.S. Attorney Stephanie Sprecher stating that Sunseri’s “prosecution appears to be a prime example of the problem of overcriminalization.”
New routes
The pardon does not automatically trigger a reversal of FTK’s decision on the Grand speed record. It’s an independent arbiter that rejected the record before rangers issued a citation. 
For now, Andy Anderson still holds the men’s FKT record for the Grand Teton for his 2012 effort, when he ran and scrambled the 13.2 miles and 7,064 feet of elevation gain in 2:32:02. Jan Maus, meanwhile, broke the women’s record in August with a time of 3:45:34.
Fastest Known Time, however, has updated language on its Grand Teton entry page to emphasize what it calls the “Modern Route” up and down the mountain. The route, which both Anderson and Maus followed, does not use the old climber’s trail. 
“The Jenny Lake Rangers now prefer that runners stick to designated and maintained trails (where available), which aligns with this Modern Route,” the page reads. “FastestKnownTime indicated it will not accept future submissions using the Historical Route, though it remains an integral part of the mountain’s history and lore.”

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune)A Utah judge’s late-night court order Monday sparked celebration from anti-gerrymandering groups and Democrats, striking down the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature’s congressional map and replacing it with one that would include a single Democratic-leaning district and three Republican-leaning districts. 
But Utah’s redistricting battle is far from over — and it may boil over into an even uglier clash with the state’s judiciary. 
Barely 20 minutes after 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson’s order was released, with her decision going public shortly before midnight, a GOP Utah lawmaker announced on social media that he would launch an effort to remove her from the bench. 
“I have opened a bill to file articles of impeachment against Judge Gibson for gross abuse of power, violating the separation of powers and failing to uphold her oath of office to the Utah Constitution,” Rep. Matt MacPherson, R-West Valley City, posted on X. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

Under Utah law, elected officials and judges can only be impeached for “high crimes and misdemeanors or malfeasance in office.” Any impeachment proceedings would be required to start in the House.
Gibson was appointed in 2018 by then-Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, and confirmed unanimously by the GOP-supermajority Utah Senate. At the time, on the Senate floor, Sen. Todd Weiler — chair of the Senate Judicial Confirmation Committee — quipped lightheartedly that he was told “by one of the smarter attorneys I know (that) ‘if we didn’t confirm her we were all a bunch of idiots,’” and he said he agreed. 
It’s too soon to say whether MacPherson’s effort will gain enough traction to survive both the House and Senate — but what was clear Tuesday was the Utah Republican Party and its member legislators were furious with Gibson’s order, accusing her of violating the Utah Constitution, which they continue to argue clearly requires the Legislature to carry out redistricting duties. 
Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders — Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and House Speaker Mike Schultz — didn’t go so far as to directly promise impeachment proceedings, but they issued a joint statement strongly condemning Gibson’s ruling. 
“Late last night, a single unelected judge set aside the Utah Constitution and the voice of Utah voters, selecting a map drawn behind closed doors by out-of-state advocacy groups,” Adams and Schultz said. “The process the judge chose denied the people of Utah a chance to see it, to weigh in, or to be heard. The judge disregarded the Constitution to select a clearly gerrymandered map. This is not fair to Utahns and is deeply disappointing.”
While they argue the map drawn by plaintiffs and chosen by the court was “clearly gerrymandered” to favor Democrats, Gibson in her order concluded from more than 1,000 pages of evidence and hours of public expert testimony that the Legislature’s map “is an extreme partisan outlier — more Republican than over 99% of expected maps drawn without political consideration.”

She also concluded that lawmakers’ retained expert drew the map with “partisan political data on display” in violation of a voter-approved law meant to protect against gerrymandering.
Schultz and Adams, however, argued “this isn’t how government should work.” 
“Our system depends on transparency, accountability, and respect for the roles defined in our Constitution,” they said. “Judges are meant to uphold the law as written, not rewrite it to serve political ends. Nothing in Utah’s Constitution gives the courts authority to impose maps designed by private groups.”
Redistricting, they added, “is not a courtroom exercise; it is a constitutional duty entrusted to the Legislature, the body directly elected and accountable to Utahns. When that process is overridden, it weakens the voice of every Utahn.”
“Utahns deserve leaders who will defend their voice, their Constitution, and the balance of powers that make our system work,” they added. “This moment calls for unity and resolve, to stand together, but firmly, in defense of the principles that make Utah strong and the Republic process we all depend on.”
Did the judge violate the constitution? No, she’s following it, plaintiffs say
Gibson’s ruling was largely based on a unanimous decision last year by the Utah Supreme Court that determined the Utah Legislature does not have unfettered power when it comes to changing “government reform” ballot initiatives. 
That ruling sent a yearslong anti-gerrymandering lawsuit against the state back to Gibson’s courtroom, with all five of the Utah Supreme Court’s justices ruling she “erred” when she initially dismissed the claim that Utah lawmakers had violated Utahns’ rights to alter and reform their government through a ballot initiative known as Proposition 4. 
That initiative, narrowly approved by voters in 2018, created an independent redistricting process meant to guard against partisan gerrymandering. 
Gibson’s Monday decision capped off a court-ordered process to “remedy” the state’s 2021 congressional map, which she voided as a result of an “unconstitutional process” after she ruled in August that Utah lawmakers overstepped when they undid Proposition 4. 
Utah Supreme Court hands big win to plaintiffs in anti-gerrymandering lawsuit

While multiple GOP legislators have accused Gibson of being an “activist judge” who is ignoring the Utah Constitution, the plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit say those claims ignore the Utah Supreme Court’s legal precedent and attack Gibson without any basis. 
“Today is a day we should all be celebrating the vindication of the voters of Utah and the courage that courts show in the face of enormous political pressure,” said the plaintiffs’ attorney, David Reymann, during a news conference on the steps of the 3rd District Courthouse in Salt Lake City on Tuesday morning. 
“The whole reason the court was put in this position to try and put a new map in place is because the Legislature failed to do its job and enact a legally compliant map,” Reymann said. “Courts don’t do this by default. They do it when the Legislature doesn’t do its job.” 
Reymann said threats to impeach Gibson are “irresponsible and unfortunate,” adding that he hopes “they are merely the initial throes of disappointment” from lawmakers who are frustrated that they lost in court “and not something they would actually pursue as a form of political reprisal, because that would be damaging.” 
To accusations that Gibson is violating the Utah Constitution, Reymann said lawmakers have “just been proven repeatedly wrong about that.” 
“The court’s role is to interpret the Constitution and decide whether what the Legislature has done complies with it,” he said. “Just because they disagree with what she has ruled does not mean that she has violated the Constitution.”

What happens when the Legislature and judiciary clash?
Acknowledging that the courts rarely issue statements in the political arena — and that Gibson is not likely to publicly defend herself — Reymann, speaking for himself as a lawyer and not on behalf of the plaintiffs, said that if lawmakers pursue impeachment, Utah attorneys and other legal professionals would likely rise up in fervent opposition. 
“The Utah legal community as a whole, political stripes aside, is very protective of the independence of the judiciary. And if there is really an effort to retaliate against Judge Gibson, I think that the legal community as a whole will stand up and defend her full-throatedly,” he said. “And they should.”
“She is an unbelievably respected judge in the community,” he added of Gibson. “She has done a fantastic job in this case, whether you agree with her decision or not. She has done the role that the Constitution committed to her, and to suggest that she should be removed from office just because you don’t like politically the result that she has reached, I think is highly irresponsible.” 
Impeachments of judges are rare, but Utah wouldn’t be the first state to see an impeachment effort stemming from a redistricting ruling. In 2023, Wisconsin Republican lawmakers threatened to impeach a liberal Supreme Court Justice judge if she didn’t recuse herself from weighing in on a lawsuit over the state’s legislative maps, but they later backed off after a former justice advised them nothing she had done had risen to the level of corrupt conduct in office. 
Utah’s redistricting ruling catches Trump’s ire

President Donald Trump has also called for impeaching judges who have ruled against his administration. In 2018, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement pushing back against the president. 
“For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,” Roberts said at the time, according to Politico. 
A spokesperson for the Utah courts did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. 
Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders, Schultz and Adams, also did not immediately respond to a question sent to their offices asking whether they were supportive of the effort to impeach Gibson. 
It also wouldn’t be the first time the Utah Legislature has clashed with the Utah judiciary. Earlier this year during lawmakers’ 2025 general session, lawmakers proposed a suite of bills that legal professionals decried as attacks on the judiciary’s independence. 
Many of those bills later fizzled after Utah Chief Justice Matthew Durrant met privately with legislative leaders, but lawmakers did pass a bill stripping the Utah Supreme Court of its ability to choose its own chief justice and instead granting that power to the governor and the Senate. 
Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, later vetoed that bill — but after striking a deal with lawmakers, they revived it while limiting the state’s next chief justice’s term to one, eight-year term. 
Pressure on lieutenant governor to not comply
Shortly after the Monday night ruling, Lt. Gov. Diedre Henderson posted on X that she would “comply with Judge Gibson’s order and immediately begin the process of implementing” the plaintiffs’ alternative map that the court ruled should be used for the 2026 elections instead of the Legislature’s map “unless otherwise ordered by an appeals court.” 
“There will likely be an emergency appeal,” Henderson said in another statement posted Tuesday morning, “but the process of finalizing new boundary details will take weeks of meticulous work on the part of state and county officials. Barring an appellate court ruling, we must begin without delay to ensure that everything is in place for candidate filing in January.”

“The people of Utah deserve an orderly and fair election,” Henderson continued, “and we will do everything in our power to administer one.” 
Henderson’s statement quickly sparked anger from conservative voices online, including from MacPherson, who replied to her post by writing: “Maybe sleep on this before making irrational, unconstitutional decisions. Remember your oath as well.” 
Utah’s Republican legislative leaders have indicated that they intend to continue fighting in court, with appeals to the Utah Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. 
“The question that nobody knows this morning is whether they are going to try to prevent the map that the judge ordered to be put in place and the lieutenant governor said would be put in place … whether they will seek to disrupt that process,” Reymann said. 
But because the lieutenant governor’s office, which oversees the state’s elections, told the court Nov. 10 would be the latest possible date to set congressional boundaries for next year’s elections, it doesn’t appear likely that an appeal could successfully reverse Gibson’s decision in time for 2026. But that remains to be seen.

The 2028 elections, however, are a different matter. While the Legislature continues to fight in court, the Utah Republican Party and the group Utahns for Representative Government are also pursuing another ballot initiative to repeal Proposition 4. 
To qualify the repeal question for the 2026 ballot, the group will need to collect at least 140,748 valid signatures from registered voters across Utah while meeting specific thresholds in at least 26 of Utah’s 29 Senate districts. 
That effort is currently underway. 
Elizabeth Rasmussen, executive director of Better Boundaries, the anti-gerrymandering group that successfully pursued Proposition 4 via ballot initiative eight years ago, said “we’re confident” that Utah voters will reject the effort to repeal. 
“We trust the voters of Utah, that they will choose fairness,” she said. “Of course, we have a fight ahead of us for next year. But right now, today, at least, we’re just celebrating this win.”

The public face of the agency has historically remained above the political fray, focusing on voting rules and routine business. That changed Saturday, Nov. 1, the final day of voting in the 2025 municipal elections.
The online portal voters use to look at their sample ballots wasn’t working that day. North Carolina Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton called out Republican state Auditor Dave Boliek, who was recently given a role in state elections.
The election board’s news release didn’t explain what happened to the portal, but castigated Clayton for spreading misinformation about the problem. It also praised state elections director Sam Hayes, and blamed the former director and Democratic leaders for not updating aging software. 
“It really struck me as odd,” said Greg Flynn, a Democrat and former member of the Wake County Board of Elections. “The partisan sniping was out of character.”
Jason Tyson, the state board’s new director of external affairs, said in an interview that the statement was an appropriate response to misinformation. 
Clayton said in her press release that the voter lookup outage had affected voting, which the elections staff denied. 
“The integrity of the Board and integrity of elections was put into question,” Tyson said. “That may have been why you saw a certain type of response.”
Tyson, who started his job in the elections office two days later, said he heard that “there was a lot of discussion” internally about the press release. “A lot of thought was put into how to respond to this type of misinformation,” he said. 
The press release was issued under state elections board spokesman Pat Gannon’s name. He is on paid leave, as Anderson Alerts first reported. Gannon has worked for the Board of Elections for more than nine years under state elections directors appointed by Democratic and Republican board majorities. Contacted last week, Gannon said he could not comment. 
For years, North Carolina elections administration under Democratic and Republican governors avoided the appearance of partisanship. That patina is now wearing away. 
Boliek, whom Republican legislators gave the power to appoint state board members and local board chairs, hired former state Republican Party executive director Dallas Woodhouse as an elections liaison a few months ago. Boliek described one of Woodhouse’s duties as coordinating training for Republican board chairs.

The state board already conducts training for local elections officials. Boliek spokesman Randy Brechbiel couldn’t say last week how Woodhouse’s training sessions would differ from those the state provides. 
Republican legislators moved the state board into Boliek’s office, but under state law, elections oversight remains with the Board of Elections and its administrators. 
The change in party leadership at the agency also appears to have loosened the purse strings of Republican legislators. After years of giving the state elections board less money than requested, the legislature finally gave the elections board $15 million to complete the technology upgrades the former Democratic elections director sought for years.
They also included $1.2 million to allow Hayes, the new elections director, to hire staff exempt from the state Human Resources Act, meaning they can be political hires. 
Hayes explained at the time that he wanted staff not for partisan purposes, but to be able to build his own team. 
Tyson, who has worked for Republican executive officers, including former Gov. Pat McCrory and Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey, is one of the new hires. 
Tim Hoegemeyer, a former Republican candidate for state auditor who last worked for the state Department of Public Instruction for nearly five years, is the board’s new general counsel. He replaces Paul Cox, who left to join the law firm Poyner Spruill.

Costs previously covered by the federal government will shift to states and poor families under the law, and some nursing homes will be forced to close while residents are rendered unhoused, industry leaders said. The law also rolls back a Biden-era rule calling for increased staffing in nursing facilities. In conjunction with the staffing cuts most nursing homes anticipate having to implement under the new budget constraints, industry leaders expect drastic repercussions for those served by and employed in nursing homes. 
“This law is really going to reshape the face of health care across the United States, including long-term care,” said Sam Brooks, director of public policy at Consumer Voice, a national nonpartisan advocacy group for long-term care. “We fought this bill tooth and nail and just really see this as an existential crisis for disabled and older folks.”
Lawmakers in favor of the law argue it doesn’t make cuts to Medicare – the federal insurance program primarily for elderly adults – but long-term care advocates argue nursing homes and residents will be harmed by these changes. Nationwide, the majority of nursing home residents use Medicaid – a fact that becomes more pronounced in Mississippi, the poorest state.
“Nursing homes rely heavily on Medicaid,” Brooks said. “You can’t cut a trillion dollars in Medicaid and not affect all Medicaid budgets … Nursing homes are not going to be over here siloed.”
Vulnerable adults in Mississippi stand to lose more, with 74% of the state’s nursing home residents on Medicaid, significantly higher than the national average, said Sylvia-Nicole Cecchi, project coordinator with the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program.
“Ultimately, these cuts could disrupt care for roughly 69,000 seniors and people with disabilities in Mississippi who rely on Medicaid,” Cecchi said. “When states are forced to cut nursing home reimbursement rates, studies show that the quality of care declines — residents face fewer staff, less attention, and poorer health outcomes.”
Home- and community-based care is also likely to be affected, though the bill doesn’t make direct cuts to the service, explained Priya Chidambaram, a senior policy manager who focuses on long-term care at KFF, a health care research nonprofit. 
“It’s a significant source of Medicaid spending,” Chidambaram said. “It’s also optional, so that’s a place states kind of have to look at first when federal spending is cut.”
The majority of long-term care Medicaid users receive care at home in the U.S. In Mississippi, roughly 3 in 5 Medicaid recipients access care this way, according to a KFF analysis.
Elderly adults will also be subject to subtle but significant enrollment changes to Medicaid and Medicare programs, such as an increase in paperwork. 
One such example is the reversal of a Biden-era policy that made it easier for people to enroll in and remain on what’s called the Medicare Savings Program. That program allows low-income Medicare beneficiaries to supplement their plan with Medicaid to bring down out-of-pocket costs for premiums, deductibles and copayments. 
As a result of increased red tape, eligible beneficiaries are expected to get kicked off, denied or scared away from the savings program. Costs will increase for 1.3 million Medicare beneficiaries who are not able to take advantage of the supplemental Medicaid coverage, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. 
“A lot of what this law does is just adds paperwork for people,” said Toby Edelman, a senior policy attorney with the Center for Medicare Advocacy. “There’s no reason to have an eligibility determination every six months for people that have no change in anything. These elderly residents are not getting new income.”
The law also changes Medicaid’s policy around retroactive coverage for nursing home residents from three months to two months. 
Retroactive Medicaid coverage for nursing home residents exists because going to a nursing home is not always planned. Sometimes an older adult will be discharged from a hospital to a nursing home after suffering a disabling condition, and oftentimes that person isn’t already on Medicaid. 
It might not seem like much, but paying out of pocket for one month in a nursing home can wipe out a person’s savings, Edelman explained. 
“The out of pocket costs for nursing homes these days are very, very high – $5,000 or $6,000 a month,” she said. “People just don’t have that kind of money – especially people who are eligible for Medicaid.”
Nursing homes are allowed to evict residents for unpaid bills, though it’s not clear how many evictions are wrongful – or how often unpaid bills are a result of a Medicaid enrollment error. The most frequent complaint against nursing homes is consistently related to evictions and transfers, according to the National Long-Term Care Ombudsman Resource Center. 
An increase in enrollment errors, at a time when facilities are facing tighter budgets, could lead nursing homes to evict Medicaid-eligible seniors with unpaid bills. 
“One of the biggest drivers of involuntary discharge in nursing homes is unpaid bills,” Brooks said. “And oftentimes those bills are unpaid because of some Medicaid snafu – not getting the documents in, not applying on time.”
Nursing home facilities will suffer, too. Keeping residents housed while not getting reimbursed by Medicaid could force already-struggling homes to shutter. In Mississippi, there are 11 nursing homes at risk of closure, according to the United States Senate Committee on Finance in June. 
Leadership at the 11 nursing homes could not be reached by the time of publication.
The Mississippi Health Care Association, the state’s largest association of nursing homes, did not respond to a request for comment. 
“The destabilizing effect (the law) will have on nursing homes and their residents will leave these seniors in peril,” said Cecchi, of the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program.

(Photo courtesy of the Polk County Assessor's Office)An Iowa distillery is suing the federal government for allegedly mishandling a permitting process and costing the company millions of dollars in lost revenue.
Red Boot Distillery of Des Moines, also known as JDSO Inc., is suing the United States of America, alleging employees of the federal Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which is an agency within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, negligently mishandled documents related to its permits to do business.
Red Boot Distillery holds federal distilled-spirits and winery permits issued by the bureau. On Dec. 21, 2019, the company submitted an application to the bureau, seeking to amend its distilled-spirits permit.  In January 2020, while that application was still pending, the company’s sole shareholder, Stuart Oxer, transferred his company stock into a revocable trust for estate-planning purposes, according to the lawsuit.
A month later, the bureau allegedly approved the permit amendment based in part on company records it had received detailing the transfer of Oxer’s shares to the trust, the lawsuit states.
Three years later, in December 2022, the bureau issued a formal “Notice of Potential Civil and Criminal Liability,” claiming the company’s permits had been automatically terminated due to an unreported change in company control — essentially arguing the distillery had not notified the bureau of Oxer’s transfers of his shares to the trust.
That move allegedly blocked the company from obtaining the required approvals for labels and formulas — and, the lawsuit claims, rendered the company “unable to serve existing customers or develop new alcoholic beverage customers.”
The lawsuit alleges the distillery was forced to suspend operations for several days and that, over the next two years, it “suffered substantial losses, including over $3.5 million in lost business and profits.”
The company claims it was forced to expend “significant financial resources” defending itself in at least two administrative proceedings commenced by the bureau. The proceedings were later withdrawn once it was discovered that the bureau’s own negligent acts had triggered the proceedings, the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, seeks compensatory damages of no less than $3.5 million, as well as reimbursement for legal expenses.
The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.
Red Boot, which calls itself Iowa’s largest beverage co-packing company, says it maintains 275,000 square feet dedicated to the bottling and canning of beverages, and manufactures flavored seltzers, health beverages, energy drinks, teas and lemonades.

More than 16,000 Heroes Memorialized on New Wall of Remembrance
NEW CASTLE, Del.  Today, Delaware River and Bay Authority (DRBA) officials joined with federal and state elected officials to commemorate the completion of the iconic Wall of Remembrance Memorial renovation project, located at Veterans Memorial Park adjacent to the Delaware Memorial Bridge.  The $5 million, multi-phase project, which began in June 2024, significantly expanded the wall to ensure every serviceman and servicewoman from Delaware and New Jersey who perished in wars and conflicts from World War II to the present day is now recognized. Previously, the War Memorial Wall contained only the names of those who served in World War II and the Korean War.
 
“Today marks the fulfillment of a promise to every Gold Star family in Delaware and New Jersey,” said DRBA Executive Director Joel Coppadge. ” The Wall of Remembrance now bears the names of every Delawarean and New Jerseyan who perished in wars and conflicts from World War II to the present day.  Every name added is a reminder of the price of freedom and a personal story of courage. It’s important that the full measure of sacrifice by our states’ bravest men and women is recognized, visible, and never forgotten.”
“To every Delawarean who raised their hand for our country, and every family who stood beside them, the Wall of Remembrance is a promise that we will never forget those who served and sacrificed for our freedom,” Governor Matt Meyer said. “As we continue strengthening veterans’ services across our state, this newly restored memorial stands as a place of reflection, respect, and gratitude for generations to come.”
“The Wall of Remembrance both honors those who gave everything and reminds each of us of the enduring responsibility that sacrifice places upon us. It is both a tribute and a teaching,” said U.S. Senator Chris Coons. “This restoration ensures that their memory, and the values they fought for, will continue to inspire future generations to serve, lead, and build a more just and peaceful world.”
“For seven decades, the Wall of Remembrance has paid homage to the brave men and women who gave their lives to protect our freedom,” said U.S. Senator Lisa Blunt Rochester. “Each of the names on this wall, including the newly added servicemen and women from more recent wars, made the ultimate sacrifice. May their names inspire us to create the more perfect union they gave their lives to protect.”
“Each name etched into this wall tells the story of a life defined by courage, duty, and love of country,” said Rep. Sarah McBride. “We owe these Delawareans and New Jerseyans more than remembrance — we owe them a nation worthy of their sacrifice. On this Veterans Day, may we honor their service not only in words, but in our shared work to preserve the freedom and democracy they gave everything to defend.”
The following DRBA veterans participated in the ceremonial raising of the six service branch flags:  Robert L. Arnold, U.S. Army (Vietnam Veteran); Michael T. Casey, U.S. Air Force (Vietnam Veteran); Edward R. Cole, U.S. Army (Vietnam Veteran); Curtis V. Esposito, U.S. Army (Vietnam Veteran); David Wayne Hearn, U.S. Navy; and Kenneth R. Overton, U.S. Navy
The centerpiece of the renovation is the newly completed Wall of Remembrance, which has been significantly expanded to display more than 16,000 names from World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf Wars, and subsequent operations in the Middle East, including Freedom’s Sentinel, Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, New Dawn, and Inherent Resolve. Approximately 1,800 new names have been added to the memorial.
Key components of comprehensive rehabilitation include:

Expansion of the Wall of Remembrance: The monument’s display capacity was expanded to include fallen service members from subsequent wars and conflicts, with new metal plaques listing their names.
Structural Integrity: The underlying concrete structure of the original 1955 monument was replaced, expanded and reinforced to protect against the deteriorating effects of weather.
Enhanced Design: The project reintroduced the original circular plaza design, increasing the plaza and lawn area for better public access and programming.
New Features: The reflecting pool was removed to accommodate more programming space, all existing flagpoles were replaced, and a new one was added to honor the sixth branch of our armed forces, the U.S. Space Force.

Originally constructed in 1955, the War Memorial Monument, now known as the Wall of Remembrance, paid tribute to soldiers from New Jersey and Delaware who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our country in World War II and the Korean War. Both the Delaware Memorial Bridge and Veterans Memorial Park are forever linked in history – dedicated five years apart from each other to honor our nation’s war sacrifices in World War II and the Korean War. The Park was dedicated on October 20, 1956.
In 1996, the monument grounds were modified from the original circular form to its current octagonal form, to add the service branch flags, and to include a new reflecting pool.
In 2024, the DRBA awarded Contract DMB 21-11 for the War Memorial Rehabilitation Project to Wickersham Construction and Engineering, Inc. of Lancaster, PA. The estimated cost is nearly $5 million to replace the underlying concrete structure, expand the Memorial Wall and Plaza, upgrade lighting, drainage, and landscaping. Construction activity was substantially completed in October 2025.

Gen. Karen Berry is stepping into a new role at the center of Delaware’s veterans network as the first director of the Delaware Department of Veterans Affairs
The department, referred to as DDVA, formalizes and elevates functions long handled by the state’s Office of Veteran Services and related agencies.






WILMINGTON, Del. — Retired Brig. Gen. Karen Berry is stepping into a new role at the center of Delaware’s veterans network as the first director of the Delaware Department of Veterans Affairs, a new cabinet-level department created to elevate how the state supports those who served.
Berry outlined her responsibilities and vision on Monday, November 1o,  on A Better Discussion, a webcast hosted by former Attorney General M. Jane Brady for A Better Delaware, a nonpartisan public policy advocacy group.
The department, referred to as DDVA, formalizes and elevates functions long handled by the state’s Office of Veteran Services and related agencies.
“It’ll come across typically as DDVA… Delaware Department of Veterans Affairs,” Berry said. “Me being in this position just really amplifies that office, the hard work that that office and our commissioners… and our cemetery staff [are doing]. I can help organize them and help us network with other state agencies so that we can fully support our veterans.”
A cabinet seat for veterans
The new department was created following unanimous legislative support.
“It was 100% supported in the House and the Senate,” Berry said. She added that Delaware’s political leaders have shown consistent unity on veterans’ issues. “Whatever your political affiliation is, everyone comes together… and is very supportive of anyone serving… and for veterans.”
Brady said lifting veterans’ affairs to cabinet status was intentional.
“The entire effort was really focused on elevating our obligation to support our veterans to the cabinet level,” Brady said on the program. “Like education, like labor, that’s important to us.”
As a cabinet secretary, Berry will join regular meetings with other top state officials, giving veterans a voice in broader decisions on employment, training, health care, housing, and social services.
“Being in that room with the other cabinet secretaries will help [her] in coordinating employment opportunities, training… and redirecting from the jobs they had in the military to civilian service,” Brady noted.
Berry said that access is critical.
“I can help bring [agencies] together and make sure that we increase awareness and help [veterans] get access to the services that they earned when they served,” she said.
What the new department oversees
Berry’s portfolio brings multiple existing programs and responsibilities under one accountable leader:


Delaware’s state veterans cemeteries in Bear and Millsboro.


The Delaware Veterans Home in Milford, established under Gov. Ruth Ann Minner.


The Office of Veteran Services, including veteran service officers who assist with benefits, claims and casework.


The Veterans Trust Fund, which provides emergency financial assistance.


“We have seen a great deal this year [of veterans] who don’t have anywhere to turn, they’re having financial difficulties,” Berry said. “We have a Veterans Trust Fund that… can give them some financial support to help them get through some rough points, and also direct them to other resources.”
Berry also oversees a 12-member commission representing veteran service organizations across the state. Her job, she said, is to strengthen coordination among those groups and state agencies, and to build a small core staff focused on outreach, constituent services and legislative work.
“I know I need a constituent [services person], I need someone to help with constituent issues and legislative issues,” she said. Over her first five weeks, she has been visiting other departments to study how they are structured. “It helps me… see what their departments look like, and how I might shape mine to be best supportive.”
Budget and staffing will grow gradually, she said, but the mandate is clear: make sure veterans are not left navigating the system alone.
Bringing national experience home
Berry’s credibility in the role is grounded in a nearly 37-year military career and a lifetime in Delaware.
Raised in the Stanton-Newport area, she attended local schools and graduated from Delcastle Technical High School before enrolling at the University of Delaware. She joined the Delaware National Guard as a college student, later commissioning through Army ROTC and remaining in the Guard for most of her career.
She served as an engineer officer before moving into the Signal Corps.
“I was a communications officer for the majority of my career,” Berry said.
Berry deployed with a U.S. Army Reserve unit to Afghanistan, where she helped run theater-wide communications.
“I was in charge of the communications network in the entire theater of Afghanistan,” she said.
Her Guard service ran alongside a civilian career as a high school math teacher at Sussex Central High School, where both of her children were students.
“I was a high school math teacher for the majority of my career,” she said.
Military service runs deep in her family. Her husband, retired Adjutant General Mike Berry, served in the Delaware National Guard and spent 28 years as a Delaware state trooper. Her son and brother also served and deployed, and earlier generations fought in World War I, World War II and Vietnam. That history, she said, shapes her commitment to today’s veterans, including those who came home to too little thanks.
“We did not treat [Vietnam veterans] right, but I do think we’ve done much better recently, and that’s one of the things that I will continue in this role,” she said.
Coordination, best practices, and community partners
Berry said one of the strengths of the new department is its formal connection to a national network of state veterans agencies.
“We have a national association… so we meet twice a year to talk about national-level issues, share best practices,” she said. “That’s a great resource for me… so that I’m not trying to just recreate things from scratch.”
In Delaware, she highlighted partnerships with organizations, including Friends of Delaware Veterans and the National Association of Black Veterans, which raise money for the Veterans Trust Fund and support local programs.
“They really do an amazing job of networking with big corporations… and they’ve been doing a lot of really good work for veterans across the state,” Berry said.
Her first Veterans Day period in office reflected the visibility and expectations of the new role: events at Delaware Tech, ceremonies at the Delaware Memorial Bridge, and a major gathering in Kent County that draws veteran service organizations from across the region.
Through it all, Berry said her goal is simple but urgent.
“We increase awareness and help them get access to the services that they earned when they served,” she said. “Having this department and this seat at the table helps us do that.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/karen-Berry.jpg,,,2025-11-11 15:03:00.496862

Members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation say FEMA continues to fail to compensate those who lost their primary residences in the fire. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation say the office overseeing $5.45 billion in compensation funds for victims of the state’s biggest-ever wildfire continues to delay payments and put up unnecessary barriers, particularly for people who lost their homes. 
The Nov. 6 letter from U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, along with U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján and Martin Heinrich, calls on the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Claims Office to account for reports from fire victims that the office is breaking promises about the pace of compensation and refusing to reopen claims from people who suffered new losses from the 2022 wildfire. 
FEMA and Claims Office officials did not respond to Source New Mexico’s inquiry about the letter on Tuesday, which is a federal holiday. 
“We understand that many of these cases are complex and require detailed review by the office,” the members, all Democrats, wrote in the letter. “But it is unacceptable that these people who have suffered so much haven’t been paid three and a half years after the catastrophe.”
Congress awarded the Federal Emergency Management Agency $5.45 billion in a series of bills beginning in late 2022 aimed to “fully compensate” victims of the 534-square-mile wildfire in Northern New Mexico that was the result of two botched prescribed burns the United States Forest Service conducted. According to the office, it has so far paid out a little more than $3 billion of that.
Around this time last year, the office reported it had fully paid one-third of the 272 claims it received from people who reported total losses of their primary residences in the fire, and that approximately another third of them had gotten partial payments. 
According to the Nov. 6 letter, claims office officials promised the delegation it would pay the remainder by March of this year, but “nearly seven months later, several total loss claimants still await payment,” the members wrote. 
FEMA has paid out just 2% of fund to help wildfire victims rebuild. Some can’t wait much longer.

The letter calls on FEMA officials to report how many total loss claims remain outstanding and what their plan is to close the claims fairly and quickly. 
The letter also says fire victims have reported repeated denials for new claims of damage. Because the fire burned at high intensity in certain areas, the burn scar and areas downstream continue to be vulnerable to post-fire flooding and debris flows, including as recently as this summer. 
Claims office guidelines require the office to consider compensation for those “cascading events” that directly result from the fire, but the letter says that isn’t happening.
“We are alarmed that many community members have reported that the Claims Office has refused to reopen their claims to account for cascading events,” according to the letter. “That is inexplicable.”
The Nov. 6 letter marks the latest outcry from the delegation, which has repeatedly criticized the office for delays. It also calls on FEMA to answer for why it has not met legal requirements for reporting on its spending to Congress.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hermits-Peak-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-11 15:03:00.496862

We were united with over 7 million protesters who participated in No Kings events across the country, the largest single-day protest in our nation’s history. Before the protest even occurred, you called it a “We Hate America Rally” in an interview on Fox News. Nothing could be further from the truth. We protested because we love America!
Many people shared many opinions at the protests and we do not endorse all of the views expressed. However, the unifying theme was concern about the overreach of the executive branch of the U.S. government under President Donald Trump and Congress’s failure to check the executive branch.
Protest against abuse of power by the executive first united the 13 colonies as one people in defiance of King George III of England. Our national identity was first expressed by our founding fathers who signed the Declaration of Independence – primarily a list of abuses of power by the English monarch.
To protest abuse of government power is to be American. To accept abuse of government power against the people or for enrichment of government officials is to be un-American.
Many Montanans are concerned by the behaviors of President Trump and his executive branch. We observe a pattern of disregard for the rule of law and the constitution of the United States that, if unchecked, will have grave consequences for our nation and its people. While the President has the right to exercise the powers vested in him by the people as established in the constitution, the taking of additional powers from the people and from the other branches of government and the states exceeds his mandate. These include detention of American citizens without trial, infringement on Congress’ exclusive power to appropriate funds, the deployment of the military in American cities, the receipt of unconstitutional gifts from foreign powers for the personal benefit of the President, and Donald Trump’s public desire for an unconstitutional third term in office.
We declare that it is our shared and indivisible commitment to democracy and the rule of law, not conservative or liberal policies or the successes of individual leaders, that has made America succeed. We declare that no man is above the law. Our democracy, based on participation, compromise, and trust in each other, built a nation able to defeat fascism and violent nationalism in the second world war; a nation that has provided opportunity and freedom for hundreds of millions of Americans and others – something we should all celebrate.
Because we love America, we feel we must stand up, unite, and speak out against the erosion of our democracy and our constitution.
We invite all Americans to join us in speaking up for democracy and the constitution which both establishes and limits government power.
We hope you now see that we, your constituents, love America enough to speak up when she is threatened and we hope you will do the same.

(Andrew Roth | Michigan Advance)Meghan Reckling, a Michigan Senate staffer who also co-founded the Republican Victory Field Operations, has resigned from her post in the office of state Sen. Lana Thies (R-Brighton), a move that followed another Senate staffer’s shuffle to the House over fallout involving their outside consulting work.
Reckling left her job acting as chief of staff for Theis following the Senate Business Office giving her an ultimatum of resigning from the Senate or keeping her connection to Victory Field Operations, The Detroit News reported on Tuesday. Reckling told the newspaper that she chose to resign.
The Senate Business Office is run by the office of Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids). Rosie Jones, spokesperson for Brinks, said the Senate does not discuss personnel matters and could not confirm whether Reckling resigned or not.
Reckling founded Victory Field Operations along with Jeff Wiggins, who worked in the office of Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt as his press secretary until Monday, when it was announced that Wiggins was moving to the office of House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township).
The moves follow the Michigan Advance reporting in October that Wiggins and Victory Field Operations were working for U.S. Rep. John James’ gubernatorial campaign. Nesbitt is also a candidate for governor and James is one of Nesbitt’s top rivals in the Republican gubernatorial hunt.
Nesbitt staffer’s firm works for James campaign, raising ethics flags in GOP governor race

At least two well-connected Michigan political operatives told the Advance in a previous story that the situation was a clear conflict of interest, even if it wasn’t illegal in terms of Michigan election law.
The Advance learned in October through public campaign finance data that Victory Field Operations was paid by James, not just for ballot access work but also political consulting via Mission Michigan, the issues-based political action committee supporting James.
Mission Michigan was created in April to support James, and received a large $5 million contribution from Dan and Pamela DeVos, members of the prominent Republican DeVos family.

Michigan campaign finance reports show that the committee paid Victory Field Operations $40,000 for political strategy consulting, according to July and September filings.

The Detroit News reported Tuesday that Nesbitt also paid Victory Field Operations for political consulting, muddying the waters even more.

Reckling also told the newspaper that she and Wiggins had been previously approved to do work with Victory Field Operations outside the halls of the Senate.
Michigan Senate rules allow for outside work by employees but it was not encouraged, and certainly not for large scale political work.
But that changed following the Advance’s report on Wiggins’ work with Victory Field Operations while he was key Nesbitt staffer. The Detroit News reported that Reckling said Brinks was “unhappy” with her work with the firm she founded and that it was growing more political.
Reckling is one of Michigan’s foremost conservative voices on social media, routinely commenting on statements made by candidates and other politicos, news stories or the political headwinds of the day.
Nesbitt in a statement to The Detroit News said the Senate Business Office’s actions amounted to a political witch hunt.

John Grady and his wife Kara opened up their hemp emporium in Rosebud on July 4 — and they say about 60% of their customers are veterans, like Grady, who are treating chronic pain or PTSD with intoxicating hemp products.
Last night, they watched the U.S. Senate vote to approve a spending package to end a record-breaking federal government shutdown. But what drew their attention was a provision tucked in the bill that would prohibit hemp products from having more than .4 milligrams of total THC per container. If the House approves it and the president signs it, the prohibition will go into effect in one year.  
The change, Grady said, will devastate his business. 
“When this is done,” he said, “we’ll lose 52% of our revenue, meaning we won’t be able to stay in business.” 
On Tuesday – a day they would normally be focused on honoring veterans – the couple said they didn’t have the energy. 
“You’re sick to your stomach all day long,” said Kara Grady, “knowing your hard work is for not.”
State officials estimated last year that 40,000 food establishments and smoke shops and 1,800 food manufacturers were selling products that would be banned under the proposed federal regulations. 
That estimate was part of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services’ 2025 budget estimate to enforce former Gov. Mike Parson’s abandoned 2024 order that would have banned intoxicating hemp products in the state.
Hemp was legalized in the 2018 Farm bill and naturally has very little THC, the intoxicating component mostly associated with marijuana. 
But that potency can be increased with some science.
While marijuana products must be sold in dispensaries and be grown and manufactured in state-regulated facilities, intoxicating hemp products are completely unregulated by any governmental agency. 
There’s no state or federal law saying teenagers or children can’t buy them or stores can’t sell them to minors. However, some stores and vendors in Missouri have taken it upon themselves to impose age restrictions of 21 and up.
John Grady, owner of Slappyhappy Hemp Company, has owned a hemp farm in Missouri since 2023 and last year opened a hemp emporium in Rosebud (Photo submitted).
Missouri state Rep. Dave Himan, a Republican from O’Fallon, said he was planning on pre-filing legislation on Dec. 1 that would have established a licensing system to allow Missouri businesses to sell the low-dose hemp-derived THC beverages and edibles. 
If the federal spending bill passes, his bill will reflect the .4 milligram limit of THC per package – and that also includes THC-A, which transforms into THC when heated.
“We are really kind of looking now to see what the federal government’s going to do,” he said, “and if we need to make adjustments in my bill to mirror what the federal government’s going to put in place.”
This will be Hinman’s second year — and Missouri’s fourth year – trying to regulate intoxicating hemp products. Previous attempts failed because the proposed bills, backed by the marijuana industry, would have banned the products. 
Last year, several bills failed to advance because the hemp industry itself couldn’t agree on provisions for things including THC limits and licensing requirements. 
A report released last month by the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association, which represents the marijuana industry, tested 55 intoxicating hemp products purchased from smoke shops and gas stations statewide. Results showed that nearly all of them were above the total THC limit that’s outlined in the pending federal spending bill.
While the debate in previous years has often been seen as a marijuana industry versus the hemp industry, both of those players have a growing common foe – the black-market marijuana products that are posing as certified hemp products, Hinman said. 
“There are some great people out there that own mom-and-pop shops that really are doing the right thing,” Hinman said. 
However, just last week, Hinman met with a group that brought in packages of about 40 different THC products purchased throughout the state that resemble Skittles, M&M’s and chips that would easily be mistaken by children as regular products. 
“That continues to proliferate throughout our state,” he said, “and it’s just getting worse and worse. So we’ve got to do something. And it’s actually not even hemp, it’s truly marijuana out there, and it’s really hurting the business.”
Eapen Thampy, a lobbyist who represents several hemp businesses, agreed that the “bad actors” have expanded and pose a threat to legitimate hemp businesses.
“We’re under attack from the marijuana industry that wants to protect their monopoly,” Thampy said, “and we’re under attack from bad actors who don’t care who they hurt to make a buck. We’re sort of the collateral damage in that picture.”
Thampy said the hemp industry is hopeful that Congress will take up the issue before the ban is implemented in a year, if the spending bill is approved. However, a Senate amendment to remove the language was defeated last night by a 76-24 vote, making the success of a separate bill unlikely.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)As New Hampshire’s lone member of death row renews an attempt to overturn his death sentence at the New Hampshire Supreme Court, the American Civil Liberties Union is jumping in to help. 
In a “friend-of-the-court” brief filed Oct. 30, lawyers for the state and national ACLU argue that Michael Addison’s death sentence was affected by racial bias, given that similar murders in the state committed by white people resulted in life imprisonments.
A jury handed Addison, who is Black, a death sentence in 2008 after he shot and killed Manchester Police Officer Michael Briggs in 2006 while fleeing. Briggs had been responding to a reported domestic disturbance; Addison shot him in the head.  
But the ACLU has pointed to two other murders in New Hampshire in which the courts found a stronger intent to kill, and in which a jury sentenced the defendant to life in prison. In one 2006 case, John Brooks was convicted of murdering a handyman with a pair of accomplices after planning the killing for two years. And in 1998, Gordon Perry received a life sentence despite shooting and killing a police officer who was approaching his parked car. Both defendants in those cases were white. 
“One cannot hand wave these racial disparities,” the ACLU brief reads, adding that a proper proportionality review of a death sentence should consider whether the sentence is “arbitrary or infected by impermissible considerations such as race.”
The brief cites studies in other states suggesting racial disparities in the use of the death penalty. One 2014 study, from the state of Washington, found that Black defendants were 4½ times more likely than white defendants to be sentenced to death after being convicted of similar crimes. 
The amici curiae brief is a collaboration of the ACLU of New Hampshire as well as the national ACLU’s Capital Punishment Project. And it comes as lawyers for Addison are hoping to use New Hampshire’s death penalty repeal in his favor. 
The New Hampshire Legislature repealed its capital punishment law in 2019, narrowly overturning a veto by Gov. Chris Sununu. 
That repeal bill was intended to be forward-looking and to not apply to death sentences in the past, including Addison’s. It states that it “shall apply to persons convicted of capital murder on or after the effective date of this act.”
But this year, Addison’s attorneys have argued that despite the prospective language, the 2019 repeal should lead the Supreme Court to negate Addison’s 2008 death sentence. Executing Addison now would be “excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases,” since someone convicted of the same crime today would not receive the death penalty, Addison’s attorneys argue. 
Under New Hampshire’s now-repealed capital murder law, the state Supreme Court may overturn a sentencing if that “excessive and disproportionate” standard is met. 
In making their argument, Addison’s attorneys are drawing in part on precedents set in Connecticut and New Mexico. In both states, lawmakers repealed a death penalty and attempted to make that repeal apply only to future capital punishment convictions, and in both states, their highest courts ruled the repeal rendered moot existing death penalty sentences. 
In its amici brief, the ACLU makes similar arguments, and provides research indicating that no state has carried out executions after its Legislature repealed the death penalty. If the state Supreme Court permits the execution despite the repeal, New Hampshire would be the first, they argue. 
The state Supreme Court has twice considered and denied appeals of Addison’s case on the basis of disproportionality — first in 2013 and again in 2015. In both instances, the court determined that Addison’s sentence was “neither excessive nor disproportionate,” after comparing it to 10 similar cases from four states with similar death penalty laws.
But Addison’s attorneys argue the 2019 repeal signaled “a profound shift in community values against the death penalty,” and that the court should thus revisit the disproportionality argument. 
In September, the Supreme Court said it would accept written briefs from both Addison and the Attorney General’s Office on the question of whether the 2019 repeal should negate Addison’s execution. 
Addison’s attorneys, Jonathan Cohen of Cohen and Winters, PLLC in Concord, and Michael Wiseman and Jon Cioschi, of Wiseman, Schwartz, Cioschi & Trama in Philadelphia, submitted their 27-page brief on Oct. 30.
The Attorney General’s Office has not yet submitted a response brief. But Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who as attorney general led the prosecution of Addison from 2006 to 2008, has spoken out strongly against Addison’s appeal efforts.
“Addison, a career criminal, murdered Manchester Police Officer Michael Briggs in cold blood, and he should face the death sentence imposed by a jury of his peers and upheld by the New Hampshire Supreme Court,” Ayotte said in a statement. “Commuting his sentence would be a grave injustice and an insult to Officer Briggs’ family and law enforcement.”
Some Republican lawmakers have filed bills ahead of the 2026 legislative session to restore the state’s death penalty laws. Ayotte has said she would support the return of the punishment to the state.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aclusign-1024x714.jpg,,,2025-11-11 15:03:00.496862

In an Oct. 10, 2025, hearing  of Kansas Legislature committee, he argues for county authority to set administrative fees. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Legislature's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — The Kansas Legislature’s auditors reported that Johnson, Labette and Gove counties spent $28.8 million to provide three state-mandated government services last year, but received one-third of that total in state, federal or user-fee funding to cover those administrative costs.
The three counties were selected for the audit because they represented a range of populations, geographic locations and spending per capita among Kansas’ 105 counties. Under state law, auditors said, Kansas counties provided 18 distinct core services. The limited audit examined costs during the 2024 fiscal year for the three counties in terms of services for criminal prosecution, motor vehicle registration and the collection of ad valorem taxes.
“The state requires counties to perform a lot of different services,” said Andy Brienzo, the supervising auditor who presented the report Monday to the Joint Legislative Post Audit Committee.
He said auditors estimated it would cost the state $19.1 million to compensate the three counties for compliance with minimum levels of service outlined in state law for the three areas reviewed.
The analysis was requested by Rep. Shannon Francis, a Republican from Liberal who chairs the audit committee, and Rep. Adam Smith, a Weskan Republican who chairs the House Appropriations Committee.
“I’ve always struggled with this,” Francis said. “I understand that the state does need to step up in this area.”
The Kansas Association of Counties estimated more than half of counties’ annual spending relates to providing services required by state law.
Johnson County had 632,000 residents in 2024, while Labette County in southeast Kansas contained 19,600 people, and Gove County had 2,600 residents.
 
Outdated model
Thomas Franzen, treasurer in Johnson County, said the majority of revenue collected by county treasurers in Kansas was passed to the state government. The audit, he said, revealed differences among Kansas counties in terms of administrative costs and levels of services provided. This reality was most evident in the administration of motor vehicle services, he said.
“Labor is the largest cost component to providing the services, and labor markets are different across the state,” Franzen said. “These differences lead to significantly different cost structures across 105 counties providing these services.”
He said Kansas’ standard county service fee structure made sense when the Kansas Department of Revenue performed a significant portion of administrative work tied to motor vehicle services. The fixed-fee structure has been flawed since 2012, when many of these responsibilities were transferred to county treasurers, he said.
“We’ve got a model that is very outdated. It’s a one-size-fits-all model,” Franzen said. “Standardized fee structures to fund these services don’t make sense in today’s world. A fee structure that allows local governments to charge fees necessary to provide the desired level of customer service is what is needed now.”
However, Rep. Shawn Tarwater, R-Stilwell, said Johnson County collected enough in property taxes annually to “more than make up” for costs incurred by the county to provide core government services outlined by the state.
In the audit report, auditors said Johnson County officials concluded the state’s requirement that motor vehicle titling be done in person was an administrative burden. Implementation of electronic titling in Kansas, as some states have done, would raised in the audit as an option for reducing staffing requirements, the counties told auditors.
Officials in the three audited counties said they disliked the state’s MOVRS computer system for registering motor vehicles. The report said the system was “slow and unreliable,” especially at the end of each month, “when the volume of activity spikes and the system is prone to crashes.”
 
‘Huge burden’
Steven Hirsch, who serves as Gove County attorney, said the western Kansas county could benefit from a surcharge on traffic tickets to handle costs incurred while enforcing state traffic law. He said the county’s administrative cost for criminal prosecutions was unusually high because 30 miles of Interstate 70 passed through Gove County. Without I-70, he said, Gove County might expect 250 traffic cases per year.
“Gove County handles 1,400 traffic cases,” Hirsch said. “This puts a huge burden on us as prosecutors and upon the courts.”
He said a majority of the offenders weren’t residents of Gove County. Small-population counties with long segments of interstate highway could benefit from state approval of a surcharge on traffic tickets to finance prosecution costs, he said.
In Johnson, Labette and Gove counties, auditors estimated the three spent $17.3 million on state-mandated criminal prosecutions in fiscal year 2024. The costs were offset by $846,000 in grants and user fees, the audit said.
Motor vehicle registration services in the three counties last year reached $8.3 million, and expenditures required by the state were partially offset with $5 million in user fees. The three counties devoted $3.2 million to collecting ad valorem taxes in 2024, but that was fully offset by $3.9 million in user fees and fines.
The three areas studied by auditors were chosen from among 18 core services provided by county governments in Kansas. Areas not considered in the audit included election administration, emergency management, jail operations, public health and property evaluation.
Sen. Caryn Tyson, a Parker Republican, said she objected to repeated references to “state-mandated” services.
“I know that terminology is bantered around,” Tyson said. “Don’t the counties exist because of state statute? It kind of makes sense that we would oversee some of the functions of those counties.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Thomas-Granzen-johnson-county-treasurer-1024x564.png,,,2025-11-11 15:03:00.496862

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma City charter school is a step away from forced closure after state officials reported “serious concerns” of poor instruction, financial struggles and organizational disarray.
Proud To Partner Leadership Academy, a charter high school known as PTPLA, has reduced its staff to only one teacher, a superintendent and a counselor to serve its 115 students, state officials said.
The Statewide Charter School Board voted unanimously on Monday to put PTPLA on probation and to require the school’s leaders to produce a turnaround plan by Nov. 26. Probation is one tier away from the board canceling a charter contract and shutting a school down.
PTPLA, which opened last year, has missed multiple deadlines to file financial reports and required documents with the state, staff for the statewide board said. After hiring a new treasurer, the school made a final Nov. 3 deadline to submit accounting reports with the Oklahoma State Department of Education.
Members of the board agreed their most urgent concern, though, is the quality of student instruction. They compared the situation multiple times to a dire medical emergency. 
“It’s like medical triage,” board member William Pearson said during the meeting. “If the patient’s not breathing, you’ve got to get them air, and if they’re bleeding, you’ve got to stop the bleeding. Along those same lines, you’ve got to get teachers into those classrooms.”
The school’s founder, Dawn Bowles, said after the meeting she looks forward to speaking with the statewide board and “wasn’t given that opportunity today.” She declined to share specifics of what she’d like to say to the board, who did not invite her to give remarks during its discussion Monday.

Several of the school’s parents and community supporters attended the board meeting at the Oklahoma History Center. Bowles described PTPLA as a “school for the community and by the community” that’s making a difference in its students’ lives.
“We’re going to keep moving and pushing,” she said. “We’ve had hurdle after hurdle, but we’ve jumped each one successfully. That’s what we do. We don’t stop. So, I look forward to the opportunity to speak.”
The chairperson of PTPLA’s school board, Sharri Coleman, spoke in a public comment portion of the meeting to highlight the school’s achievements, awards and college acceptances in its first year of operation. Enrollment, though, “was our steepest hill” to climb, she said.
Public schools, including charters, receive state funding based on the number of students they enroll. Failing to meet expected enrollment could cause a budget shortfall.
The Oklahoma State Board of Education approved the school’s concept in April 2024 and permitted it to open four months later — an unusually short amount of preparation time compared to most newly approved charter schools. Even at the time of approval, state Education Department staff openly expressed concerns about the school’s financial plan.
The Statewide Charter School Board, which requires an 18-month runway before opening a new charter school, inherited oversight of PTPLA from the state Board of Education last year because of changes to Oklahoma law.
“The school opened four months after their approval, and they could have waited another year,” statewide board chairperson Brian Shellem said after the meeting. “We might be having a totally different discussion if that were the case.”
PTPLA budget records show the school finished the previous fiscal year on June 30 with a $274,222 deficit.
Financial constraints led to a reduction in school staff a few months ago, said Skyler Lusnia, the statewide board’s financial compliance officer.

School leaders have said they plan to rehire teachers when more state funding comes through in January, and those who were laid off are volunteering at PTPLA in the meantime, Lusnia said in a presentation to the board.
Board staff have been looking into issues at the school since the spring, Lusnia said, but concerns grew after three recent visits to PTPLA indicated a “clear lack of student engagement and lack of rigor.”
The statewide board’s executive director, Rebecca Wilkinson, said she observed students with their computers open but not logged into their schoolwork. She said other students had their heads down, were on their cellphones or were laying down during her visits.
“We did see the one remaining teacher that is on staff on all three visits working directly with students,” Wilkinson told the board. “Instruction was concerning, but with 115 students and one teacher, that’s problematic.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) has launched a pilot program offering landlords free monthly transit passes to share with their tenants this holiday season.
Announced Monday, RIPTA’s Residential Transit Pilot Program lets landlords who own or manage at least 10 units near a bus route apply online for December and January passes. The initiative is intended to “promote sustainable travel choices and reduce reliance on personal vehicles,” according to the agency.
“By partnering directly with multifamily property owners and managers, we’re helping residents experience the convenience and value of public transportation in communities that are already transit-accessible,” CEO Christopher Durand said in a statement.
Covering the cost of the pass purchases is the remainder of a $145,000 allocation from the state’s Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council in October 2024 toward “growing transit ridership.”
Similar free passes have been earmarked for travelers who fly into Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport in the council’s fiscal 2026 plan approved in mid-September.
The council’s fiscal 2025 plan aims to boost ridership by lowering the cost of RIPTA transit passes purchased by employers, property owners, and social service agencies for their employees, tenants, and clients.
RIPTA is already coordinating with area employers to boost revenue. In January, the agency extended its 10x and 28 routes to align with shift schedules at the new Amazon Fulfillment Center off Route 6 in Johnston. In return, Amazon agreed to pay $90,000 annually over the next decade to cover employee fares.
In May, RIPTA announced that the Omni Providence Hotel had agreed to partially subsidize fares for 216 employees who work at the hotel. 
Increasing ridership has been an elusive goal for state leaders in recent years, as levels still remain below pre-pandemic levels.
In fiscal year 2024, the most recent agency data available, fixed-route buses served more than 12.6 million passengers, across more than 58 statewide routes. In fiscal year 2019, RIPTA buses provided around 16.4 million passenger trips.
Tenants who receive a monthly pass from their landlords will find fewer buses running this holiday season, as the agency in September enacted sweeping service reductions — cutting schedule spans, reducing frequency, and eliminating segments on 46 of its 67 routes.
The cuts were part of a cost-cutting measure meant to avert bus driver layoffs due to an initial $32.6 million dollar budget shortfall mostly filled by the General Assembly and last-minute “budget framework” from Gov. Dan McKee.
RIPTA’s financial outlook doesn’t appear any better next year. Last year’s spending request projects a $39.8 million deficit for the fiscal year starting July 1, 2026. RIPTA’s board of directors is likely to review the agency’s spending request for the upcoming fiscal year when it meets on Dec. 4, 2025.

Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) and John James (R-Shelby Twp.), for votes that cut funding to health care, food assistance and veterans’ affairs programs, in a press conference hosted by Michigan Families for Fair Care on Veterans’ Day. 
“Even after service, I think a lot of veterans just have this inherent or developed sense that we need to take care of our fellow citizens,” said Steve Monti, an Army veteran from the 7th Congressional District. “I just can’t understand how Tom Barrett can lose that, or maybe he never had it, because the only people he’s taking care of are his donors.”
Barrett and James are Army veterans themselves — a fact that Monti said, as someone represented by Barrett makes his votes even more hurtful. 
“I just don’t understand how Tom Barrett can see his people, and just the anticipation of these cuts coming into effect, that he’s already voted for, is causing real world consequences, and he’s holding firm, and he’s hiding from his constituents,” he said. “Tom Barrett has yet to hold one town hall in person, and he knows that none of his constituents support him, and he hides behind the fact that he’s a veteran and he’s a disgrace.”

Sean McLaughlin, another constituent of Barrett’s and a Marine Corps veteran, noted that Medicaid is crucial for filling in gaps in veteran health care systems, such as providing dental care that would otherwise be excluded. 
But things are getting worse, McLaughlin continued. Mental health care for veterans is being limited to 20 sessions, according to reports received by Common Defense, a progressive veterans’ advocacy group that he is a part of. Rural hospitals, including one in Carson City, Mich., he said, will close without Medicaid funding, which will harm not only veterans but every resident of the area. 
“Really listen, Representative Tom Barrett. Fund SNAP and healthcare, not billionaires,” McLaughlin said. “That’s what we need. That’s what this community needs, and that’s your job. Do it. Side with the veterans, side with your community, and not the interests.”
Joel Rutherford, an Air Force veteran and resident of Warren, Mich., in the 10th Congressional District, added that in working with other veterans in the area, he regularly sees veterans who rely on Medicaid for their health care because they do not qualify for or cannot access VA health care. 
“The ‘Big Billionaires Bill’ stripped work requirement exemptions from over 300,000 veterans nationwide. That’s 38,000 that are in Michigan,” Rutherford said, referring to the One Big Beautiful Bill that passed this summer. “I see veterans in Macomb County who are trying to live on $1,000 a month or less, and yet you want to cut things for them.”
“Cutting Medicaid means cutting lifelines for veterans struggling with PTSD, addiction and chronic conditions,” he added. “I expect better from veterans and obviously John James and Tom Barrett have totally forgotten about us.”
Michigan Families for Fair Care also showed a new ad campaign featuring Monti, which will air in Barrett’s district. 
“I was a gunner in Iraq. Our convoy was hit twice with IEDs,” Monti says in the video. “20 years later, I rely on the VA to survive. I feel betrayed when I see Tom Barrett cut veterans’ health care benefits to give tax breaks to billionaires. It’s just a spit in our face that he’s going to just abandon that many veterans.”
While neither Barrett nor James’ offices were available to comment due to the Veterans Day holiday, Barrett has previously expressed support for veterans services, having called on the VA in March to “review and reconsider” workforce reductions at the agency in the wake of plans to cut 80,000 positions. He also introduced legislation to maintain essential benefits, including health care, for veterans through the government shutdown, although the bill was never taken up. 
Similarly, James co-sponsored a bill in March to support veteran families’ access to mental health care, peer support, and other resources, although it also remains in committee.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)NEW PORT RICHEY — While Florida lawmakers continue to consider reducing or eliminating property taxes, Pasco County state legislators learned Monday that they would need to find an alternative source of funding to keep up services for residents updating motor vehicle records.
Pasco County Tax Collector Mike Fasano said that 95% of the work his staff provides involve motor vehicle services, for which they receive a small percentage of the fees paid, but that’s not nearly enough to cover his costs. Those losses, he said, are made up through property taxes.
“Our money comes from the services we provide,” Fasano told the six Republicans attending the Pasco County legislative delegation meeting at Pasco-Hernando State College. “So, if you’re going to reduce or take away property taxes, that’s great. But someone’s going to have to fill that void of my budget of $20 million a year, because I still have to serve those 50,000 to 60,000 people a month in those five offices.”
In a follow-up interview, Fasano, a Republican who served in the Florida House and Senate for nearly 20 years (1994-2013), said hypothetically that if the state of Florida bans all property taxes, he’d need approximately $23 million to offset the deficit his office would run annually.

Tax collectors in Florida are considered “fee-based” officers, responsible for collecting ad valorem taxes set at the local level, including those by special districts, state agencies, and county commissions. They are responsible for issuing vehicle license plates, driver’s licenses, title transfers, vehicle registrations, and other essential services.
State law provides a tiered commission structure for county tax collectors based on the total taxes collected, with a 2% commission on the balance of taxes collected on behalf of each taxing district or special assessment district.
Fasano said his office loses approximately $4 million in providing those services and that that’s the situation for every tax collector in the state.
“So, it’s important that you understand that whatever you do with property taxes will have a huge impact on the tax collector offices,” he told lawmakers.
Florida House Republicans have offered at least seven proposed constitutional amendments to address property taxes during the 2026 legislative session, but Gov. Ron DeSantis has lambasted those proposals, saying he would prefer to place a single initiative before the voters in November 2026.
“It’s got to be very clearly written and give people a chance to vote for it,” the governor said at the University of South Florida campus in Tampa on Oct. 29. “What you don’t do is put five [constitutional amendments] on there … because they’re going to be written in ways that are not going to be clear — and so there’s going to create confusion on the ballot.”
At the conclusion of the three hour-plus meeting, members of the Pasco delegation weighed in on the topic, acknowledging the discussions may prove heated, but promising it will benefit those now paying taxes on their homestead properties.
“We’re fighting to bring you home money in your pocket, and it’s probably not going to be pretty for a little while longer, but, at the end of the day, it’s better than fighting to raise your taxes, like you probably see in every other state,” said Republican Rep. Jeff Holcomb, who represents portions of both Pasco and Hernando counties.
“No state has done this. No state has eliminated property taxes. They’ve done a few things where they give you a $1,000 credit, lower some markers, or raise some exceptions, but no one’s done it. So, if we do it in Florida, and I hope we will, we’ll be setting the precedent again in the state of Florida.”
Ed Hooper, the Senate Appropriations chairman, acknowledged there hasn’t been much action from members of the Florida Senate on property taxes, but said that doesn’t mean the chamber isn’t working on the matter. “Trust me that the Senate is studying every component of what impact each of our proposals will have on 23.5 million Floridians,” he said.
“We’re trying to give you money back, someway,” added Republican Rep. Randy Maggard. “So, we’re looking at costs at every way we possibly can. So, it’s not really a bad thing, but we don’t want to be stupid and cut something that will cut costs or services. … We’ve got a long way to go on this.”
Meanwhile, Fasano said, it’s important for Gov. DeSantis to understand what severely reducing or outright eliminating property taxes could mean in terms of services local governments provide to Floridians on a daily basis.
“I would love to be able to sit down with the governor’s staff and explain this,” he said. “You want to reduce property taxes? I’m all for that. Just make sure you understand how it’s going to affect certain constitutional officers that have to still provide a service each day in their office.”

She sued, arguing that West Virginia's law violated the Constitution and Title IX as applied to her. (Photo courtesy of ACLU-WV)Attorneys representing a transgender student athlete in Harrison County, West Virginia have filed their argument in a U.S. Supreme Court challenge of a state law that prohibits her from participating in her school’s track program. 
Attorneys for 15-year-old Becky Pepper-Jackson filed the response with the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday. She’s challenging West Virginia’s Save Women’s Sport Act, which former Gov. Jim Justice signed into law in 2021. Pepper-Jackson is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of West Virginia, Lambda Legal, and Cooley LLP.
The Supreme Court announced in July it would hear the state of West Virginia’s appeal of a Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that blocked the law. The lower court found that the law violates transgender students’ rights under Title IX, a federal civil rights law prohibiting discrimination based on sex in education programs. 
“I play for my school for the same reason other kids on my track team do — to make friends, have fun, and challenge myself through practice and teamwork,” Pepper-Jackson said in an ACLU news release Monday. “And all I’ve ever wanted was the same opportunities as my peers. Instead, I’ve had my rights and my life debated by politicians who’ve never even met me but want to stop me from playing sports with my friends. 
“I know this case isn’t just about me, or even just about sports,” she said. “It’s just one part of a plan to push transgender people like me out of public life entirely. I’m proud to stand up alongside my mom for what I believe and who I am and I want other transgender kids to know they aren’t alone.”
In a September filing, attorneys for the state of West Virginia argued that transgender athletes are a threat to the promise of equity in women’s sports from Title IX.
“Male athletes identifying as female are increasingly competing in women’s sports, erasing the opportunities Title IX ensured,” they wrote. “Women and girls have lost places on sports teams, surrendered spots on championship podiums, and suffered injuries competing against bigger, faster and stronger males. For too many women and girls, the ‘thrill of victory’ is gone.”
The president of the NCAA recently told Congress, “less than 10”  — and not all of them transgender women — of the more than 500,000 college athletes in the country are openly transgender.
The high court announced it would hear the case in July. At that time, state attorney general J.B. McCuskey said that the people of West Virginia know it’s unfair to let male athletes compete against women.
“That’s why we passed this commonsense law preserving women’s sports for women,” McCuskey said in a July news release. “We are confident the Supreme Court will uphold the Save Women’s Sports Act because it complies with the U.S. Constitution and complies with Title IX. And most importantly: it protects women and girls by ensuring the playing field is safe and fair.”
Former Gov. Patrick Morrisey represented the state in the case during his time as attorney general. He said in a July news release he was pleased the court would take up the case. 
“I am optimistic that after hearing the case, the Supreme Court will restore sanity to athletics and allow West Virginia to enforce its commonsense law that prevents boys from competing in girl’s sports,” Morrisey said.
The Supreme Court has also said it would hear a challenge to Idaho’s transgender athlete ban. 
According to the ACLU, 27 states have banned transgender youth from playing school sports since 2020.

Jeffrey Jack Bates, 42, of Indianola, is criminally charged with one count of felony first-degree theft, one count of tampering with records, one count of identity theft and eight counts of prohibited acts involving controlled substances.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. A trial date has yet to be scheduled, although a pretrial conference is planned for Dec. 22, 2025.

According to records related to a search warrant authorized for Bates’ home and vehicle, Indianola police received information in April 2025 from the Indianola Hy-Vee store indicating Bates had been fired a few days earlier and was the focus of an investigation into the possible theft of drugs.
According to the warrant application, store management believed Bates had been creating phony prescriptions for medications using the name of actual medical providers and the names of both real and fictious patients, filling the prescriptions and billing the cost to insurance providers, and then later taking the bottles of medications out of the store at the end of his shift.
The store alleged it had compiled video of Bates going through those steps and had correlated the timing of those actions to Bates’ computer entries.
The warrant and other court records indicate store officials believed at least 3,703 pills — many of them for Adderall, a narcotic, and the drug Vyvanse, a narcotic stimulant — may have been misappropriated.
In the application for the search warrant, a police officer reported that it was “important to note that Bates was on his cell phone a majority of this time and appeared to be texting/communicating with someone.”
According to the warrant application, Hy-Vee personnel indicated they confronted Bates about the alleged theft and that while he admitted creating the phony bottle labels, he asserted he did so not to steal medications but to deal with discrepancies in the pharmacy’s drug inventory.
Court records indicate that on April 23, 2025, police executed the search warrant at Bates’ home and seized pill bottles, prescription paperwork and a cell phone. A second warrant was later obtained for the contents of the phone.
On May 28, 2025, criminal charges were filed in the case, with police alleging Bates had created phony prescriptions in the names of 55 actual patients and four nonexistent patients. In one such instance, Bates allegedly used the name of one patient to create six fake prescriptions for more than 300 Adderall and Vyvanse pills.
Police allege Bates also used the names of at least seven different doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants in creating the fabricated prescriptions. The Hy-Vee store has claimed the total value of the drugs at issue is $71,231.
The Iowa Board of Pharmacy alleges Bates is suspected of not only theft, but insurance fraud, with fraudulent billings made to insurers to account for the pharmacy’s cost of dispensing the drugs.
After the board charged Bates with knowingly making misleading, deceptive, untrue or fraudulent representations in the practice of pharmacy, and with diverting prescription drugs from a pharmacy for personal use or distribution, Bates recently agreed to surrender his license.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) A new report from the Iowa Food System Coalition shows that Iowa has 1,461 local food businesses spread across the state.
Coalition staff said the report shows the economic viability of local food businesses across the levels of the food system. 
Bob Ferguson, who serves on the Farm and Food Business priority team with the coalition, said the report showed an increase in the number of on-farm stores, farm stands and local food businesses from previous estimations.
“There’s more there than one would suspect,” he said. “There needs to be a lot more, but there’s already robust local infrastructure that interacts with itself to provide local goods and services.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The businesses, which include food farmers, processors, food hubs and more, are spread across the state, with greater concentration around Iowa’s largest cities. 
The majority, or 1,074, of the businesses are farmers and food producers. Meat and food processors make up the next highest category, with 189 meat processors and 47 food processors in the state. 
The report identified between 10 and 26, per category, of local wineries, restaurants, retail stores, groceries and dairy manufacturers in Iowa. 
The remaining categories had fewer than 10 businesses each identified in the state: grade A dairies, breweries, coffee, food hubs, raw milk, uncategorized, grain mills, caterers, distributors and private chef services. 
The report defined local food businesses as producers that sell direct to consumer, strategic supply chain partners and some large volume distribution services that make “substantial and effective efforts to produce or market source-identified local foods.” 
Ferguson said the food system has become heavy at the top level and at at the small-scale level, but has been “hollowed” in the middle. 
This report that shows the number and spread of local food businesses, he said, shows that “infrastructure at the middle is still there.” Ferguson predicts the number of businesses will only continue to grow in the state.
“It doesn’t make sense for Iowa to import 90-95% of our food when we have the best ground … We don’t in any way need to compete with commodity production to be very significant,” Ferguson said. 
In addition to providing local food infrastructure and economic impact, Ferguson said these local business also provide a “powerful sense of placemaking” or the “coolness factor” that helps people “feel great about being where they are,” which he said is important for rural development. 
The report analyzed online directories, like the state’s Choose Iowa network, various food hubs, farmers market databases and registries for licensed dairy and meat processing plants. Because the report only makes use of regularly updated online lists, the coalition notes it is “likely an under-count” of local food businesses. 
The coalition hopes future iterations of the report will also include business that don’t have an online presence.
“I feel very certain based on what I’ve seen … that this is going to be a growing percentage of our food, and a very significant and valuable element of economic development,” Ferguson said.

,DC,2025-11-11 18:24:15+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Hemp growers, retailers targeted in section of government shutdown legislation",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/hemp-growers-retailers-targeted-section-government-shutdown-legislation,,"WASHINGTON — Kentucky’s two U.S. senators sparred this week over the future of the country’s hemp industry — one arguing that a provision attached to the package that will reopen the government will close a problematic loophole and the other contending the language will regulate the industry “to death.”Sen. Mitch McConnell ultimately prevailed and was able to keep the section in the Agriculture appropriations bill cracking down on hemp that Sen. Rand Paul tried to remove during floor debate. Both are Republicans.The appropriations bill is riding along with a stopgap spending bill that will end the government shutdown and is expected to be voted on by the House as soon as Wednesday. The hemp measure has raised alarm in farm states benefiting from a robust hemp growing industry.Hemp plants have 0.3% or less of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, while cannabis or marijuana plants have higher concentrations of that substance, which is what gives users the “high or stoned” feeling. A summary of the bill put together by Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins’ staff says the new language would prevent “the unregulated sale of intoxicating hemp-based or hemp-derived products, including Delta-8, from being sold online, in gas stations, and corner stores, while preserving non-intoxicating CBD and industrial hemp products.”The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has a warning page on its website cautioning “that delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by the FDA for safe use in any context.”Farm Bill originsMcConnell explained he is targeting hemp because its uses have expanded beyond what was intended. ""I led the effort to legalize industrial hemp through the 2014 pilot program and the 2018 Farm Bill,"" McConnell said. ""Unfortunately, companies have exploited a loophole in the 2018 legislation by taking legal amounts of THC from hemp and turning it into intoxicating substances, and then marketing it to children in candy-like packaging and selling it in easily accessible places, like gas stations and convenience stores all across our country.""McConnell said the new provision, which won’t take effect until a year after the bill becomes law, would “keep these dangerous products out of the hands of children while preserving the hemp industry for farmers.”Paul and Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley urged their colleagues to remove that McConnell provision from the larger spending package, but were unsuccessful. “This is the most thoughtless, ignorant proposal to an industry that I've seen in a long, long time,” Paul said. The new language would change the definition of what makes a hemp plant legal, a move Paul said would mean “every plant in the country will have to be destroyed.” “This bill's per-serving THC content limit would make illegal any hemp product that contains more than point four milligrams,” Paul said. “That would be nearly 100% of the existing market. That amounts to an effective ban, because the limit is so low that the products intended to manage pain or anxiety will lose their effect.”State laws said to be nullifiedThe legislation, Paul added, will negatively impact the nearly two dozen states that have set higher limits on hemp production.“Currently, Maine limits THC to three milligrams per serving. That will be overruled. My home state limits THC to five milligrams in beverages; that will be overruled. Minnesota, Utah, Louisiana also have five milligrams per serving. Alabama and Georgia have 10 milligrams. Tennessee has 15 milligrams,” Paul said. “The bill before us nullifies all these state laws.”Merkley said the new provision in the larger spending package would eliminate the hemp industry, which Congress took steps to establish more than a decade ago.“I support my other colleague from Kentucky who doesn't want intoxicated products produced from hemp,” Merkley said. “But the definition that is in this bill does far more than that, and it has to be fixed. So for now, it needs to be stripped out.”The Senate voted 76-24 to table, or set aside, Paul’s amendment after McConnell moved to block it from being taken up directly. The Agriculture funding bill is one of three full-year government spending bills included in the stopgap spending package that will end the government shutdown once the House approves the measure later this week and President Donald Trump signs the bill. Trade group warns of hundreds of thousands of jobs affectedHemp Industry & Farmers of America Executive Director Brian Swensen wrote in a statement released last week that McConnell's provision would have a devastating impact on the industry and its workers. ""Congress legalized hemp, Americans built an industry, and now Washington wants to pull the rug out from under hardworking farmers and small business owners. The industry wants a solid regulatory package that protects kids, but instead, Congress wants to place industry-killing caps on cannabinoids. Congress is not listening to the industry they created — they’re dismantling an industry with over 325,000 jobs and driving consumers to an unregulated, unsafe, and untaxed black market.""",,,,2025-11-11 14:01:56.661826

North Dakota Supreme Court chief justice not seeking another term in top post

Fair McEvers has served as a justice since 2014, when she was appointed by former Gov. Jack Dalrymple to fill a vacancy left by former Justice Mary Muehlen Maring. Fair McEvers was then elected to the court to serve a two-year term in 2016 and a 10-year term in 2018.
She previously pursued the position of chief justice in 2019.
Fair McEvers was formerly a state district court judge and North Dakota labor commissioner.
Tufte was elected to a 10-year term on the North Dakota Supreme Court in 2016. Prior to his service on the high court, he was legal counsel for Dalrymple and a state district court judge.   
Jensen was elected chief justice in December 2019 and reelected to another five-year term in 2020. In a letter to the court system last week, Jensen said he would not seek reelection to the position when his term as chief expires at the end of 2025. He will continue serving as a justice.
Jensen’s letter did not provide a reason for not seeking another term.

Maia Jackson should have been cranking out a research paper for her communications class. Instead, she found herself queuing up at a food pantry to secure groceries for her household amid the nation’s longest government shutdown.
“I walked out with a shopping cart full of food,” the 25-year-old college senior said. “I could barely carry it all. I got cereal. I got some frozen meat, hamburger buns. I got a bag of black beans, and then I got a bag of rice.”
Finding a package of chicken strips, a dish she knew her picky 2-year-old daughter would actually eat, almost made her cry, Jackson said. She expects the combination of perishable, bagged and canned foods to last them a month. By then, she hopes her Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  payments — widely known as food stamps — will have resumed.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

On Nov. 1, SNAP benefits ground to a halt during the federal budget impasse that began a month earlier, with President Donald Trump’s administration refusing to fully fund these payments, a matter now tied up in court. Even as the Senate has reached a framework deal that leaves lawmakers and the White House a step closer to ending the shutdown, the disruption in benefits has revealed how fragile the social safety net is for vulnerable Americans. That includes single parents and young adults experiencing food insecurity, a problem that occurs when people lack regular access to the nourishment needed to sustain their health.
An estimated 1.1 million college students rely on SNAP, including parents like Jackson, who attends North Dakota State University in Fargo. For such students, a delayed SNAP payment isn’t a mere hiccup, but a serious setback that can imperil their education, their health and stability for their children, experts contend.
“It’s such a distraction for me as a single mom in school,” Jackson said. “I don’t have any bandwidth to give to trying to find food at pantries.”
She tried to minimize the time she spent at the food pantry last week by making an appointment first, but she was still one of a couple of dozen people in line. The visit prevented her from completing her research paper by its due date, which will likely result in her grade being docked. Jackson, who has so far maintained a 4.0 grade point average, isn’t happy about that prospect, but with her family members an hour away and her child’s father mostly out of the picture, she had to prioritize food over her education.

No college student should have to choose between a basic need and school, said Deborah Martin, a senior policy associate for The Institute for College Access & Success, a nonprofit that advocates for college access and affordability.
“A lot of students have to make these daily tough decisions where they’re wondering, ‘Where am I going to get my next meal from?’ instead of focusing on homework, on classwork,” Martin said. “We know that when students have these unmet basic needs such as food insecurity, they’re more likely to struggle academically, less likely to persist from semester to semester, and in some cases, may even drop out of college altogether.”
Roughly 60% of college students are women. For the most marginalized students, the risk of quitting school due to food insecurity may be even greater. The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan federal agency that provides fact-based information to Congress, reported last year that about 80% of food-insecure students are nontraditional — meaning their parents don’t financially support them, they didn’t begin college immediately after high school or they are caring for dependents. Moreover, the 2023-2024 Student Basic Needs Survey Report from the Hope Center, a research center at Temple University focused on the food, housing and health of college students, found that around three-quarters of parenting, Black and Indigenous students experience insecurity related to a basic need.
Most of these students, the Government Accountability Office discovered, do not sign up for services like SNAP, and those who do may hesitate to discuss their food insecurity. As a mom and a slightly older student who works part-time, Jackson has felt largely alone on campus as SNAP benefits have paused. Her classmates don’t appear to share her anxiety over the shutdown, if they know about it at all.

“A lot of the kids that I’m in class with, they’re not in the same circumstance,” Jackson said. “It’s weird to see a lot of people just carrying on as usual.”
Since most of her classmates — about an even percentage of NDSU students are women and men — are childfree and on the school meal plan, she doesn’t want to be a “downer” by bringing up her difficulties. For the same reason, she didn’t explain to her professor why her paper was late. “I didn’t want to tell him, ‘Oh, I couldn’t write it because I was standing in the food pantry line’ because it just sounds so sad,” she said. “What’s he supposed to say? I don’t want him to feel bad for me. I don’t want to be pitied.”
But faking normal could come at a high cost for college students who don’t reach out for help. Martin fears these young adults will resort to using high-interest payment plans or acquire credit card debt just to afford groceries.
“The longer that students and other SNAP participants don’t receive their funds, this is just more days that students are going to have to make these difficult decisions,” she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Some college administrators are taking action. When the shutdown began, Compton College President and CEO Keith Curry contacted Everytable, a food company that offers inexpensive made-from-scratch meals via carryout storefronts and a delivery service. The college, about 18 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, has partnered with Everytable for seven years to provide all students — approximately 6,000 of whom attend full time — with one nutritious free meal on weekdays.
The federal government crisis prompted Curry and Everytable CEO Sam Polk to scale up that program so SNAP-recipient and economically disadvantaged students didn’t suffer during the shutdown.
“We need to do something. Can we split the cost?” Curry recalled asking Polk. “I think if we double the meals, at least they get another meal for the day.”
On November 5, Compton College’s most underprivileged students began getting two free meals per day, or 10 per week. The need for such an intervention there is substantial: A 2025 basic needs survey of students found that 81 percent of them experience at least one form of insecurity related to a basic need. That includes signs of food insecurity such as skipping meals, reducing meal sizes or fearing they will run out of food. Most Compton College students are moderately food insecure, the survey revealed, indicating persistent hardship. Women make up 61 percent of the student body.
“Right now, students have other stress, and what we’re doing to them is adding more stress,” Curry said of the shutdown. “They still want to do well in classes, but now they don’t have food.”
Together, Compton College and Everytable have the resources to supply students with 10 weekly meals for a month, Curry said. The students are deeply grateful for the additional provisions, according to Dee Garrett, who oversees Everytable’s operation at the college.
“What better way to start your studies than with a stomach that’s full?” Garrett asked. “You don’t have to think about, ‘Oh, my God, my stomach. I can’t concentrate or focus.’”
Asked what impact he hopes the scaled-up program makes, Curry said he’s more interested in letting students know they’re not alone.
“It’s not about the impact. It’s about our students knowing that we were there for them during this time,” he said. “In our community, when students need us most, we have to step up and be there for them, and they’re never going to forget that.”
Martin applauds the efforts of colleges and K-12 schools, which have connected students and their families to food banks, to curb food insecurity during the shutdown. But she also advocates for long-term policies to ensure students have enough food to eat. That includes the Enhance Access to SNAP Act, proposed legislation to remove the barriers that prevent economically disadvantaged college students from utilizing benefits generally — not just during the current crisis.
However, Martin continued, “the most important thing that we can do right now in this moment is for these SNAP benefits to be fully funded and for them to go out to students as soon as possible.”

Back in Fargo, Jackson has refocused her attention on her coursework now that she has a month’s worth of food. Still, she worries about the people who couldn’t make it to a pantry or that the government will cut other social services she needs. She currently earns $400 monthly working part time as an academic journal editor. The job, which she performs remotely, allows her to attend school and be her daughter’s primary caretaker when the toddler is not in day care.
“If they cut child care, if they cut these programs I rely on, I would have to drop out of school,” Jackson said. “But I’m trying to give my daughter a better life than that.”
Jackson is majoring in university studies with a pre-law emphasis, a dramatic shift from her life before motherhood when she dropped out of school and struggled with addiction. Getting pregnant inspired her to undergo a transformation, which she largely credits to the Jeremiah Program. The national nonprofit provides single mothers with support for college, child care and housing, and it recently started a campaign to raise $190,000 to cover essential needs for families who have lost SNAP and other benefits because of the shutdown. The organization estimates that single-parent families represent nearly a third of families in the United States, with 80 percent of those headed by mothers.
Jackson has been deeply disturbed to see the misperceptions that abound about mothers like herself. She’s encountered online commenters who have characterized SNAP recipients as “welfare queens.”
If she could confront such individuals in person, Jackson would emphasize how much value mothers add to society. “And on top of it… we are all in school and working, too,” she said. “The insinuation is that we’re just scammers, freeloaders, when, in reality, I’m working very hard every day to hopefully not need these supports.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-11 17:46:54+00:00,Mississippi Today,People are regularly wounded at this Jackson apartment complex. Suing the landlord has only gotten harder.,Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/11/wounded-jackson-landlord-lawsuits/,"For years, legal battles routinely led to monetary settlements for the victims of violence at Rebelwood or their family, but that changed after the Mississippi Landowners Protection Act.","On a Sunday afternoon in 2017, a masked assailant came from around a building, shooting and killing Teresa Hughes’ son, Kendrick, as he stood talking to two friends at Pine Ridge Gardens Apartments in southeast Jackson.  
A few months later, four John Does riding through the parking lot shot at Christine Christon, almost striking her minor son who was sitting in a car seat. 
Christon dove from the spray of bullets, but the shooters hit Arsentell Burton 13 times, permanently incapacitating him. Burton’s pastor had dropped him off at the complex so he could help his uncle move. 
After the shootings, Hughes, Christon and Burton did as dozens of Jacksonians before them: They hired a lawyer and filed suit, alleging out-of-state landlords failed to provide adequate security, fostering an “atmosphere of violence” at the federally funded complex commonly known as Rebelwood.
For years, these legal battles routinely led to monetary settlements, providing a modicum of justice for some of Rebelwood’s more than 400 tenants living in deadly and dire conditions, according to 15 lawsuits filed since 2010 that Mississippi Today reviewed. 
But in 2019, lawmakers passed a bill known as the Mississippi Landowners Protection Act that has all but shielded landlords from liability for violent crimes committed on their properties. It has done so by limiting what constitutes an “atmosphere of violence” – a legal term describing conditions in which the property owner should have known injuries were likely and taken steps to prevent them.
Since then, local attorneys say liability has been harder to prove — and accountability less achievable — even if the landlord has neglected to take reasonable steps to secure the complex, such as hiring security, fixing broken lights, maintaining cameras or removing trespassers from the property. 
Nicole Gibson launched such a battle. The Jackson native filed her lawsuit in 2022 after her son, Quindarius, was killed in the Rebelwood parking lot while the two were running an errand for family staying there. The incident occurred just one year after the Landowners Protection Act passed.
She went up against the companies responsible for the property at the time of her son’s death: The Texas-based owner, Rebelwood Apartments, and a New Jersey-based behemoth management company, Michaels Management Affordable. Last month, a Hinds County Circuit Court judge granted a motion to dismiss the case from a lawyer representing the companies – a hurdle Gibson’s attorney, Phillip Hearn, fears they won’t overcome if he appeals. 
In an email, an attorney for Michaels Management Affordable said the company’s policy is not to comment on pending litigation. The Texas company that previously owned Rebelwood has shuttered. 
Gibson, 43, struggles with the notion of attaining justice for her son, nicknamed “Bubba,” whom she said had never been in trouble with the law – but for one time she took him to the county youth detention center for disrespecting her. He had graduated high school, worked at McDonald’s for years and played football for a local amateur team called the Magnolia State Knights.
“They just knew from the life that he lived that he was not supposed to die,” she said. “I tell everybody, ‘It’s a hard pill to swallow.’” 
This is not to say plaintiffs lawsuits have done much to address the chronically poor conditions facing tenants who live in areas of Jackson with higher crime rates. Rebelwood remains one of the most notorious places to live in the city. Residents there continue to experience problems on a daily basis, from criminal incidents to grim living conditions of the kind that led Mayor John Horhn to convene a housing task force earlier this year.

In a recent meeting, task force members lauded the Landowners Protection Act for helping landlords weather the fallout of the decision by insurance companies, which were losing money to settlements, to discontinue coverage of claims stemming from violent crimes at complexes in Jackson.
“Every claim I’ve ever had on my properties is cumulative, it’s passed on. It’s like a credit check or a credit report,” said Jennifer Welch, a Jackson-based property manager and vice chair of the city’s housing task force. “It’s very unfortunate.” 
Meanwhile, Jacksonians who’ve been harmed at Rebelwood or lost their loved ones have little recourse but to file these lawsuits, known in the legal world as “premises liability” cases. Earlier this year, a woman filed suit after she was struck by a bullet that entered through her living room window, according to her complaint. Her case is pending.
“You can’t have all the laws be for the consumer, because then people can’t make money. I get it,” said Catouche Body, an attorney who represented Christon. “I just think the Landowners Protection Act goes a step too far.” 
Former state Rep. Mark Baker, a Republican from Brandon who championed the bill, said he did not recall the Landowners Protection Act well enough to comment on its impact.

Before the 2019 act, lawyers frequently secured settlements in these cases. Hearn has several under his belt. When the parties couldn’t agree, the cases went to juries who were sympathetic to victims. In 2009, a jury awarded a $3 million judgment to the family of a woman whose body was found at Rebelwood (though the Mississippi Supreme Court later reversed that decision, ruling evidence she’d been killed elsewhere was withheld from trial). 
But under the new law, Hearn and other attorneys must prove a landlord “impelled” the criminal conduct of the man who shot Gibson – a term plaintiffs lawyers told Mississippi Today they’re not sure how to interpret.
“What the hell does that mean?” Hearn said. 
Attorneys must also show that violent conduct at the property in the three years leading up to an incident has resulted in three or more felony arraignments.
This might seem like an easy standard to meet at Rebelwood, where police have received calls of more than 100 shootings since the beginning of 2024, according to dispatch records obtained by Mississippi Today. 
But when Hearn tried to gather the data, he said he hit a wall. Even though Rebelwood has been the site of numerous arrests for violent crimes in the three years leading up to Quindarius’s death, Hearn said he could not identify three felony indictments, the legal step proceeding an arraignment.
“I’ve subpoenaed the Hinds County District Attorney, the Hinds County attorney, the Jackson city attorney, the sheriff’s department, the Jackson Police Department, and every one of them says, ‘We do not maintain this information,’” Hearn said. 
Where he might have once convinced a jury of pervasive violence using a 911 log – which shows roughly two calls a day from Rebelwood in recent years – or social media videos of fights at the complex that routinely go viral, Hearn said this kind of proof does not meet the redefined legal standard. 
Hearn has already lost one case against the complex on behalf of another mother whose son was shot at Rebelwood while visiting his girlfriend. He can add Gibson’s case to the list. Hinds County Circuit Court Judge Eleanor Faye Peterson dismissed the case last month after Hearn could not find three arraignments.
“It’s a different age,” Hearn said. “And guess what, Rebelwood is more dangerous than ever.” 
“Maybe left over from the 4th of July or maybe not,” said Cleveland “Bozo” Colbert regarding shell casings picked up from the parking lot at the Pine Ridge Gardens apartments in south Jackson, Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2025.

Government officials have taken far-reaching action in the past against Rebelwood, which opened in 1980. History lingers in the Civil War-themed street names still surrounding the troubled complex — Rebel Wood, Shiloh, Gray, Champion Hill. 
In 1996, Brad Pigott, then the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi, filed for forfeiture against the owners of the complex, alleging the number of drug complaints at Rebelwood showed they were not complying with federal standards. 
Faced with the threat of losing the property, the owners pledged to install fences and screen applicants, resulting in what Pigott at the time called a “remarkable” turnaround.

Desiree Hensley, the director of the University of Mississippi School of Law’s Low-Income Housing Clinic, said city leaders could take similar action today. The council could seek to condemn Rebelwood for violating nuisance ordinances and force the complex to close until the landlord has improved the property. 
“The local government’s hands are definitely not tied,” she said. 
Kevin Parkinson, the Ward 7 Jackson city council member who represents Rebelwood, said shutting down the complex could send vulnerable people into the street, even as the city needs to do more in addressing its “unacceptable” conditions. 
“Do we have solutions for 450 people to go elsewhere in the city?” Parkinson said. “I’m not sure that we do.” 
Gibson was familiar with Rebelwood long before Quindarius was killed that day in 2020. Her sister had moved there in the late 1990s, around the time Quindarius was born. Her mother moved there a few years later. Gibson remembers kids playing water balloons and basketball and the security guard, Mr. Jimmy, who she said kept the complex in order.
“Mr. Jimmy had developed a relationship with the community out there,” she said. “He did not play.” 
Hiawatha Northington II, a local attorney for Michaels Management Affordable who worked on Gibson’s case, remembers Rebelwood, too, as a place he used to visit friends during undergrad at Jackson State University in the 1990s.
Amenities like the Kroger on Terry Road – now an empty storefront – were close by. 
“Whether you represent plaintiffs, defendants or neither, there are facts about the city of Jackson that are not in dispute and one of them is that areas like Terry Road have been systemically disinvested in for whatever reasons you want to attribute it to,” Northington said. 
Improving conditions at Rebelwood would require a systemic solution, Northington said, which he feels individual lawsuits cannot achieve. 
“Interpersonal conflicts can happen at the Country Club of Jackson just like they can happen at North Hills Apartments,” he said. “Some of those things are beyond what the civil justice system can address.”

Gibson was heading to Rebelwood on the afternoon of Saturday, April 25, 2020 to drop off some clothes to her brother, who was staying there, when Quindarius asked if he could ride with.
She didn’t think it was a good idea. Gibson knew Quindarius was at odds with a group of men at Rebelwood over the outcome of a dice game earlier that week. Quindarius had won $5, but when he tried to collect, the player threatened him. Gibson said she wanted to talk to that player’s parents, but Quindarius begged her not to, claiming the situation had been resolved. 
“Me personally, I’m going to diffuse the situation,” she said. “I will never indulge in a kid’s beef.”

But when they arrived at Rebelwood, the 21-year-old son spotted a friend and told Gibson he was going to stay at the complex.
The mother recounted what happened next – a chaotic series of events that culminated in Quindarius’s killing – in a court filing in her lawsuit against Rebelwood. As she was speaking to her brother’s friend, she said she saw a group heading in Quindarius’s direction. Suddenly, he came storming toward her car, asking if he could borrow his uncle’s gun, telling Gibson he was “tired of them threatening him.” 
She said no. Then she called the police. But instead of aiding Quindarius, Gibson said the officers escorted her off the property. Driving down the highway, she was on the phone with her twin sister, who was at the complex when gunshots rang out.
Gibson said she “snapped.” She characterizes the perpetrators as a “family which plotted his death” and ruminates on how things could have gone differently.
“I could’ve put a gun in my baby’s hand and let him do whatever he wanted to do, and I guarantee he would be home with me today,” she told Mississippi Today.
Without a weapon of his own, Gibson argues no one was there to protect him.
“You’ve got management just sitting out there,” she said. “They’ve got protection for them, but when it comes to the kids and the people living there, a lot of time they get in their car and leave the property because they be scared for themselves.” 
Quindarius’ alleged shooter, 38-year-old Joe Willis, is out on bond, and Gibson is not optimistic that he will be convicted. She said it took years to forgive herself for bringing Quindarius with her to Rebelwood, only doing so after taking a job that sent her across the country, giving her space and time to think. 
She concluded that she was not the only one responsible for her son’s safety that day. But now she feels alone in her pursuit of accountability.
“It’s just me and my attorney,” Gibson said before receiving notification the case had been dismissed.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10152621/MT-Rebelwood-FeatImage-01.jpg,,,2025-11-11 12:57:37.646975

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A handful of county-level officials who were involved in a small-town Kansas newspaper raid in 2023 will pay a cumulative $3 million to three journalists and a city councilor.
In two of the four agreements, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office also crafted a statement admitting regret.
“The Sheriff’s Office wishes to express its sincere regrets to Eric and Joan Meyer and Ruth and Ronald Herbel for its participation in the drafting and execution of the Marion Police Department’s search warrants on their homes and the Marion County Record. This likely would not have happened if established law had been reviewed and applied prior to the execution of the warrants,” the statement reads.
Marion County’s board of commissioners approved agreements Monday with Eric Meyer, the owner and editor of the Marion County Record, and Ruth Herbel, the Marion city councilor whose home was raided in tandem with the newspaper office, and two other journalists. The agreements coincide with consent judgments expected to be submitted in their federal cases against the county.
The county was a secondary player in the raids, in Meyer’s eyes, but the agreements could play a part in the paper’s ongoing cases against the city.
“Everybody involved in this is 100% convinced we are going to go to trial with the city,” Meyer said. “This will make that easier in some regard.”
The county’s agreements with Deb Gruver and Phyllis Zorn, local journalists whose lives were upended by the raids, are more akin to settlements and don’t include admissions of regret.
The county agreed to pay Meyer $1.5 million, Herbel and Zorn $650,000 apiece, and Gruver $250,000, according to copies of the agreements obtained by Kansas Reflector.
Insurance covers most of those funds, but the county must pay Meyer $50,000.
In another lawsuit against former Marion police chief Gideon Cody, who is also facing criminal charges, Gruver settled earlier this year for $235,000.
According to Meyer, Zorn has resigned from her position at the Marion County Record, effective immediately.
Monday’s deals settle the county’s obligations within four federal lawsuits against the city of Marion and Marion County governments and officials in the wake of the raids. Five cases were consolidated into a single federal lawsuit, and the four agreements give the county and the sheriff’s office immunity from any future legal action related to the Aug. 11, 2023, searches and seizures at the Marion County Record, Meyer’s home and Herbel’s home.
The county agreed to make available Marion County Sheriff Jeff Soyez, Detective Aaron Christner, and Undersheriff Larry Starkey for official interviews, which could be used in other legal disputes. Previously, the cases were stalled, preventing interviews from taking place.

Rounds said those bills include seven of his congressionally directed spending requests, also known as earmarks. Four of those are for construction projects at Ellsworth Air Force Base near Rapid City to accommodate the future addition of B-21 bomber planes, which are under development:

$4.8 million for planning and design for a Weapons Generation Facility Dormitory.
$3.5 million for planning and design of a Communications Center.
$4 million for 11 new munitions storage structures.
$5.4 million for two other munitions storage structures.

Rounds’ other earmarks are:

$1.7 million for an aircraft maintenance hangar at Joe Foss Field in Sioux Falls.
$2 million for South Dakota State University’s Cottonwood Field Station renovation and expansion in western South Dakota.
$500,000 for SDSU’s Transient Animal Research Support Facility.

The spending bill passed the Senate on Monday night, with yes votes from Rounds and Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota. The House is expected to clear the legislation for President Donald Trump’s signature later this week, which would end the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history.
Rounds issued a statement saying “it’s now time to move forward and continue working on our regular order appropriations process, but we can’t ignore the devastating effect that six weeks of a government shutdown has had on our nation.” He said thousands of federal workers have gone without pay, millions of families have had the federal benefits they use to feed their children put at risk and the nation’s air travel system has been thrown into chaos.
“It’s my hope that these families who have suffered real damaging effects can move forward with their lives,” Rounds said. “We must work hard in the Senate to prevent a shutdown like this from happening again.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture told states on Saturday to fund 65% of the benefits for SNAP.
The partial November benefit amounts are determined by the USDA. Amounts will vary, based on federal guidance. Some recipients may not receive any benefits due to eligibility requirements.
Clients do not need to take any action to receive the benefits, which will be issued automatically, according to a press release.
More than 680,000 Oklahomans receive the benefits, more commonly known as food stamps.
“Oklahomans stepped up, and they continue to do so,” said Gov. Kevin Stitt. “I’m proud of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services for their tireless work to ensure Oklahomans had the information and services they needed.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe argues in new court documents that a federal judge was wrong to dismiss its latest lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over the Dakota Access Pipeline.
Standing Rock filed the lawsuit, which seeks to shut the pipeline down, last October.
The tribe argues the Army Corps flouted federal law by allowing the Dakota Access Pipeline, also known as DAPL, to operate without an easement to cross Lake Oahe. Lake Oahe is a reservoir of the Missouri River that borders the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation that straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota state line.
Judge slashes jury damages in Greenpeace case to $345 million

U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg dismissed the case in March, finding that the tribe was relitigating claims it already brought before his court in a previous lawsuit filed in 2016. At the time of the first suit, Standing Rock was leading a protest movement against the pipeline’s construction that brought thousands of demonstrators to rural south-central North Dakota. 
The tribe disputed Boasberg’s dismissal in new arguments filed last week with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
“This appeal is a necessary step to hold the Corps accountable for its unlawful actions, to protect our people from the ongoing risks posed by DAPL, and to ensure that our sovereignty is respected,” Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chair Steve Sitting Bear said in a Friday statement. 
Standing Rock says Boasberg’s dismissal should be reversed because the Army Corps of Engineers’ yearslong inaction on the easement counts as a separate issue the courts haven’t ruled on yet.
“These are not challenges to past decisions but to the Corps’ ongoing violations of clear statutory duties,” the tribe wrote in court records.
The Army Corps initially granted the oil pipeline an easement in 2017, but Boasberg revoked it in 2020 after finding the agency had broken the law by not fully evaluating the pipeline’s environmental impacts.
Standing Rock Sioux Tribe files new lawsuit over DAPL

Boasberg ordered the Corps to conduct a complete environmental impact study, which is still pending five years later. The agency published a draft in late 2023. 
While the judge in court orders has been critical of the Army Corps’ failure to move faster, he said this isn’t something the tribe can sue over.
“No matter its frustration with Defendants’ sluggish pace, it is not yet entitled to a second bite at the apple,” he wrote in his March order.
He said the tribe may file another lawsuit once the Army Corps finishes its environmental impact study and takes final action on the easement.
The tribe in the case claims the Army Corps violated a number of other federal laws related to the Dakota Access Pipeline, including that it hasn’t enforced regulatory standards for emergency spill response plans.
Standing Rock has said in court filings it has new evidence showing the pipeline is unsafe. The pipeline developer, Energy Transfer, has indicated previously it does not consider the information credible. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“We still need people to stand with us. People think Standing Rock ended when DAPL went online in 2017,” said Doug Crow Ghost, Standing Rock’s director of water resources.
The tribe also alleges that the Army Corps failed to investigate reports that sacred cultural sites were destroyed during the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which it says is required under the National Historic Preservation Act. The pipeline company disputes that it desecrated cultural sites.
The Dakota Access Pipeline passes through unceded land recognized as belonging to the Sioux Nation in 19th century treaties with the U.S. government.
Several states, including North Dakota, have intervened in the lawsuit as defendants. The states have argued that shuttering the pipeline would harm the regional economy, make road and rail transit more dangerous and would violate states’ rights.
Dakota Access, the pipeline’s owner, also joined the lawsuit on the side of the Army Corps. Dakota Access is owned by subsidiaries and affiliates of Energy Transfer.
The federal government, intervening states and Dakota Access are expected to respond to the tribe’s arguments by early January.

	Barbara Kelley remembers when her car and windows were routinely coated with a thin film of coal dust that had drifted over from the power plant on the edge of her neighborhood in Salem, Massachusetts. She remembers the noise as a conveyor belt lifted the coal into the building. She also remembers how pleased she was when the community started to discuss the possibility of building an offshore wind terminal on the site when the plant eventually closed.


“The coal plant — it worked, it gave us energy, but it was time to change,” Kelley said. ​“My reaction was, having a wind port is part of having wind energy — and that’s a good thing.”


In the years since the coal plant shut down in 2014, Kelley and many other community members have worked to promote the goal of transforming part of the property into a staging ground where wind turbine blades, tower sections, and nacelles can be prepared for transport to offshore construction sites south of Cape Cod and north in the Gulf of Maine. The vision was to turn Salem Harbor, one of the country’s oldest ports, into a linchpin of the then-burgeoning offshore wind industry and provide an economic boost to some of Salem’s most disadvantaged residents.


Last year, that dream seemed close at hand. City and state leadership had embraced the idea. The state had promised a hefty investment, and the Biden administration had awarded the project a sizable grant. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the development in August 2024, and operations were expected to begin in 2026.


Project developer Crowley had agreed to pour nearly $9 million into a community benefits agreement that included job training, childcare, emergency services, and local sustainability and resilience efforts. Planners estimated construction and operations would create hundreds of jobs. And the whole process of bringing the idea to life gave community members a sense of agency and hope for their city.


Then this August the Trump administration announced that it would cut off $679million in federal funding for offshore wind ports. The move was part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing attacks on offshore wind, the impacts of which are being felt far beyond the nascent sector. Now, like those in so many communities across the country, the people of Salem find themselves facing the fallout of national political priorities, and wondering whether more than a decade of work will ever bear fruit.


“I feel like we’re all a little bit in the dark still,” said Lucy Corchado, a local activist who was part of the group that negotiated the community benefits agreement. ​“I hope we hear some good news, but I’m not sure that’s going to happen.”
 The path to an offshore wind port


Community advocates first started floating the idea of building a wind port on Salem Harbor roughly 15 years ago. At the time, plans were underway to build a commercial wind farm off Cape Cod, and the coal plant’s closure looked likely. The advocates saw a promising future for the large industrial waterfront parcel in what seemed to be a growing energy sector.


Once the epicenter of the spice trade in early America, Salem has a deepwater port that today serves mostly recreational boaters, tourist outings, and the occasional cruise ship. Though the city is home to a hospital, university, and thriving hospitality sector, it also has a median household income well below the average in most surrounding towns and statewide.
Amid federal setbacks, Maine ‘closely tracking’ development of Canadian offshore wind



When the owner of the coal plant proposed building a natural gas–burning facility on the site, activists from Salem Alliance for the Environment, or SAFE, were skeptical of replacing one fossil fuel with another. However, they decided not to oppose the plan for a new, smaller plant and to instead push for the rest of the property to be used for an offshore wind port that could both contribute to the decarbonization of the grid and create new opportunities for local residents.


“It wasn’t that we were really supportive of the gas plant, but we had bigger dreams of a wind port coming into town,” said SAFE founder Patricia Gozemba. ​“Our dream played out.”


In 2022, then-Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, announced the state would make a $75 million investment in the port, and the project was also awarded a $34million grant from the federal Port Infrastructure Development Program. Two years later, the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center bought 42 acres of the former coal plant property, with the intention of leasing it to energy and marine developer Crowley. The City of Salem acquired five adjacent acres.

The plans enjoyed widespread support in the city.


“We’re a uniquely progressive community,” said SAFE executive director Bonnie Bain. There was no organized opposition to the wind port idea beyond occasional grumbling by Facebook commenters, she said.
 A seat at the table


As negotiations between Crowley and the city got underway, SAFE and other groups started to worry that, despite their longstanding advocacy for the project, important community input was missing from the process.


“This wasn’t just a wind port — it was an investment in the community,” Bain said. ​“We want to make sure that when we build projects that they enhance the community.”


Advocates raised their voices, submitting testimony for state and local proceedings, attending planning board meetings, and hosting educational webinars about offshore wind. In 2023, SAFE and several Salem neighborhood associations and civic groups formed a coalition to ask for a seat at the bargaining table as the city and developer hammered out the community benefits agreement.


The coalition was determined to make sure that the project didn’t harm nearby residents and created opportunities for some of the city’s disadvantaged populations. The group met once a week — Thursdays at 4 p.m. — for a year to discuss strategy, write letters to the media, and plan for local and state meetings. Salem Mayor Dominick Pangallo agreed to include two coalition members — Kelley, representing the Historic Derby Street neighborhood adjacent to the planned port, and Corchado, representing The Point, a largely immigrant, lower-income neighborhood nearby — in the community benefit negotiations.


“We kind of pushed our way to the discussion table to make sure they heard what we were looking for,” Corchado said.


The parties struck a deal that included a range of measures. The city’s public schools were set to receive $40,000 annually for technical and vocational education programs and another $50,000 per year to expand prekindergarten childcare to help parents attend job training. Crowley also committed to offer paid apprenticeships and internships, help graduating students find jobs in the industry, and fund scholarships for local workers to access relevant training opportunities.


When Trump was elected in 2024, some port supporters held out hope that the project would escape the president’s well-known hostility to offshore wind. Corchado, however, was concerned from the beginning.


“We were so far along and the funding has already been secured. It was like, maybe it’s not going to be that bad,” she said. ​“But, yeah … it’s what I was worried about.”


The news on Aug. 29 that the federal funding would be terminated was an enormous disappointment for proponents. It also left them with questions about whether the lost funds would scuttle the plan entirely, force the developer to change course, or merely delay implementation. Crowley will say only that it is reviewing the action and determining next steps. The city of Salem is also figuring out what to do now.


“We are still working to pursue all avenues to address the funding termination,” the mayor’s office said in a statement. ​“That includes working to get it restored or, failing that, looking at how we could revise the project plan to account for the loss of what was around 10% of the expected construction costs for the port.”


Community members are feeling somewhat adrift as the concrete plans they invested so much time in become increasingly uncertain.
“It wasn’t necessarily surprising,” Bain said. ​“But it’s still dizzying when it actually happens.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Salem-Gas-Plant.jpg.webp,,,2025-11-11 12:03:39.057264

Campbell. often face long waits for care and denial of claims  when seeking health care through the Veterans Administration.(Win McNamee/Getty Images)(Photo by Luke Sharrett/Getty Images)In March 2024, I had an altercation with people who had broken into my late father’s home. Afterwards, I spent long hours cleaning the property, and when I returned home and went to the ER on post, I learned I had torn several tendons in my right arm as a result of the incident.
Despite months of therapy, my recovery stalled, and it took more than 14 months for the Veterans Administration (VA) to schedule a needed EMG test, which I had to drive to Franklin to receive — an hour away from my home in Clarksville. That was September 2024, and I am still not healed.
When we enlisted in the military, we were proud to serve our country. We never imagined that, after our service, we would have to fight for our own healthcare. We never imagined that we would have to fight to save the lives of my fellow veterans because the system meant to protect us is failing. 
Every day, we find ourselves on the phone preventing veterans from taking their own lives because they cannot access the care they desperately need. Every day, we watch more of our brothers and sisters slip into homelessness because the promises made to them went unfulfilled. This is not how service should be repaid.
Clarksville veterans, like many across the country, are facing a growing crisis in our healthcare and services. Under Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins, in partnership with billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the VA targeted 30,000 federal jobs, many held by veterans. Since January 2025, thousands of critical staff, including doctors and nurses, have left the VA, worsening long-standing problems of staffing shortages, wait times and denied claims.
Nine rare cancers tied to burn pit exposure added to VA benefits list

Collins has also attempted to invalidate collective bargaining agreements that protect federal workers in the workplace and impact the quality of our care. Before taking the job, Collins was a major ally of a billionaire-funded effort to further increase reliance of the VA on private healthcare, benefiting corporations instead of investing in our public healthcare system. 
When veterans try to file a claim or even seek a diagnosis at the VA, every step matters. You might have a recurring condition, but after months of waiting, your appointment finally arrives on a day when you happen to feel slightly “okay” or are not showing symptoms due to months of waiting for an appointment. That single “okay” or good day can set you back, forcing you to start the process over again just to get the needed care or continue with the same treatment or medical practice. The VA delivers medical care through a step-by-step escalation process, but these steps are slippery and dimly lit, leading to delayed care for our veterans. 
Now imagine all of this compounded by VA staffing cuts, which cause longer wait times, hours on hold, the loss of key personnel who help veterans access care, and long trips to Nashville to see a specialist, only to have your travel pay denied.
This is the care we subject our veterans to. This is what their service and sacrifices have earned them. Broken promises and broken systems. Elected officials with short-term memory seem to remember veterans only at election time or on Veterans Day. Veterans are left asking: what happened to ‘never forget’?
Calls by Tennessee veterans double after expansion of VA healthcare benefits

Millions of veterans were exposed to burn pits. The VA created the Burn Pit Registry to track and compile data on troops affected by these toxic exposures because, frankly, no one yet knows the long-term impact or the care they will need. A stripped-down VA in the future could be held accountable for failing to provide that care and protect our veterans.
Yet five Tennessee members of Congress, U.S. Reps. Chuck Fleischmann, Mark Green — a graduate of West Point and a veteran —  Diana Harshbarger, David Kustoff and John Rose, voted against the PACT Act, a law designed to provide health care and benefits to veterans exposed to toxic substances. The expansion of our VA clinic in Clarksville is a result of PACT Act funding. 
Veterans are dying every day, be it from illnesses exasperated by long wait times or suicide. Now, on top of that, millions of Americans, including veterans, have also lost their SNAP food benefits. While working people face cuts, the wealthy and corporations won nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts over the next decade. 
Clarksville has always been a proud military town. With Fort Campbell in our backyard, Montgomery County has the highest veteran density in the state. Twenty percent of our residents have served in the military. We are more than veterans. We are your teachers, your pastors, your factory workers and your friends. We raise families, coach Little League, volunteer in our churches, and contribute every day to the life of our community.
When we cannot get an appointment for months or can’t afford our groceries, our health worsens. When our travel pay is denied, we often skip care altogether. When forced into private networks, many of us give up in frustration. The result is not efficiency, it is neglect.
We have sacrificed enough. And our message is clear. Invest in our care, not cuts. 
We have come together to form Veterans For All, organizing in Clarksville to protect our care and reject cuts to vital services. Our platform calls on major Clarksville corporations that receive millions in public subsidies and tax breaks to invest in veteran care, make binding commitments to hire veterans, and treat workers with dignity. It also urges our elected officials to oppose VA cuts and resist a shift toward privatized healthcare.
The veterans we have met in the waiting room at the VA  told us they were not going to stop fighting for their benefits. Neither will we. 
Clarksville’s veterans have never walked away from a fight. Now we are asking you and our leaders not to walk away from us. 
It is time to make a choice. We can continue to reward corporations with massive tax breaks while cutting services for veterans and working families, or we can invest in the people who have already given so much for all of us.

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)Many food pantries in Ohio are seeing record demand as President Donald Trump has resisted court orders to provide food aid to 42 million Americans.
The outlines of an agreement to end the longest government shutdown in history emerged Sunday night. But it’s unclear how quickly the administration will work to distribute food benefits or in what amounts. 
A federal judge ruled that despite the shutdown, Trump must disburse funds that are available for the purpose. But so far he has refused. 
The matter is before the appellate courts, and the Department of Agriculture on Saturday ordered some states to undo their work to disburse food funds on their own.
On Monday afternoon, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services issued guidance saying that full benefits are unlikely to be provided this month.
“Under the revised federal calculations, nearly all recipients will receive less than 65% of their normal benefit,” it said. 
“Some recipients, particularly those whose earnings place the household near the cutoff for eligibility, may receive no benefits this week under the revised calculation. An official notice explaining each household’s specific benefit change will be issued. After the federal government shutdown ends, additional (federal) guidance will be needed to determine how to handle the difference between what would ordinarily be issued for the month and what is being issued this week.”
Last week, as 1.4 million Ohioans lost their food benefits, record numbers flocked to the state’s food pantries. 
“We had our biggest day ever in history last Wednesday — 285 families in a three-hour period,” Roy Clark, executive director of the NNEMAP food pantry a mile east of the Ohio State campus in Columbus said on Monday. 
About 10 yards away, a constant stream of people made their way through the season’s first snow seeking help. “
We were shoving a lot of food out the door. It’s maintaining close to that every day — even on a day like this.”

A few miles to the south, officials at the pantry at the Broad Street Presbyterian Church were also dealing with unprecedented demand. 
Where they served an average 35 families a day during the pandemic, they were serving nearly 60 in July as Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act slashed $186 billion over 10 years from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
The same law slashes nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid, the federal health program for the poor, while delivering a similar amount of tax cuts to the richest 1% of Americans.
As of last week, the Broad Street pantry was serving more than 90 families a day, said Amy Miracle, a pastor at the church. That’s nearly three times the number it was serving during the pandemic.
“The reason the numbers have gone up in the past 10 days is because of the pause in SNAP benefits,” Miracle said. 
“I, like everyone else in the country, have no idea (when benefits will resume.) We just know it’s having a real and immediate impact on families here in Central Ohio.”
Shawn Weatherby, a supervisor at the pantry, said resources have become so strained that it’s been turning away five to 10 visitors a day — something hunger fighters never want to do.
 “It feels bad to me, but at some point in time we have to close the line because we won’t be able to serve everybody,” he said.
Joree Novotny, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, said that stocking up for the SNAP crisis has been difficult because planners have to balance the need for adequate supplies against not wasting perishable food.
“We are proudly operating on a backbone of generous volunteers and community organizations, many of whom are taking extraordinary steps to expand hours, to help manage traffic flow, to make sure food remains available as they’re serving much higher numbers than normal,” she said. 
Novotny said that with the interruption of federal food benefits, demand at food pantries across the state accelerated rapidly. 
On Thursday, they served 70% more individuals than the average between January and September.
“We are purchasing much more food right now than we ever would normally,” Novotny said. 
“I had a couple food banks tell me they had their busiest day on record for picking orders off their shelves in the warehouse to pile them on to trucks to local food pantries.”

But perhaps surprisingly, food pantries there aren’t facing as big a surge as some counterparts elsewhere in the state, said Mike Iberis, executive director of the Second Harvest Food Bank of Mahoning County. 
The food bank supplies pantries there and in Columbiana and Trumbull counties.
Iberis said that with the interruption of SNAP, demand has increased about 5%.
“We’ve seen an uptick, but we’ve been able to address it,” he said. “We’ve been able to supply the pantries with what they need.”
Clark, of the NNEMAP pantry in Columbus, said it makes more food deliveries than any nonprofit in Ohio — half of them to seniors. 
He said it’s a vital service for people who find it hard to get around, but delivery costs extra.
“Finances are always an issue,” he said, inviting people to donate. “We barely made our budget last year and this year looks to be very tight.”
Novotny of the association of foodbanks said that anyone seeking to volunteer or donate can start at the find your food bank page on her agency’s website. Or they can start even closer to home.
“First things first,” she said. “If you know someone, if you have a personal relationship with a family you can provide direct help to, please consider doing so. It’s neighbor helping neighbor.”
But while inspiring, no charitable effort can replace what SNAP does for the most vulnerable Ohioans, Novotny said.
“This isn’t sustainable,” she said. “SNAP provides over $215 million a month in federally funded food-purchasing power. I’m really proud of what our network was doing before this. We were providing 19 million meals on average per month. But it doesn’t come close to touching what SNAP does to provide a first line of defense.”

(Photo by WEWS.)Ohio will begin distributing partial SNAP benefits as early as Wednesday, the state said late Monday. This comes as the U.S. Senate is set to vote on a continuing resolution to reopen the government.
All recipients who’ve not yet received their November Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, as well as individuals who were approved for, but not paid in October, will begin receiving their partial November benefit this week, the Department of Jobs and Family Services said.
ODJFS is required to reduce the maximum amount of SNAP benefits each household can receive in November by 35% and to recalculate each household’s payment based on that new amount. Some recipients may receive no benefits this week, the department said.
And after 41 days of the government being shut down, the Senate finally reached a deal to pass legislation that would provide backpay to federal workers, reverse layoffs and reinstate government benefits.
“We gotta stop thinking this is us against them and remember that we’re here for our country,” U.S. Rep. Dave Joyce, a Republican representing District 14, told us earlier in the shutdown.
An official vote is set to take place late Monday.
“Military — those are the men and women who are out there 24 hours a day for us, a lot of them with young families, they’ve got to have support,” U.S. Rep. Bob Latta, a Republican representing District 5, told us in October. “They don’t have it when they don’t have these paychecks.
Joyce and Latta were awaiting a compromise, which came Sunday evening.
But SNAP benefits are still in limbo for 1.4 million Ohioans.
“What’s on my card right now is from last month’s benefits,” said Janiah Gales, a Cleveland resident. “So I’m just trying to hold onto them as best as I can.”
Democratic U.S. Rep. Emilia Sykes, who represents District 13, blames the GOP for the struggles Americans are facing.
“This is a failure of the Congress led by Republicans, the White House led by Republicans and Donald Trump to come together and do the necessary work, the very basic work of funding our United States government,” Sykes told us in an interview last month.
The resolution doesn’t address Sykes’ and the Democratic Party’s main goal — extending subsidies tied to the Affordable Care Act.
This means health care premiums could go up.
“I was clear: any deal that could earn my support needed to lower costs and keep healthcare accessible and affordable. Our local economy relies on healthcare not only for our well-being, but also for jobs and economic growth. This deal does not get us there and leaves thousands of my constituents without healthcare and spending more money to live than they ever have. I will continue to fight to deliver the relief that families in Ohio’s 13th District and across the country deserve,” Sykes said in a statement Monday.
In addition, the nonpartisan research group Center for Community Solutions reports hundreds of thousands of Ohioans will be removed from Medicaid in 2027.
“It’s going to kick off people from their healthcare coverage… specifically for Ohio’s 13th district that relies upon health care systems to employ our neighbors and our friends and our family,” the congresswoman said.
What the Democrats got in this deal was a promise of a vote in the coming weeks on the subsidies.
But Latta doesn’t support them, citing the Affordable Care Act as too expensive.
“They want $1.5 trillion, and now they’re saying the federal debt’s gonna be going up to $38 trillion,” Latta said.
The continuing resolution still has to officially pass the Senate and the House, but it appears likely to go through. It would only last until the end of January.

Applications open Wednesday for 29 total seats on the governing boards of eight South Carolina public universities. Fifteen of those seats are at Coastal Carolina.
A legislative screening panel also is seeking candidates for a number of vacant and expired board positions at The Citadel, the College of Charleston, Lander University, the Medical University of South Carolina, South Carolina State University, the University of South Carolina and Winthrop University. Applications are due no later than noon Dec. 17.

Applicants for the College of Charleston seat must live in the 4th Congressional District.
The opening at MUSC is for a resident of the 2nd Congressional District who does not have a medical background.
Of Lander’s three seats on the list, one represents the 5th Congressional District and two will be filled by the governor. They are “at-large” seats, meaning applicants can live anywhere in the state.
Winthrop has two at-large seats and a 7th Congressional District seat.
USC has two gubernatorial appointed seats, one seat for a resident of the state’s 4th judicial circuit and one for the 15th circuit
One opening each at the Citadel and SC State are at large. The Citadel member must be an alumni.

Still, others will be left out of the oversight measure.
The committee chose to screen applicants for only a portion of the boards’ seats with expired terms.
For example, the Citadel has four members of its board of visitors with expired terms, but the panel opened applications for just one of the positions — an at-large seat held by Col. James Nicholson Jr.

 How to apply
Applicants must fill out all required forms, including:
A letter of intentA personal questionnaireA release allowing the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division to conduct a background checkA release of their driving recordA release allowing the state to conduct a credit reportA statement of their economic holdingsAnd a form acknowledging their applications.
All forms are available on the screening panel’s web page.
Applications must be hand delivered to room 419 of the Blatt Building on the Statehouse grounds by noon, Dec. 17.

Nicholson, who legislators elected to the board in 2019, has continued to sit on the board since his term expired at the end of June 2023.
At Winthrop University, legislators will screen candidates for only one expired position and two vacant seats. However, three other board members are serving expired terms.
Among those vacancies is the seat previously held by Winthrop’s former board chairman, the late Glenn McCall.
The longtime South Carolina GOP leader was York County’s first Black Republican chairman. In 2008, he was elected the state party’s first Black national committeeman. He helped write a 2013 report that called for a more inclusive and diverse GOP. His other roles in the party included vice-chairman for the 2016 Republican National Convention and a committee co-chairman for the 2020 national convention.
He died July 11 from complications from surgery. He was 71.
Screenings at the other five colleges are focused solely on filling vacancies and vetting gubernatorial appointees.
At the College of Charleston, eight other members serving expired terms won’t be required to go through the re-application process. At Lander University six other members appointed by the General Assembly will continue on in expired terms.
MUSC and SC State each have seven members with expired terms not being screened. And USC has five.
Clemson University and Francis Marion University aren’t part of the screening list at all despite having a dozen members with expired terms between them.
Rep. Bill Whitmire, who chairs the committee, said it comes down to time.
The Walhalla Republican said the Legislature fell behind in the process amid lawsuits challenging the state’s congressional districts, redrawn by the Legislature following the 2020 census.
From foster care to fine arts, SC has hundreds of citizen boards and lots of openings to fill

All but Clemson, The Citadel and USC boards’ memberships are determined, at least in part, by congressional district.
USC’s board seats are by judicial circuit. Clemson’s board is partially selected by its existing members and partially appointed by the Legislature to at-large seats. The Citadel board is made up of alumni serving in at-large positions.
With so many college board members serving expired terms, Whitmire said, the panel can’t review them all in one sitting and will try to get caught up at a later date.
Citadel board members in expired terms include former state Rep. Gene Pinson, R-Greenwood; and Col. Peter McCoy Sr., the father of former House Judiciary chairman and U.S. Attorney Peter McCoy.
Brian Stern, son of SC Ports Authority Chairman Bill Stern, holds an expired term at the College of Charleston
Michael Stavrinakis, brother of state Rep. Leon Stavrinakis, and the father of House Speaker Murrell Smith both hold expired terms on the MUSC board.
And Leah Moody, daughter of the late Rep. Bessie Moody-Lawrence; and Rose Newton, wife of state Rep. Weston Newton, are both in expired terms at USC.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Campus_Beauty-4440-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-11 09:58:13.071508

Barfoot winning the Medal of Honor included killing seven Germans and capturing 17 while helping to save the lives of fellow soldiers.,"Among the Mississippians honored on Veterans Day are 28 Medal of Honor recipients. Among those is Van T. Barfoot.
After a day dodging land mines, facing tanks and taking prisoners, U.S. Army Col. Barfoot led his squad to victory against German forces in Italy in 1944. His actions that day earned him a Medal of Honor as told in the graphic novel from the Association of the United States Army.
The book is part of a series called Medal of Honor, which tells the stories of Army veterans who’ve received the highest honor in the U.S. Armed Forces for valor from the Civil War to the present.
According to Joseph Craig, director of AUSA’s book program, over half a million people read the first six volumes.
Craig wrote that Bartfoot’s life was “exciting and inspiring — a classic WWII hero’s tale full of action.”
Van T Barfoot Credit: United States Army
Barfoot’s story began in Edinburg, an unincorporated community in Leake County in east central Mississippi, where he was one of eight siblings. He enlisted in the Army in 1940. In 1943, he began fighting in Europe as part of the 3rd Platoon, Company L, 3rd Battalion, 157th Infantry Regiment, 45th Division.
On May 23, 1944, Barfoot’s unit was facing off against German forces near Carano, Italy. Alone, Barfoot navigated across a minefield to the enemy’s left flank. He took out a machine gun nest with a hand grenade, killing two Germans and wounding three. He then entered a German trench, where he killed two more soldiers and took the remaining ones as prisoners.
Barfoot and his men then took control of more German positions. He reorganized his men and consolidated their new ground.
Later that day, three German tanks launched a counterattack. Barfoot single-handedly disabled the first tank with a bazooka, then killed three of the tank’s crew. The other two tanks fled. Barfoot’s group advanced and destroyed an abandoned German artillery piece. Later, he helped two wounded men cross 1,700 yards of enemy territory to reach safety. 
In total, he killed seven Germans and captured 17 that day.
Barfoot received a Medal of Honor on Sept. 28, 1944, in Épinal, France. He continued serving in the Army, fighting in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Later in his career, he worked as a senior national adviser to the Army National Guard. He retired from the Army in 1974 as a colonel.
He received national attention in 2009 when his homeowners association in Virginia tried to force him to take down the flagpole in his yard. The association backed down after the dispute reached national headlines, with public opinion mostly on Barfoot’s side.
Barfoot was 92 when he died in 2012.
Each book in the Medal of Honor series is made by professional comic book writers and artists, with vetting by historians. They’re part of AUSA’s educational mission.
People can read them online for free, and AUSA premium members can order paperback collections at the end of every year.

“We get a great response from the public, including many suggestions for people to feature in new issues,” Craig said. “I have also heard from a few relatives, which is particularly rewarding.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10151100/MoH_Van-T-Barfoot_COVER-e1762809214873.jpg,,,2025-11-11 09:58:13.071508

(Submitted by Eric Thomas)TOPEKA — The Kansas City Chiefs put out a request for proposals to design a new stadium on the Kansas side of the state line with Missouri and are negotiating for land near the Kansas Speedway, according to two reports from Kansas City area talk show hosts. 
Pete Mundo of KCMO talk radio broke the news that the Chiefs contacted multiple firms regarding a new stadium to be built at Interstate 435 and Interstate 70. He said the news was confirmed by several sources.
Mundo stressed that the RFP didn’t mean the Chiefs had selected Kansas as the location for a new stadium and added that his “gut” said they would stay in Missouri. 
On Monday, Kevin Kietzman said on his podcast that the Chiefs are in negotiations with NASCAR and the state of Kansas to acquire land just west of the Kansas Speedway. He said the Chiefs also may be building a hotel by the Hollywood Casino and creating an entertainment district. 
“NASCAR owns a total of 880 acres of land at Village West, folks,” Kietzman said. “They only use 300 of them.”
Patrick Lowry, spokesman for the Kansas Department of Commerce, said major development projects require confidentiality and the agency has no comment on negotiations regarding the stadium. 
“Kansas Department of Commerce continues to conduct a careful analysis of costs and benefits as part of crafting agreements to keep the Chiefs and Royals in the region while maximizing growth opportunities for Kansas,” Lowry said.
The Kansas Legislature agreed to finance up to 70% of the project, with a minimum $1 billion price tag, by issuing bonds to be repaid with sales tax collected in the STAR Bond district. 
 
Wyandotte opportunity
The possibility of moving the Chiefs stadium across the state line has both excited and concerned Kansas leaders. In Wyandotte County, where the Village West area is located, an economic development leader is hesitant to talk about what the stadium might bring to his county, although he’s positive that location would be a strong one for the Chiefs. 
“I think that area is the No. 1 tourist destination in the state of Kansas,” said Greg Kindle, president of the Wyandotte Economic Development Council. “There’s infrastructure and highway infrastructure. We know there’s an ability to get people in and out of major sporting events, and if we can put a deal together that works for everybody, it’s a win-win.”
Much still needs to be assessed in terms of the economic development benefits for Wyandotte County. 
“We’re still working through the economics of it,” Kindle said. “It has to be revenue development that works for the sports teams but also drives revenue into the community. On the front end, it’s super exciting to have a national sports team in your community because you get a lot of branding, you get more tourism, you get people who are excited about being near that environment.”
Kindle referred to the success of the Kansas Speedway and Sporting KC, both of which are in the area and hold numerous events all year. 
“Tourism areas benefit,” he said. “New things have to be happening. This would be an interesting additional asset to the area that we hope would bring in additional hotels and restaurants and interest in that area.”
Kindle said the negotiations with the Chiefs are going on through state officials and Wyandotte has offered support as needed. He’s excited about the idea the team may come to his county, but he also wants to encourage everyone to think long-term.
“They’ve been in their current location for what, 50 or 60 years. We want to make sure that whatever happens here builds on what they’ve done and the success that they’ve had, but also that we ensure that we do, in fact, get that ancillary growth that goes with the project,” Kindle said. 
 
Stadium investments
J.C. Bradbury, an economist and professor at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, is releasing a book next year titled “This One Will be Different: False Promises and Fiscal Realities of Publicly Funded Stadiums.” 
He said economic justifications for putting tax dollars behind stadium development don’t hold up.
Economists look at economic development differently than other professionals, who consider the process about increasing business activity in a community, Bradbury said.
“Economists use the term economic development to describe improving economic outcomes. And stadiums are absolutely not true economic development catalysts,” he said.
Bradbury said he has looked for studies that show there is an economic benefit to stadiums and hasn’t found one.
“If you went and called a doctor for a study on the dangers of smoking, you wouldn’t be able to find a doctor who would say smoking is good for you, right?” Bradbury said. “If you would ask economists about the economic benefits of stadiums, you probably couldn’t find an economist who would say that they’re beneficial. But no one wants to listen to economists on that.”
Multiple changes happen in communities when stadiums are built that lead people to believe the economy benefits, he said. Increased spending definitely happening around the stadium, but Bradbury said that spending is pulled from restaurants and stores not in the stadium’s entertainment sphere. 
Other factors include being unable to track businesses that don’t open up in a stadium district, such as doctor’s offices and retail stores, because of traffic and people who don’t want to live near stadiums, he said. 
“There’s actually some negative spillover effects that no one likes to talk about,” Bradbury said. He gave an example of an area in Atlanta that was near where stadiums were formerly located. For years, it was a “ghost town,” but after stadiums moved, it is now a thriving commercial district.
There are positives, including the novelty effect when the stadium first opens, Bradbury said. 
“This is a private business that largely benefits the owners of the team. It’s generating hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars,” Bradbury said. “Athletes are paid millions of dollars of salaries. These organizations exist as economic entities because they’re profitable. There’s zero justification for taxpayers putting a dime for professional sports stadiums, but we just sort of got in the habit of doing that, and now I’m hoping to try to break this habit.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221122-Chiefs-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-11 09:58:13.071508

The Trump administration is planning an oil and gas lease sale in federal territory of the inlet. It is set to be the first of at six Cook Inlet lease sales that Congress has mandated by held between now and 2032. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Trump administration on Monday outlined its plans to auction 1 million acres of federal offshore territory in what it has called the “Big Beautiful Cook Inlet Oil and Gas Lease Sale.”
The lease sale, to be held early next year under terms detailed in a notice published Monday in the Federal Register, is to be the first of at least six mandated for Cook Inlet through 2032 under the sweeping budget bill that Congress passed this summer. The bill also mandated 30 lease sales through 2040 in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
“President Trump’s signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act marked the beginning of a new chapter for oil and gas development in the Gulf of America and Alaska’s Cook Inlet,” Matt Giacona, acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, said in a news release issued Friday. “BOEM is now moving forward with a predictable, congressionally mandated leasing schedule that will support offshore oil and gas development for decades to come.”
In the statement, the agency, which is the Department of the Interior division that oversees offshore oil and gas drilling in federal waters, touted the 12.5% royalty offered in the lease sale as an incentive to bidders. The agency statement noted that 12.5% is the lowest royalty rate allowed for offshore oil and gas production in federal territory.
Lease sale bids are to be opened on March 4.
Cook Inlet lease sales held in recent years, whether in federal or state territory, have drawn little industry interest. That is despite the use of some incentives, such as royalty-free terms.
There are only eight active leases in federal waters of Cook Inlet, all held by Hilcorp, the inlet’s dominant operator. One of those leases was acquired in a sale held at the end of 2022 under a requirement inserted into the Inflation Reduction Act; Hilcorp’s bid was the only one in that lease sale.
Hilcorp also was the sole bidder in a 2017 federal Cook Inlet lease sale, when it acquired 14 leases. Last year, it relinquished seven of those leases.

The lease sale is the first of six mandated under the budget bill passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump in July. (Map provided by the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management)
 

	There is no pending exploration plan for Hilcorp’s eight federal Cook Inlet leases, according to the BOEM website.
Muted industry interest in past sales
Annual areawide Cook Inlet lease sales held by the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas, for both offshore and onshore state territory, have also produced few bids in recent years.
The 2025 state sale drew five bids, according to results released by the division in June. The 2024 sale drew three bids. The 2023 state sale drew six bids. Each sale offered more than 700 tracts spread over about 3 million acres, and in two of those lease sales, Hilcorp was the sole bidder.
For the upcoming federal lease Cook Inlet lease sale, rules used in the 2017 federal sale will apply, BOEM said.
The agency’s Federal Register notice kicked off a 60-day comment period — but only for Alaska’s governor and for local governments. It is unclear whether tribal governments or any other organizations are included among those invited to comment; a question posed to the Department of the Interior press office was not answered by Monday afternoon.
An automatic emailed message from BOEM spokesperson Jennifer Russo said she could not respond to questions on Monday because of the federal government shutdown.
One environmental group that opposes the lease sale plans to submit public comments nonetheless.
“They’re not asking for comments from the public. But we are still planning to make sure that the people who live in Cook Inlet and Alaska and around the country, their voices will be heard,” said Cooper Freeman, Alaska director of the Center for Biological Diversity.
There appears to be no prohibition on public comments, Freeman noted.
Even though recent Cook Inlet lease sales have drawn little industry interest, he said the center has worries about future leasing.
“We hope that there’s no bids, but we’re taking it very seriously,” he said. “All it takes is one drill rig, one pipeline to burst, and it would be over for the inlet.”
The upcoming Cook Inlet lease sale process is separate from a court-mandated review of the 2022 lease sale.
A lawsuit filed by the Center for Biological Diversity and other organizations resulted in a federal court ruling last year that found the presale analysis to be flawed. U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason ordered BOEM to conduct further analysis of leasing impacts to endangered Cook Inlet beluga whales and other natural resources.
BOEM, in a Federal Register notice published in September, said it plans to complete the supplemental impact statement by the end of the year.
The agency said that it will not release the draft study for public comment and will hold no public hearings on the draft, a departure from procedures followed in past environmental studies.
The lack of public comment opportunities or planned public hearings has angered some Cook Inlet area organizations.
Cook Inletkeeper, an environmental group, has launched a petition drive calling for the normal public process to be reinstated.

(Photo by Alex Bierens de Haan/Getty Images for Heineken)The capitulation by a handful of moderate Senate Democrats, including Nevada’s two senators, to end the government shutdown came days after Nevada resort and tourism officials sided with the White House position on reopening the government.
Nevada’s Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who had been voting with Republicans from the start, and Sen. Jacky Rosen joined Republicans to approve a package Monday that restores pay and protections for federal workers harmed during the shutdown, but doesn’t deliver on the extension of the health care tax credits Democrats had been holding out for. 
Rosen had held out since Oct. 1 for a commitment from Republicans to extend Affordable Care Act premium subsidies, but received no such assurances in the end. 
Throughout the shutdown Republicans said they would negotiate on ACA premiums only if Democrats surrendered and voted for the the Republican spending resolution bill. 
Last month, noting the control President Donald Trump has exhibited over congressional Republicans, Rosen said taking Trump and Republicans at their word when “they violated that trust every single time, it’s a little naive on our part.” 
What’s changed, according to a statement from Rosen this week, is Republicans “weaponizing their power in alarming ways to inflict unimaginable pain and suffering on working people, like fully withholding SNAP benefits and gutting our tourism industry by grinding air travel to a halt.”
Rosen’s capitulation comes days after outreach from the tourism industry to congressional and White House leaders. 
With Thanksgiving approaching, “the consequences of a continued shutdown will be immediate, deeply felt by millions of American travelers, and economically devastating to communities in every state,” the U.S. Travel Association, representing hundreds of travel-related companies, including Caesars Entertainment, Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, MGM Resorts International, and the Venetian Casino Resort, wrote to congressional leaders last week.
“We urge Congress to immediately pass a clean continuing resolution to reopen the federal government,” the letter said, echoing the position reiterated by the Trump administration and Republican congressional leaders throughout the shutdown. 
The LVCVA “informed Senator Rosen that we planned to sign U.S. Travel’s letter to congressional leaders, which was issued last week, and shared its general content with her in advance,” says Vice President of Public Relations and Communications Molly Castano. 
Castano, in an email to the Current, noted the approach of “peak travel season,” including the Formula 1 race, National Finals Rodeo, and New Year’s Eve. “Maintaining stable staffing levels for TSA, FAA, and CBP (Customs and Border Enforcement) is essential to ensuring the smooth flow of holiday travel and major events that drive our economy.”
“No other state in the country is as dependent on the travel and tourism industry as Nevada,”   the LVCVA, the Las Vegas Chamber, and the Nevada Resort Association wrote in a joint letter to U.S. Secretary of Travel Sean Duffy, adding they share Duffy’s “commitment to ensuring safe and reliable air travel and stand ready to collaborate with you to find balanced, practical solutions. However, we respectfully urge that our nation’s air service continue without reductions. Any reduction in service will reverberate far beyond Nevada — threatening jobs, small businesses and economic activity nationwide.”
The letter, dated Nov. 7, was copied to all of Nevada’s congressional delegates. 
American Airlines, a major carrier at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, expressed gratitude in a news release to Cortez Masto and Rosen “for their leadership.” 
The airline noted “for 40 days, federal aviation workers haven’t been paid, and our customers have endured thousands of delays and cancellations due to the government shutdown. It’s imperative that we get the hardworking aviation safety and security professionals paid, and that we get the country moving again.”
In statements, Cortez Masto and Rosen framed their decision as a pragmatic step to end the 40-day government shutdown while securing a promise from Republicans that they will take up a vote on extending the Affordable Care Act’s tax credits.
Republicans have refused to negotiate extensions to health insurance premium subsidies for people insured through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) until the government is reopened. Nevadans who get insurance through Nevada Health Link are facing a projected average 26% premium rate hike, though the increases could be far greater for many Nevadans.
Republicans say they will hold the promised vote to extend health care tax credits by mid-December. Passage of the extension is highly unlikely, but the Democrats making the deal with Republicans argue it will once again put Senate Republicans on the record on extending ACA tax credits.
Lee and Horsford mum
The bill still needs approval from the Republican-controlled House and the signature of the president before the shutdown ends. Trump has indicated he’ll sign it.
Many House Democrats, including Nevada Rep. Dina Titus, slammed the deal. Titus said she would “oppose the continuing resolution again for the same reasons I did earlier.”
“Senate passage of the continuing resolution without extending Affordable Care Act premium subsidies means thousands of Nevadans will lose their health insurance because they won’t be able to afford it,” Titus said.
“We have endured weeks of pain from a government shutdown – including cutting off SNAP benefits and not paying federal workers – for nothing. Nevadans will see their health insurance premiums double or triple, leaving many with no choice but to drop their coverage,” she continued.
Nevada Democratic Reps. Steven Horsford and Susie Lee did not respond to questions on how they plan to vote once the bill gets to the House.
Some progressive organizations in Nevada were more forthcoming.
Make the Road Nevada said they were “deeply disappointed in Senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen for supporting the continuing resolution that fails to meet the real needs of working families.”
“This agreement does nothing to resolve the ongoing attacks on the Affordable Care Act,” said Jen Fleischmann Willoughby, director of development at Make The Road Nevada. “Our communities deserve lasting protections, not short-term compromises.”
Shelbie Swartz, the executive director of Battle Born Progress, also criticized the decision by Cortez Masto and Rosen to join Republicans in reopening “the government without a concrete fix for expiring ACA premium subsidies.”
Swartz added that the Trump administration’s efforts to withhold funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – which provides food assistance for 500,000 Nevadans – put Nevada’s “senators into a difficult position.”
“We cannot allow the Trump administration to pit SNAP recipients against families who need affordable health coverage—Nevadans deserve both,” Swartz said. “ACA premiums are increasing in real time, and without the subsidy extension, many Nevadans will lose coverage altogether.”
Republicans say they will hold the vote to extend health care tax credits by mid-December. Passage of the extension is doubtful at most, but the Democrats making the deal with Republicans argue it will at least put Senate Republicans on the record. 
The final version of the deal would extend government funding through January 2026.
The bill still needs approval from the House and the signature of the president before the shutdown ends.
In addition to reinstating all federal employees dismissed and furloughed during the shutdown, the bill also prohibits further layoffs through the end of January, when the continuing spending resolution would expire.
The length of the shutdown has had significant economic impacts on federal workers and industries that rely on those federal workers. In Nevada, nearly 14,000 federal workers have gone without a paycheck since the government shutdown.
“Most Americans wouldn’t continue showing up to work for 41 days without a paycheck, and we’re deeply grateful to those who did,” said Nevada State AFL-CIO’s executive secretary-treasurer Susie Martinez.
Martinez said she was “relieved to see movement toward reopening the government.” Referring to federal workers who have not been getting paid Marintinez said she is also “encouraged that this legislative package includes critical support that help working people afford food and health care.”
“That said, this shutdown should have never happened. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees, contractors, and those in the industries that depend on them have been forced to go weeks without pay or face job insecurity because of political brinkmanship. In Nevada that means families struggling to pay rent, feed their children, and keep up with the rising costs of living,” Martinez said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1804681979-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-11 09:58:13.071508

Another 6,000 could lose benefits in the coming months. 
The bill disqualifies refugees, people who have been granted asylum and other humanitarian immigrants from receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
As a result, families who have already missed November SNAP payments due to the ongoing federal government shutdown are staring down reduced food budgets that will outlast the current gridlock in Washington.
People who lose eligibility because they are in an affected group cannot re-qualify for SNAP until they have held lawful permanent residence, commonly known as a green card, for 5 years, said Chris Moreland, director of communications for the state’s social services department.
Syed Yousuf Hussain, case manager for ICNA Relief Missouri, a Muslim faith-based charity in St. Louis, said the center’s food pantry has seen a 20% increase in attendance since SNAP payments were suspended on Nov. 1. Of the 90 families the food pantry serves each month, Hussain said, most are refugees, from countries including Afghanistan, Syria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Venezuela and Colombia, but the food pantry is open to anyone in need, regardless of their immigration status or religion.
“Many families, they’re suddenly left with a big question mark, how to cope up with the situation when suddenly the benefits have been drastically reduced,” Hussain said.

Joan Kelly, director of strategic partnerships at Jewish Vocational Services of Kansas City, a nonprofit that aids refugees, said she expects 170 of the families her organization serves to lose benefits. Of these, she said 78% have at least one working family member and 75% have children.
“In a family that is working, and working really hard, these are really challenging conversations that we are having with folks already to say, ‘I don’t know how we’re going to make your budget work,’” Kelly said. “You’re already working. Your wife is working. You can’t really just walk in and say, ‘Hey boss, I lost my SNAP benefits. Can I get a raise?’”
Members of these groups have long been the exception to federal restrictions on immigrants’ access to safety-net programs. 
Adults living in the U.S. without legal status are not eligible for SNAP, though they can apply and get benefits for members of their household who meet requirements, such as children born in the U.S. 
Since 1996, federal law has required most immigrants with green cards to wait 5 years before they can qualify, even if they meet all other requirements applied to U.S. citizens.
Adriana Cadena, executive director of Protecting Immigrant Families, a national coalition of groups that advocates for low-income immigrants, said the new exclusions mark a departure from longstanding U.S. policy.
“In the past, there would be this sort of division among different types of immigrants in this country,” Cadena said. “Right now, the attack is on everyone.”
 A key tool for self-sufficiency

Advocates said that while many refugees are eager to support themselves and their families without assistance, SNAP is a key tool for clients to meet basic needs during their early days in the U.S.
“Some of them are just gung-ho, ‘I don’t want any of this orientation stuff. Just get me a job. I want to support my family,’” Paul Costigan, state refugee coordinator at the Missouri Office of Refugee Administration.
Hussain said that in addition to food, the ICNA center in St. Louis provides English language and financial literacy courses, resume and job interview support, and mental health services. ICNA Relief USA provides a broader array of services throughout the country, including disaster relief, transitional housing and support for students.
“One can understand when somebody is coming here in the beginning, much more support is needed,” Hussain said, “but we try our best to make them fully self-reliant as soon as possible.”
For some refugees still using SNAP, Kelly said, the prospect of going to a food pantry after taking steps toward self-sufficiency is demoralizing.
“We have clients that have said, ‘I’ve stood in line for food my entire life. The thought of going to a pantry and standing for food again is untenable,’” Kelly said.
 Changing eligibility during the shutdown

Baylee Watts, media director for the state’s social services department, said in an email that 3,651 individuals are expected to lose SNAP benefits because they belong to one of the impacted groups. Another 6,052 could lose eligibility after further examination of their cases.
The department has been updating its systems during the government shutdown to apply SNAP eligibility changes.
Watts said the department is working on implementing the new eligibility rules for refugees and other humanitarian immigrants in accordance with guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Once the updates are complete, the department will notify impacted people and “issue the necessary adverse action notices.” 
The changes will then apply to current recipients’ cases at their next annual recertification, or when they submit a change to the department, Watts said. 
The federal law also excludes refugees, asylees and some other groups from eligibility for Medicaid, the nation’s health insurance program for low-income people, beginning October 2026.
Meanwhile, some advocates said it remains unclear which groups of humanitarian immigrants will lose eligibility for SNAP and how many families they work with will be affected. 
Costigan said new restrictions may apply mostly to refugees who entered the country in late 2024 or January 2025.
New arrivals of refugees have all but halted since Trump suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program in late January. Refugees must live in the U.S. for one year before they can apply for a green card.
“It may just be a small number of people who have come in over the last year who have not adjusted their status yet, because it hasn’t been the one year mark,” Costigan said.
 Supporting families

Cadena, of Protecting Immigrant Families, said her group has been working since January to understand the Trump administration’s policy changes on immigration and who is still eligible to receive help.
“What are the actual changes?” Cadena said. “Because a lot of this as well is about creating fear in keeping people from not accessing services they are really eligible for.”
Cadena noted that households with children who are U.S. citizens can qualify for SNAP benefits, regardless of the status of their parents.
The state social services department confirmed this.
Watts said that when an individual loses eligibility due to membership in one of the affected groups, “the household would still receive benefits for members of the household that meet citizenship requirements.”
Hussain said that although he expects more families to visit the food pantry in the coming months, donations have increased, and the center is coordinating with local partners to reach more households and supplementing food distribution with meal deliveries.
“We are trying to support our clients in the best way possible, regardless of the legal situation,” Hussain said. “This is something secondary, but our primary objective is to support those families.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/icnarelief-1-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-11-11 09:58:13.071508

Gavin Newsom attracted national news coverage thanks to Proposition 50 before jetting to Brazil for a climate conference President Donald Trump avoided.,"Gov. Gavin Newsom still insists he hasn’t decided to run for president in 2028. But after persuading California’s voters to gerrymander the state’s congressional districts to grab more Democratic seats, he embarked on a flurry of appearances that had the distinct aroma of a political campaign.
He did an interview on CNN, jetted off to Texas to crow about California’s passage of the Proposition 50 gerrymander at a rally of Democrats — some chanted about a 2028 candidacy — and then headed to Brazil as the self-appointed U.S. delegate to a climate change conference boycotted by President Donald Trump.
Oh yes, and Penguin Random House announced that in February, it will release Newsom’s memoir of growing up in San Francisco, founding a business and segueing into politics, titled “Young Man in a Hurry: A Memoir of Discovery.”  It will cost just $30.
No presidential campaign is complete without an autobiography describing how the candidate overcame barriers of birth and circumstance to become a dedicated public servant.
As Newsom surfaced in Brazil on Monday, Politico journalist Camille von Kaenel filed this analysis of the governor’s purpose:
“The California governor’s task at United Nations climate talks in Belém, Brazil, this week isn’t to negotiate sweeping policy changes or break into closed-door talks reserved for nations. It’s to put on a show: proving his state is still cutting emissions despite President Donald Trump’s rollbacks, nudging governments and businesses to do the same, and reminding the world that the U.S. might one day pick the climate agenda back up — perhaps under a President Newsom.”
There is, however, a subtext to Newsom’s claim to be a climate change warrior. In recent months, he’s tiptoed away from the aggressive decarbonization programs he had championed earlier, clearly trying to minimize impacts — particularly costs — on consumers. Living costs loomed large in last year’s presidential campaign.
One example is Newsom’s effort to stop the planned decommission of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant and several gas-fired generators in Southern California, when it became evident that taking them off-line could lead to shortages in electrical power and potential blackouts.
Another is this year’s 180-degree flip on the petroleum industry. Newsom had spent months demonizing refiners for price-gouging, but when two refineries announced plans to shut down, raising the possibility of sharp gasoline price hikes, Newsom shifted to maintaining fuel supplies and encouraging oil production to stave off imports.
“We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas. No one’s naive about that,” Newsom said. “So it’s always been about finding a just transition, a pragmatism in terms of that process.”
Still another example is what happened just a few days ago in Southern California. After years of squabbling over carbon emissions from ships and equipment at the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the logistics industry and the regional air quality board appointed by Newsom reached a compromise.
The ports are a major source of emissions in the smog-sensitive region and the South Coast Air Quality Management District had been pressing them to shift from gasoline- and diesel-powered equipment to electricity. Cargo handlers complained that expensive retrofits could make the ports uncompetitive in global trade, potentially threatening thousands of jobs.
The agreement requires a three-phase, multi-year transition to zero-emission machinery, which disturbs environmental advocates and even some board members. Opponents who wanted immediate action chanted their displeasure and were removed from the meeting before the vote.
“The give-and-take of ideas and compromises in this process — it mirrors exactly what a real-world transition to zero emissions looks like,” said William Bartelson, an executive at the Pacific Maritime Association. “It’s practical, it’s inclusive and it’s grounded in shared goals.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111025-Newsom-Houston-JF-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-11 08:57:42.305355

A second student seat is a non-voting “designate.” To increase student representation, UC student leaders are pushing for the second seat to also have voting power.","In summary
Of the 26 UC Regents, one student position has voting power. A second student seat is a non-voting “designate.” To increase student representation, UC student leaders are pushing for the second seat to also have voting power. 


The University of California serves 300,000 students, yet only one of the two students on the 26-member Board of Regents is allowed to vote. Now, student leaders are campaigning for a second vote, saying it would better ensure that UC policy reflects all students.
Regents are the top decision-makers of the UC system, and set policies for all campuses, including tuition increases. When one student has to represent the wishes of the entire student population, some feel other perspectives miss out. Last year, when one student regent voted in favor of raising nonresident tuition, the other student regent disagreed, but couldn’t vote on it. 
Currently, the non-voting student spends the first year on the board as a “regent-designate.” That student then moves into the voting position the following year. The students are selected from an applicant pool of all UC graduate and undergraduate students and approved by the board. 
By adding a second vote for student regents, UC would follow in the footsteps of the other two public higher education systems in the state. Legislation passed earlier this decade enabled voting power for two student representatives on the California State University and California Community College governing boards. 
UC board policy, by contrast, cannot be changed through a legislative bill, but could be changed by measures voted on by the regents, or by a constitutional amendment approved by both the Legislature and California voters. Unlike Cal State and community colleges, the UC was established by the state constitution as a system that governs itself with very limited legislative oversight. An attorney general once likened the Board of Regents to a branch of state government, equal to the legislative, judiciary and executive. 
If they choose to go for the amendment, student advocates would like to see it passed by the end of next year’s legislative session so the measure can appear on the November 2026 midterm elections ballot.
Student advocates take the lead
Current student regent Sonya Brooks, a doctoral student in education policy at UCLA, began her voting tenure in July, when she voted in a committee meeting against allowing the UC president to raise professional degree tuition. The committee voted to recommend the president be given this authority, with six in favor and three against. The full board then voted to affirm the authority. 
“I’ve always been an advocate for all things justice,” Brooks said. “Now, because of this position and the opportunities that are available, I’ve really taken advantage to really help not only students… but also faculty and staff.”

Miguel Craven, an energy systems graduate student at UC Davis, is shadowing Brooks this year as the non-voting student regent. He was UC Merced’s student government senator and president during undergrad, while also serving as a student observer to the regents. 
He hopes to act as a bridge between students and regents, in a system that can structurally feel hard for students to participate in.
“It’s not so much that the institution consults the students,” Craven said. “The reality is, it’s the other way: the students have to consult the institution… It’s up to the students to make that effort.”
Every year, the UC Student Association, a coalition of UC students and student governments, conducts a civic engagement campaign called UCweVOTE to teach students about electoral processes and encourage them to vote. This year, to boost student power on the Board of Regents, they are taking the lead in advocating for voting rights for the second student regent. 
Aditi Hariharan, the association’s president and a fifth-year nutrition and political science double major at UC Davis, wants to see a broader range of student voices and backgrounds represented that cannot be captured in just one vote.
“The need for this campaign is the fact that students aren’t a monolith,” said Hariharan. “Not every student views issues the same.”

Advocates believe a second voting student can also give weight to the student voice on more than one of the regents’ 10 committees. Regent committees often meet concurrently, meaning the voting student regent can only cast votes at one of them. 
Committee deliberations often have big impacts on regent decisions, says former student regent Alexis Zaragoza. Non-voting student regents can attend committee meetings and contribute to discussions, but Zaragoza noted even this ability is not protected in policy. She wishes it was.
“If you have two student votes… maybe the other student votes a different way, right?” Zaragoza said. “And it kind of just shows, maybe students are actually kind of split on this issue, maybe your different backgrounds contribute in different ways. It no longer puts that pressure on one student to represent an entire populace.” 
One issue on which students and student regents sometimes disagree is tuition. At the November 2024 regent meeting, the board, including Josiah Beharry, the student regent at the time, voted to increase nonresident tuition. 
At the meeting, multiple students raised concerns about the tuition increase, including Craven as a student observer, who said the increase would limit accessibility at the UC by making the university less affordable for out-of-state and international students. 
The two students were “not in agreement” on this issue, Brooks recalled. After the vote, Beharry asked Brooks how she would have voted in his shoes. She told him she would have voted against the increase. Beharry has not responded to multiple requests for comment.
A trip through the Legislature
In 2021, former Sen. Steve Glazer, a Democrat from Orinda in the East Bay, introduced Senate Constitutional Amendment 5, which would have required the creation of a second voting student regent. The Assembly Appropriations Committee determined that the amendment’s costs to the UC would be “minor and absorbable.” 
However, Glazer told CalMatters that the committee decided the amendment would not progress, without specifying a reason.
In 1974, a constitutional amendment approved by California voters gave the board permission to have a student regent. The regents added the position in 1975. Then, in 1993, the regents created the regent-designate position by voting on a policy, without a constitutional amendment. 
According to an assembly committee analysis of Glazer’s amendment, a constitutional amendment is not required to add a second student voter. This time around, the student association is considering simply proposing a policy change for the board to vote on rather than a constitutional amendment.
If the student association decides to go the amendment route, they would need a legislator to sponsor the bill, which would need the approval of several committees, a two-thirds vote in both the Assembly and Senate, and a simple majority of votes in a statewide election. 
As with Glazer’s amendment, students say the change in voting power will not directly lead to extra costs for the university, because both student regents already attend all meetings on the UC’s dime. It would be a simple transition from a non-voting to a voting role.

Some students do still see value in having a non-voting student regent build understanding during the first year before receiving voting power. Brooks is an active participant at bi-monthly regent meetings, asking questions, chatting with students, and engaging in debates with other regents. But when she joined the board, “I didn’t know A to Z,” she said. “If I didn’t have that one year to grow, to meet people, to form these organic relationships… I would have completely been lost.”
All regents, including student regents, complete the same orientation. These training sessions teach them board policies and logistics, and include briefings with board leaders. So when student regents join the board, they know what they’re getting into, Zaragoza said. 
None of the 18 regents appointed by the governor responded to CalMatters’ requests for comment on this story. The other seven members are “ex officio,” having regental power by virtue of another office they hold, such as the governor and Assembly speaker. These members don’t always attend regent meetings.
Craven thinks that a second student voter isn’t the sole solution to the lack of student representation. He’s interested in ways to expand student advocacy at the regents beyond the positions that exist. 
“What does student representation mean?” Craven said. “Does that mean somebody who’s actually voting, who sits on the board? Do we want to provide an additional space for students to be able to speak?… It’s a discussion that has to happen.”
On Nov. 19, the regents will vote whether to re-affirm annual tuition increases for incoming groups of students, which was first implemented in 2021. Brooks said few students have shared concerns with her over the increases, but she plans to seek them out and talk to them.
“I will continue to reach out to students and vote accordingly,” Brooks said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/091725_UCRegents_FM_CM_28.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-11 08:57:42.305355

Today in Maryland, they are thrown into adult prisons. The state must do better by those youth, living and dead, write Vincent Schiraldi and Marc Schindler.","A fallen gravestone, marked only with the initials J.B., in the woods that have overtaken a graveyard for Black youth in Cheltenham. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Recent news of a long-abandoned burial site near Maryland’s House of Reformation for Colored Children – a Blacks-only youth prison opened in 1873 to remove youth from adult prisons – has sparked much-needed grappling with the state’s legacy of disparate treatment of youth of color and laws that disproportionately prosecute Black children as adults. This comes against the backdrop of actions by President Donald Trump to erase uncomfortable history, as well as to prosecute 14-year-olds as adults in Washington, D.C.
Between the 1880s and 1939 there were likely more than 230 children buried, in mostly unmarked graves, in a wooded area adjacent to the House of Reformation in Cheltenham. Before its opening, Black youth, some as young as 5, were sent to Maryland’s adult prisons. The House of Reformation opened nearly two decades after the House of Refuge – the reform school established in Baltimore to remove white children from Maryland’s adult prisons.
While records mostly cite disease as the youths’ cause of death, reporting at the time reveals violence, gross neglect and cover-ups. It appears families of the boys who died were rarely, if ever, notified. State officials were aware of the site as far back as the 1970s, but nothing was done to preserve it, even when the adjacent area was turned into an appropriately dignified cemetery for Maryland veterans.
So more than 200 Black youth, buried in unmarked graves with officials aware of the situation going back 50 years, but doing nothing. This scandal presents, as Legislative Black Caucus Chair Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery) urged on a recent site visit with caucus members, “an opportunity to take action.”

Fortunately, through work done under the Moore administration and recent actions of elected officials, it appears there will finally be steps taken to address these issues.
Since locating the burial site in October 2024, the Department of Juvenile Services began plans to restore, recognize and maintain it, including: applying for funds for a ground-penetrating radar survey to discern how many boys are buried there; restoring the area as an official cemetery identifying the buried boys; attempting to communicate with the boys’ families; partnering with nonprofit groups and descendants to recognize the cemetery’s history; and creating a dignified process to address the harms against them. This was part of a larger initiative we launched to document the segregationist history of juvenile justice in Maryland under the belief that, to change the system, we had to grapple with the past, even if that was uncomfortable.
When the burial site was revealed in July, Senate Judicial Proceedings Chair Will Smith (D-Montgomery) called to rehabilitate the grounds with dignity. In stark contrast to proposals to try 14-year-olds as adults in neighboring D.C., Smith also announced he would reintroduce legislation to curb Maryland’s practice of automatically trying so many youth as adults, a reform recently endorsed by the state’s juvenile justice commission. As Smith said then, “Segregation was terrible. Secretly burying young people in unmarked graves is indefensible. But at least the leaders of that day were taking young people out of adult jails and prisons.”
Arguments in favor of Smith’s approach – and against Trump’s – are strong.  Maryland currently incarcerates a higher percentage of its youth in adult jails and prisons than any state except Alabama. The department calculated it cost nearly $20 million annually just to hold youths while they are processed in slow-moving adult courts to decide whether they stay in adult court or are returned to juvenile court. About 85% of cases were either returned to juvenile court or dismissed, begging the question of how this approach makes sense.
Additionally, research shows that prosecuting youth in the adult system not only fails to  contribute to public safety, it results in more crime. Youth prosecuted as adults are more likely to reoffend and to do so in a violent manner than similar youth kept in juvenile court. Youth held in the adult system are also more likely to be sexually assaulted and to attempt suicide.
And like the double-standard that existed when Maryland operated segregated facilities, the state’s “autowaiver” law is not affecting all children equally.  Nine out of 10 youth charged as adults are youth of color; 80% are Black.
A century ago, poor Black youth were thrown away and buried in unmarked graves. We need to acknowledge this painful history, learn from it and atone for those harms. Today the system throws them away into adult prisons despite evidence that that is ineffective and unfair.  We must do better to honor these youths’ legacies and change our laws to reflect what data shows will improve public safety, save money, and create a more equitable system.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cheltenham-headstone-9-23-2025-cropped-e1758712940300-1024x718.jpg,,,2025-11-11 08:57:42.305355

(Photo by Jerry Redfern / Capital & Main)The New Mexico Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear an appeal for a lawsuit brought by environmental, youth and activist groups challenging the constitutionality of oil and gas pollution in the state.
The lawsuit, Atencio v. State of New Mexico, filed in May 2023, argues that the state’s permitting of oil and gas production, alongside a failure to enforce pollution laws, violates its duty laid out in a 1971 amendment Article 20, Section 21 of the state Constitution, the pollution control clause.
Gail Evans, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement characterized New Mexico’s Constitution as “strong” and said she was confident the state Supreme Court would “uphold New Mexicans’ right to protection of our health and our environment.”




Pollution Control
“The protection of the state’s beautiful and healthful environment is hereby declared to be of fundamental importance to the public interest, health, safety and the general welfare. The legislature shall provide for control of pollution and control of despoilment of the air, water and other natural resources of this state, consistent with the use and development of these resources for the maximum benefit of the people.”
– New Mexico constitutional amendment approved by voters November 1971




Plaintiffs requested the courts rule the state has a constitutional duty to prevent pollution — similar to landmark rulings in education and workers’ compensation — and asked the courts to “suspend additional permitting of oil and gas wells” until the state is in compliance. Moreover, plaintiffs asked the courts order state government to install a regulatory structure and plan to protect from pollution.
In June 2024,  First District Judge Matthew Wilson dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims against the Legislature, but allowed the case to continue moving through the courts to determine if a constitutional right to pollution control exists.
A year later, in June of this year, the New Mexico Court of Appeals reversed that ruling and concluded that the judiciary does not have the power to address the plaintiffs’ claims.
The plaintiffs appealed and will now have their case heard by the state Supreme Court, which did not provide any additional scheduling information on the case.
“We have hope that the Supreme Court will find that our state constitution guarantees our right to a healthy environment and upholds the requirement that the state protect us from toxic oil and gas pollution,” Johnny Juarez with Youth United for Climate Crisis Action said in a statement. “We brought this case to protect every New Mexican from the devastation caused by the state’s failure to control this filthy industry. It’s time the state lives up to that commitment.”
The suit also contends that oil and gas pollution disproportionately harms Indigenous, youth and frontline communities, and seeks additional constitutional relief for those alleged harms as well.
Attorneys for the State of New Mexico have previously argued the case oversteps separations of power between the branches of government, and that youth and frontline communities are not protected classes and there’s no discriminatory intent.
Mario Atencio (Diné), one of the plaintiffs, has previously discussed damage to sacred Navajo lands as a result of the oil and gas industry. “Our Constitution requires protection of our healthful environment, and yet the state continues to allow the industry to make our air unhealthy to breathe, and to waste and contaminate our precious drinking water, all for fracking,” Atencio said in a statement Monday. “With our Constitution, we hope to ensure that the state protects all of us from the harms of this dangerous industry.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DSC1659_01-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-11-11 08:57:42.305355

California state officials are in Brazil for the annual United Nations climate conference. The visit highlights California’s role as a climate leader and supports its environmental policies, especially since the U.S. has no official federal delegation. However, some critics question whether the trip is worthwhile because California lacks the power to make international agreements.


California likes to think of itself as a nation — and this week, it’s acting like one. Gov. Gavin Newsom, top state officials and legislators are leading a delegation to the United Nations’ 30th Conference of Parties this week in Belém, a gateway to Brazil’s Amazon region. 
The state has no seat in the rooms where nations will negotiate their commitments under international law to curbing greenhouse gases. But California and the governor are there anyway, to project his and the state’s climate message onto the global stage. 
“The reason I’m here is the absence of leadership coming from the United States — this vacuum, it’s rather jaw dropping,” Newsom said Monday in São Paulo, speaking at the Milken Institute Global Investors’ Symposium. “Not even an observer; not someone taking notes.”
After the Trump administration withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement for the second time earlier this year, California was left symbolically standing in for a United States government.
Supporters say the annual global climate conference is worth it, pointing to policies inspired by and partnerships formed at past conferences. But environmental justice advocates question the value of these excursions, arguing the events are too distant and industry-driven to reflect frontline communities.
California’s presence on the world stage may matter more than ever, experts said — but the state can’t substitute for the world’s leading superpower. Although it’s Newsom’s first time at the summit, he has sent state representatives to every event since he took office. 
“If we weren’t doing things like this, then the rest of the world would be even more puzzled as to what’s going on inside the United States,” said UC San Diego climate expert David G. Victor. “The symbolic value of showing that the United States has not completely abandoned climate and clean energy…is pretty important for the rest of the world, but there’s not a huge caloric value to it.”
International events influence state policy 
California officials who attend the climate conference say they foster relationships with international leaders that influence policy, both through subnational agreements and through legislative efforts. 
“Californians have been very clear that we also need to take actions … to combat climate change,” said state Natural Resources Agency Secretary Wade Crowfoot, part of the delegation to Brazil. “And simply put, it doesn’t make any sense that all of the answers would be found in California.” 
As a strategy to achieve its goals, California has signed dozens of agreements with other regional governments and some nations, including Mexico, Australia and Denmark. 
In August, Newsom signed an agreement with Denmark committing to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045 — a goal established in an executive order and in state law — and to collaborate on ways to improve cyber resilience. In March, the state entered an agreement with the Mexican state of Sonora to expand renewable electricity generation and cross-border energy trade.
The state’s relationship with Denmark has helped California gain access to technology to better manage its water systems, Crowfoot added. Using that geophysical imaging technology, Stanford researchers were able to map the state’s groundwater system as part of a joint study. 
Legislators say the climate conference itself has brought solutions from abroad to local problems. 
Sen. Anna Caballero, a Democrat who represents Merced,  said severe climate impacts to her region prompted her to look for answers internationally. In 2023, she traveled to the U.N. summit in Dubai – in part, she said, looking for climate solutions that would keep workers in her region employed as the state transitions away from fossil fuels.
“I’ve been concerned with the lack of investments that actually make a difference in rural and poorly resourced communities,” Caballero said. “So I was looking for alternatives.”
The Dubai trip inspired a number of bills, she said, including one that directs the state Air Resources Board to develop carbon capture and sequestration technologies to meet greenhouse gas reduction goals. Newsom signed the bill into law in 2022.  Caballero said she has met with people from the Amazon who are affected by climate change, and “it was very moving,” she said. 
“The impact we have on the world is tremendous, and we just need to be more sensitive to that.”
What’s in it for state leaders? 
With the fourth-largest economy in the world, California wields clout even without being directly involved in global climate talks. Newsom is continuing a decades-long tradition of state governors who have used the U.N. summit as a chance to cement their status as climate leaders and substitute diplomats.
Arnold Schwarzenegger was the first California governor to attend the conference, flying to Copenhagen in 2009.  Then, Jerry Brown attended the 2015 summit where the United Nations signed the Paris agreement, a legally-binding treaty aimed at limiting global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. That year, Brown started the Under 2 Coalition, a group of 200 subnational governments that share knowledge with each other to work toward that goal. 
It’s Newsom’s first time attending the international conference, but he has burnished his profile as a climate leader by travelling to other events. 
In the past, Newsom has appeared regularly at Climate Week in New York City, where he told a United Nations summit in 2023 that “this climate crisis is a fossil fuel crisis.” This year, however, he has moderated his posture toward the fossil fuel industry, advancing legislation to expand drilling in Kern County and slowing certain regulations. In 2023, he also traveled to China to promote California’s zero-emission vehicle agenda.
He was named co-chair of the U.N. summit’s newly-formed Local Leaders Forum, a group of regional and state leaders that met in Rio de Janeiro the week before the conference to discuss subnational strategies to reduce emission.
So far at events around the conference in Brazil, Newsom has highlighted the state’s progress in deploying electric cars, extending its cap and trade program through 2045 and increasingly running the grid on renewable energy such as wind, solar, and battery storage.
“The state of California has been a consistent partner for a half century, and will continue to be for decades to come,” he said.
For Newsom, attending the conference is also about positioning himself as a global leader as he considers a 2028 presidential run.  
Shannon Gibson, a University of Southern California professor who teaches global climate policy, said the U.N. summit offers a massive international stage, media coverage and access to world leaders that help Newsom advance his climate agenda.
It’s not a bad place for Newsom to showcase his presidential leadership abilities, she added. 
“It’s the ability to network and rub elbows with high level leaders, prime ministers and presidents from all around the world,” Gibson said. “It does present an international stage where Gov. Newsom could take his domestic policies and advance them at that global level.”
Not everyone sees the governor’s global spotlight as a virtue. State Senator Tony Strickland, a Republican from Huntington Beach, said Newsom should be tackling the state’s affordability crisis instead of viewing every decision through the lens of a future presidential run.
“We have major problems here in California,” Strickland said. “We need a leader to solve these problems.”
Costs & Controversy 
A private nonprofit tied to the governor paid for Newsom’s trip to Brazil. The non-profit helps fund a range of official travel and ceremonial events, drawing money both from his inaugural committees and outside donors.
The California State Protocol Foundation is a charitable nonprofit corporation whose purpose is “to lessen the burden on California taxpayers by relieving the state of California of its obligations to fund certain expenditures.” The Governor’s own inaugural committees have contributed at least $5 million since 2019, according to data from the Fair Political Practices Commission reviewed by CalMatters.  The governor established inaugural committees to pay for events and official activities surrounding his 2019 and 2023 inaugurations.
The protocol foundation has drawn a range of outside donors to pay for state officials’ international travel – not just to climate conferences. The Hewlett Foundation provided $300,000 in 2023 to support the Governor’s climate-focused trip to China. The Los Angeles Dodgers contributed $25,000 in 2021 to help underwrite his State of the State address at Dodger Stadium. 
“We don’t live in an ideal world,” said Jessica A. Levinson, a law professor at Loyola Marymount Law School in Los Angeles and former president of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission. “On the one hand, you’re trying to protect our scarcest resource, which is taxpayer dollars,” she continued, “on the other hand, you are, of course, allowing private influence over public officials.”
Legislators said they cover their expenses to attend international climate conferences with campaign funds and their own money. And in 2021, two nonprofits, the Climate Action Reserve and the Climate Registry covered some costs for lawmakers to attend the event in Scotland. 
That year, the Assembly covered the costs for a few security staff to accompany them –  funded by taxpayer dollars. This year, there is no extra security or staff accompanying the two legislators attending: Senator Josh Becker, a Democrat from Menlo Park, and Senator Henry Stern, a Democrat from the Calabasas area.  
Recently, environmental justice and indigenous communities have criticized the U.N.’s choices to hold events in regions that have an economic interest in fossil fuels: Dubai in 2023 and Azerbaijan in 2024. 
This year’s conference is also controversial for some, because it’s located in populous but remote Belém, which some say lacks sufficient infrastructure. Attendees took multiple planes to reach the city, and hotel options are limited. 
Caballero said she opted out of attending the conference this year, as she did last year, because of the length of the journey.
“I would go in a heartbeat,” she said, “if it weren’t for the inconvenient travel.”
Environmental groups are skeptical 
Schwarzenegger was seen as a trailblazer when he first attended the U.N. conference. But more than a decade later, he offered a different perspective: bringing world leaders together to commit to the same goals year after year is a waste of time. 
“The definition of insanity is you do the same thing over and over again and expect different results,” he said. “When it comes to the negotiations with the U.N., these COP kind of agreements, I think it’s set up the wrong way.” 
Critics question the practical value of California’s presence around international climate talks. The state’s subnational agreements are largely aspirational. Environmental activists, who lack access to international talks and funds to attend conferences, raise concerns about how well state agencies represent local interests abroad. 
“In a lot of ways, it seems like it’s a pretty performative meeting,” said Catherine Garoupa, executive director of the Central Valley Air Quality Coalition and a member of the Air Resources Board’s environmental justice advisory committee.  “I’ve never had a conversation or been consulted by anyone who participates in that forum.”
Jaron Browne, an Oakland organizer with the Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, traveled to Belém for the People’s Climate Summit,  a parallel gathering where activists and Indigenous leaders called for fairer climate policies, stronger land protections, and accountability for major polluters.
Browne said that while California speaks with urgency on climate, its continued reliance on imported crude oil undercuts that message. 
What communities near the fencelines of refineries and other industrial polluters want is to stop pollution at its source, said Browne. The bigger problem, he added, is that carbon markets like California’s cap-and-trade system let companies keep polluting while claiming progress by buying offsets or funding forest projects.
“Thank God we have a voice that is speaking about the urgency of the crisis, and that’s very important, and taking some really important progressive stances,” Browne said. At the same time, “we talk out of both sides of our mouths.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110725-COP30-Brazil-WM-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-11 08:57:42.305355

(Photo courtesy of Dwight ""Andy"" Anderson)During World War II, countless men and women from Utah answered the call, leaving behind their families, their futures, and their dreams to defend the freedoms we cherish today. Thousands of miles away from home, they faced unimaginable challenges and endured horrific conditions. They did not seek recognition or reward, yet history will forever remember them as heroes. Among the brave souls who left Utah but never returned was Pvt. Samuel “Sam” C. Morrelli. 
I was born in Paris, and about 10 years ago, I carried out extensive research on American heroes buried at the Epinal American Cemetery in France. That’s when I first learned about Pvt. Morrelli. Using a detailed obituary published by the Standard-Examiner in Ogden, Utah, in December 1944 and a biography of his father, I compiled his story to share.
Sam was born on March 14, 1923, in Ogden, Utah, to Amico Giusto “Mike” Morrelli and Pauline Lena “Polly” Lombardi. He grew up in a home filled with love and laughter, sharing unforgettable moments with his siblings. Even from a young age, Sam stood out for his kindness and determination. At just 12 years old, he worked with his father, helping build their family’s brick home from the ground up. Mornings, nights, and weekends were spent hammering, mixing, and laying bricks. He was rewarded with a new bicycle — a gift that made him so happy. 
Sam attended St. Joseph Catholic School and graduated from Ogden High School in 1939. Known for his sharp mind, work ethic and generosity, he was admired by his teachers and loved by his classmates. At Weber College, he continued to grow into a young man of character, integrity and promise. 
When the world fell into chaos and freedom stood in peril, Sam felt a call that couldn’t be ignored. Driven by a deep sense of duty and love for his country, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve Corps on Nov. 27, 1942. Initially part of the Air Corps Engineer Reserve, he studied for nine months at the University of South Dakota before transitioning to the infantry. He was later assigned to Company C, 1st Battalion, 324th Infantry Regiment, 44th Infantry Division. In September 1944, Sam was deployed to Europe — stepping into the heart of one of history’s most brutal wars.
He found himself in the Vosges Mountains of France — a place of unimaginable hardship with freezing temperatures, unforgiving terrain, and relentless enemy fire. Yet Sam and his brothers-in-arms pressed forward, village by village — fighting not for glory, but to liberate people they had never met. Their courage and determination were nothing short of heroic.
In mid-November, his unit continued advancing through the Vosges, battling fiercely to break through German lines. Tragically, near the village of Avricourt, Sam was struck by enemy fire. His comrades rushed to his aid and quickly realized the severity of his injuries. Medics and nurses fought desperately to save him, but on Nov. 18, 1944, Sam died from his wounds. He was just 21 years old — with so much life ahead, and so much to give.
Back in Utah, the news of his death sent shockwaves through the entire community. Sam was a son, a brother, a friend — and now a fallen hero. For his parents, Mike and Polly, the pain was unbearable, and the silence too loud to ignore. They carried a quiet, unspoken grief for the rest of their lives. Mike passed away on Jan. 6, 1979, and Polly on Nov. 30, 1985 — both holding their beloved son close in their hearts.
Today, Sam rests in the Epinal American Cemetery in Dinozé, France — alongside 5,255 fellow Americans who laid down their lives in the battle for freedom. Endless rows of white marble crosses and Stars of David stretch out in silence — a heartbreaking reminder of what it took to defeat the forces of tyranny. Each one marks not just a grave, but a name, a voice, a story — a life full of promise, cut short by an unforgiving war.
It is our solemn responsibility to carry Sam’s memory forward and ensure his name never fades into the archives of history. Let us speak his name with reverence and pride. Let us remember the boy who built a house with his father, who loved his family, and who sacrificed everything for a cause greater than himself. Let us ensure that Pvt. Sam Morrelli is never forgotten — and that the freedom he gave his life for is never taken for granted.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/56374389_136109495106-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-11-11 08:57:42.305355

The Gov. Kay Ivey Correctional Complex in Elmore County, a 4,000-bed men’s prison, will open next October instead of May, said Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, the chair of the Senate Finance and Taxation General Fund Committee, which oversees the Alabama Department of Corrections’ (ADOC) budget. 
“It’s not as far as cost is concerned. In fact because [Caddell Construction Co.] missed the date, part of the agreement is they will pay us,” Albritton said.

The news was first reported by Alabama Daily News.
The cost of the Elmore County facility has far exceeded the original budget. Lawmakers in 2021 originally appropriated $1.3 billion for the construction of the Elmore County facility and another 4,000-bed prison facility in Escambia County. 
Supporters of the plan argued that the new facilities would be safer for the incarcerated and easier to staff, as well as provide additional space for training and rehabilitation facilities. Opponents said the new facilities would be expensive and not address the causes of the violence and overcrowding crisis in the state prisons. 
The costs for the Elmore County prison have soared, due to inflations and higher than expected costs on components of the facility. 
Albritton said the Ivey Correctional Facility is now estimated to cost $1.23 billion.
“We had anticipated both facilities being a total cost of $750 million. Well, we’re way out of that league. But we were able to go to the bond market, and we obtained, I think, $500 million from the bond market, that’s all the money that’s been borrowed,” Albritton said. “And then we used other funds available to the state that we put in over the number of years that we’ve been doing this so that we have funded now all of the Elmore facility, and should have monies left over to begin the Escambia facility.”
Messages seeking comment were left with Ivey and the Alabama Department of Corrections on Monday.
The Elmore County facility is set to have more cells instead of dorms, specialized medical and mental health facilities and centralized spaces to better monitor inmates.
State officials are also prepared to borrow an undisclosed amount of money to start construction on the Escambia County facility. 
“We anticipate and we’ve gotten different estimates on there. But as far as bonding authority we have, we have a bonding authority available more than is needed for the construction of the Escambia facility,” Albritton said.
Albritton sponsored a bill earlier this year to extend the borrowing authority of the Alabama Corrections Institutions Finance Authority.
The 4,000-bed facility in Escambia County has not begun construction and is still in the planning phase.
“We have a large population of inmates that’s growing. The facilities that we haven’t built a prison in 50 years or more. generations. And none of them have been maintained very well. We’ve closed two or three in the last five years, so we have fewer beds and we have more people,” Albritton said.
As of August, there were 21,121 inmates in Alabama prisons. There are 14 major correctional facilities in Alabama.
Inmates will also be moved to the two new facilities to help reduce overcrowding.
“It won’t be an overnight thing. It’s going to take us a while to get people moved in, and also we got to have the staffing that’s available in each too, so it’s going to take a while, but we are foreseeing that and planning for that,” Albritton said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-cell-Holman-2019-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-11 08:57:42.305355

Katie Britt, R-Alabama, expressed skepticism Monday of a proposal to renew Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies one year.
Speaking to the Montgomery Area Chamber of Commerce via teleconference from Washington, Britt suggested that the proposal would not be sufficient.
“A proposal of just a one-year extension doesn’t deal with any of the issues that are in front of us on that,” Britt said of the Affordable Care Act. “There is no income cap for anyone who receives those subsidies.”
About 478,000 Alabamians, or 9.3% of the population, currently get health insurance through Affordable Care Act plans. The enhanced ACA subsidies, first approved by Congress in 2021 and extended the following year, lower insurance costs and make those making more than 400% of the federal poverty level eligible for tax credits through the marketplace. The subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year. That could lead to premiums more than doubling.
“The loss of the enhanced tax credits is going to result in 2026 health care premiums skyrocketing,” said Natasha Murphy, director of health policy at the Center for American Progress, in an interview on Monday.
Murphy said there had been fraud from some brokers and agents applying for assistance on people’s behalf, but that there had been safeguards put in place.
“The notion that individuals are, in every enrollment, enrolling in health coverage trying to get tax credits is definitely not the case,” she said. “People are not getting hard checks for their health coverage. These are funds that are going to the insurance company on behalf of their monthly premiums.”
Britt spoke a day after seven Democrats and one independent joined nearly all Republican senators in voting to advance a bill to end the federal government shutdown, the longest in history. The bill would restore aid for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Plan (SNAP) and return federal workers fired during the shutdown. It would not extend the ACA credits, the major sticking point for Democrats during the shutdown. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, said he will hold a vote on them in the Republican-dominated chamber.
“What we said is that we would take the budget as it currently exists, which ironically is President (Joe) Biden’s budget, and we would extend that for the next several weeks as we work to do our jobs,” Britt said during the event. “The reason we ended up having to do a continuing resolution is because we have not passed appropriation bills.”
The move will allow to approve four bills: the continuing resolution and three appropriations measures to fund the Legislative Branch, the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration through fiscal year 2026.
The continuing resolution would keep the government open through Jan. 30.
Appropriations for USDA was one of the most heavily publicized because it is the agency responsible for overseeing SNAP, which helps low-income households pay for food. It covers about 726,000 Alabamians. . The compromise funds the program for the remainder of the year.
Food banks saw increased need as more people sought their assistance as the benefits expired.
Two federal judges and an appeals court ordered the administration to use emergency funding to allow the program to continue, but the U.S. Supreme Court blocked the payment of benefits Friday.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Katie-Britt-April-17-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-11 08:04:12.483569

(Nadav Soroker/Searchlight New Mexico)
The state environment department on Monday announced free filters and water testing for residents in La Cienega and La Cieneguilla, two Santa Fe County communities where toxic chemicals have been identified in the groundwater.
Specifically, a report by research firm INTERA found that one in three parcels in both areas showed PFAS contamination in the underlying groundwater, with 169 parcels showing contamination above Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standards, a New Mexico Environment Department news release said. Total PFAS levels were found to be as high as 800 parts per trillion, which is more than 200 times the federal drinking water standard of 4 parts per trillion set for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), two of the many PFAS compounds. The source of the contamination and solutions for cleaning the groundwater remain under investigation, the department said.
PFAS (per and poly fluoroalkyl substances), so-called “forever chemicals” are a class of synthetic chemicals used in the manufacture of everything from rugs to cookware to firefighting foams. Exposure through contaminated water and soil, as well as through the plants and animals, cause PFAS to build up in the human body. While still being studied, PFAS exposure is linked to increased cancer risks, fertility issues, low birth weights or fetal development issues, hormonal imbalances and limiting vaccine effectiveness.
Environment Secretary James Kenney said the state had funded the study and contracted with TLC Plumbing to install the filters in residents’ homes. “If your private well water exceeds PFAS drinking water standards, installing a filter in your home is the best way for residents to protect themselves from these chemicals, which can lead to health issues,” Kenney said in a statement.
La Cienega and La Cieneguilla are the latest communities working with the state to counter exposure to PFAS. NMED last month announced that approximately 100 homes in Curry County would be receiving a new water source to lessen their exposure to toxic PFAS in their drinking wells from nearby Cannon Air Force Base.
The state has also kicked off the rulemaking process for a new law that requires labeling for some intentionally added PFAS to certain consumer products, and an eventual ban of them.
New Mexico’s efforts to regulate PFAS attract national industry pushback

NMED also will host an open house at the La Cienega Community Center on Nov. 15, and intends to attend the community’s own town hall on PFAS this week.
“Environmental justice has long been a concern for La Cieneguilla and surrounding area residents and now our highest priority is to assure that households and agriculture can return to having clean and healthy water,” Santa Fe County Commissioner Camilla Bustamante said in a statement. “I am grateful that Secretary Kenney has assured support in holding the sources of this contamination accountable. Be assured that together we will identify the most effective long-term strategies to return and protect the quality of our waters.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Villegas15_PFAS_1.25.2024-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-11 08:04:12.483569

This Veterans Day, however, the Trump administration is threatening to undo our progress against homelessness in ways that could hurt veterans in particular.
The U.S. has made incredible strides in reducing veteran homelessness by 55% since 2009. In contrast, overall homelessness declined by only 10% through 2022 and then surged to a record high in 2024 as pandemic relief measures came to an end.
At the center of our remarkable progress for veterans are two strategies: housing vouchers and the “Housing First” approach (which starts with the premise that people need safe, stable housing before they can successfully address other life challenges, like unemployment or substance use disorder).
Now, the Trump administration wants to slash both and, worse yet, replace them with increased criminalization measures. This will hurt veterans and hundreds of thousands of other Americans experiencing homelessness or on the brink.
In July, President Trump issued an Executive Order (EO) seeking to weaken protections against forced institutionalization of people with mental health disabilities and unhoused people. The EO also directs federal grant programs that fund community homeless services to abandon evidence-based, humane approaches — like Housing First — and instead reward communities that center arrest and incarceration.

If implemented, these policy changes could disproportionately harm veterans, of whom about one-third have a disability here in Michigan. Among unhoused veterans, the disability rate is 55% – notably higher than for unhoused people overall. Specifically, 1 in 3 has a mental health disability, 1 in 3 has a physical disability, and 1 in 6 has a chronic health condition.
At the same time, the Trump administration is pushing for a 50% cut to federal rental assistance programs, including Housing Choice Vouchers, and a 70% cut to the agency that enforces fair housing laws. Reported cases of housing discrimination are rising, with disability-based discrimination now making up more than half. Thus, gutting this agency could threaten access to safe housing for veterans in particular.
The monstrous Trump crackdown on disabled and unhoused folks comes alongside massive cuts to Medicaid and food assistance under the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act. In Michigan, 39,000 veterans are enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and more than 57,000 are enrolled in Medicaid. The Republican-sponsored bill eliminated a provision that made it easier for veterans and unhoused people to access their SNAP benefits and puts half a million Michiganders at risk of losing their health insurance.
During Trump’s first term, homelessness ticked up after years of slow but steady decline. Now, the Trump administration’s agenda threatens to push more Americans — including veterans and their families — into economic precarity. This essentially guarantees continued growth of the unhoused population who would be targeted for lockup, either in psychiatric institutions or jails.
Obviously, saddling people with criminal records and fines they can’t pay won’t make it easier for them to secure gainful employment and stable housing in the future. A person who has been incarcerated once is nearly seven times more likely to experience homelessness, and, for those incarcerated more than once, 13 times more likely.
The Trump administration’s war on homeless people will have a particular impact on disabled people and veterans. That the president and those propping him up would take freedom away from those who have defended ours — many of whom became disabled in service to our country — is unconscionable. To honor U.S. veterans this year, we can start by making sure they and the fellow Americans they have dedicated their lives to serving all have safe, stable homes.

The Marine veteran and self-described “city boy” from Waterbury had agreed to go pheasant hunting with friends in the Naugatuck State Forest. It was McCool’s second attempt after an unsuccessful earlier outing, and he was reluctant to try again.
But this time his friends brought along Boone, a German short-haired pointer, and McCool said he was inspired by the way the dog and its handler worked together to pursue, shoot and retrieve their quarry.
“When I was in the Marine Corps, I felt like I had a purpose,” said McCool, who served from 2008 to 2014 and was deployed in Jordan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. “What I did made a difference to myself, the people I directly worked with, and part of an overall, bigger mission in some way, shape or form. I felt accomplished.”
That same feeling of purpose came back to him on that hunting trip, McCool said. “I wanted to immerse myself in everything that had to do with that dog, which were the game birds that drove her.”

The experience led McCool to open Steadfast Farms in 2017. The farm, which he operates with his brother, Aaron, has since grown to become one of the state’s largest producers of game birds such as quail, pheasant and chukar — a type of partridge. The brothers also raise thousands of chickens and hundreds of turkeys each year.
In addition, McCool has enlisted the support of other veterans as president of the Connecticut chapter of the Veteran Farmer Coalition, a national organization. The group’s work includes connecting returning vets to careers in agriculture and promoting the work of the state’s existing veteran-owned farms through farm stands, marketing and help applying for grants.
In 2023, the coalition launched a website, CTVeteranGrown.org, that serves as a hub for farmers as well as a resource for customers to find produce, meat, honey and other products from local veteran-owned farms. More than 40 farms are currently listed on the site.
The project is supported by the nonprofit Connecticut Resource Conservation and Development (CT RC&D) through a multi-year $500,000 grant from the U.S. Small Business Administration. In addition, participating farms get permission to market their products with a specialized “Homegrown by Heroes” label that also features branding from the Connecticut Department of Agriculture.
“People usually like to support local. This is just an added benefit that we’re supporting our military veterans,” said Amanda Fargo-Johnson, the agricultural programs director at CT RC&D. The tagline for the program is, “Served then, still serving now.”
In 2022 there were 668 farms in Connecticut operated by veterans or people serving in the military, according the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The total value of products produced by those farms was more than $62 million.

Fad foods
McCool’s first step in launching Steadfast Farms was to purchase several acres of land in Bethlehem that included a ranch house and a small barn where he could protect his birds from predators such as bears and coyotes. At the time, he was working in sales for a technology company — a job that he says paid well but left him searching for more fulfillment.
Early on, McCool and a business partner at the time decided to focus on raising quail for their eggs, which were gaining popularity as a “superfood” rich in protein and vitamin B12. 
Working nights, early mornings and weekends on the farm, McCool said he was able to bring roughly 1,500 game birds to market in the first year.
“That was a lot, because I was a city boy,” he said. Still, at that point, it wasn’t enough to turn a profit. But the farm was gaining momentum. 
McCool expanded into raising chickens and turkeys. Then, after losing his day job during the COVID-19 pandemic, he jumped full time into farming. 
In 2020, he brought his brother Aaron on board as the farm’s director of operations. That same year, Steadfast Farms received a matching grant from the state allowing the brothers to begin construction of a processing facility for egg production, slaughter and meatpacking.
Today, Steadfast Farms raises up to 16,000 birds a year while processing another 21,000 birds raised on farms from as far away as Maine. And they’re making money.
In addition to being the only federally inspected poultry slaughter facility in Connecticut, Steadfast Farms has also received its organic handling certification from the USDA.
The brothers are currently planning the next expansion of their processing facility, which will allow them to scale up production of pre-packaged products such as chicken sausages, pickled quail eggs and Thanksgiving turkeys. By the end of this year, they hope to be able to ship products nationwide.
“I make less money [than working in sales], I work longer hours, I wake up earlier, go to bed later — and I couldn’t be happier,” McCool said. “It is so easy to get up in the morning because you’re just ready to start the next day.”

McCool attributed much of the farm’s success to the sustained popularity of quail eggs. The farm’s flock is capable of producing as many as 320,000 eggs a year. 
“BJs is carrying quail eggs, most of your supermarkets are carrying quail eggs, now you’re starting to see Instagram influencers post about quail eggs,” he said. “Really, the only thing keeping [quail] out of the mainstream right now is not the taste, it’s not the amount of meat, it’s the cost.”
Coturnix quail, the type the McCools raise, lay eggs that are about one-third the size of chicken egg. Steadfast Farms sells a dozen quail eggs for $7.25. McCool is also working on breeding his own plump variety of quail that lays fewer eggs but comes with about 50% more meat.
In addition to raising birds for their meats and eggs, Steadfast Farms also sells live game birds to other farms, private hunting clubs and state agencies such as the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife to stock during hunting season.
Following the brothers around the farm these days is Remi, another German shorthaired pointer that McCool purchased from the same breeder as the dog that inspired his interest in farming nearly a decade ago. His brother is quick to note the significance as he offers Remi a scratch behind the ears.
“Everything we do here is because of her,” Aaron said.

A helping hand
The idea to establish a statewide network of veteran farmers came to McCool in 2019, when he was in the process of applying for a federal grant to install solar panels on the roof of his farmhouse.
At the time, he said, he was struggling to navigate the myriad programs available from Connecticut Department of Agriculture to support small farmers.
“Connecticut has tons of resources for new and beginning farmers, but it is analysis paralysis, click a link to another link,” McCool said. “You didn’t really know who to talk to, how to follow through to take advantage of these programs.” 
McCool found a helping hand through Fargo-Johnson and CT RC&D’s Farm Up program, which offers one-on-one counseling and support services to small farmers and agricultural businesses. “Amanda was so good at what she did with the solar I was like, ‘Amanda, it would be great if, like, I had a you to help me navigate all the Department of Agriculture programs,” he recalled.

As a result of those conversations, RC&D expanded its Farm Up program to include assistance that was specifically tailored to veteran farmers. Fargo-Johnson said that one of the biggest hurdles facing veterans seeking a start in the industry is that, for the most part, they are not inheriting farmland from their parents or grandparents. 
‘They’re first-generation farmers trying to figure out, you know, where can I farm?” Fargo-Johnson said. “They don’t walk into a farm family who says, ‘Great, take over the business.’ So that’s really a challenge, kind of setting their anchor and finding where they can grow their business, their family, everything.”
While McCool said that Farm Up offered vital logistical support for veteran farmers, he still felt there was a need for an organization that could provide the sense of “camaraderie” that he had felt during his military service.
After doing more research online, McCool said he came cross the Veteran Farmer Coalition, which was opening up chapters in more than a dozen states across the country. Again working with Fargo-Johnson and other local veterans, he helped launch the first Connecticut chapter in 2022. 
In addition to monthly meetings, McCool said the group hosts quarterly gatherings and messaging groups across various platforms like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp where members can find social interaction or a helpful bit of advice.
“What we find is, yes, veterans want camaraderie, but especially the ones that farm or run businesses, we’re all always busy,” McCool said.
As a result of the resources that have been made available through RC&D and the Farmer Veteran Coalition, the number of veterans who received farm transition grants from the Connecticut Department of Agriculture went from four in 2024 to eight so far this year.
“We’re actually seeing the growth of this community happen,” Agriculture Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt said. “There’s a lot more attention… from media, but also from other farmer veterans who realize that it’s not just a social group of people with a shared experience, but it’s a business relationship group as well that can help support them in their business development.”

Clearing a ‘path’
In their latest initiative, McCool and the Farmer Veteran Coalition are working again with RC&D to launch program called “Path to Victory” that pairs returning veterans with more experienced farmers for a longer mentorship period. The program is being funded through a $50,000 grant from the Connecticut Department of Agriculture that was awarded in 2024.
Steven Thompson, the owner of Thy Neighbors Farm in Torrington, is helping to lead that effort. Thompson, who served as a scout sniper in the U.S. Marine Corps, began farming in 2020 and currently grows vegetables along with a sheep flock that he grazes on nearby solar fields.
Other mentorship opportunities are also available for veterans interested in beekeeping, maple syrup production, growing cut flowers and other types of agriculture, he said.
“If any veteran in the state of Connecticut is interested in farming, right now is the time,” Thompson said. “Even if they’re going to start something small on the side, not do it full time, if they want to get something started or think maybe in the future they do, it would be very foolish not to capitalize on the opportunities available right now.”
Since opening Steadfast Farms, McCool said he has employed four veterans, none of whom are still working there. That experience, he said, has opened his eyes to the different paths that working on a farm could lead to for other returning veterans.
“I found farming as being such a successful and consistent process of healing and having a purpose, and that transition from the military back to civilian life, it checked all the boxes for me,” McCool said.
“The veterans that have come through here, I always expected them to stay here like it would check all the boxes for them, but I learned that that wasn’t the case,” he continued. “I might just be a stop on their recovery or their understanding of what the next chapter is in their life after service.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1017_SR_SteadfastFarms_349-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-11 08:04:12.483569

Lo que debe saber.,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/11/ct-legisladores-sesion-extraordinaria/,"La Asamblea General convoca una sesión extraordinaria en casos de emergencia, aunque han adoptado una visión amplia de lo que constituye una.","Traducción por Jorge Alatrista, Identidad Latina Multimedia.

Read this story in English.
La Asamblea General de Connecticut se reunirá en sesión extraordinaria el miércoles, adoptando una vez más una perspectiva amplia sobre lo que constituye una emergencia que requiere acción antes de la próxima sesión ordinaria anual, que comienza el 4 de febrero.
Por su frecuencia, las sesiones extraordinarias tienen poco de extraordinarias. Los legisladores han regresado a Hartford para sesiones extraordinarias al menos una vez en 41 de los 54 años transcurridos desde 1971, cuando la Asamblea General comenzó a reunirse anualmente.
La Constitución de Connecticut establece que la legislatura, un organismo a tiempo parcial cuyos miembros suelen tener otros trabajos, se reúne en sesión ordinaria durante cinco meses en los años impares y tres meses en los años pares. No impone límites a las sesiones extraordinarias.
¿Quién decide convocar una sesión extraordinaria?
La legislatura puede autoconvocarse, pero normalmente la inicia el gobernador. Este emite una “convocatoria”, una proclamación que describe los temas que se abordarán.
¿Cómo se convoca a los legisladores?
Antes era un proceso engorroso, que requería un aviso entregado a los legisladores por correo certificado con hasta 15 días de antelación, o notificado en persona por un alguacil estatal, un agente de policía u otra “persona imparcial” al menos 24 horas antes de la sesión. El Gobernador William A. O’Neill incluso hizo que la policía estatal les entregara una citación para que regresaran la última noche de una sesión cuando se fueron sin haber aprobado un presupuesto.
¿Así que había policías recorriendo el estado durante el fin de semana para obligarlos a regresar?
No, ahora se hace por correo electrónico. La legislatura aprobó una ley en 2016 que permite la transmisión electrónica de la convocatoria. Debe enviarse al menos 72 horas antes de la sesión.
Entonces, ¿los legisladores solo pueden actuar sobre los temas descritos por el gobernador en la convocatoria?
No exactamente. La legislatura siempre tiene la opción de convocar su propia sesión extraordinaria para abordar otros temas. Los legisladores pueden estar literalmente en más de una sesión extraordinaria al mismo tiempo.
Suena confuso. ¿Cómo funciona eso?
La mejor manera de visualizar sesiones extraordinarias simultáneas es imaginar una computadora con varias pantallas abiertas. Al igual que usted alterna entre las pantallas de su computadora, la legislatura puede hacerlo con diferentes sesiones extraordinarias.
¿Cuánto duran las sesiones extraordinarias?
La mayoría son breves, de uno o dos días. Hay excepciones notables.
¿Cuándo ocurrió?
La sesión extraordinaria por excelencia fue en 1991, el año en que se adoptó el impuesto sobre la renta, se derogó y entró en vigor después de que se vetara el proyecto de ley de derogación, todo ello en una sesión extraordinaria que se extendió hasta el 19 de septiembre.
¿Y luego se fueron a casa?
Por poco tiempo. Una vez que fracasó la derogación, pasaron a lo que llamaron “reparación”. Estuvieron trabajando hasta el Día de Acción de Gracias, y finalmente dieron por terminada la sesión el 18 de diciembre.
Durante una sesión ordinaria, la legislatura tarda meses en redactar los proyectos de ley y someterlos a la revisión de un comité y a una audiencia pública. ¿Cómo hacen todo eso en una sesión extraordinaria que dura uno o dos días?
No lo hacen. Como vimos el viernes, cuando el gobernador y los legisladores presentaron un proyecto de ley de vivienda que se debatirá el miércoles en la Cámara de Representantes, la legislación generalmente se redacta antes de que regresen los legisladores.
¿Alguna vez hacen eso en una sesión extraordinaria?
A veces. Si el presidente de la Cámara de Representantes y el presidente pro tempore del Senado están de acuerdo, cualquier proyecto de ley puede ser declarado “de emergencia” y presentarse para una votación en el pleno sin una audiencia ni revisión de comité.
¿Tienen prohibido celebrar una audiencia pública en una sesión extraordinaria?
No, la legislatura establece las reglas.
Además del impuesto sobre la renta, ¿cuáles son algunas de las cosas más notables que se han hecho en sesiones extraordinarias?
El innovador sistema de financiación pública de campañas de Connecticut se implementó en una sesión extraordinaria convocada por la Gobernadora M. Jodi Rell en 2005. El proyecto de ley se aprobó en septiembre después de un verano de negociaciones.
El cannabis recreativo se legalizó en una sesión extraordinaria mediante un proyecto de ley que obtuvo la aprobación final en el Senado el 17 de junio de 2021. La sesión ordinaria había terminado el 9 de junio con la aprobación del Senado, pero sin la acción de la Cámara de Representantes.
El Senado volvió a aprobar el proyecto de ley en la sesión extraordinaria, solo para verlo modificado en la Cámara de Representantes. El Senado aprobó la versión final.
¿Los legisladores reciben un pago adicional por las sesiones extraordinarias?
No.

Tina Kotek on Friday signed Oregon’s long-awaited transportation bill into law, setting the stage for opponents to begin collecting signatures for a referendum effort to overturn it.
After Democrats in the Oregon Legislature secured enough votes to pass the transportation bill in a special session that ended in late September, Kotek had 30 working days, or until Nov. 12, to sign it into law. By using almost all 30 days to sign it, Republican opponents have less time to gather the signatures to qualify for a referendum on the November 2026 ballot. If they are successful at gathering enough signatures, a referendum would give Oregon voters the opportunity to reject or approve the new law.
State Rep. Ed Diehl, R-Stayton, Sen. Bruce Starr, R-Dundee and Taxpayer Association of Oregon Director Jason Williams — the chief petitioners behind the “No Tax Oregon” referendum effort — submitted paperwork to the Oregon Secretary of State Monday morning to begin collecting signatures. The secretary must review and approve the referendum forms before they can officially start.
“We feel pretty confident that by the end of this week, we will be good to go,” Diehl told the Capital Chronicle.
Petitioners have 90 calendar days from the Legislature’s adjournment to gather 78,116 signatures, which was 4% of the total ballots cast in the most recent gubernatorial election. This means they have until Dec. 30 to submit all the signatures.
The transportation law is expected to raise about $4.3 billion over the next 10 years for road maintenance and operations by:

Raising the gas tax by 6 cents.
Increasing annual registration fees from $43 to $85 for passenger vehicles; $63 to $105 for utility vehicles, light trailers, low-speed vehicles and medium-speed electric vehicles; and $44 to $86 for mopeds and motorcycles, beginning Dec. 31.
Increasing title fees for passenger vehicles from $77 to $216, beginning Dec. 31.
Doubling the payroll tax used to fund public transit from 0.1% to 0.2% of a paycheck until January 2028. For the average Oregonian making $68,000 a year, that means paying $136 a year for this tax, or $11.20 a month.

The referendum effort seeks to reject those four components of the law.
Kotek said she is grateful to the broad coalition of cities, counties, transportation workers, truckers and the American Automobile Association for supporting the legislation.
“This bill will help us keep state highways and local roads safe and open to traffic while preserving transit service and halting the pending layoffs of essential transportation staff,” Kotek said in a statement.
Starr criticized Kotek for taking a month to sign the transportation funding bill, saying she used a delay tactic that undermines public trust.
“At every turn, (Kotek) chose to protect a broken status quo that raises costs on struggling families while failing to fix the structural problems that created this crisis,” Starr said in a statement. ”But Oregonians will not be silenced, and their voices will not be ignored. They will have the opportunity to weigh in, hold their leaders accountable and demand a transportation system that works for the people who pay for it.”
The chief petitioners formed a political committee for the referendum on Oct. 2, but on Nov. 4 discontinued the committee because it was filed incorrectly and risked facing penalties, Oregon Secretary of State spokesperson Tess Seger said. Diehl said he and the chief petitioners are reforming the committee.

It is heartening that so many people love the forest, but disagreement about whether and how to manage forests is just under the surface.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rob Riley: Embracing ecological forestry, a new approach to forest management .","This commentary is by Rob Riley. He is president of the Northern Forest Center, a regional innovation and investment partner creating rural vibrancy by connecting people, economy and the forested landscape.


I’ve had the opportunity to walk in the forest with ecologists, recreationists, conservationists, foresters, casual observers, and more. The commonality among them all is that they love the forest! 
My recent time in the trees — ranging from Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom to the heart of Maine’s North Woods — illustrated the resilience of the forest and also an onslaught of threats that are devastating to contemplate. The multiple impacts of climate change — extreme weather, invasive pests and pathogens, changing seasonal patterns — are increasingly evident on the landscape and are impacting biodiversity and forest health. 
As I sit with this unpleasant reality, I’m also encouraged that we have the tools we need to address these threats, if we are open to conversation and trying new (and some old) approaches to forest management.  
Enter ecological forestry – some just say forestry, others use various aspirational modifiers — an approach that builds on the best forest science while overlaying a new emphasis on resilience and complexity to encourage the diversity of age class and type of native trees and plants. 
 An evolution in forest management 
The profession of forestry emerged in the late 1800s and grew alongside the region’s forests, many of which were recovering from heavy deforestation. The new profession established the idea of sustained yield, a principle of harvesting no more than the forests could naturally replenish, which allowed for a steady, sustainable stream of wood.  
 This idea dominated forest management for decades but gradually evolved by the late 20th century to incorporate multiple use goals beyond timber production. Landowners and foresters added habitat improvements, water quality protection, and recreational opportunities as important goals in their forest management plans. 
 As our understanding of forest ecosystems has deepened — and the pressures and demands on them have increased — foresters have recognized the need to go further. Today, foresters incorporate carbon uptake and storage, climate resilience, a greater focus on biodiversity, and other critical concerns in forest management.  
Nature knows best 
Ecological forestry prioritizes forest health and integrity. It embraces strategies that mimic the naturally occurring disturbances with which our forests have evolved and supports forests to withstand disturbances such as storms, pests and climate shifts. 
Rather than focusing primarily on timber, ecological forestry sees the entire puzzle — large living and dead trees, a mix of species, fallen logs nurturing vigorous new growth and diverse habitat.
Over the long-term, ecological forestry works to maintain all these elements across the landscape to achieve integrated environmental, economic and social outcomes. And yet it also allows for harvesting forest products — which people need for everything from building homes to paper products, and which landowners depend on for revenue to support keeping forests as forests.  
Love your forest – stand up for ecological management 
The climate crisis is real, and we need everyone to play a part. It is heartening that so many people love the forest, but disagreement about whether and how to manage forests is just under the surface. Resolving those disagreements is complicated by the fact that while much communication today defaults to soundbites and memes, forests are complex systems that deserve complex thinking and robust responses like ecological forestry. 
Now more than ever, forest management strategies must evolve to reflect the pressing realities of climate change, the need to replace carbon-intensive products with renewable forest products and the inherent complexities and dynamics of forest ecosystems. By coming together first to love the forest — and second to embrace ecological forestry — we can ask better questions, respect the forest’s complexity, and seek new solutions for supporting healthy and resilient forests.  
You can help by rejecting oversimplified arguments against managing forests and using forest products. Get out and enjoy the forest you love and choose locally produced wood products whenever you can. In the Northern Forest, we’re blessed with an abundant renewable resource, and ecological forestry is our best tool for ensuring healthy, resilient forests in the future.  
To learn more about the complexity of forests and topics such as carbon storage, the impact and response to forest pests, and ensuring forest health and resilience, readers are invited to check out the Northern Forest Center’s webinars on forest stewardship.

(Photo by Gregory Adams/Getty Images)Will nuclear waste travel all the way from Ontario, Canada to a site about an hour drive from Salt Lake City?
An interstate panel may consider a resolution later this month on whether to allow EnergySolutions to import up to 1.3 million cubic yards of low-level radioactive waste from Canada, a move worrying local advocates who argue this may be the stepping stone into accepting other types of nuclear waste.
Waste that is accepted to be buried at the Clive facility is Class A, the least hazardous radioactive waste under U.S. standards. That includes items that staff working with radioactive materials wear, like gloves, shoe coverings, cleaning materials and tools. But the proposal can still be hazardous, said Carmen Valdez, senior policy associate at the Healthy Environment Alliance of Utah.
“Any level of radiation can be harmful to humans. There is no safe level, frankly,” Valdez said. “And our concern is the lack of public transparency from the company in bringing in international waste, which can lead to international security issues.”
According to EnergySolutions, the type of material being proposed for this project is identical to the low-level radioactive waste the facility has managed for over 30 years.
“While located across the nations’ northern border, these facilities in Ontario currently provide electricity to customers in the United States,” the company said in a statement.
But, environmental groups are still hesitant about the proposal since public input hasn’t been extensive. Especially with this being an unprecedented situation for the compact.
Public comment is allowed in the special meetings where the NorthWest Interstate Compact — a group of states that cooperates on low-level radioactive waste management — is considering EnergySolutions’ petition. But, not many people from the community are keeping tabs on the body, Valdez said. It was only after learning about the discussion from a mailer sent to a former executive that Healthy Environment Alliance of Utah advocates began watching the process.
“There was no announcement, there was nothing on the Division of Waste Management and Radiation Control Board’s meetings, things like that,” Valdez said. “So it was kind of per chance that we saw this and started watching it, and have been attending that.”
A big item on the advocates’ list of concerns, Valdez said, is public safety along the transportation routes for the waste, which is set to travel via rail.
Dave Noriega, a spokesperson for the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, said that “no significant, additional safety measures are necessary with this proposed project since EnergySolutions has extensive experience disposing of Class A waste.”
The state, he said, has robust regulations that minimize risks to the public and the Department of Environmental Quality will continue to regulate all low-level radioactive waste.
 Low-level radioactivity standards

Some aspects of the draft resolution are still uncertain, Valdez said. For one, will EnergySolutions classify waste coming from Canada according to U.S. or Canadian standards?
“We’re concerned about what that type of waste is because we’re just hearing that it’s related to the nuclear fuel industry,” Valdez said. “It’s mixed waste. But there’s no clarification on that.”
Noriega said the arriving waste needs to be documented as Class A before it can be shipped to Utah.
Casey Hill, a lobbyist representing EnergySolutions, said in a legislative hearing for a bill updating waste facilities’ licensing requirements that EnergySolutions’ Clive facility takes non-concentrated amounts of depleted uranium and has since it opened. But that wouldn’t change with an expanded Clive facility.
“Class A waste, as it’s currently determined, is what we can take in this facility. This would not be able to, as of right now, due to the fact that we don’t have a license to take concentrated depleted uranium, we would not be able to take that under this legislation,” Hill said.
This year the Utah Legislature also removed its specific nuclear waste classification to instead adopt federal definitions. According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, depleted uranium is categorized as Class A. But, currently, there’s no indication that the material will be transported from Canada.
Still, advocates worry about the legislative change, especially now that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is reviewing its rules under a White House order.
“What happens with aligning to the (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) is now what we’re hearing is that the waste will be determined at the site,” Valdez said, “and if it meets Class A then it can come into Utah, no matter what.”
Six out of 8 states that make up the NorthWest Interstate Compact have to approve the plans. Utah would have veto power, Kristen Schwab, chair of the compact said in an October meeting.
In a presentation, EnergySolutions said the state supports the company’s desire to dispose of low-level radioactive waste from Canada at the Clive site.
The Utah Legislature approved an adjustment this year that would allow the state to get up to $30 million in tax for the expansion application, which would be deposited into the Energy Research Fund, and will support Utah’s big nuclear plans.
“The governor is in favor, the Legislature is in favor, and they want this to happen,” Valdez said about the proposal, “but there’s no talk about the general public and if they want this waste coming into our country and into our state too.”

In Minnesota, the multiple new mandates — work requirements, additional eligibility and verification requirements – will fall on counties. That’s because in Minnesota, the state sets policy and oversees administration, but the counties do the client contact service delivery part of the job. 
In addition to new administrative requirements, the bill reduces federal reimbursement for the administrative costs of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — i.e., SNAP or food stamps — from 50% to 25%. That means counties now have to pay 75% of the cost of running SNAP.
The Minnesota Department of Human Services is estimating that administering the new Medicaid work requirements will cost the state, county and tribes $165 million annually. The new Medicaid eligibility checks will cost another $5 million. 
The Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families estimates that the state and counties will lose $39 million a year in SNAP federal administrative funding, and increased workloads will push that number higher. 
Minnesota counties are raising the alarm. 
Exactly how much of these costs fall to counties, however, is ultimately dependent on decisions by the state. The state could provide additional funds to counties to offset some of these costs. 
One problem, though: The state is facing a looming budget deficit. 
So, if this is a crisis, what’s the opportunity? 
Blow up the system.

Or, to put it more nicely, maybe it’s finally time to seriously reexamine the state-county relationship that sits at the core of how we run our human services system. 
Minnesota hasn’t really examined the state-county system in over 15 years. DHS and counties have attempted several partnership efforts. These are helpful to state-county relations, but lack the resources needed for serious restructuring work. 
The last effort — sparked by a 2007 report from the Office of Legislative Auditor — resulted in little change. 
The OLA was primarily concerned with variation in services and outcomes between counties, as well as inconsistency in state oversight. 
Let’s start with another issue the OLA explored — the one that drives current concerns: The county role in financing human services. 
Minnesota counties have a small role in human services financing, averaging 4-5% of human services spending. But it is not a small dollar amount: $837 million in 2021 (the last year of available data). 
Much of this money goes to support the counties’ role in service delivery — eligibility, assessments, case management, etc. Counties also fund a portion of some services, notably large shares of children’s services (child protection, foster care, etc.) and mental health services. 
This is a problem. Counties have different taxing capacities, which can result in uneven access to services across the state. 
These funding arrangements are largely historic anachronisms — a collection of decisions made over time with no guiding strategy. 
And it’s not getting better. Earlier this year, Gov. Tim Walz proposed shifting some of the cost of disability services to counties.
And now the federal government is dumping their budget problem on counties.  
Layering more random financing responsibilities on top of this mess seems inadvisable.
But you can’t have the money conversation without having the roles-and-responsibilities conversation. What should the state do? What should counties do?
Minnesota is in the minority among states, one of just 10 or so that has counties deliver services. In most states people go to state offices for services. 
Talking with colleagues in other states over the years raised some possible advantages of state administration. For example:  

When service delivery is defaulted to the counties, policy makers may ignore how service delivery impacts the goals of a new policy. With state administration, the people in charge of delivering the services can be more easily engaged in designing the policy. 
State-administered systems can more easily respond to crises or emergencies by quickly reallocating or supplementing staffing and other resources. 
Business processes can be more easily redesigned to fully leverage new technology. 

In the current structure with 87 counties doing any of the things is cumbersome at best. Counties have different staffing capacity and structures, union contracts and IT systems. 
And, they are accountable to locally elected officials who don’t set policy, which falls on the Legislature. 
None of this is to say the counties are doing a bad job or doing something wrong. I worked with counties for decades, and from front line workers to leadership they are dedicated to helping Minnesotans in need. 
Counties value their role in delivering services to their communities, and that bond to local communities is an advantage of county service delivery. 
And, of course, suggesting the state take on more responsibility for service delivery raises its own set of questions – and healthy skepticism. The failure to prevent fraud in multiple human services programs does not engender confidence in the operational capacity of state agencies, and the state’s failure to improve human services IT systems is a significant problem for counties right now.  
But the system may be at a breaking point. And continuing to ignore this — especially in the face of the new federal requirements — is only going to compound the problem. 
These sorts of structural and operational issues often fall by the wayside. They are big and complicated, take lots of resources, and have no obvious political constituency. 
But counties see the steamroller coming. 
And maybe the fraud problem highlights what happens when we don’t proactively deal with basic operational problems. 
When I was in state government we’d sometimes talk about “second term issues” — not the flashy policies of the first term, but the meat and potatoes of good government. 
We never had occasion to talk about “third term issues” — but this seems like a perfect fit.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2189117613-1024x585.jpg,,,2025-11-11 08:04:12.483569

WARNING: This story describes allegations of repeated domestic violence and murder.

On Oct. 7, 2019, a 30-year-old beautician named Temptress Peebles called the Nashville probation office begging for help. Days earlier, her ex-boyfriend Brandon Horton had come up behind her, choked her and kicked her in the face, according to a court document. 
Records show that was just the most recent attack. She had been living in a constant state of fear, her family said, since Horton had broken down her door and pointed a gun at her three months earlier, court records show. He had open warrants for his arrest, so she and her 8-year-old daughter, Khloe, were avoiding the apartment, always taking different roads to get to work or to stay at her family’s house.
Peebles asked the probation manager if Horton could be arrested when he came in for a court date the next day. Horton’s probation file shows the manager said she would try to help. 
But Horton never showed up to court, according to his probation file, and Nashville police didn’t arrest him until it was too late.
Ten days after that call, probation and police records show, Horton waited for Peebles outside her apartment. Khloe told WPLN she remembers seeing Horton pointing a gun at her mom. She remembers throwing her arms around his legs and pleading with him, “no, no, no.” She remembers trying to call 911 while her mom, shot in both legs, lay in the street bleeding to death. 
Horton is now awaiting trial on charges of killing Peebles. He and his lawyer declined to comment for this story. The case file is sealed and the public defender’s office declined to comment further on whether Horton has entered a plea.
Throughout the period when Peebles reported he was threatening and hurting her, Horton was released repeatedly into the community under the stipulation that probation officers would be actively supervising him. But in Tennessee, a state with one of the highest rates of women killed by men, WPLN and ProPublica found that a deadly blind spot in the probation supervision system emerges at a time when experts say domestic violence victims are particularly vulnerable. 
When an offender under probation supervision violates the rules by being charged with a new crime or being found with a firearm, for example, a warrant may be issued for their arrest. When law enforcement serves that warrant, the offender can either end up behind bars or back out on probation while awaiting a court date. 
But between the time a probation violation warrant is signed by a judge and when it is served, probation officers stop conducting any in-person supervision: For a high-risk offender, this means probation officers are no longer holding three in-person meetings per month; they also no longer conduct a monthly unannounced home visit to look for drugs and guns. That period of suspended face-to-face checks can stretch for months — in one instance, for more than 400 days. 
In Horton’s case, he remained free, armed and dangerous for three months.
An excerpt from one of Peebles’ protection order petitions against Brandon Horton alleges that Horton was involved in an incident with a weapon and that he is armed. Image obtained by WPLN and ProPublica.
That pause of in-person supervision is spelled out in the Tennessee Department of Correction’s standards of supervision. Between 2019 and 2022, WPLN and ProPublica found at least six people, including Peebles, were shot to death during the gap in oversight. All were young Black mothers, ages 20 to 31. One victim was a cheerleading coach and a mom of two. Another woman was shot while her 2-year-old daughter lay on the bed nearby. In a third case, a mother of three was found in a creek days before Christmas with a purple domestic violence bracelet around her wrist. Their deaths left 12 children without their mothers. 
TDOC declined to make any probation officials available for this story. In an emailed statement, Sarah Gallagher, a department spokesperson, said that “supervision remains active” for offenders who have warrants but “the objective changes.” Instead of ensuring offenders are abiding by the rules of probation, she said, officers help to bring that person into custody by sharing relevant case information with law enforcement. Gallagher confirmed there is no in-person supervision during that time. 
This blind spot is one of the ways that the state failed to stop offenders from harming domestic violence victims. WPLN and ProPublica examined hundreds of fatal domestic violence shootings between 2007 and 2023 in Tennessee’s five most populous cities. The reporting, which expanded on our earlier investigations into Tennessee’s lax enforcement of gun prohibitions, found that among these fatal domestic violence shootings, at least 86 people — about 1 in every 4 — were allegedly killed by a suspect who was legally prohibited from having a firearm. Sixteen of those suspects were also on probation. 
In a Second Amendment-friendly state like Tennessee where laws make it easy for more people to carry firearms in more places, little can stop a person intent on getting a gun, even if they are legally barred from doing so. One backstop is the state’s probation officers, who are in close contact with violent, high-risk offenders and can search homes for prohibited weapons without a warrant if they have “reasonable suspicion,” TDOC said. 
According to the department’s own documents, a probation officer’s mission is to ensure public safety. In cases where there is an open warrant, the department relies on law enforcement to prioritize the arrests of probation violators and on judges to incarcerate repeat violators instead of releasing them back into supervision and the community. The result: Some offenders like Horton return to the street. 
“The system did her wrong,” Peebles’ mom, Karen Peebles, said. “If the police department had did their job, and the probation office had did theirs — I think it could have been prevented.” 
 The red flags

Peebles’s friends and family called her Chippie because she had a high, singsongy voice, like a chipmunk. She was loud, funny and always smiling. Almost every night, Peebles talked to her mom on the phone, and she never missed a Sunday dinner.

Her family said she started dating Horton around 2018, giving in after he had pursued her for years. She was hesitant, in part because of his criminal history. Horton had just started 10 years of supervised probation after he pleaded guilty to facilitation of second-degree murder in a robbery where a man was shot and killed. 
“Even when she saw the red flags, she would just try anything in her power to try to make him better,” her cousin Princess Pinkston said. “She felt like she could save everybody.”
The probation department classified Horton as a high-risk violent probationer, which meant that every month his probation officer was required to see him face-to-face three times, conduct a home visit and check to make sure he hadn’t been arrested. This kind of supervision is more intensive and time-consuming than what low-risk offenders get.
In some probation departments across the country, probation officers are assigned either high-, medium- or low-risk offenders. Experts say this allows specialized teams to focus on intense monitoring of a smaller caseload of high-risk offenders, while lower-risk probationers are left to newer officers. 
“It’s like the medical profession,” said Susan Rice, former president of the American Probation and Parole Association. “If you’re a specialist doctor and you do only the high-risk heart surgeries, you’re not going to have as many clients as a general practitioner who sees everybody that comes in with a runny nose.” 
But in Tennessee, officers handle a mix of high-, medium- and low-risk offenders. And Tennessee’s probation offices do not have specialized domestic violence teams or training. A report from victim advocates more than a decade ago said these changes could save lives in the most dangerous cases. “This report should be viewed as a guide for where to begin changing policy,” the report reads, “and by doing so, ultimately reduce the occurrence of domestic violence homicides in Nashville-Davidson County.”
Rice said it is common practice nationwide to have mixed caseloads in probation departments. In an email, TDOC said the same, adding that all officers are “trained in areas like situational awareness and de-escalation techniques to identify warning signs and manage conflict.” 
Most of the 16 alleged suspects who WPLN and ProPublica found were both prohibited from having a gun and under supervision by the probation department were deemed high or moderate risks by TDOC. 
In addition, all 16 were under supervision in Memphis or Nashville, the state’s busiest offices. In those offices, probation officers handle an average of at least 65 cases annually, according to TDOC data. 
Horton was assigned to the Nashville office, eventually coming under the supervision of probation officer Derrick Finch, who had been on the job a little more than a year at the time. Finch told WPLN that at one point he had more than 100 offenders in his caseload. Records show the department fired him in 2024 after seven years on the job for reporting that he conducted a home visit with an offender who was in custody at that time. Finch said he thought he had conducted the visit when he was entering his case notes at the end of the month. 
“I got let go because I couldn’t keep up with the caseload anymore,” Finch explained in an interview with WPLN.
By early January of 2019, Horton had been on probation for about a year. His relationship with Peebles was fracturing and she was referring to him as her ex in court records. She joined her own family dinners less frequently, and when she did show up, her mom said, something was always off. She would wear long-sleeved shirts, even in the middle of sweltering Tennessee summers. Once she arrived on crutches, claiming she had fallen down the stairs. Another time she had a black eye, and told her family that a door had swung back and hit her.










If this guy wants to change, we can help him. But if he doesn't — which unfortunately is the case with too many of them — what do you do? 


– Probation officer Derrick Finch


Multiple studies have shown that the most dangerous time for a domestic violence victim is when they are trying to leave their abuser, often turning to the courts and law enforcement for protection. 
But the case notes in Horton’s probation file seem to only scratch the surface of what her family suspected was happening behind closed doors. The case notes show Finch ticking through a standardized assessment of Horton’s progress, noting his body language, behavior and next steps. 
“Offender reported as directed.” 
“Offender was calm, alert and oriented.” 
“Offender seeking full-time employment at this time.”
“Offender advises he is in process of moving in with his mother.” 
“Will advise offender next report date.” 
Finch said the department wants officers to have a rapport with the offenders they are supervising, “but who’s got time for that? It’s very hard to do everything they want you to do, because there’s so much to do.” 
He said when a “problem child” arose in his caseload, there was not much he could do about it. 
“If this guy wants to change, we can help him,” Finch said of probationers. “But if he doesn’t — which unfortunately is the case with too many of them — what do you do?”
 A slap on the wrist 

In a court document, Peebles alleged that on Jan. 12, 2019, Horton went on Facebook Live and said he would kill her before he saw her with another man. He called her multiple times, she wrote, then showed up at her house, blocking her car with his. They started arguing. He punched her twice in the head. She ran to her car to escape and he chased her, she wrote. He tore the windshield wipers off of her car and used them to strike the glass as she cowered inside the locked vehicle. Horton fled when she called police.
What followed was a string of actions by probation officers, law enforcement and the courts that left Horton free and Peebles afraid.
The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department filed a domestic assault charge against Horton. MNPD arrested Horton and searched his home for weapons, according to probation records. He paid a bond to get out of jail while awaiting his court date. 
According to TDOC policy, Horton’s arrest on suspicion of domestic assault required Finch to file a report and request a warrant for a probation violation. 
That policy says that warrants for violations posing “an immediate and/or imminent threat to public safety” should be requested “as soon as possible.” Finch submitted a violation warrant to his supervisor and requested a judge sign it on Jan. 22, 2019, according to probation records. 
Once a judge signed it, the warrant was sent to police, who arrested Horton two days later. But at a court hearing, Peebles failed to appear to testify on the assault charge and the case was dismissed. Her mom said that Peebles did not show up because she was afraid, and that Horton had threatened her if she pursued charges.
“The victim, more frequently than not, is the evidence,” Christina Johnson, a domestic violence prosecutor with the Nashville district attorney’s office, said. “If the evidence isn’t there, we have no choice, we can’t go forward.”
For this reason, the Nashville Office of Family Safety has called for the district attorney’s office to rely more on evidence such as 911 calls, body camera footage or forensic exams instead of just victim testimony.
Once the assault charge against Horton was dropped, the probation violation that was based on those charges was dismissed. Horton remained in the community under Finch’s supervision. 










The victim, more frequently than not, is the evidence. If the evidence isn't there, we have no choice, we can't go forward. 


– Christina Johnson, a domestic violence prosecutor with the Nashville district attorney’s office


And it didn’t take long before the process started all over again. 
On Jan. 28, 2019, Horton was arrested in nearby Marshall County. Law enforcement officers reported finding four bags of a white substance believed to be cocaine on him, as well as a stolen Glock 26 9 mm handgun. 
Being arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs with the intent to sell is a probation violation, as is being a felon in possession of firearms. 
So, records show, Finch requested another probation violation warrant to bring Horton in front of a judge. Horton was arrested and released on bond the next day.
Despite Horton’s status as a high-risk offender, his multiple arrests in a month and his possession of a prohibited firearm, Judge Jennifer Smith returned Horton to probation supervision instead of incarcerating him. In a statement to WPLN, Smith said she cannot comment on previous decisions.
In at least two other domestic violence gun homicide cases in 2021 a probationer was caught with a gun prior to the shooting — even though they were prohibited from having a firearm because of a prior conviction and because they were on probation. As with Horton, judges did not revoke their probation for being found with a gun.
“There are people who are telling us over and over again with their actions that they have no desire to change,” said Becky Bullard, deputy director of programs at Nashville’s Office of Family Safety, about abusers on probation who continue to perpetuate harm. “And when someone is waving that flag to us to say, ‘Hey, I’m out here practicing all of these high-risk behaviors with someone I’m supposed to care about,’ that is someone raising their hand and telling us that they’re about to murder.” 
Shari Bryant was a Nashville probation officer from 2020 to 2025, and she said she left the job to become an accountant. She said it was common for someone to continuously violate probation with few consequences. Even in these high-risk, violent cases. 
In one of the case files TDOC provided in response to WPLN and ProPublica’s record requests, a Memphis offender named Torian Williams was sentenced to probation for aggravated assault and reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon. He was classified as a medium risk and charged while on probation for having two guns. He would go on to shoot and kill his 20-year-old girlfriend Demya Gordon in 2021. For that crime, he took a plea deal for a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and was released to probation again. During that probation period, the probation department got a call from an ex-girlfriend and Williams’ mother saying that he was physically abusing them and threatening their lives. Williams died in 2025. 
“Obviously, they’re not learning their lessons, right? They just keep getting a slap on the wrist,” Bryant said. “They keep getting out and getting away with it.” 
That revolving door allowed Horton to remain on probation and return to the street again. 
 He is going to kill me

Months before she was killed, Peebles was in the bedroom of her apartment when she heard a loud boom at the back door. It was a stormy summer night, July 13, 2019. 
“I got up walked to the door seen Brandon with a gun,” she wrote in a court document. He pointed the gun at her, and she ran out of her apartment. A neighbor later told the court that she was awakened by gunshots that went through her roof, her walls and her mirror. The neighbor, peeking through the blinds, saw Horton running with a gun in his hand. A few moments later, she saw Peebles climbing down a tree.
When police arrived, they could not find Horton. Metro Nashville Police Department charged him with felon in possession of a weapon, aggravated assault and aggravated burglary. And, for the third time in less than a year, Finch requested a probation violation warrant for Horton’s arrest. 
Temptress Peebles requested a protection order against Horton in July 2019 after he showed up at her home with a gun. Obtained by WPLN and ProPublica.
Then, as is spelled out in TDOC’s standards of supervision, Finch stopped supervising Horton in person until police could arrest him. In the past, police served the warrant in a matter of days. This time, it would take three months for the police to catch up with Horton. For those three months, all that was required of Finch was a once-a-month check for arrests in the computer system. Police would not arrest Horton until after he allegedly killed Peebles. He has been behind bars ever since. 
Probation experts said this practice of stopping in-person probation supervision once a violation warrant has been issued is not uncommon. 
“It’s kind of a messed-up process,” said Rice of the American Probation and Parole Association. “Do we really want that period of supervision to stop if they’re not incarcerated during that time?” 
In the six cases of domestic violence homicide that occurred during this supervision gap, WPLN and ProPublica found the time between when a warrant was issued and when police made an arrest stretched from as few as nine days to as many as 425 days. In all six cases, the alleged offender was put on probation for a gun-related offense. 
In some states, probation officers are able to serve violation warrants and arrest probationers themselves. But in Tennessee, officers must contact law enforcement. TDOC said while probation officers cannot make arrests themselves, they work with local, state and federal law enforcement, sharing information such as “addresses, photographs, known associates, and other leads” to assist in locating the offender.
When asked why it took so long to serve warrants in cases like Horton’s, the Metro Nashville Police Department said that “wanted persons frequently change where they stay or leave town and they are often difficult to locate.” MNPD said it works closely with probation officers to serve offenders if they continue to come in for office visits or when they show up for their court dates. 
MNPD said it has one documented attempt to serve Horton’s violation warrant between the time it was issued in July and Oct. 17, when Peebles was killed. That attempt was on Oct. 9. Police said no one answered the door at Horton’s address.
Peebles requested another protection order against Horton in October 2019. Obtained by WPLN and ProPublica. Highlighted by ProPublica.
“Detectives spend their days researching people with outstanding warrants so they can arrest them,” said Debra Fessenden, chief policy adviser with the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office, an agency that handles warrants for Memphis. “No one is ignoring the warrants.” 
She said that not all intelligence leads to a timely arrest. 
“It’s not unusual — because of resources, training and protocol — that law enforcement decides, ‘We’ll just serve this when we pull someone over’” for a traffic stop, said Julia Weber, a California-based expert who trains law enforcement and probation departments on dangerous domestic violence cases. 
“What I tell communities is we have to recognize how dangerous a decision that is.” 
In her final days, records show that Peebles was increasingly aware of how much danger she was in.
She had already called the probation department once for help getting Horton’s warrant served at his Marshall County court date. Days later, on Oct. 11, she called again to say that Horton had failed to appear in court “because he spoke to officer finch and was told that he would be taken into custody at that time on his warrant,” the probation file notes. The manager wrote that Peebles was upset and that Horton was threatening to hurt her. 
In an interview with WPLN, Finch denied warning Horton.
“Everything that could have been done was done from our end,” Finch said. “Once that warrant is filed, there is nothing else that we can do.” 
Six days after Peebles’ final call to the probation department, Horton allegedly shot and killed her outside of her apartment while her daughter, Khloe, struggled to call for help. Horton was arrested the next morning, and Smith, the judge who had allowed his release, later revoked his probation. 
“Chippie should be here with her child, with her mom,” said Pinkston, Peebles’ cousin. “She had told you many times, ‘No, he’s serious. He is going to kill me.’ … Now it’s too late.”

Khloe is in high school now. For a long time after her mom died, Khloe said, she heard the gunshots in her sleep. She lives in her mom’s childhood bedroom to feel closer to her. 
She’s starting to fully understand the ways the system did not protect her mom from Horton. But the 14-year-old says she has lived each day since her mom’s death struggling with a guilt she cannot shake.
“I always felt like her death was on me,” Khloe said, remembering how she had forgotten her phone in the kitchen that day, so they returned to the apartment to get it. “If we would never went back to that house … maybe she would have still been here.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20250904-DeShazer-TN-Guns-Probation-02_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-11 08:04:12.483569

Two Terre Haute hospitals that once competed for patients will soon operate as one system under a newly approved merger that state officials said will expand care and cap prices — although critics warn the deal will eliminate competition.
The Indiana Department of Health greenlit the closely watched merger between nonprofit Union Hospital and for-profit Terre Haute Regional, owned by HCA Healthcare, creating a single hospital system in the Wabash Valley, Gov. Mike Braun’s office announced on Sunday.
IDOH’s decision will allow the Vigo County hospitals to combine operations, but under state oversight.
It marks the first hospital merger approved under Indiana’s 2021 Certificate of Public Advantage, law which allows the state to regulate consolidated hospital systems in exchange for supervision over pricing and service access.
The approval also follows months of public debate and opposition from federal antitrust officials who warned the merger could raise costs and limit patient choice.
“The result of this merger will be lower prices and more healthcare services available to residents of Terre Haute and Vigo County because of the strict operating terms and conditions that Union Hospital accepted,” Braun said in a statement. “This will bring long-term improvement to the community’s health outcomes.”
First test of Indiana’s hospital oversight law
The hospitals’ first COPA filing in September 2023 was pulled back in November 2024 after state and federal regulators raised questions about the merger’s projected benefits and oversight terms. The application was resubmitted in February with new details on price caps, service guarantees and oversight terms.
IDOH officials acknowledged in a 13-page approval brief that the merger would result in a near monopoly for inpatient hospital care but called the coupling “presumptively anticompetitive” because it gives the combined system control of nearly all inpatient hospital care in Vigo County.
Story continues below.
COPA.Determination.2025
 
Department leadership said the merger was only approved after Union Hospital agreed to a set of “comprehensive final terms and conditions” intended to offset the loss of competition.
Those conditions include caps on prices, requirements to maintain both hospitals and emergency departments, and detailed oversight and reporting provisions. The state will monitor compliance annually and can impose penalties or revoke the COPA if the hospitals fail to meet their obligations.
The COPA term lasts five years for general compliance and up to ten years for pricing oversight, according to the department’s determination.
One of the key pricing requirements limits the merged system’s commercial rates to an average of no more than 265% of Medicare rates for the same services. Another “site-neutrality” rule prohibits Union Hospital from reclassifying off-campus clinics as hospital facilities without state approval — a move that would otherwise allow higher billing rates.
The department also required Union Hospital to maintain both hospital campuses, continue providing major services such as trauma care, obstetrics, chemotherapy and intensive care, and invest in facility upgrades. The hospitals must file quarterly and annual reports with IDOH, the attorney general, and the legislature detailing pricing, quality, and access metrics.
Federal and public opposition
Even so, federal antitrust regulators under both the Biden and Trump administrations opposed the merger.
In September 2024, staff from the Federal Trade Commission urged the state to reject the COPA, warning it would “likely impose higher costs and could lead to worse healthcare outcomes for Indiana patients, as well as lower wage growth for hospital workers.”
FTC staff said the combined system would control nearly 74% of commercially insured inpatient services in Vigo County.
The agency reaffirmed its opposition in March 2025, saying the revised COPA “presents the same problems as before,” including risks of higher health care costs, reduced innovation, and lower wages. The FTC also noted there was no assurance the commitments made under state supervision would remain in effect after the COPA term expires.










This repackaged COPA application presents the same problems as before. Competition consistently results in better outcomes for patients and workers than consolidation subject to COPAs. The Indiana Department of Health should deny this attempt by Vigo County’s only two hospitals to eliminate competition and avoid antitrust review.”

In April, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said he was also concerned the merger would hurt competition in Terre Haute.
“We all understand that hospitals face distinct challenges, but consolidation at the expense of free-market competition is not the way to address those challenges in this case,” Rokita said earlier this year.
In a written statement, the attorney general’s office added, “IDOH must soon decide to either deny the merger or permit the consolidation and monopolization of Terre Haute’s only two hospitals.”
Public comments submitted to the state reflected similar concerns. At a public hearing held in May at Ivy Tech Community College in Terre Haute, about two-thirds of the 245 attendees supported the merger, while roughly one-quarter opposed it, according to IDOH records.
Dozens of written comments posted online by the department additionally warned that the merger would leave residents with fewer choices.
“This buy out has to be stopped. This will eliminate the health option for care in the Wabash Valley,” one commenter wrote. “Leaving the worst health care organization as the only alternative for residents. … Residents should not be left with NO CHOICE! How can we allow the monopoly of our health care?” 
Others expressed concern about potential job or benefit changes for hospital employees.
Supporters, including local business leaders and community groups, said the combination would stabilize the region’s health care system and preserve services that might otherwise close if Terre Haute Regional remained independent.
Ongoing oversight
Union Hospital and Terre Haute Regional representatives said in their application that the merger was necessary to sustain access and improve health outcomes across the six-county region.
They noted that Terre Haute Regional had faced “significant operational challenges” and reductions in service lines in recent years, and that the merger would bring a unified management structure and lower overall costs.

COPA-2025-Application-Reduced
 
The hospitals pledged to keep both campuses open and to adopt Union Hospital’s lower-cost pricing structure systemwide. They also committed to tens of millions of dollars in capital investments at both facilities and to expand financial assistance programs for uninsured and underinsured patients.
Under the approval, Union Hospital must submit an implementation plan within 60 days and begin quarterly reporting to IDOH. The state will also appoint two representatives to Union Hospital’s board during the COPA term to help monitor compliance.
Some states back hospital mergers despite record of service cuts, price hikes

If IDOH determines the hospitals are not meeting their obligations, it can order corrective action, impose fines, or revoke the COPA entirely.
The department’s approval summary said the merger is expected to “improve the health outcomes, healthcare access, and quality of care” in the area — but only if the hospitals meet the terms and if “the aggregate benefits outweigh any disadvantages attributable to a potential reduction in competition.”
Union Health President and CEO Steve Holman called the approval “an opportunity for growth, expanded services and improved health outcomes for those we serve.”
 “This journey has been about far more than the purchase of a hospital,” Holman said in a statement. “From the beginning, we knew we wanted to protect more than 500 high-paying, high-skill healthcare jobs in the Wabash Valley. This will also come with an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars to improve healthcare outcomes for our region — including access to care.”
“This was never simply about acquiring another hospital,” he continued, “it was about ensuring that we didn’t lose one, and that our community’s access to quality healthcare would be protected for generations to come.”
Molly Callahan, chair of the Union Health Board of Directors, said the merger would allow the hospitals to “combine those resources and expand the quality of health care we provide.”

DemasA Michigan nonprofit with ties to one of the state’s largest energy companies is accused of participating in a dark money scheme to funnel money into an effort to overturn the governor’s COVID-19 emergency powers, according to a complaint filed with the Michigan Department of State.
Brought by Bob LaBrant, an attorney and former general counsel for the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, and filed by Mark Brewer, an election attorney and former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, the complaint alleges Michigan Energy First, a dark money group linked to DTE Energy, violated the Michigan Campaign Finance Act by working to funnel $100,000 into the Unlock Michigan campaign in 2020. 
In 2024, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced criminal charges against two fundraisers for their alleged participation in a scheme to funnel political contributions to the Unlock Michigan ballot initiative, through two nonprofits tied to former Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarklake), the result of an investigation into campaign finance complaints also filed by LaBrant and Brewer. 
Unlock Michigan aimed to repeal the law Gov. Gretchen Whitmer used to issue emergency health orders during the pandemic, with the majority of funding for the effort stemming from Michigan! My Michigan! and Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility, both 501(c)(4) nonprofits.
Groups using a 501(c)(4) designation are deemed to be social welfare organizations that, according to the IRS, cannot directly participate or intervene in political campaigns. However, they can raise money for ads that don’t expressly endorse or advocate for any particular candidate or ballot question, but instead “educate” voters on various issues. Most importantly, 501(c)(4) nonprofits do not have to reveal their donors or otherwise reveal where their money comes from.
Heather Lombardini, the head of Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility, was one of the two individuals charged for allegedly encouraging businesspeople and political funds tied to large businesses to contribute to the group, with the intention of moving those funds to Unlock Michigan to support its signature collection efforts.
Attorney General Dana Nessel announced charges related to Unlock Michigan, Feb. 21, 2024 | Anna Liz Nichols
In their new complaint, LaBrant and Brewer argued Michigan Energy First’s donation to Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility was intended to support Unlock Michigan, citing text messages and emails disclosed in court as part of Lombardini’s preliminary examination in which the chief of staff in DTE’s Corporate and Government Affairs Division in 2020, Pam Headley,  helped to facilitate the donation between the two groups. They also referenced exchanges between Lombardini and Shirkey regarding the check for the donation.
“The Attorney General’s office went to court and received an investigative subpoena to obtain [Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility] emails, bank records, and documents,” The complaint notes. “With this treasure trove the period of donor and anonymity ended. Very few major donors contributed directly to Unlock Michigan choosing instead to funnel their secret funding through [Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility] including [Michigan Energy First].” 










It’s very difficult to sort of fully believe the utility’s line, which is that there’s...separation between the two entities.


– Karlee Weinmann, a researcher for the Energy and Policy Institute.


During the 2022 election cycle, Michigan Energy First contributed $200,000 in support of another ballot question committee, Voters For Transparency and Term Limits, which supported a “yes” vote on Proposal 1, which modified term limits for the Legislature and required its members, as well as the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, and attorney general to file annual public financial disclosure reports.
Brewer and LaBrant said this shows the group is “fully capable” of directly donating to a ballot question committee directly, writing that “unlike the funding of unlock Michigan, there was no strategic need for [Michigan Energy First] to keep their contribution hidden using a conduit.” 
While speaking with the Michigan Advance, Eric Doster, attorney for Michigan Energy First, said “This is an absolutely baseless and meritless complaint. That’s my only comment.”
When asked about the complaint and DTE’s relationship with Michigan Energy First, Ryan Lowry, a spokesperson for DTE said the company complies with “all applicable laws regarding corporate donations and political contributions.”
“While DTE has contributed to Michigan Energy First (MEF) in the past, we can’t speak on behalf of MEF or the contributions the organization makes,” Lowry said in an emailed statement.
Who is Michigan Energy First
Launched in 2014, Michigan Energy First is registered as a social welfare nonprofit. In its 2023 tax filings, the organization says its purpose is to “Educate legislators and the general public on the issues facing Michigan, and to advocate citizen participation & obtain grassroots support for public policies relating to federal, state or local legislation and ballot questions.”
Michigan Energy First is headed by Andrew Coulouris, DTE’s vice president of corporate & government affairs, while DTE’s manager of regulatory accounting, Theresa Uzenski, serves as the group’s treasurer. Frank Fountain, who served on DTE’s company’s board of directors, is listed as a director in the group’s annual report with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.
Since the group’s inception, DTE representatives – namely lobbyists and executives – have sat on its board, Karlee Weinmann, a researcher for the Energy and Policy Institute told the Advance on Monday. 
Between Sept. 1, 2024 and Aug. 31, 2025, DTE contributed $8 million to Michigan Energy first, according to the company’s annual nonprofit contributions report. Contributions to social welfare nonprofits like Michigan Energy First are often hard to track down. 
Weinmann also pointed to the emails released through Lombardini’s court case, noting that Headley had no known affiliation with Michigan Energy First. According to the Energy and Policy Institute’s review of the exchanges revealed in court, Renze Hoeksema, who served as Michigan Energy First’s President in 2020, and as a longtime lobbyist for DTE, was the one who instructed Headley to coordinate the exchange.
“It’s very difficult to sort of fully believe the utility’s line, which is that there’s, you know, separation between the two entities,” Weinmann said. “And I think the emails that came to light as part of that court proceeding really sort of affirm that there are bigger questions here about the depth of the relationship between DTE and Michigan Energy First.” 
Dark money – or political spending where the source of money isn’t publicly known or disclosed – is used to avoid transparency, Weinmann said, and any effort to demystify or unmask the flow of that money is beneficial to the public. 
These types of schemes aren’t new, Weinmann said, pointing to a ballot initiative aimed at barring utility companies and government contractors from making political contributions as a response to concerns about corporate spending in politics. 
To the extent that this complaint can bring visibility to concerns about dark money and, if a violation is found, bring accountability and recourse, that is a win for transparency and political integrity in the state, Weinmann said.

(Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)The PAC backing Republican Jay Ashcroft’s 2024 bid for governor improperly coordinated with his campaign on a letter attacking his opponents, according to a consent agreement approved by the Missouri Ethics Commission.
The Committee for Liberty, which spent $2.9 million promoting Ashcroft’s losing effort, must pay $536 and avoid future violations, states the agreement posted Oct. 15 on the commission’s website.
The Committee for Liberty and Ashcroft for Missouri both paid $5,361 each to produce and mail a letter dated March 8, 2024, and marked as paid for jointly by the committees. The consent agreement states that Committee for Liberty should have either reported it as an in-kind expense on behalf of Ashcroft’s campaign or an in-kind donation from Ashcroft’s campaign.
If there is another violation, the agreement states, the commission can seek a fine of the full amount of the expense.
The agreement said Ashcroft’s campaign also did not report it as either an in-kind donation or an in-kind expense on behalf of Committee for Liberty. 
Ashcroft, who was secretary of state at the time, was running against then-Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe and then-state Sen. Bill Eigel. Kehoe won the primary and is now governor. Eigel came in second and is running to be St. Charles County Executive.
The March 8 letter labeled Kehoe as a closet Democrat and Eigel as a “political gadfly.”
Ashcroft ran a distant third and is now working as an administrative law judge hearing workers’ compensation appeals.
Democratic attorney and lobbyist Jane Dueker filed the complaint in May 2024, citing the failure of either committee to report it properly. She also complained that the value of the donation to Ashcroft for Missouri exceeded the limit of $2,825 from any donor.
Dueker declined to comment on the outcome of the complaint. She noted that the portion of the complaint against Ashcroft’s campaign has not been resolved.
PACs like Committee for Liberty can accept donations of any size. Candidates are allowed to make joint fundraising appeals seeking money in limited amounts for the campaign and unlimited amounts for their PAC.
That is where the coordination must end. Neither the official committee nor the PAC are allowed to influence the other’s campaign strategy or tactics.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ashcroft-III-20240229-1-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-11-11 06:56:11.564229

Tony Evers and Veterans Affairs Sec. James Bond spoke an event for veterans in the state Capitol on April 22, 2025. (Photo via Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs Facebook page)As Wisconsin policymakers honor Veterans Day Tuesday, the state continues to grapple with diminished resources for its most vulnerable veterans, those who are struggling with homelessness.
Debate in the state Capitol continues over the closure of sites in Green Bay and Chippewa Falls for the Veterans Housing and Recovery Program (VHRP), which provided support to veterans on the verge of or experiencing homelessness, including those who have been incarcerated, unemployed or suffered physical and mental health problems. 
Republican lawmakers recently proposed that the state create a new grant match program to help support homeless veterans. But some are expressing doubt that the bill would fill the gaps left by the recent closures, especially since it would rely on nonprofit organizations to start their own programs. 
Coauthored by Rep. Benjamin Franklin (R-De Pere) and Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto), AB 596 and AB 597 would direct $1.9 million to be used for a state grant match program. 
To receive the funds, a nonprofit group would need to be participating in the federal per diem program, which currently provides about $82 per day per veteran housed to groups that offer  wraparound supportive services to homeless veterans. The bill would offer state matching funds of $25 per day per veteran.
Finger pointing over funding continues 
The closures of the Green Bay and Chippewa Falls facilities were announced in July after lawmakers chose not to provide additional funding in the state budget for the programs. Both  sites closed their doors in September. By that point, the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs said it was able to find new places for each resident, including some who moved to a Union Grove site and others who were transferred out of state. 
The Legislative Fiscal Bureau had warned in a memo that without funding the sites would be at risk of closing, though the recent reaction of lawmakers who sit on the budget committee gave the appearance that they missed that warning. Gov. Tony Evers and Democratic lawmakers had called for additional funding and the Department of Veterans Affairs said staff had discussed the issue with the chairs of the Joint Finance Committee. Still, one member of the committee, Rep. Karen Hurd (R-Withee), said at a recent public hearing on the new bill that she was “absolutely blindsided” by the announcement of the closures.
While a handful of lawmakers have advocated for giving the department the additional funding to reopen the sites, the new Republican proposal takes a different approach that would limit the department’s direct involvement in the program.
Since the announced closures, some Republican lawmakers have blamed the Evers administration for not using money in the Veterans Trust Fund to keep the sites open and instead sending that money back to the general fund, even as the agency has said it can’t spend funds without the Legislature directing it to.
“There’s money in the account. It’s fully funded in the exact same way that it was funded last year. [Evers] just suddenly declared… he wasn’t going to use the trust account anymore,” Wimberger told the Wisconsin Examiner after he introduced the new proposal.
The Veterans Trust Fund receives general purpose revenue allocations from the state, though it doesn’t function as a big pot of money that can be used for anything. The funds have specific purposes, such as to be used for administrative costs and the Veterans Housing and Recovery Program. 
According to Joseph Hoey, assistant deputy secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the agency did use money from the trust fund to pay for administrative expenses to keep the buildings used for veterans’ housing in “good working order.” He said it was a legitimate use since the buildings are owned by the department and could be considered administrative purposes, but that wouldn’t be the case for other costs related to the program. 
“We cannot use that money to pay [Lutheran Social Services] or to run the VHRP [Veterans Housing Recovery Program] because there is a separate appropriation for VHRP,” Hoey said.
Wimberger and Republican lawmakers have also noted a 15% increase for veterans housing  in the recent budget. The Department of Veterans Affairsnoted that amount fell short of the $1.95 million that was requested by Evers to keep the sites open. 
Unclear whether new proposal would fill gaps
Wimberger told the Examiner that a grant program would be “a lot simpler” and require “less of a direct monitoring” by the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
Hoey said he sees the proposal as “the first step in leaving this up to nonprofits and ultimately spending less state resources on homeless veterans.” He also expressed concern about whether the approach would fill the gaps left by the closures of the two sites in Green Bay and Chippewa Falls.
There are currently four entities that would be eligible to apply for the new grant program: Porchlight Inc. in Madison, Rock Valley Community Programs, Inc. in Janesville, as well as Center For Veterans Issues Ltd. and Guest House Of Milwaukee, Inc., which are both in Milwaukee.
“As you see from the locations of those organizations that are providing these services, they’re not meeting the need in other parts of the state, and WDVA was,” Hoey said. “I think we as a state have a commitment when people sign up to protect our freedom, I think we have an obligation to care for them, especially when they’re struggling.”
Hoey told lawmakers on the Assembly Veterans and Military Affairs committee at a hearing on the bill that the additional $25 per veteran likely wouldn’t be enough to encourage outside groups to open up new programs. He said it is estimated that it costs about $139 per day to house each participating veteran. 
“$83 is barely enough to house a veteran, let alone feed them, provide them with counseling and training that they need to get back on their feet, and it’s not enough to make the programs work,” Hoey said. “That’s why we asked for such a large amount in the last budget because these programs are just slowly getting harder and harder to operate.”
Lutheran Social Services, which was helping to operate the now closed sites in Green Bay and Chippewa Falls, could not do that work with $25 from the state, Hoey added. 
“We provide the facilities for them, so they’re not suddenly going to, in Green Bay, open up their own homeless shelter, because they don’t have the facility,” Hoey told the Examiner. “They have no way to pay for it, and the [grant and per diem payment], even with the bonus, probably wouldn’t cover their costs. It’s wishful thinking.”
Hoey also told lawmakers that it is possible the money would not actually lead to additional funding for participating nonprofit organizations. 
“Based on our preliminary analysis, we believe it is possible that all or part of the $25 state payment would be clawed back or offset by the federal VA,” Hoey said. “It’s the way the program is written at the federal level. It penalizes the programs for getting other state or government money.” 
Rep. Rob Summerfield (R-Bloomer) said it is a good bill and pushed back on the idea that only four organizations would be eligible.
“We have one entity in Eau Claire that would be eligible for this, but there’s no money,” Summerfield said. “They’re not going to commit til we actually put this in the statute, get the funding into it, so just to say it’s just going to be four entities — that is incorrect. It, maybe, is correct, but you cannot say that it’s going to be. It could be 10 more. We could have ones in Superior, Lacrosse, Eau Claire, Green Bay, including Milwaukee.”
Hoey told the Examiner that the proposal is at best an incentive for private organizations to apply for the federal grant and start a program from scratch. 
“It would be years before this could result in homeless transition services being provided for veterans anywhere other than in the Milwaukee and Madison areas,” Hoey said. 
The agency had previously said it could get the VHRP sites restarted within a year if the state provided the funding for the programs. 
Asked in an interview whether he is concerned about the prospect of nonprofit groups not opting into the program and being able to fill the present gaps, Wimberger said, “Oh sure, of course.”
“I wish DVA would have used the money we gave them, but this is, this is in response to the executive — Gov. Evers and his administration — just simply refusing to spend the money,” he said. 
Other proposals in limbo
Two proposals that would provide the Department of Veterans Affairs with funds to restart the closed sites remain in limbo.
A Democratic bill, coauthored by Sen. Jamie Wall (D-Green Bay) , Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) and Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick), would provide $2.6 million for veterans’ housing.
Another bill authored by Sen. André Jacque (R-New Franken) would provide $1.9 million.
Jacque’s bill passed committee on Oct. 8 and is available to be scheduled for a floor vote in the Senate. It has not received a public hearing in the Assembly. 
Democratic lawmakers have also expressed concerns about whether the new bill will be effective in filling the existing gaps. 
“If your objective is to fix the problem that we’re now lacking services for homeless veterans in northern Wisconsin” either a bill drafted by Republican Sen. André Jacque (R-New Franken) or a Democratic bill, both of which provide funds to the now-closed facilities, “does the trick,” Sen. Jamie Wall (D-Green Bay) said in an interview. “[Wimberger’s] bill does not.” 
Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) said at a press conference that Republican lawmakers had “walked away” from the solutions that would actually fix the problem and were trying to “rewrite history.” 
“Our veterans deserve better than political games. They gave everything for our country, and the least we can do is make sure that they have a safe place to live, recover and rebuild their lives,” Emerson said. “It’s time to stop pointing fingers and actually fix this problem.” 
Wimberger said he didn’t sign on to Jacque’s bill at the time because it was “premature” when it was introduced. 
“It’s not like I’m opposed to it… It’s not like a bad thing, but I don’t, I don’t feel like I want to be extorted to pay for a program twice this. This method just solves the problem without playing this politics with homeless veterans,” Wimberger said of his own proposal. 
As for Wimberger’s proposal, Jacque said in October that he was still “gathering information on what the likeliest real world effect would be” if it were adopted. He also said he was waiting to hear back from the Department of Veterans Affairs on their plans to submit a emergency supplemental funding request to the Joint Finance Committee to address the situation. He said that “could be the quickest option for a positive resolution.”
Hoey said the agency is thankful for Jacque’s work on the issue. 
“We greatly appreciate [Jacque’s] willingness to keep going — to keep trying to get the funding for this program,” Hoey said. “This is something that he believes in and it’s not lip service.”
However, Hoey told the Examiner that the agency is not sure the funding request would meet statutory requirements and be an appropriate avenue for providing the funding given that the Legislature purposefully didn’t include the funding in the budget. 
He said the agency is unsure the current situation would constitute an emergency as it would be used to restart a program, not keep one going, and the agency is also currently grappling with a deficit. The agency’s last such request related to the veterans’ housing and recovery program, submitted to the Joint Finance Committee in March, was never taken up by lawmakers.

(Photo by Getty Images)Senate lawmakers on Monday advanced legislation that would launch the most comprehensive overhaul of New Jersey’s regulation of charter schools in 30 years.
The bill advanced by the Senate Education Committee on Monday would outright ban for-profit charter schools, require them to post a range of documents online, and impose residency requirements for some charter school trustees.
“We have not looked at charter schools as a whole legislatively in this committee since the 1990s, so this is an opportunity where we’re trying to do that,” said Sen. Vin Gopal (D-Monmouth), the panel’s chair and the bill’s prime sponsor.
NJ teacher workforce stable, but pipeline still thin, report finds

The bill comes as New Jersey charter schools have faced scrutiny after reporting revealed top officials were paid far more than their counterparts at traditional public schools, including, among others, a Newark charter school CEO who was paid nearly $800,000 in 2024.
The proposal, which Gopal said was the product of a year of negotiations, would require charter schools to post user-friendly budgets that include the compensation paid to charter school leaders and school business administrators. They must also post existing contracts.
Charters would be required to post meeting notices, annual reports, board members’ identities, and facility locations online. Some critics have charged that charter schools routinely fail to provide notice of their public meetings.
The legislation would also require the state to create a dedicated charter school transparency website to host plain language budgets, 990 disclosure forms filed with the IRS, contracts with charter management organizations, and a list of charter schools on probation, among other things.
It would also ban fully virtual charter schools.
“We support the bills as a step forward in holding all public schools in our state accountable for fiscal and transparency requirements that will ultimately best serve our students,” said Debbie Bradley, director of government relations for the New Jersey Principals and Supervisors Association.
The two sides remained at odds over the membership of charter school boards.
Charter critics argued residency for those positions — which, unlike traditional public school boards, are largely appointed rather than elected — should mirror those imposed on regular public schools.
In New Jersey, school board members must live in the district they serve. That’s not the case for charter schools, whose trustees face no residency or qualification limits under existing law.
The bill would only impose a residency requirement on one-third of a charter school’s trustees, and rather than forcing them to live in the district, the bill would require charter trustees to live in the school’s county or within 30 miles of the school.
That language was criticized by statewide teachers union the New Jersey Education Association, which has called existing law governing charter schools outdated and flawed.
“School board representation should remain primarily local, and when we mean local, we don’t mean within a 30-mile radius. A 30-mile radius of Newark could include Maplewood, South Orange, communities that don’t necessarily represent what Newark looks like as a community,” said Deb Cornavaca, the union’s director of government relations.
Charter school supporters said their boards need flexibility because their leadership has broader responsibilities than counterparts in traditional public schools.
“Running a charter is a little different than running a traditional district. You need experience in school finance. You need to fundraise a bunch of money on the front end because you’re not getting paid on the front end,” said New Jersey Charter School Association President Harry Lee, adding they also needed familiarity with real estate and community experience.
Amendments removed provisions that would have required charter school board members to be approved by the state commissioner of education, though the commissioner retains sole power over whether to allow the formation of a new charter, a power that gives the commissioner some veto power over a charter’s board.
Gopal acknowledged the 30-mile residency rule was a sticking point and said legislators would discuss it before the measure comes before the Senate Budget Committee. Earlier, he warned the bill was likely to see more changes as it moved through the Legislature.
Some argued enrollment in charter schools should be more limited by geography, arguing that out-of-district enrollments that are common at New Jersey charters could place financial strain on the students’ former district.
Most per-pupil state and local funding follows students who enroll in charter schools, even if their departure does not actually decrease the original district’s expenses because, for example, those schools still require the same number of teachers and administrators.
Charter operators said that would make New Jersey a national outlier and argued that a separate provision that would bar new charter schools when there are empty seats in existing area charters should come out of the bill.
“It could be read as a moratorium on charters, so we want to revisit that provision,” Lee said.
Such vacancies could exist for various reasons, they argued, including student age distributions.
Alongside that measure, the panel approved separate legislation that would bar charter schools from setting criteria to enroll students, ban them from imposing other requirements on a student randomly selected to attend, and place new limits on how such schools can enroll children from outside their district.
That bill would also bar charter schools from encouraging students to break with the district. Some opponents have charged that charter schools push out low-performing students to boost their metrics.
The committee approved the bills in unanimous votes, though Sens. Owen Henry (R-Ocean) and Kristin Corrado (R-Passaic) abstained from votes on both bills, saying they are broadly supportive but need more time to review amendments.

As one of many Montana women who answered the military’s call for service during World War I as a trained nurse with the Red Cross, Sandelius shipped overseas, volunteered for combat duty, and served on front-line hospitals, nearly losing her life several times. She returned to America with little fanfare and got married to a man whom she secretly wed before deploying, both never knowing if they’d see each other again.
They did. And they raised a family. But even that family, who knew her simply as “Granny,” had no idea that among the records of battlefield heroics, she stood out. According to her relatives, she never recounted her experiences of the field hospital or the wounded.
It was a decade-long journey by one of Montana’s best contemporary historians that culminated in a small ceremony in Los Angeles last year, where Sandelius was awarded the honor, even though many nurses during the “Great War” never got the same recognition as their male military counterparts.

In fact, in what may be a cruel historic irony: Sandelius’ name may have been more remembered had she been killed in action rather than just serving in it. The names of the fallen dead were remembered, often chiseled in the stone of memorials and written in the books of military history.
However, Sandelius’ story follows a common trajectory: Small town girl who becomes a nurse, only to have the country enter into a great global war. Edward Saunders, who has done extensive history of Montana women in the military, especially during the first half of the twentieth century in his book, “Knapsacks and Roses,” said when America entered into the war, there were more nurses in Montana than the military, which only had about 400 (at the time, there were 500 in the Treasure State). The Department of War would send out a call for more than 14,000.
Sandelius answered that call, not once, but three times. She volunteered to be a nurse for the military; she volunteered to go to overseas; and then she volunteered to go to the front lines. None of those things were required.
But it would be her service on the battlefield, in a field hospital that wasn’t much more than a tent, during some of the most intense fighting where she caught the notice of the commanders.
In July and August 1918, Sandelius was assigned to the U.S. 28th Division, which was helping the French infantry stave off German attacks, including those with lethal gas. During the Oise-Ainse offensive and the Second Battle of the Marne, the 28th sustained more than 14,000 casualties.
Sandelius was assigned to Field Hospital 112, near Cohan, about 60 miles from Paris. Saunders recounts that the tented field hospital would receive more than 5,000 wounded and perform more than 200 surgeries.
But on Aug. 10, the Germans stepped up the attacks, and the field hospital was caught.
Even after military commanders had ordered the nurses to withdraw to three miles, Sandelius refused to leave the side of the injured and sick.
“For eight consecutive days and nights, she stayed with her patients, enduring enemy artillery and aerial bombardment in dire and deadly conditions,” Saunders wrote.
Her life could have ended in a multitude of ways during those harrowing hours, but two coincidences should have killed her. Both times, a German warplane — military aviation was still in its infancy — dropped a bomb near the tented hospital, only to have them both fail to explode. One landed approximately 15 feet from her.
While she would survive on a combination of luck and steely determination, Sandelius and other nurses would stay on long after the war’s end on Nov. 11, 1918, helping to care for the sick and wounded.
She returned to the United States in 1919, alive and with little other fanfare. Few even know that she and her husband, Stillwater County soldier C.B. Benbow, had fallen madly in love just prior to entering into the war. Not knowing where they’d end up, or if either would make it out of the worldwide conflict alive, they secretly wed two weeks before she left.
The marriage had to be done secretly, or she’d likely not be accepted for the war effort. On all of her war records, including her dog tags, she remained Elizabeth D. Sandelius, No. 12660, of the American Expeditionary Forces.
In reality, she was Elizabeth D. Benbow.
After the war, she returned to her husband, C.B., who was trained as an early aviation pilot, but never left the states during the war. Sandelius died in May 1983, never knowing her battlefield legacy would be remembered. She was buried in Los Angeles’ National Cemetery.

It was Saunders, while researching his book about Montana women and their involvement in World War I, who discovered Sandelius’ story.
“From the centennial of World War One about 10 years go, I first met her in the dusty archives of the Montana state library among many records of Montana women who went to war in 1917,” Saunders said. “As I looked at Elizabeth’s service record in war-torn France, I couldn’t help but think, ‘This gal was in some bad stuff.’ I wanted to find more about her. My walk with her began.”
His inspiration would lead him to research more of her life, and he believed that U.S. military officials had overlooked awards that she more than deserved.
It took nearly a decade of research and a writing campaign. Saunders was able to track down the grandchildren of Sandelius, themselves old enough to be grandparents. They were shocked to learn about “Granny’s” history, and proud that their grandmother, whom they remembered warmly, was also a hero.
They offered letters of support in Saunders’ campaign to earn her recognition, including sending Sandelius’ dog-tags and photos. And they were shocked when the U.S. Army accepted their case for Sandelius receiving the Silver Star.
Saunders, a retired Army colonel who served in combat himself, remembers calling the family when the letter from the U.S. Army arrived.
“We both had tears in our eyes,” Saunders said.
Sandelius was among the first four American servicewomen in the American military history, all WWI Army Nurse Corps nurse, to have been awarded the Silver Star medal for valor in combat.
“The greatest tragedy that can befall an American serviceman — or woman — is not that they may be killed in action, that’s the greatest sacrifice. The greatest tragedy is they may be forgotten: Forgotten in life and forgotten in death by the very same nation they — and I — swore and oath to defend, even at the cost of our lives,” Saunders said. “In the words of the ancient Greeks, Elizabeth helped make gentle the horror which mankind often inflicts upon itself.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Elizabeth-Sandelius-Dog-Tags-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-11-11 06:56:11.564229

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)On Monday, a group of state and local lawmakers expected to see firsthand the conditions within the Milwaukee Secure Detention Facility (MSDF), a state-run facility imprisoning people for things like probation and parole violations. Lawmakers said the Department of Corrections (DOC) approved the tour, only to back out. It wasn’t the first time that elected officials have reported being denied tours of prisons and jails around the state, many of which continue to produce troubling accounts of the conditions inside their walls. 
“Let me be clear, the conditions in Wisconsin’s correctional facilities are not simply unfortunate,” said Rep. Darrin Madison (D-Milwaukee), standing with other elected officials and community organizers on the steps of the Milwaukee County Courthouse on Monday. “They are unacceptable…We are not going to normalize inhumanity.” 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Madison said that in some incarceration facilities, people may be locked in their cells for 20-23 hours a day for months. “They are denied sunlight,” said Madison. “They’re denied movement. They’re denied programming. They’re denied medical care. They’re denied basic human contact. There are facilities where people can’t even get consistent access to quality hygiene products. Where food is so poor, it does not meet the nutritional needs of grown adults…Where communication with family, the very thing that reduces recidivism, is treated like a privilege instead of a right.” 
Inhumane conditions in Wisconsin’s  jails and prisons, Madison said, is “state-sanctioned violence, and it’s being done in our name and disguised as justice.” Rather than creating spaces where rehabilitation can occur, Madison said, the Legislature has favored “choices related to punishment over rehabilitation, control over care, silence over accountability.” He stressed that “when you run a system on punishment and silence, abuse becomes the operating procedure.” 
That’s why Madison, alongside other elected officials and organizers from Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing (EXPO) and the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, gathered outside the courthouse in Milwaukee to announce a package of bills aimed at improving conditions in prisons and jails. The bills would accomplish a number of things including:

Guaranteeing 180 free minutes of telephone access, 60 minutes of free video calling, and 100 free messages per week to incarcerated people. In-person visits would also not be replaced with video or phone calls, 
Increase wages to incarcerated people to at least $2.33 per hour. In  Wisconsin most incarcerated people are paid anywhere from nothing to 40 cents per hour, 
Guaranteeing at least four bathing periods for people incarcerated in  state and county facilities, 
Providing culturally sensitive products and a $25 a month stipend to help pay for them, female hygiene supplies, and other grooming and hygiene products, 
Guaranteeing up to two in-person visits a week, and allowing incarcerated people to have up to 25 registered visitors who may embrace them for up to 20 seconds before and after visits, 
Requiring that all state and county correctional facilities provide recreational activities, as well as organized and structured programming,
Ensuring that people placed in solitary confinement are given a book, pen or pencil, paper, envelopes, hygiene products, a personal address book, and other supplies within two hours of being placed in restrictive housing, requiring structured programming while in solitary confinement, guaranteeing access to case managers, and providing three 25-minute video visitation periods per week, 
Ensuring that housing units are kept at 68-76 degrees Fahrenheit, 
Granting incarcerated people the ability to see the outdoors at least three hours daily, and the ability to be outside and up to three hours a week, 
Creating a public dashboard with status on solitary confinement, prison lockdowns, and complaints, 
Ensuring that lawmakers are able to access prisons and jails for oversight purposes, 
Allowing counties to oversee control of a jail if lawmakers vote to do so, 
And requiring jails and prisons to provide written documents to incarcerated people detailing their rights, and ensuring the document can be viewed and accessed throughout any correctional facility. 

Justin Bielinski, a Milwaukee County supervisor and chair of the Judiciary, Law Enforcement, and General Services Committee, quoted the adage that with great power comes great responsibility and added, “our carceral system is the ultimate power, depriving people of their freedom.” Bielinski said she  fears that “we’re not holding up our end of the bargain and our responsibility to keep people safe and free from harm.” 
Meanwhile, Milwaukee County is running out of space in the jail and Community Reintegration Center (CRC). “So it’s more important than ever that the conditions inside these facilities are the best that we can make them so that when people come out, they are not worse, that they are at least the same, if not better.” Bielinksi said. She added, “The Sheriff’s Office has been resistant to every attempt that we’ve made to offer change, offer oversight within the jail.” Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), who was also in attendance on Monday, said he has also battled the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office to visit the jail and improve conditions there.

Although the county board can pass resolutions, they are not binding and do not usurp the authority the sheriff has over the jail. “We cannot force change inside of that facility,” said Bielinski. “And so we do need state legislation to help us out with that…We know these things are going to cost money, but we cannot let money be the excuse for treating people in a way that is less than human. And if we can’t find the money, then we shouldn’t be locking this many people up.” 
Bielinksi recalled the string of deaths inside the Milwaukee County Jail from 2021 to 2022, which led to a third-party audit of the jail. Yet in that audit, Bielinksi said, the county didn’t address the specific circumstances that led to the deaths. Among the people who died were 21-year-old Brieon Green and 20-year-old Cilivea Thyrion, whose deaths were both ruled suicides despite  their families’ insistence that jail staff were at the very least negligent in their care. Green and Thyrion’s loved ones joined local activists in calling for reform to the jail and sheriff’s office. 
December will mark three years since Thyrion died. Kayla Patterson, a member of the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, highlighted the deaths and riots at the jail in recent years. “And we will continue to see that until the sheriff and her office are held accountable,” said Patterson. “This legislative pack should represent one of the first steps in standing with the people of Milwaukee for jail oversight that works with them, and not against them. For real transparency input into how our loved ones are kept while in custody. In the Alliance there’s a slogan we use: ‘In your custody, in your care.’ These are not just inmates, but community members that deserve dignity 24-7 during their time in the jail.” 
Conditions within state prisons have also been under the microscope. Last year, the warden of Waupun Correctional and eight other staff members were charged with crimes related to the treatment and neglect of people within the prison, which may have contributed to a string of four deaths from 2023 to 2024.

The deaths included Dean Hoffmann, ruled suicide by hanging, Tyshun Lemons who overdosed on a substance containing fentanyl, Cameron Williams who complained of breathing issues and was found unresponsive in his bed, and Donald Maier, who died while in solitary confinement of dehydration and malnutrition. Water to his cell had been shut off, and correctional officers allegedly knew that Maier’s mental condition was worsening, that he had not eaten for days, and had begun drinking sewage water. In 2025, Waupun warden Randall Hepp was convicted of a misdemeanor in Maier’s death, and fined $500. Hepp pleaded no contest. 
The DOC didn’t respond to a request for comment, and the story will be updated with any reply from them. 
Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said at the press conference, “We invest, as a state, millions of dollars in folks who are in our care. And they should be coming out on a trajectory of success to make sure that they are finding a job, finding a community, and the only time they think about their time incarcerated is in the rear view mirror, in the past tense. Unfortunately, the way that we have this set up is a broken ‘tough on crime’ idea that once you touch the criminal justice system it is cruel to you, it diminishes you, and it never lets you go.”

Androne Lane has experienced the struggles Larson described. He came home in 2018 after spending time in several prisons including Waupun, Green Bay, Red Granite and  Fox Lake. “I think it was important for me to come out and speak today because being a returning citizen, this bill or this movement that these guys are pushing to me is like a basic, like our own constitution for returning citizens,” Lane told the Wisconsin Examiner. “We’re not asking for a lot, we’re asking for dignity. We’re asking for humanity.” 
The priorities outlined in the bill package cover things that would help incarcerated people heal and become whole, Lane said. When people return home from prison, Lane continued, “How do you get a community to accept them coming back in there? And what does that look like for encouraging the community or an individual coming back to recover something that wasn’t replaced?” 
Lane and other advocates say there needs to be a “community care plan” for people returning home from incarceration. When Lane returned home, he told the  Examiner, it took a while for him to accept that he needed mental health therapy. “I think one of the hardest things for individuals is to ask for help, not knowing what help you need,” he said. “When I came home there was a lot of things that was on the surface that I had to deal with. But there was a lot of things inside that I didn’t know I was dealing with.” On the surface, Lane was unemployed and deeply stressed, but on the inside he was struggling with the trauma of being molested as a child, and he didn’t know how he’d be accepted in the community. “What does mental health look like for us? What does wellness look like …and what is this ‘whole’ that everybody is working for?” 
Rep. Margaret Arney (D-Wauwatosa) (Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)
Rep. Margaret Arney (D-Wauwatosa), said the bills embody important work for Wisconsin to take on. “I hate living in a state where we lock up so many people and have so little regard for how those people live their lives,” Arney told the Examiner. “It’s a heartbreaking, enraging type of situation…When I look around and say, ‘What’s as bad as slavery was?’ And I think of the conditions of incarceration in the state of Wisconsin. That us as the United States, we’re addicted to locking people up, and in Wisconsin we do it even more so and even worse than in other states. And even though it costs a tremendous amount of resources, there’s so little willingness to engage in what those resources are here for, what we’re doing. Why does it cost so much to treat people so badly? Why do we, everyday, just put up with the fact that we’re somewhere on the order of 5,000 people over capacity?” 
Although “conditions of confinement” sounds like a “sterile” term to Arney, she said,  it’s not. “It’s human beings that are being treated at torture-level conditions, and I just can’t stand that.”

According to the department, the plan evaluates the condition and performance of Idaho’s existing rail system, identifies challenges and opportunities and covers strategies to strengthen infrastructure. 
The plan also addresses public safety and railroad crossings.
“We want to hear from Idaho communities about how rail infrastructure is working today and what improvements would make the biggest difference in the future,” Freight Program Manager Caleb Forrey said in a written statement. “Your feedback will help us better understand statewide priorities and shape a plan that reflects Idaho’s needs.”

The Idaho Statewide Rail Plan will be used to support grant applications and coordination with the Federal Railroad Administration, but does not allocate funding for specific projects, Idaho Transportation Department officials said. 
The Idaho Statewide Rail Plan and grant opportunities are important to the railway system in Idaho because there is no dedicated state source of funding for freight or passenger rail aside from matching funds available for federally funded rail crossing improvements, transportation officials said. 
Feedback gathered from the online public survey will be incorporated into an updated Idaho Statewide Rail Plan, which officials said they expect to release in spring 2026. The updated plan will then be used to guide discussions and partnerships at the community, state and federal levels. 
A summary of the 2013 Idaho Statewide Rail Plan is available online.

The case, which could have major implications for voters in Wyoming, is expected to be appealed to the Wyoming Supreme Court. 
The post District court upholds Wyoming’s closed primary election system, ‘sore loser’ laws appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s closed primary election system and its so-called “sore loser” laws do not violate the state’s constitution, a district court judge ruled Friday in a lawsuit brought by a group of voters earlier this year. 
“The challenged statutes regulate the manner in which political rights are exercised but do not abridge the rights themselves,” Laramie County District Court Judge Nathaniel S. Hibben wrote in his decision. “The court likewise finds the challenged statutes do not deny Plaintiffs equal protection of the laws.”
First filed in August 2024, the lawsuit initially sought to overturn the state’s prohibition on failed primary candidates appearing on the general election ballot as independents, known as a “sore loser law.”
In April, the complaint expanded to challenge Wyoming’s closed primary election system as well as its crossover voting ban, which limits how and when voters may affiliate with a political party. 
The plaintiffs, who included voters, former political candidates and a retired state lawmaker, argued that such laws violate the Wyoming Constitution’s guarantee of “political equality” and “impermissibly discriminate against candidates and voters not affiliated with a major political party.” 
Those laws, however, are a “valid exercise of legislative power,” Hibben ruled, adding that his decision is likely not the last in the case. 
“As the parties made clear at argument on these motions, this dispute will inevitably be resolved by the Wyoming Supreme Court,” the ruling states.

In the meantime, Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who was named as a defendant in his official capacity as the state’s top elections official, called the ruling “a huge win for the integrity of Wyoming’s elections,” in a statement.  
“Protecting the election process by banning crossover voting has been a key part of our administration’s election integrity agenda,” Gray wrote. “With this ruling, it is confirmed what we, the citizens of Wyoming, knew all along: these laws are constitutional, and pivotal to ensuring election integrity in Wyoming.”
The ruling
It’s not the court’s job, Hibben wrote, “to question the wisdom of the Legislature’s policy choices,” but rather “to determine whether those choices transgress the clear boundaries established by the Wyoming Constitution.” 
The court found the sore loser law does not cross that boundary in part because it does not completely disqualify a candidate from running after losing a primary. 
“The availability of the write-in option, explicitly protected by the Wyoming Constitution, ensures that the right to seek office is not extinguished,” Hibben wrote. 
For decades, Wyoming had a partially open primary election system. That meant voters were restricted to casting ballots in races that aligned with political party affiliation, which they could change on election day and during most of the early-voting period. 
However, that changed in 2023 when lawmakers created a 96-day blackout period leading up to the primary election in order to ban what’s known as crossover voting — a popular practice for Democrats in a state where Republicans dominate politics. Democrats often vote for more moderate Republicans, which has frustrated some on the right. 
The new timeline lines up with the candidate filing period, meaning voters must affiliate with a party before the slate of candidates is finalized. 
Altogether, plaintiffs argued that the deadline and Wyoming’s closed primary system unconstitutionally burden their fundamental right to vote.  
However, “the right to vote in a primary is not an absolute right to vote for any candidate, but rather a right to participate in the selection process of the political party with which one has chosen to affiliate,” Hibben ruled. 
In their filings, the plaintiffs pointed to the political reality that many races in Wyoming are decided in the primary election due to the Republican Party’s dominance. 
“This perspective, however, invites the court to step beyond its constitutional bounds. It is not the court’s function to diagnose the causes of the political imbalance, much less to prescribe a remedy,” Hibben wrote. “Rather, the court must champion the very political rights plaintiffs exercised: the freedom to organize, to advocate, to persuade, to seek public office, and to cast a vote for the candidate of their choice. Plaintiffs had, and still have those political rights and privileges.” 
Plaintiffs now have 30 days to file an appeal with the Wyoming Supreme Court.

Candace Machado resigned after a frustrating year, columnist Kerry Drake writes, but urged people to run for office if they can handle the personal risks.
The post Ex-Evansville mayor’s experiences show why good folks don’t get into politics appeared first on WyoFile .","It’s a given that most progressive candidates don’t fare well in Wyoming politics. 

Opinion

But what happened during Candace Machado’s time as Evansville’s mayor shows that serving in office after overcoming the obstacles to win an election can be a nightmarish experience.
When she resigned last month, people on social media told her, “You signed up for this.”
“We signed up to serve the community, not to be the emotional punching bag for every adult who never learned effective boundaries, coping skills and emotional reasoning,” Machado told me a week after she left the nonpartisan office. 
Media attention has focused on the most controversial event of her tenure as mayor, the vitriolic response after she planted miniature Pride flags on the lawn of the Evansville Town Hall in June. She wanted to show the town’s support for the LGBTQ+ community.
Resident Jeremy Brown responded by drawing swastikas in chalk on the sidewalk to protest the Pride flags. Brown said at a council meeting that he did it as an act of free speech to register his complaint that having ideologies displayed on government buildings “brings division, hatred and just, basically, we don’t need that in our town.”
What Evansville doesn’t need are people who respond to a message of inclusion, love and respect for LGBTQ+ individuals with the symbol of a Nazi regime that persecuted and ultimately killed more than 6 million Jews and millions more based on their political beliefs, sexual orientation, and mental or physical disabilities.
Brown apologized if his swastikas “offended anyone.” He and a few supporters demanded Machado’s resignation at town council meetings, and Councilman Greg Flesvig even presented a letter of resignation for the mayor to sign. 
It’s a sad chapter in the history of Evansville.
The former mayor stressed to me that the Pride flag incident wasn’t the reason she resigned, but part of a long series of events in which — “behind the scenes” — she often felt demeaned and ignored by peers who didn’t want to rock the boat. 


“I don’t want my five years [in office] to be representative of one choice and one decision that I made,” Machado said. “There were a lot of choices and decisions I made that moved the town forward.”
Machado’s political career began when she ran for the Evansville Town Council in 2020 and won. Mayor Chad Edwards resigned in February 2024, and she said the town’s police chief and fire chief talked her into seeking the interim position. Machado, who didn’t see eye-to-eye with members on many issues, said she was surprised when the town council unanimously voted for her.
Machado has an impressive record, including completing her predecessor’s prime project, a $1 million park playground. She also helped secure a nearly $9 million grant from the Wyoming Business Council for the Mesa Natural Gas Solutions manufacturing plant in Evansville. It’s scheduled to be completed next summer.
Machado, a social worker for 18 years, is also proud that the council approved mental health and counseling services for first responders who have experienced trauma.
“I’m a pretty progressive person, and I had a lot of people who just wanted me to fit in a box,” she said. “They wanted me to conform and stick with the status quo, and don’t shine light on things that are bad for the community.”
Machado describes Wyoming’s political system as “broken.” I agree with her assessment: “If you don’t fall in line with how Wyoming politicians think and behave, you’re the bad guy,” she said. “You get quietly silenced; they shut you out. They’ll make it look good in public settings, but you get to know very quickly how you land with everything.”
Machado said she has supporters, but they can’t always be at meetings. “It’s a very lonely space to be in. At the end of the day, when things get tough and challenging, it’s just you and your family to pick up the pieces,” she related.
There were two reasons I interviewed Machado. I wanted to see what advice she would offer future candidates and if she feels people can make a positive impact on the state’s politics even if they don’t throw their hat in the ring.
“People have told me they’ve seen what I went through the last 21 months, and they want no part of it because they didn’t think they could do it,” she said.
Machado said this isn’t the end of her political career, and she’s leaving the door open to seeking another office in the future.
I’m glad Machado isn’t staying quiet. “I feel like I can do a lot of great work as an activist and an advocate in the community,” she said. “It’s what I’ve been doing for the past two decades.”
Machado hopes the Wyoming Freedom Caucus falls out of favor with voters and is amazed many candidates won’t even admit they’re members, but notes it makes it difficult for opponents to pin down their views in a campaign. “If you’re going to be honest with your constituents, at least tell them which party line you affiliate yourself with,” she said.
Even after her resignation, the ex-mayor still encourages people to get involved in the political arena as candidates. But Machado cautions that they need to go in with their eyes wide open.
“If people are going to run for office, they need to know how it’s going to impact them and their families,” she advised. “And they need to know what it’s going to be like when they’re in office.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska was set to lead the way July 1 with a new statewide criminal justice diversion program for eligible veterans through evidence-based treatment and case plans. But lawmakers delayed the rollout for two years in the face of growing budget woes.
It’s not yet clear whether Nebraska lawmakers can meet that later timeline and find the roughly $4.7 million in annual funding the state court system says is needed to start by July 1, 2027. 
Several current and former state lawmakers called the funding decision “disappointing” and “incredibly problematic.” Another former lawmaker said she wasn’t in a position to “second guess” a response to the state’s fiscal situation.
Former State Sen. Tom Brewer, the sponsor of the 2024 bill who represented north-central Nebraska, said in a May text that lawmakers had made a “conscious decision” to ignore veterans’ problems and wait to support those who have stumbled and need a second chance.

Brewer said the budget had already passed by the time he learned about the proposal. 
“I believe that veterans will come with a vengeance against those senators and the governor if they take a law that was debated and voted on and made into law and then ignore it for their convenience for the budget,” Brewer said in May.
Unlike the state’s four specific Veterans Treatment Courts operating in the three most populous counties and in central Nebraska, the new veterans justice program would support all veterans, not just those who were honorably discharged. The Veterans Administration can’t reimburse the treatment costs for veterans who are dishonorably discharged, which increases state costs.
‘Playing politics with our veterans’
Two other lawmakers, both lawyers, joined Brewer this week in criticizing the spring decision as a continuation of not fully supporting veterans who have come home from serving.
“It’s unfortunate that we’re playing politics with our veterans,” former State Sen. Justin Wayne, the then-chair of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee who partnered with Brewer on the bill, said this week.
“We don’t uphold our end of the deal, and those folks are left holding the bag,” said State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, another supporter of the law who works in the public defender’s office in Lancaster County.

This week, just before Veterans Day, Brewer added: “I think that they’re forgetting a group of folks that shouldn’t be forgotten.”
The law, passed 44-0 in April 2024, directed the Nebraska Judicial Branch to provide targeted statewide support to eligible veterans if a veteran’s military service-connected conditions contributed to their alleged criminal actions.
“The ones that are struggling are the ones that have seen some of the worst action, and sometimes, figuring out how to beat those ghosts that you’re dealing with, you need a little extra help,” Brewer said.
Last in, first out
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen identified the specialized diversion program as one of many “last in, first out” laws his budget proposal targeted for cuts or delayed implementation in January. 
The recommendations temporarily ensnared or ended programs, including a prescription drug donation program costing about $500,000 annually, a step which was later reversed. The moves were part of Pillen’s answer to a then-projected$432 million state budget deficit through June 30, 2027.

The total budget hole lawmakers ultimately filled was much larger. In the case of the veterans justice program, Pillen’s recommendations argued the state court system could support veterans without additional taxpayer dollars.
“The Supreme Court is able to develop a process independently to address critical veteran justice needs,” Pillen’s budget recommendations said in mid-January.
Because the veterans justice program didn’t start until July 2025, lawmakers would have needed to find the $9.4 million for this budget year. 
The Appropriations Committee accepted Pillen’s recommendation, and the full Legislature accepted the change with little opposition in the first year after legislative term limits sent home Brewer, Wayne and another lead supporter, former State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of the Elkhorn area.
An effect of term limits
The trio joined a large class of lawmakers in 2017 and were among the most influential senators in recent years. Linehan chaired the Revenue Committee, and Brewer chaired the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee. 
Brewer, a 36-year military veteran with two Purple Hearts, served six combat tours in Afghanistan and two in Kyrgyzstan. He has since led nine volunteer missions to Ukraine after Russia invaded the country in February 2022 and plans to return next month.
The decorated veteran said he thought the decision would have been harder and that it would have been different had his class of “natural supporters” still been there. He said he would have “obviously fought it tooth and nail.” 
Nebraska leads with new veteran justice program, aiming to steer veterans back to ‘hero status’

But Brewer also expected other military veterans in the Legislature to step up.
“Maybe they didn’t want me barking at them, so they didn’t bother to let me know what was going on with it, but Justin [Wayne] notified me afterwards, and that’s the first I knew about it,” Brewer said.
Wayne said that while $5 million a year is big to everyday Nebraskans, it isn’t for the state budget or for those who have served the country. He said every dollar invested in problem-solving courts today, including those specific to veterans, yields a return of $8 to $10.
“The government put them in an area that caused it, so we as a government should take care of it,” Wayne said. “It’s unfortunate that Nebraska continues to fall behind in that.”

Brewer said Wayne came to him with the idea for the diversion program in the 2024 session, after bill introductions in their final session, but the two worked together with Linehan and other legislative leaders to find an unusual and speedy path to making it law.
“We weren’t sure if we could get it pushed through or not, but everything clicked,” Brewer said.
Dungan said he has seen and defended veterans facing criminal charges connected to their service. He said he recently attended a Lancaster County Veterans Treatment Court graduation, which was “one of the more moving things I’ve ever seen.”
“I understand that budgets are tight right now, but, again, it comes down to prioritization,” Dungan said. “I think that we absolutely have to prioritize the health and the welfare of vets across this entire state.”
A ‘fair number’
State Sen. Christy Armendariz of Omaha, Appropriations Committee vice chair, was among those who led the committee’s push to accept Pillen’s recommendation for the veterans program. She had told the Examiner during the 2025 session that her budget focuses were infrastructure, public safety and taking care of those who cannot take care of themselves, such as children and older adults.

In one executive session of the budget-writing committee in late March, she told her colleagues she felt the court hadn’t provided the Legislature a “fair number” and had inflated the estimated cost of a veterans justice program.
Armendariz was among those who supported the passage of the program the previous year, as did all other members of the Appropriations Committee at the time. An April 2024 fiscal note estimated the same $4.7 million annual cost that the Appropriations Committee and Pillen wrestled with this spring.
Nebraska Supreme Court Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke and State Court Administrator Corey Steel told the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee that the court system could not proceed with implementing the new program without the new funding. The plan is to add specialized probation officers, for instance, to monitor eligible veterans.
“I think we’re statutorily obligated to do that work,” Funke told the committee in his first budget cycle leading the court system. “We just don’t have the funding to do it.”

Steel told the Examiner in May that the fiscal estimate included roughly $3 million for staffing, $1 million for treatment costs and $500,000 for related information technology programming needs.
If the program had no state funding, it would have needed to go into effect July 1. But Steel told the Examiner in May, “The implementation would be very watered down and not implemented at the expectation that LB 253 was passed.” 
Worsening budget trends
In late May, lawmakers took the extra step of formally delaying the implementation of the diversion program in state law, through Legislative Bill 150. 
The Appropriations Committee almost advanced the delay without a separate public hearing on the proposal, but State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha urged the Judiciary Committee to hold one, partly because neither Pillen nor lawmakers had proposed the delay in the budget or in a separate bill.
With less than 24 hours’ notice, and with the budget having already passed, the Judiciary Committee hosted a short hearing the morning of May 22. It lasted no longer than 15 minutes, said State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, Appropriations Committee chair..
“I do not want the Legislature to start a new program without a reasonable plan and proper funding,” Clements testified. He had sponsored the amendment delaying the program’s start.

State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, vice chair of the Judiciary Committee, asked Clements why pushing the program out to 2027, to a new budget cycle for a different set of lawmakers, would be the “magic date.”
“Will you fund it?” DeBoer asked.
“Well, that’s part of the budget discussion. There wasn’t room for it in this year’s budget, and we’ll see how revenues and budgets are in the future,” Clements responded.
Since then, the state’s budget situation has worsened, with lawmakers projected to face another nearly half-a-billion-dollar deficit heading into the 2026 session that ends in mid-April.
Pillen also tried to trim the court system’s budget in late May, attempting to veto $12 million that court leaders said could have shuttered some critical court services, including a separate Veterans Treatment Court in Sarpy County. The Legislature deemed the vetoes had not been properly submitted, prematurely ending the fight and preserving the funds.
‘We’re ready to go’
Clements told the Examiner in May that a “problem” with the veterans justice program was that any veteran would be able to “claim he needs the veterans justice treatment” in any district or county court. He said judges and staff were not trained for that, suggesting a regional hub model as a possible alternative.
“I think the body will be favorable to that, so there’s some time to adjust the program down to what’s workable,” Clements said in a phone call.

At Clements’ hearing on the delay, DeBoer said she might consider seeking funding for the veterans program in 2026. She confirmed Monday night that she is still considering doing so in what would be her and Clements’ final year. 
Pillen told the Examiner in a post-session interview that his office continued to support veterans statewide, including recognizing those who served in Vietnam, Korea and World War II.
“I think that there’s way more to supporting our veterans than just talking about more money,” Pillen said June 3, a day after the 2025 session ended.
Funke, in a wide-ranging interview this month about the judicial branch, said the courts continue to work to design the new veterans justice diversion program, which would supplement the existing state Veterans Treatment Courts. Judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys and more support those intensive programs designed to reduce recidivism and allow reentry to society.
“Once they say, ‘Yep, go forward, here’s the funding,’ we’re ready to go,” Funke said last week of the Legislature.
‘They didn’t kill it’
A national panel of senior military and criminal justice leaders designed the model policy that Nebraska was the first to pass last year. Former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, chair of the national Veterans Justice Commission of the Council on Criminal Justice and a former U.S. senator from Nebraska, led the charge with Brewer, Wayne and Linehan.
Minnesota had passed a similar law a few years before the creation of the approach Nebraska adopted last year.
Wayne noted that the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, which shares model conservative bills nationwide, touted Wayne and Brewer as bipartisan “policy champions” after the 2024 law. Wayne criticized Pillen and other supporters for breaking their promise.

Part of the reason for the legislation, Hagel said last year, was because of the difficulties of some servicemembers in transitioning back to civilian life. More than 200,000 active-duty members make that switch each year, a number exacerbated by the country’s long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Retired Brig. Gen. David MacEwen, director of the national Veterans Justice Commission and a former Army adjutant general between 2013 and 2015, said in a statement this month that the Nebraska law honors the sacrifices of veterans. 
He said the new diversion program would ensure that those “entangled” in the legal system aren’t “forgotten” in jails or prisons and are supported.
“We understand that putting new laws into practice is never as smooth or as fast as we’d like, but we’re heartened to see that Nebraska remains committed to implementing this important reform,” MacEwen said.
Linehan, while reaffirming the importance of the law she helped champion, said in July that she wasn’t in a position to “second guess” the Legislature’s work this year. However, she said she looked forward to the state’s nationally praised court programs for veterans becoming more robust.
“I have every confidence in the governor and the leaders in the Legislature,” Linehan said. “They didn’t kill it. I’m happy about that.”
Readjusting to civilian life
Linehan, a former chief of staff for Hagel, served in the U.S. State Department between 2009 and 2012, where she worked on the Iraq desk. She worked in Iraq at the Baghdad Provincial Reconstruction Team and, in the end, headed the consulate in Basra after the Army left.

When she returned, Linehan said she was able to adjust back to the U.S., but she noted she wasn’t a young servicemember who spent four or five years in the military, who returned confused as to why others couldn’t understand their situation. She said support for veterans means helping with long-term reintegration, not just when they get off the plane.
“Nobody can understand what it’s like to be deployed,” Linehan said. “So we need to make sure, when we ask people to sacrifice everything, including some their lives and many their health, and especially their mental health, we need to make sure we’re there to help them.”
‘I just hope that our veterans matter’
According to the Council on Criminal Justice, roughly one in three veterans report being arrested or booked into jail at least once. The suicide rate for veterans is approximately 1.5 times higher than the rate among the general population and higher still for veterans who have been incarcerated.
Among all U.S. adults in 2022, there were, on average, more than 131 suicides each day and nearly 18 veteran suicides per day, according to the data reported by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

Brewer said the state’s delay makes him worry about the veterans who need the support the most. He said some worry more about their own struggles than the criminal penalties they face. 
Brewer said a key reason veterans consider taking their own lives is a loss of hope and feeling as if no one cares. He said that was one of the problems he, Wayne, Linehan and Hagel sought to address.
Dungan passed a bill this year to systematically review veteran and general population suicides in the state and analyze ways to make a difference. Pillen supported those efforts. Lawmakers also explicitly banned discrimination on the basis of military or veteran status as part of LB 150.
Wayne said he wants lawmakers to care more about standing by veterans when they are in need or when they make a mistake, to not just make political speeches and appearances on Veterans Day or show up to banquets, but to help servicemembers and their families. He said the Legislature can always find money for things that matter.
“I just hope that our veterans matter enough to this Legislature to fund them.”

Trafficking of a […]","A bipartisan bill in the Wisconsin legislature would impose mandatory minimum sentences on people convicted of human trafficking. Advocates worry the penalty could be applied to victims.Close up shot of fingerprint paper | Getty ImagesA bill that would require judges to sentence people convicted of human trafficking to at least 10 years in prison, or at least 15 years for trafficking a child, is advancing through the Wisconsin Legislature.  
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Human trafficking involves the use of force, fraud or coercion for labor, services or commercial sex acts. Trafficking of a child includes knowingly attempting to recruit a child for commercial sex acts. The bill would also increase the maximum prison time a person can receive for trafficking. 
Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) wrote that the bill “will continue to put a dent in human trafficking in Wisconsin.” Rep. Jerry O’Connor (R-Fond Du Lac) listed five cases in which, he wrote, a person convicted of sex trafficking received between six and eight years in prison. It appeared that the cases took place in states other than Wisconsin. 
“AB 265 ensures that these soft-on-trafficking policies never happen in Wisconsin,” O’Connor wrote. He argued that the bill’s mandatory minimums ensure adequate punishment and prevent offenders from doing further harm. 
The criminal justice advocacy group Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing (EXPO) and the president of the Wisconsin Justice Initiative oppose the mandatory minimums, arguing that there is a lack of evidence they will be effective at reducing trafficking. EXPO argues in an email to the Wisconsin Examiner that mandatory minimums risk unintended harmful consequences and resources are better spent on areas such as prevention and victim services.  
The LOTUS Legal Clinic in Milwaukee, which works with survivors of human trafficking, expressed concern in a written comment submitted on the Senate version of the bill in September. Executive Director Erika Petty wrote that many of LOTUS’s clients might support the mandatory minimum in principle, but expressed concern about unintended consequences for trafficking victims. 
“Traffickers commonly shield themselves from criminal accountability by forcing their victims — often at a very young age — to post ads, recruit new trafficking victims, and facilitate encounters,” Petty wrote in her comment, which was brought up in the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety. “Thus, the victims themselves become vulnerable to criminal prosecution for human trafficking.”
The bill’s mandatory minimums would apply if a person is convicted of human or child trafficking in adult court, Amber Otis, senior staff attorney with the Wisconsin Legislative Council, wrote in a message to lawmakers on the committee.
Petty argued that under the bill, a victim forced to participate in trafficking of others would fall under the mandatory minimum, just like their trafficker. She provided language for lawmakers to consider; if added to the bill, it would create exceptions to the mandatory minimums that would give judges the ability to hand down lighter sentences or probation to people who offer evidence that their offense is the direct result of a violation of the trafficking statutes.
A 2017 Northwestern University Law Review article made a suggestion in the same vein as Petty’s, proposing that Congress create a “safety valve” for “lead prostitutes,” or “bottoms,” who are both victims and perpetrators of trafficking, to allow them to receive a sentence lighter than a mandatory minimum if certain criteria were met. An article in Anti-Trafficking Review describes a case where a woman named Keosha Jones was both perpetrator and victim of sex trafficking.
Petty wrote that LOTUS attorneys currently had multiple cases involving convicted survivors. The clinic doesn’t handle criminal defense, but LOTUS can work with survivors on their rights as crime victims and see if they can alleviate a survivor’s criminal record, Petty told the Examiner in an interview. A survivor may have a criminal record as a result of trafficking that creates barriers to gainful employment and safe housing. 
While the bill was introduced by Republicans, the Assembly Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety approved it unanimously, and Minority Caucus Chair Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) and Rep. Shelia Stubbs (D-Madison) have been added as coauthors. It has since passed the Assembly. 
The Senate Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety approved the Senate bill along party lines, with the committee’s three Democrats voting against. 
People convicted of benefiting from human trafficking or receiving compensation from the earnings of debt bondage, the prostitution of others or a commercial sex act would also receive a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, or 15 years for benefiting from child trafficking. 
The bill would also increase the amount of prison time a judge could hand down for trafficking and give prosecutors a longer window to charge someone with human trafficking. 
Victims have a defense in court, but concerns remain
The Examiner reached out to Sen. Wanggaard in September about LOTUS’s comment and suggested amendment. Wanggaard aide Scott Kelly said that “we do not believe an amendment is necessary.” 
If a trafficking victim commits a crime as a “direct result” of a violation of human trafficking law, the victim can use an affirmative defense in court. Kelly referenced the affirmative defense and the 2022 Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling in State v. Kizer, which involved a woman who killed a man prosecutors admitted had sexually abused her. 
The court held that an offense is committed as a direct result of a violation of the human trafficking statutes if there is “a logical, causal connection” between the offense and the trafficking. Other events or considerations must not have played a significant role in causing the offense. 
If a victim is charged and convicted of trafficking, that would mean the victim did not successfully assert the defense, Otis wrote. This could occur if the prosecutor proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not meet the elements of the defense. 
Even with the affirmative defense, Assistant State Public Defender Katie York of the Wisconsin State Public Defenders Office told the Examiner that she thinks the bill puts trafficking survivors at risk. 
York opposes the human trafficking mandatory minimum in general, and said it takes away the opportunity for prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges to evaluate each case based on individual circumstances. York said she thinks judges are well equipped to make decisions and she doesn’t believe that this area of the law needs more specific parameters. 
York said how well the defense can be used to protect a trafficking victim is “largely untested at this point.” 
Also, if there is a situation where a jury doesn’t think the defendant meets the “direct result” standard for the affirmative defense, the trafficking still might have been a contributing factor to the defendant’s involvement in the offense, York said. A judge could take that into account. 
“So they could be found guilty of trafficking, even if they tried the affirmative defense,” York said. “But, if the judge is looking at the full picture when they’re sentencing someone, which is what judges do, they would want to take into consideration how that person got involved in the trafficking.”
If a person got involved in trafficking because they were originally trafficked themselves, that would be an important factor for the sentencing judge, York said. 
A person might have some culpability, without having as much culpability as whoever drew them in or forced them into human trafficking, said Sarah Schmeiser, president of the Wisconsin Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. 
Schmeiser said prosecutors use mandatory minimums to force plea deals, as someone charged with a crime that carries a mandatory minimum sentence has an incentive to plead guilty to a lower charge with a lower penalty instead of risking the mandatory minimum sentence at trial. 
York thinks traffickers could use the mandatory minimum as a tool to further coerce their victims.
“So if… they say, ‘Hey, I need you to post this on Backpage,’ or ‘I need you to talk to this girl for me,’ or whatever it is to bring them into the trafficking, they’re putting that person at risk of criminal liability,” York said. “And then the trafficker can say, ‘And, now you better be careful and listen to what I have to say, because otherwise, you’re going to get in trouble with law enforcement and you’re going to go to prison for 10 years,’ or whatever the mandatory minimum is.”
Increased penalties 
Under the bill, someone convicted of committing or benefitting from human trafficking would be guilty of a Class C felony, which carries up to 25 years in prison. Receiving compensation from the earnings of debt bondage, a prostitute or a commercial sex act would become a Class E felony, which carries up to 10 years in prison. The mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison would apply to all human trafficking offenses.
Committing or benefitting from child trafficking would become a Class B felony, which carries up to 40 years in prison. Child trafficking offenses would carry the 15-year mandatory minimum. 
More time to prosecute
The bill would also increase the statute of limitations for human trafficking from six years to 10 years, allowing more time for prosecution. During an Assembly hearing, Investigator Luke Johnson of the Racine County Sheriff’s Office said many human trafficking victims struggle to leave their traffickers. 
“It is very easy for victims to be trapped in a life for many years before having a chance to get out or feeling comfortable enough to disclose to law enforcement or anyone else,” Johnson said. 
Of the human trafficking charges filed under the state law between 2018 and 2023, so far 14 charges have led to convictions, according to Wisconsin Court System data. For trafficking of a child, so far, 32 charges have led to convictions. This does not represent the number of people convicted, as a person can be charged more than once in a case. Charges of benefiting from human or child trafficking were less frequent. 
The National Human Trafficking Hotline reports it has identified 1,117 cases of human trafficking in Wisconsin since 2007, with 2,212 victims identified in those cases. There were 445 allegations of child sex trafficking across Wisconsin in 2021.
“It is imperative to note that in this underworld of crime, there are far more cases that are not reported to law enforcement,” Rep. Jerry O’Connor wrote in a comment on the bill. 
Burden of proof 
Senators discussed LOTUS’s comment during a hearing of the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety in September, with Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee) raising concern about charging and criminalizing victims. 
Committee chair and Sen. Van Wanggaard said he thinks investigators understand that a person might be coerced to participate in human trafficking. 
Otis’s email to the Senate committee noted that the district attorney has discretion over whether and how to charge someone with trafficking depending on the situation. 
It’s difficult to prove whether someone is a victim of human trafficking, York said. She added that the victim may not identify as a victim of trafficking, and may view their trafficker as a boyfriend or someone they relied on. 
“It’s a challenge to kind of go back and unpack years worth of trauma and history to say, ‘OK, this is what originally happened, and this is how we got to where we are,” York said. 
At times, a plea deal may work out better for the individual than using the affirmative defense, York said, due to the mental toll the defendant would experience from going in front of a jury and speaking about what happened to them. A mandatory minimum limits the ability to negotiate for the client, she said. 
Erika Petty of LOTUS suggested there could be a situation where someone is not ready to identify as a victim of trafficking at the trial stage, but the situation changes by the time of sentencing. 
Petty referenced a law that allows a person convicted of prostitution to submit a motion for a court to overturn their conviction if certain criteria are met, including that the person was a victim of trafficking for the purposes of a commercial sex act. Human trafficking convictions aren’t covered. 
Potentially, a survivor could appeal a decision, Petty said, but “those are all very specific, and have to align with timing and whatever underlying issue wanted to be appealed.”
Whose expertise informed the bill? 
Shortly before the Assembly voted on the bill, Rep. Robert Wittke (R-Caledonia) said the bill came to lawmakers from Investigator Luke Johnson. Johnson’s comments state that from 2023 to earlier this year, he had an opportunity to serve on a task force specifically targeting human trafficking and internet crimes against children. 
“I urge any of you that have any trepidation with this bill to sit down with those in the front line that actually do this work and actually see this firsthand,” Wittke said. 
During the hearing in the Senate in September, Drake asked Wanggaard and Wittke if they had reached out to any groups or partners that work with victims of human trafficking outside of law enforcement for input. 
Wanggaard said he didn’t know of any group recently that they talked with specifically about this draft, but said that “we have [done so] for most of the content in this draft.” He said he thinks law enforcement was probably the most vocal “because they’re seeing the same people out there, continuing to reoffend.”
Wittke said he didn’t go to any other groups and that “this came specifically from sitting down with Inspector Johnson.” 
Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) expressed concern about “only talking to one entity, and that is law enforcement, and we know that not all of our law enforcement officers have the tools necessary to decipher who those victims are.” 
The bill received support from the Wisconsin Sheriffs and Deputy Sheriffs Association and other law enforcement groups, as well as the nonprofit United Migrant Opportunity Services (UMOS). UMOS’s Latina Resource Center operates the Wisconsin Regional Anti-Human Trafficking Program, which helps victims of labor and sex trafficking. UMOS did not respond to requests for comment.

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Veterans Day this year came just days after my 20th reunion with my West Point classmates. I spent the weekend reconnecting with friends — some still in uniform, others like me long since transitioned to civilian life — and was reminded of the shared values that first brought us together. 
I graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 2005 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army Corps of Engineers. My final assignment was at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where I served as a civil affairs officer from 2011 to 2014. Over nine years on active duty, I was humbled by the people who volunteered to serve our country — bound by shared values and a steadfast commitment to the oath we all took to support and defend the Constitution.
When I turned 18 and became eligible to vote, I was already a cadet at West Point and soon to be an Army officer. Since that time, I’ve never officially affiliated with any political party. Military service impressed upon me that the health of our republic depends on service members who uphold their oath to the Constitution, even when political tides shift around them  — a principle I’ve carried with me long after hanging up the uniform.
North Carolina is home to one of the largest military bases — Fort Bragg — and one of the largest military and veteran populations in the country. Each November 11, communities gather to reflect on the meaning of service and what it asks of us as a society. It also reminds us of the enduring principles that guide the military and safeguard our democracy: a nonpartisan commitment to serve the nation, mutual trust between civilians and those in uniform, and a clear line between military duties and local law enforcement.
Our military strength depends on deep public trust that service members act in the interest of all Americans, rather than any single party or a politician. Upholding this principle keeps our democracy strong and ensures our armed forces are respected across all divides.
Recent actions across the nation, including here in North Carolina, threaten public trust in the military. The federal government has attempted and, in some instances, succeeded in deploying National Guard troops into major U.S. cities without the approval of state or local authorities to police civilians. These actions are now being challenged in the courts. 
Just last week, three N.C. Congress members urged Governor Josh Stein to deploy the National Guard to Charlotte, citing the federal government’s deployments in other major cities. Tasking service members with missions meant for state and local authorities — many of them politically charged — threatens the military’s nonpartisan role and risks politicizing service members. 
The same principle applies beyond the military to non-military federal authorities. When the government blurs the lines between national defense, law enforcement, and politics, it undermines both accountability and public safety. In North Carolina, for instance, bills like HB10 and HB318 require sheriffs to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, effectively pulling local law enforcement into federal immigration enforcement. This blurring of roles erodes trust between police and the communities they serve — especially among immigrant communities who may fear reporting crimes — and diverts local policing resources from essential public safety duties. Just as deploying troops for civilian policing threatens the military’s nonpartisan integrity, these laws have the same effect at the local level.
Reuniting with my classmates last weekend reaffirmed that the foundational principles of military service must be upheld at all times, especially when they are under threat. We must recommit to the principle that the military exists to uphold the Constitution and defend our democracy, not to carry out political agendas. 
Veterans, active-duty members, families and civic leaders all have a role in speaking clearly against any attempt to use the military as a tool for partisan gain. This Veterans Day, let’s honor service not only with parades, but by defending its purpose. If you’ve worn the uniform or love someone who has, speak up for policies that keep our military focused on national defense rather than domestic policing.

(Photo by Lexi Browning/West Virginia Watch)As the year winds up, it is imperative that every West Virginian takes a close look at the challenges that we faced, that we endured and that seem to only escalate, with very little reversal. It’s also important to note that so much of these unfathomable challenges did not only happen to us, but to all Americans, particularly those in rural America. Yes, change is certain, but the degree to which we experienced change this year was unprecedented, with a playbook that did not and still does not exist.
What has perhaps been most troubling is what is happening to families, particularly children. Each of us is aware of the knowledge that families, children are going hungry due to the reduction or lack of national and state funding for SNAP recipients. And what makes this atrocity even more incredulous is that it was 100% avoidable, that its political underpinnings created its cause and effect. I’m reminded a bit of the closing scene in the movie, “Crimson Tide.” As the two commanding officers aboard a nuclear missile submarine could not resolve their differences, the head of the tribunal summed it up by saying that while disaster had been averted, they had created “one helluva mess.” The film was released in 1995. Watch it again.
This year, West Virginia’s struggling economy continued, along with energy sector challenges, health care availability and accessibility, lack of affordable housing, and an education system that seems to constantly be put on the back burner, jeopardizing the future of our children. And let’s not forget the talk of data centers and the potential harm that accompanies them. Even the knowing benefits from the loss of funding for the arts contributes to a society’s downfall. And let’s not forget our aging population, noting that over a quarter of West Virginians are caregivers.
The infighting that exists and continues to escalate among those in power, both nationally and in West Virginia, is outrageous. Not working together to resolve differences will always create chaos, affecting those most vulnerable.
Both sides continue to dig their heels in deeper and deeper, until any effort to make amends to a collapsed system leaves them frozen in place, with the citizenry suffering in unimaginable ways.
As the year comes to a close, it is troubling to even suggest that capitulation might very well be the word of the year.

(Photo: John Partipilo)A Nashville judge has rejected one of the state’s legal arguments for refusing to disclose the identities of Tennessee Highway Patrol officers involved in immigration enforcement actions but asked to hear additional arguments before making a final ruling. 
The Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition, or TIRRC, filed a public records lawsuit against the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security in August, alleging the agency failed to meaningfully respond to its request for records and video footage involving officers during mass immigration sweeps in Nashville earlier this year. 
The state delayed providing video of the stops and other documents, and heavily redacted the reports it did provide to exclude a host of identifying information that “made it hard to understand what police did and why they did it,” attorneys for the nonprofit argued.
Redactions included the names and badge numbers of officers conducting traffic stops, information that is routinely released to the press and public.
State fights to keep confidential full record of THP participation in immigration enforcement

The state argued that the highly politicized nature of the immigration enforcement activities could make troopers a target of violence or harassment if their names were made public, mirroring arguments by federal officials that immigration enforcement officers need to conceal their identities to protect themselves and their families from harassment and violence. 
In his Friday order, Davidson County Chancellor Russell Perkins rejected the argument that a state “anti-hacking” statute designed to prevent disclosure and disruption of certain government electronic information applied to the records being sought. The state had argued the records sought by the nonprofit group could reveal “operational vulnerabilities” without heavy redactions.
Perkins wrote he needs to hear more on the state’s legal argument that information such as officer names and badge numbers are protected by a separate state law that withholds certain personal information of law enforcement officers from public release.
The law defines officers’ “personal information” as home addresses, cell phone numbers, and the name of day care providers an officer’s child is enrolled in. The law does not specifically cite the names of officers or their badge numbers. 
Immigrant group sues for records, footage of Nashville immigration sweeps

Attorneys for the nonprofit argued that officers’ names and badge numbers, typically displayed on officers’ uniforms, were visible during the traffic stops and do not subsequently become confidential when requested by the public.
“Redactions of any personal identifying information related to (Tennessee Highway Patrol) officers that were not publicly disclosed during the joint operation…should not be publicly disclosed,” Perkins wrote.
“That fact that material is aggregated in a public records response, however, does not convert previously disclosed information, such as badge numbers, into personal identifying information” protected by Tenenssee law, he wrote.
A date for a future hearing has not yet been set.

(Photo by Daniel Finsley/Finsley Creative for West Virginia Watch)Since last year, the city of Wheeling, West Virginia, has allowed homeless people to live in a wooded area along a trail — it’s been the only public property where it’s legal for homeless people to live after the city passed a camping ban. Next month that will change. 
City council voted last month to support City Manager Bob Herron withdrawing the site’s exempted status as of Dec. 1. According to the city’s ordinance, camping can be permitted at the city manager’s discretion. Only one council member voted against the measure. 
Councilwoman Connie Cain made the motion at a regular council meeting Oct. 21. 
“It is my opinion, and I hope that it is shared with my colleagues on city council, that providing such an outdoor area during freezing temperatures and deteriorating conditions is not in the public’s best interest and does not serve the goals of council of health safety and welfare of the community,” she said. 
On Monday, representatives of several homeless services providers from the area were at the camp, trying to help the approximately 70 people staying there get into housing or connect with other services. 
Maryanne Capp, a volunteer nurse with the homeless medical outreach organization Project HOPE, said the people she talked to Monday are intimidated by the prospect of leaving the camp and are unsure what to do. 
“It’s a short notice to get some place to go,” Capp said. “They don’t have solid plans yet, but everybody’s working really hard to try to get them to that point. I talked to several people that are trying to reach out to family to see if they can come and stay with family.”
City officials call exempted site ‘a failure’
During city council’s discussion, Wheeling Mayor Denny Magruder called the exempted camp a “failure,” for its residents and for other people who live in the neighborhood.
Others echoed support for closing the camp. 
“That camp is not a great place,” Councilman Ben Seidler said. “It is a special spot of hell and it is time to close that. Those folks deserve better and they need to be around the resources that are there. That number has increased, not decreased, so what is supposed to happen is not happening.”
Wheeling is one of dozens of cities around the country that have enacted laws prohibiting homeless people from camping on public property. The United States Supreme Court upheld a similar camping ban in Grants Pass, Oregon in June 2024. The high court ruled that the Oregon law does not violate the Constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. 
Morgantown, Parkersburg, Bluefield, Clarksburg and Princeton have camping bans. The Legislature earlier this year introduced a statewide ban that passed the House of Delegates, but not the Senate.
Opponents of camping bans say they don’t address the causes of homelessness, like a lack of affordable housing and mental illness, and make the problem worse by imposing fines and criminal penalties on unhoused people, making it more difficult for them to get into housing.
Speaking to West Virginia Watch Friday, Cain said she wants to make sure that homeless people don’t suffer frostbite in the cold this year. She said the number of homeless people in the city is growing as shelters in other parts of the state have closed. 
“They can’t be outside in the cold. It’s terrible,” she said. “And my thoughts were, let’s get them inside and then work on a plan. Because that location is not working, not only for the homeless, but for the residents and the businesses. I get calls every day. 
“So my goal is to hopefully, in the next few months, to work with some of the agencies to come up with a better plan,” Cain said. “Because this plan of free reign and nobody’s managing the camp is not working anymore.”
Cain said the city does not intend to reopen the exempted camp, at least at the same location and in the same way. She said she’d like to see the camp be managed and moved to a place that’s not near a neighborhood.
“Nobody has the answers to what we need to do or who wants to actually manage the camp,” she said. “The city is not in the rental business. We can’t be out there all day long watching the camp. There’s a lot of criminal activity.”
Cain added that she lives nearby the camp, and people leave clothes and litter in the area.
“They’re going behind the businesses and going to the bathroom,” she said. “It’s a nightmare for everyone. And I understand and I feel for the homeless, but I have to represent my ward. I have to represent the residents, the businesses. We’ve got to come to some kind of agreement somewhere, because, if not, it’s going to be like California out here. And we can’t afford that.”
City’s low barrier shelter has limited space
People leaving the exempted camp in December may have difficulty finding temporary shelter. The Life Hub operates a year-round low barrier shelter with 50 regular beds and four specialty beds in a former downtown church building. The facility is regularly filled to near capacity, said Tina Morris, one of Life Hub’s cofounders. The city has other facilities, but the availability of beds depend on a person’s circumstances — like whether they’re using drugs, facing mental health issues or fleeing domestic violence. 
The organization is working with the local fire and health departments to add 10 more beds, at least through the winter. As of Monday, they had not yet been approved for the addition. The people who stay at the exempted site are generally a different crowd than who stay in the low-barrier shelter, Morris said. 
“When the camp does close, we’ll have a little bit of space for those that want to come into the shelter, but at the shelter, it’s not a permanent housing solution,” Morris said. “So we are working with folks daily for housing options or treatment bed options or mental health bed options. Our program is designed to make sure that we could provide a handoff or next step for all the guests, and also any kind of wraparound services that they might need.”
Capp, with Project Hope, said she agrees with the city that people shouldn’t be left out in the cold, getting people into housing is not simple. Some of the people there have felony criminal records. Some don’t have an income. 
“I think the hardest part is a lot of the people have mental health issues, and they probably burn bridges with their families anyway, and that’s why they’re homeless,” she said. “Some of them don’t have ID, so they need to get into housing, but they don’t have their ID.”
She added that it’s a bad time of year for people to be out looking for another place to go. It snowed in West Virginia on Monday. 
“We gave out socks, scarves, hats, gloves and they need all that now because now they’re going to be looking,” she said. “They have to be out in the elements looking for some place to go, yeah. So it’s just never easy.”

(Bob Wick/BLM/Public domain)Colorado Democrats in Congress on Monday asked the U.S. Department of the Interior to keep in place a 2024 rule that allows federal public lands to be leased for environmental protection, which the Trump administration intends to rescind.
The Conservation and Landscape Health Rule, commonly referred to as the Public Lands Rule, directed the Bureau of Land Management to identify and support landscapes in need of restoration and created leases that focus on protecting natural areas. The BLM manages more than 8 million acres of land in Colorado.
BLM already had leasing processes in place for extractive industries including energy development, mining and livestock grazing, and the Public Lands Rule balanced those priorities with conservation efforts, rule supporters say.

U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper and U.S. Reps. Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette, Jason Crow of Aurora and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood asked Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and BLM Acting Director Bill Groffy to reverse course on a proposal to rescind the Public Lands Rule, which the Democrats say would make it easier to sell off public lands for mining and drilling. 
“The Public Lands Rule was developed to provide balance in how the BLM fulfills its multiple-use and sustained yield mission,” the letter says. “It ensures that conservation, recreation, and local input are appropriately considered alongside grazing, energy development, and other uses. The rule updates BLM management for the 21st century and puts in place important safeguards to ensure that land health is accounted for in management decisions.”
Hickenlooper led a separate letter from a larger group of Congressional Democrats asking Burgum and the BLM to end its plans to overturn the Public Lands Rule. 
Monday was the last day for members of the public to submit comments on whether they support rescinding the rule. A Center for Western Priorities analysis found that 98% of the more than 40,000 comments submitted as of Monday morning opposed the Trump administration’s plan to rescind the rule. 
Conservation groups including Rocky Mountain Wild, the Western Slope Conservation Center, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Conservation Lands Foundation support keeping the Public Lands Rule in place. More than 100 local elected officials from across Colorado also signed a letter opposing its repeal.
“In La Plata County, our public lands are the backbone of our economy and the heart of our outdoor way of life,” Matt Salka, a La Plata County commissioner, said in a statement. “We celebrated when BLM recognized that conservation of these irreplaceable landscapes deserves equal standing alongside agriculture, energy development, and other uses. We are deeply concerned to see that hard-won balance now at risk.”
The energy industry and agriculture producers support rescinding the rule, according to the DOI. Several farming and mining organizations sued the BLM challenging the rule shortly after it was implemented last year.
The Democrats said that Colorado ranchers, sportsmen, small business owners and gateway communities depend on access to healthy public landscapes, and rescinding the Public Lands Rule could “jeopardize these livelihoods by increasing the likelihood of land degradation, reduced recreational access, and economic instability for rural communities.”
The rule also strengthens the BLM’s ability to protect water resources in Colorado, the letter says, empowering land managers to make watersheds more resilient against wildfire, drought and other threats.
“Eliminating it would leave our water resources more vulnerable at a time when resiliency is urgently needed,” the letter says.

After 12 years, he called it a career and transitioned to civilian life, but he never expected to find himself homeless at 64.
Hauck received an honorable discharge in 1992. Last year, he moved to Carson, North Dakota, about 70 miles southwest of Bismarck, and was living off his monthly Social Security benefit. But after battling hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees with his bank and bouncing rent checks, he was evicted in August. And the bank closed his account, he said, which hindered his ability to open another one and access his benefits, leading him to the streets. 
“Why I survived is because of the Army, because I don’t quit,” Hauck said.
Hauck is among an increasing number of veterans experiencing homelessness in North Dakota.
In 2024, statewide and community nonprofits provided services to more than 3,800 people who were experiencing homelessness. Of those, 229 were veterans, according to the North Dakota Homeless Management Information System. 
Homelessness among veterans has seen a noticeable increase in the past couple of years, said Commissioner Lonnie Wangen, head of the North Dakota Department of Veterans Services since 2008.
A few years ago, he said the department had enough resources, beds and assistance available to veterans at the time of their requests through statewide and community groups.
“We no longer do,” Wangen said. “I thought we had it licked.”
Since August, Hauck spent three weeks at Burleigh/Morton Detention Center, having been charged with misdemeanor theft for stealing a license plate. He was also admitted to a local hospital where blood clots were discovered in his heart. When he was discharged, Hauck said he had nowhere to go and ended up at Ministry on the Margins, a zero-barrier, overnight homeless shelter in Bismarck.
“I couldn’t get a motel room because I didn’t have a damn ID,” Hauck said.
Staff at the shelter helped Hauck track down a copy of his military separation paperwork, register for primary health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs and transferred his Social Security benefits to a debit card. Hauck was also able to register for a federal housing assistance program through the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the VA.
Kris Morrissette, behavioral health manager at Ministry on the Margins, said they also worked with Community Action Partnership of North Dakota, a nonprofit specializing in low-to-moderate income clients obtaining self-sufficiency, to set Hauck up in a hotel for up to 60 days while he waits for permanent housing.
Hauck is now on a wait list for an apartment at a reduced rent of $270 per month. He and staff are hopeful he will be housed within the next month.
“It just takes a while to get all those services in place,” Morrissette said.
Hauck said he would have never been able to complete all the paperwork for the services he is now receiving without the help of the shelter staff.
“I went from hell to heaven,” Hauck said.

Earlier this year, state lawmakers authorized an additional $500,000 on top of the North Dakota Department of Veterans Services budget during the 2025 legislative session to address an uptick in veteran homelessness. Wangen said the department plans to make the funds available through a grant program that can catch veterans who may not qualify for other federal or community-based programs — those who “fall through the cracks.”
“I don’t like to see people coming back every month to help with rent,” Wangen said. “I really want to look at: How do we get them from point A to point B so they don’t have to come back?”
The homeless services provided in North Dakota include emergency shelter, rapid rehousing, transitional housing and coordinated entry services, which matches people and families to the housing program most suitable to their situation.
Dan Thorstad, chief administrator for the Department of Veterans Affairs, previously worked as a state service officer and veterans service officer for Cass County. He said one issue for veterans, or anyone facing homelessness, is North Dakota’s quick eviction timeline where landlords only need to provide a three-day notice of their intent to evict a tenant.
“You can’t get anything done in 72 hours,” Thorstad said.
If a renter falls behind on rent, he said, they are not able to find new housing until their previous balance is cleared.
“That becomes a sticking point because how do we get them housed now when they owe?” Thorstad said.
Michael Weyrauch, commander for North Dakota American Legion, said he sees higher rent prices as a barrier for veterans to find affordable housing, especially in the northwest part of the state. 
Hauck said he had a message for decision-makers in the state: homeless services need more funding and the process needs to be simplified. 
“I’ve never signed my name so many freaking times in my life,” he said. “And I thought the Army was bad.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Hauck also encouraged portable toilets and warming tents stationed in areas where homeless people gather to offer at least a shred of comfort during a difficult time.
In October, Bismarck police cited Hauck for indecent conduct, which stemmed from defecating in public.
“What’s so difficult about putting out porta potties?” Hauck said. “I don’t want to do it, but I don’t have a choice.”
Once he’s back on his feet, Hauck said he wants to help others escape homelessness like he did.
“If you kick them to the curb, then you’ve got to go and pick them up,” he said.
Wangen said any veteran struggling to find housing, or any other services, should call 988, the suicide and crisis lifeline, or 211, the information hotline for housing and other available community resources. He said FirstLink manages both helplines.
“988 will help you with anything,” Wangen said. “Financial problems, legal problems, you need food assistance, rent, all the way to your mental health issues, they can answer it and help you with legitimate resources, which is great, just the one call.”

Bill Lee and Speaker of the House Cameron Sexton are discussing expanding access to private school vouchers. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s budget outlook will determine the number of new private school vouchers the state funds in 2026, according to Gov. Bill Lee.
The Department of Education declined to make estimates during budget hearings on the amount of money it plans to spend on K-12 education for fiscal 2026-27 or the number of vouchers it expects to give out for private school enrollment. 
Lee told reporters Monday he believes K-12 education will see a funding increase but that the state has several months left to make revenue projections for large budget items, including “education freedom scholarship” spending, which provides recipients $7,300 each to enroll at private schools. Both items are funded separately. 
The state spent $144 million this year on 20,000 vouchers, as well as money for one-time teacher bonuses and funds to offset losses for public school districts whose students transferred to private schools.
House Speaker Cameron Sexton, who voted against the governor’s first voucher program for low-income students six years ago, is supporting a move to double the number of vouchers after the state received 42,000 applications for them this year. 
The law allows 5,000 vouchers to be added if the number of applications reaches at least 75% of the scholarships available the past year. But even that depends on whether lawmakers fund the increase.
Debate over private-school voucher expansion looms in Tennessee

Lee has made no secret of backing expansion, calling it a “priority,” but he hasn’t put a number with the plan.
“We had a huge demand. Tennesseans want it,” Lee said. “It’s something that we’ve understood there’s an over-subscription for, and we should do everything we can to give it to them.”
Education Commissioner Lizzette Reynolds didn’t propose a cost for the state’s K-12 education funding, which is roughly $6.9 billion this year, or the private-school voucher program during last week’s budget hearing. She declined to speak to reporters afterward. Department of Education spokesperson Ricki Collins said later the figures weren’t provided because they depend on this year’s enrollment. Even though students are three months into the school year, she said it is too early to make an estimate.
Likewise, no estimate could be made on voucher spending until a plan for funding K-12 education is made, she said.
The state is depending more than ever on sales tax revenue to fund the budget after lawmakers reduced business taxes two straight years and gave companies a tax rebate.
Sales tax collections for the first three months of this fiscal year, which started in July, exceeded projections by $49 million, nearly 2%, while corporate tax collections came in $28.6 million below estimates, 3.8% off the mark.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)For the last two years, OpenDoors has only been able to offer 15 year-round beds in its 1940s Providence rooming house for women and children without a place to stay. But that number will more than quadruple this winter, thanks to a new round of state homelessness response grants.
A total of 49 additional beds will open up starting Dec. 1 to provide temporary relief for OpenDoors clients. The beds are among a total of 281 that will be available through mid-spring 2026 funded by $1.74 million in state grants awarded to municipalities and nonprofit service providers to expand Rhode Island’s network of warming centers and homeless shelters.
“The house is large enough to house more people than we can currently staff it for,” co-Executive Director Nick Horton recently told Rhode Island Current. 
Funding will provide the beds in time for winter, according to the Oct. 30 announcement by Gov. Dan McKee.
The grants come from the state’s remaining pandemic relief aid and will support new or expanded seasonal emergency shelters operating between Nov. 1, 2025, through April 30, 2026. To qualify for the funding, shelters were required to be open at least overnight.
A little more than $1.15 million will be divided between OpenDoors and five other organizations. The remaining funds will go to warming centers that will be active during only the most severe or inclement weather.
Receiving the seasonal shelter funding are:

Community Care Alliance in Woonsocket: $404,178
Harvest Sanctuary in Woonsocket: $114,022
Hope in Jesus Ministry in Providence: $100,000
Multi-Center for All in Providence: $100,000
OpenDoors in Providence: $167,207
WARM in Westerly: $264,905

Additionally, the following were awarded funds to manage warming centers:

Crossroads RI in Providence: $99,801
Rhode Island Council of Churches: $200,000
MAE Organization in Cranston: $77,500.00
The Town of West Warwick: $94,546 
Youth Pride in Providence: $120,707

The Most Rev. Israel Mercedes of the Multi-Center for All confirmed plans to shelter 12 veterans at its Broad Street center in Providence upon renovating the building’s second floor.
The seasonal new beds will operate in addition to Rhode Island’s 1,327 year-round beds funded through a $20 million commitment made by the governor and the Executive Office of Housing in August. That gives the state a little more than 1,600 available shelter beds for Rhode Island’s unhoused population through early spring.
McKee’s administration faced criticism during a polar vortex earlier this year from homeless advocates who urged him to declare a state of emergency to open additional shelter space amid a shortage of emergency beds. But the latest grants show a “continued commitment” to helping Rhode Islanders access emergency shelters as a short-term solution to more stable, long-term housing, McKee’s office said.
“My administration’s priority is keeping our most vulnerable residents safe, especially in the coldest months,” McKee said.
Youth Pride, which provides support for LGBTQ+ youth, initially applied for a $120,707 shelter grant but was unable to meet the requirements for the funding. 
“We don’t have capacity for people to sleep,” Logan England, the organization’s director of resources and programming, said in a phone interview. 
Instead, Youth Pride will use its funding to manage a warming center at its Westminster Street headquarters in Providence where people ages 18 to 24 can grab a meal, charge their phones, and connect with a case manager who can help refer them to a shelter or other assistance.
England said the plan is to get the center up and running by Dec.1.
“We would have liked to have opened sooner, but having just gotten approved last week we couldn’t even start to order food supplies until the grant was awarded,” he said.
At OpenDoors, Horton said the grant will also allow the nonprofit to hire additional house monitors to ensure help is available around the clock. 
“They help man the door, help guests follow rules, make sure there are no people on the property who shouldn’t be there,” he said. “They’re also a friendly shoulder — they do a little bit of everything.”
When OpenDoors’ seasonal beds are ready, Horton said he expects them to fill up quickly.
“Just to be clear, people should not be calling us before Dec. 1,” he said. 
Those seeking shelter must now go through the state’s new regional access points, walk-in centers across Rhode Island set up to connect people with housing and other services.
The referral system established Oct. 1 takes over shelter placements previously made through a singular hotline via the state’s Coordinated Entry System (CES) managed by the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness.
The state’s shelter dashboard notes a total of 1,434 beds available across Rhode Island, with 76 unused as of Monday.

Lawmakers this week heard a range of possible fixes aimed at expanding access and lowering recidivism rates.
Inmates housed at facilities operated by the Virginia Department of Corrections are permitted by state law to participate in educational and vocational programs, including a “functional literacy” program for inmates testing below the 12th-grade level, adult basic education, career and technical education, and postsecondary education. However, not all prisons are required to offer inmate education.
As of February, 5,671 inmates were on waiting lists for educational programs, highlighting the demand that far surpasses DOC’s capacity, according to a report presented by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission at the direction of state lawmakers. About 40% of inmates require education to successfully reintegrate into society.
“We take this very seriously at the Department of Corrections,” said Chadwick Dotson, the agency’s director. “And again, the reason we do this is because every recidivism point we can drop, that’s one fewer victim, that’s one more father, mother raising their child. So it’s a win-win for everyone.”
Researchers found that inmates who participated in educational programs had better employment outcomes and quality of life after release than those who did not. But the demand continues to exceed the department’s capacity.
In addition to limited capacity, challenges include security staffing shortages — with vacancy rates over 20% at 16 of the 37 facilities — technology and infrastructure, and the inconsistent programming when inmates transfer between facilities.
Recommendations included better management of waitlists, improvements to GED testing processes (which dropped by 35% between 2022 and 2025), and stronger links between CTE programs and job opportunities. The discussion also emphasized the need for more funding and infrastructure upgrades to support education in prisons and jails.
Virginia currently allocates $36.8 million to adult basic education, CTE, and postsecondary education programs, which make up 2% of DOC’s $1.56 billion total budget.
Dotson told lawmakers that the agency is working to balance GED testing frequency, develop stronger employment connections, and improve technology and inmate transfers.
He said DOC is introducing new tablets to enable distance learning, expanding broadband access in facilities, and exploring an offender management system used in other states to better track and minimize disruptive transfers during coursework.
Terri Erwin, director of the Virginia Consensus for Higher Education in Prison — an initiative of the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy — said one priority is expanding access to higher education for inmates following recent changes in Pell Grant eligibility. She said about67% of people incarcerated in Virginia are academically eligible for college.
“We’d like to see a return of college programs to the prisons because they have such a dramatically beneficial effect on reducing recidivism, but also increasing employability and wages and benefits for folks who ultimately return back to society,” Erwin said.
Lawmakers could introduce related legislation when they return to Richmond on Jan. 14 for the start of the General Assembly session. The study did not include juvenile detention centers.
Meanwhile, several agencies are developing a strategic plan to expand educational opportunities for incarcerated individuals. The effort stems from House Bill 2158, carried by Del. Betsy Carr, D-Richmond, which aimed to strengthen carceral education from basic literacy through post-secondary programs but was vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. 
“We’re really excited about it, to be able to sit around the table and kind of noodle and do the math over how we fix some of the things that were referred to today, but in fact, it really requires some very pragmatic sitting around the table and figuring stuff out,” Erwin said.
Erwin said participating agencies include the State Council of Higher Education, the Department of Corrections, Virginia’s Community College System, and her own organization.
The plan could take between 10-12 months to complete.
Still, she said it was a good time for lawmakers to act. 
“We feel like it’s actually a very ripe time for legislators, there’s a lot of really good will towards expansion of educational opportunity, post secondary and generally, to build that pipeline …with the ABE and the GED, because that’s the ecosystem inside the prison,” Erwin. 
“It’s a throughput system, hopefully ending in higher education, which has the maximum increase in affecting recidivism, but also in terms of salaries, employability, but also salaries.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)After weeks of whiplash and food insecurity for about 850,000 Virginians during the nation’s longest federal government shutdown, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients appear on track to keep receiving a fraction of their benefits — at least for now.
The federal program, also known as SNAP, helps low-income families and people unable to work afford groceries. But it hasn’t been funded since the start of November, a casualty of the six-week-and-counting federal shutdown. 
The prospect of constituents going hungry spurred Gov. Glenn Youngkin to create a state-level temporary version of SNAP called the Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance, or VENA. After disbursing small allotments to Virginians last week by tapping into the state’s budget surplus, Youngkin announced over the weekend that VENA will be paused. 
Despite a court order directing President Donald Trump’s administration to utilize a contingency fund to distribute SNAP payments, the issue has been unresolved since early November. 
While the federal shutdown lingers, a partial breakthrough emerged Sunday evening. 
In a bipartisan move, seven Senate Democrats — including U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia — and one independent joined Republicans to advance legislation aimed at reopening the government and keeping funding flowing until late January.
The measure would also fully restore benefits for SNAP and other nutrition-program funding, though it must still pass the House before becoming law. 
Until Sunday’s vote, the Trump administration signaled it would partially tap into the contingency fund for SNAP, suggesting implementation could take weeks or months. Trump also wrote on social media that SNAP “will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up the government.” 
That prompted  a federal district judge to reaffirm his order, ruling the partial payment plan noncompliant. At least 20 states began lining up to issue full payments to residents as Trump filed an appeal and urged states to “undo” efforts to provide full benefits. 
Before the weekend ended, Youngkin announced that Virginia would comply with the Trump administration and pause VENA this week. He said in a news release that he expects partial federal SNAP funding  to reach people’s benefit cards by Nov. 13. 
“Our top priority has been to ensure that every Virginian facing food insecurity knows that we are doing everything in our ability to provide food assistance,” Youngkin said. “Now, based on federal guidance, we are committed to processing the federal SNAP benefits made available no later than Thursday.” 
Because VENA had already distributed about 25% of typical monthly benefits, Youngkin said the state will deliver 65% of regular monthly federal funds to eligible Virginians this month. That means Virginians will have received about 90% of their usual allotment  by the end of November. 
For Richmond residents Daniel Garratt and Asia Broadie, the start of each month is typically grocery shopping time. 
Garratt, who lives in an apartment complex for seniors and people with disabilities, said most of his Social Security income goes to rent, so SNAP has helped him keep food on the table. Broadie, a single mother juggling work with nursing school, said food “goes quick” with her growing children. She hopes to eventually earn enough not to need SNAP, but for now it gives her family peace of mind. 
While Youngkin is complying with the latest federal guidance, he is also promoting a donation page where Virginians can support their regional food banks through the Virginia Cares Initiative — which his administration has already seeded with $1 million.  
The move follows warnings from the Federation of Virginia Food Banks that its already  strained safety net can’t absorb the influx of SNAP recipients and furloughed federal workers without additional support.

Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, in May 2024. (Photo courtesy of Dan Helmer campaign)Days before the June 2024 Democratic primary for Virginia’s 10th Congressional District, allegations surfaced that Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, had sexually assaulted a woman. Helmer, who finished second in the crowded contest, later filed a defamation lawsuit claiming the allegations were false and politically motivated. 
By late October, the defendants — a group of people connected to a Northern Virginia Democratic committee — had settled the case out of court. 
In a statement, Helmer said that they couldn’t discuss the case in detail because the “terms are confidential,” but added that “the matter was settled to the satisfaction of the parties.”
The lawsuit had originally been filed against Avram Fechter, Charles King and Lissa Savaglio. Fechter and Savaglio have been involved with the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, while King has served as Savaglio’s attorney. Although Fechter and King have settled, Savaglio has not.  She was identified as the woman who allegedly accused Helmer of groping her during a 2018 event. 
In the suit that was filed in January, Helmer claimed that in May 2024, Savaglio contacted him to warn that a “grassroots activist” had asked her about rumours of sexual misconduct between the two. According to the filing, she offered no additional details at the time but allegedly said the rumors were false and called them “typical Republican tactics.” 
The suit also included screenshots of text messages purportedly between Helmer and Savaglio, as well as  an image showing her at a different event on the night of the alleged incident. 
When the story was first reported by NOTUS, a national outlet, last summer, Fechter said the incident prompted the Loudoun County Democratic Committee to adopt a new policy to prevent sexual misconduct. He also said no immediate action was taken after the alleged 2018 incident because the alleged victim was not yet willing to come forward publicly. 
It remains unclear what the terms of the settlement were, though Helmer had originally sought $15 million in damages. As Savaglio has not settled, it remains to be seen if the unresolved claims will proceed  in court — and what additional evidence either side may present.

(Getty Images)A defining New Hampshire renewable energy policy is once again facing proposed changes that opponents say would hamstring it and the state’s clean energy market.
Divided on the role of renewable energy in lowering electricity costs, the House Finance Committee voted, 14-11, Oct. 30 to recommend passage of the amended House Bill 219. The bill would alter the structure of the Renewable Portfolio Standard, which sets goals for the amount of renewable energy fed to New Hampshire’s grid and directs money into the Renewable Energy Fund. That fund, in turn, is intended to bolster new renewable energy projects statewide. 
HB 219 proposes eliminating the portfolio’s specific provisions on solar energy while indefinitely fixing the compensation rates electricity providers must pay into the Renewable Energy Fund when they do not meet renewable quotas. 
Those in favor of the proposal say it will deliver needed rate cuts to consumers by reducing the amount that utilities spend to comply with the standard. Opponents argue the proposed changes would discourage renewable development in New Hampshire, taking the wind out of a policy that defines clean energy goals and has been the target of other cuts in recent years.
The discussion reflects a larger debate about the merits of the standard and the state’s role in encouraging renewable energy development.
“The role of the (Renewable Portfolio Standard) is foundational, but attacks on its efficacy are nothing new,” said Nick Paul, director of legislative affairs with Clean Energy New Hampshire, in an interview.
Understanding the program
A renewable portfolio standard is a system through which a state can track and set goals for the proportion of clean energy used across its grid. A majority of U.S. states have established such a system, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which in 2023 listed 36 states with renewable portfolio standards or similar programs.
Under New Hampshire’s standard, which was first enacted in 2007, electricity providers are given a percentage goal for the amount of renewably generated energy they sell. That breakdown has grown year over year, with electricity providers now expected to source 25.2 percent of electricity from renewable sources.
Within that 25.2 percent, renewable energy sources are further broken down by category, and the relative amount of energy that providers are required to source from each category also changes from year to year.
If a provider cannot, or does not, purchase enough from those sources to meet the quota of renewable energy set by the Renewable Portfolio Standard, they can also meet that quota in another way: by paying into the Renewable Energy Fund in what is known as an “alternative compliance payment.” 
Those payments and the interest on the fund make up the entirety of the Renewable Energy Fund, which is administered by the New Hampshire Department of Energy.
Proposed changes
As recommended for passage by the finance committee Oct. 30, the amended HB 219 calls for changes to the overall structure of the Renewable Portfolio Standard program. 
One of those changes would diminish the emphasis put on solar in the portfolio by folding the “solar” energy subcategory, which currently stands alone, into the broader “new renewables” subcategory.
The bill would also fix rates for the payments made by utility companies in lieu of purchasing renewable electricity. Currently, the rates change over time and in relation to the cost of renewable energy.
Proponents say this will lower the financial burden on utilities of complying with the Renewable Portfolio Standard, and in turn result in decreased rates for ratepayers.
“Basically, this bill is something that we’re doing to help the high cost of electricity in New Hampshire, to help our ratepayers,” said Rep. Jose Cambrils, a Loudon Republican, at the Finance Committee meeting Oct. 30.
Speakers stressed the high electricity rates paid by New Hampshire consumers. Rep. Daniel Popovici-Muller, a Windham Republican, said he wanted to support the measure because it would reduce costs.
“If other forms of energy were cheaper, I would be more than happy to support them,” he said.
However, others said the changes would carry on a continual weakening of a central part of New Hampshire’s renewable policy.
“If we pass this bill … it will significantly weaken one of the last remaining programs we have to encourage the development of alternative sources of energy that will make us less dependent on the very volatile natural gas market,” said Rep. Chris Muns, a Hampton Democrat.
Paul said the bill as proposed would prevent the fund from bouncing back from the hit it took in the new budget, and have wider effects on the clean energy economy. In the biennial budget passed in June, lawmakers gutted the fund through 2027, sending all but $1 million annually to the General Fund.
“This bill will kill New Hampshire jobs in the long term, it will raise monthly bills for customers, and it … bakes in an incentive to avoid investing in New Hampshire,” he said. 
He criticized the fixed rates for alternative compliance payments. Over time, with no inflation indexing, he expects the payments to become cheaper than paying for renewably generated electricity — a difference that could encourage providers to simply pay the fee, rather than pay for actual clean energy. And he also disagreed that lowering penalties would translate naturally into lower rates for customers.
“Cutting the cap on a penalty is not the same as cutting the cost of electricity,” he said.
Folding in solar
The elimination of a standalone solar subcategory was another concern for Paul, who said it would muddy the solar energy market in the short term and have negative effects on renewable energy broadly in the long term.
This is due, in part, to how the electricity from distributed solar generation (meaning, for example, solar panels at a customer’s home) is tallied. 
Most larger renewable generators in New Hampshire, and many residential generators, register with the Department of Energy to certify the energy they produce. A registered facility can sell a “renewable energy certificate” for a set amount of electricity they have generated. These certificates, then, are the commodity that electric providers purchase to certify that they have paid for a given amount of renewably generated electricity, and in doing so, certify that they have complied with the Renewable Portfolio Standard.
But not all generators become certified, so not all eligible renewable generators sell renewable energy certificates. This includes many homeowners with solar panels. To account for those homes, the Department of Energy allows electricity providers to count a proportion of the unregistered but net metered generation on their network as a credit toward their annual solar total without purchasing renewable energy certificates from generators.
Folding solar in with other categories would add those previously unaccounted, free “swept” certificates into the market, artificially lowering the price paid for clean energy in New Hampshire, said Clean Energy New Hampshire Executive Director Sam Evans-Brown in an email.
Paul said this might lower the costs of alternative compliance payments in the short-term, but disagreed that this would lead to a long-term reduction in the cost of electricity for ratepayers, as proponents of the bill argue.
Renewable Energy Fund access has narrowed with time
As the ultimate landing place for compliance payments, the Renewable Energy Fund is where financial consequences to changes in the Renewable Portfolio Standard show up first. The fund has supported projects across the state for years, although observers have previously criticized the Department of Energy for, they said, chronically underspending Renewable Energy Fund dollars and accumulating the large surplus that was later targeted in the budget.
Over the course of fiscal year 2025, Renewable Energy Fund dollars were awarded through several programs, including about $1 million across four solar projects that will lower rates for low- and moderate-income communities, $185,006 for residential clean energy rebates, and $486,078 for commercial/industrial renewable energy projects, according to a Nov. 1 report released by the New Hampshire Department of Energy. About $876,000 from the fund is reported as spent on administrative costs during fiscal year 2025. In all, $3,547,368 in Renewable Energy Fund dollars was expended from the fund during that period, while the fund recorded revenues including $4,428,851 in compliance payments and just short of $1 million in interest, according to the report.
Fewer channels to access Renewable Energy Fund dollars are available to residents today than in years past. The residential solar rebate program was eliminated in 2024, leaving only the wood pellet furnace and boiler rebate program available to residential customers.
A grant program also administered through the Renewable Energy Fund, though technically still offered, was also quiet in its most recent cycle. The department issued a “request for proposals” for non-residential grants in October 2024, and received 11 responses requesting a total of $1,600,000, according to the report. However, the department later rescinded the request and did not award funding to any of the projects that had applied.
Chris Ellms, department deputy commissioner, said in an email Nov. 6 that none of the applicants’ projects had scored high enough to “justify moving forward.”
The prior funding year, the Department of Energy funded four projects, disbursing a total of $1,600,000, according to the report. Since 2011, the competitive grant program has funded a total of 56 nonresidential renewable energy projects in the state, disbursing a total of $16,380,154. The first year in which no project was funded was 2024; over the preceding 13 years, the department funded an average of 4.3 projects each year, disbursing an average of $1,260,212 per year.
Another $250,000 from the Renewable Energy Fund was transferred to the Department of Environmental Services, according to the report. The transfer was directed by the state budget, Ellms said.
The shrinking Renewable Energy Fund means less incentive for developers to site renewable projects in New Hampshire, according to Paul, setting New Hampshire up to continue relying on expensive outside sources — like imported natural gas — for electric generation.

(Getty Images.)Ohio House lawmakers approved several property tax reforms in recent weeks, and now state senators are debating those proposals.
One of the measures is already on its way to the Senate floor. Another four are still working their way through committees.
Following last Wednesday’s session, Senate President Rob McColley promised action and laid out a brisk timeline.
“We will be passing those, in all likelihood here this month, before we’re done this month,” he said.
“Which ones rise to the top, which one’s pass, and in what form, we’ll see. But I think there’s a desire among the caucus to try and see that stuff get across the finish line.”
Flipping the script
State senators advanced a measure out of committee last week which gives county auditors greater control over the home valuation process.
County auditors reappraise homes on a six-year cycle.
But midway through, they adjust those values based on a statistical sample, known as the triennial update.
Under current law, state tax officials review the auditor’s work, and if they disagree, they can order an auditor to adjust valuations.
The auditor can appeal that decision, but they carry the burden of proof.

Ohio House Bill 124, known colloquially as the “flip the script” bill, puts the onus on tax officials.
Instead of an auditor appealing, they’re given the benefit of the doubt, and tax officials can appeal if they believe the auditor got it wrong.
Lake County Auditor Chris Galloway said that’s as it should be.
“County auditors are in the best position to determine which sales are valid within their counties,” he said.
There are several instances where local knowledge matters.
A home sale between John Smith and Jane Doe looks normal on paper, Galloway said, but the auditor might know they’re siblings.
Since it’s not an arm’s length sale it shouldn’t be included.
Other sales could be outliers, due to renovation for instance, and they’d skew the formula for other homes.
The measure “allows for these kinds of inaccuracies to be corrected,” Galloway said. “This creates a fairer and more accurate valuation process for all taxpayers.”
No one testified against the proposal, and it passed out of committee unanimously.
What counts?
Ohio House Bill 129 would count more levies toward what’s known as the 20-mill floor.
Property taxes are collected in mills — like a percentage but calculated out of 1,000 instead of 100.
Twenty mills is the equivalent of 2%.
Since the 1970s, Ohio law has reduced homeowners’ tax rates to keep a levy’s revenue steady.
It means taxing authorities get only what voters approved even if home values climb.
But there’s an important caveat: School funding can’t dip below 20 mills, so if home values rise high enough there’s no more room for reductions.
Meanwhile, certain taxes like emergency and substitute levies are set aside from that 20-mill calculation.
By including them, the legislation creates slack, allowing tax rates to come down further.
School officials didn’t even push back on the idea.
“We are not here to disagree with whether these levies should be counted toward the floor,” Paul Imhoff from the Buckeye Association of School Administrators explained.
Instead, they want lawmakers to allow districts to renew those levies at the ballot rather than starting over with new ones.
That’s because back in 2014, lawmakers stopped paying a 12.5% state share for any new levies.
“In effect, homeowners would face a tax increase for the same amount of school revenue,” Imhoff said. “Put simply, House Bill 129 would have homeowners pay more for the same.”
That state share, known as the ‘rollback,’ accounts for roughly $96 million in school revenue across the state.
And in some districts, Imhoff said, the levies that stand lose state funding account for as much as a third of operating revenue.
Committee chair, state Sen. Sandra O’Brien, R-Ashtabula, seemed unmoved.
She said the state stepped in to help, “really out of their goodness,” but the total cost of the rollback isn’t that significant.
“Over all of the taxpayers, it’s going to be so minute no one’s going to even notice it,” she said. “So, I think maybe that could be a little bit disingenuous when you keep calling that a tax increase or losing tax dollars.”
Who really set rates?
The Ohio Constitution gives local governments the right to levy 10 mills of property tax, but every levy beyond that amount requires voter approval.
Ohio House Bill 309 would give county budget commissions, made up of the local auditor, treasurer and prosecutor, the authority trim those voted levies after the fact if they’re deemed unnecessary or excessive.
Policy Matters Ohio Research Director Zach Schiller said that’s “fundamentally undemocratic.”
The bill’s backers point to school districts on the 20-mill floor.
Because their tax rates haven’t been able to drop, their tax bills have risen with home values.
Supporters argue that subverts the will of the voters by increasing taxes without their approval.
“Yet here is a bill that would allow voter decisions to be overridden,” Schiller said.
After some last-minute tweaks in the House, the measure includes explicit definitions for “unnecessary” and “excessive” collections, as well as a five-year safe harbor for new levies.
But there is no safe harbor, Schiller noted, for renewal levies.
That means even if lawmakers maintain the rollback, county budget commissions could immediately reduce a levy renewed at the ballot.
Pounding his fist on the lectern, Schiller said he’d heard complaints about ‘unvoted’ levies “dozens and dozens and dozens of times.”
“So, if we’re going to respect the voters,” he said, “if we’re going to say that voters have to have the power, why are we going to pass a bill that expressly takes that power away from the voters?”
Even the typically tax-allergic Buckeye Institute gestured toward additional guardrails as it expressed its support.
Research fellow Greg Lawson warned lawmakers may need to ensure, “levies remain high enough to satisfy their original purposes and over-zealous commissioners do not substitute their personal tax-cutting preferences for the will of the voters.”
Lawson noted possibilities like specific metrics for “excess” and limits on the time period or amount of tax cuts.
That said, he continued, “the need for those manageable safeguards should not preclude the bill’s enactment.”

Setting the ceiling
Ohio’s constitutionally permitted 10 mills of property tax is known as ‘inside’ millage, while any other levies approved by voters are known as ‘outside’ millage.
A pair of bills would cap the increase of both kinds of millage at the rate of inflation in the broader economy.
The measure related to outside millage, Ohio House Bill 186, would affect the roughly two-thirds of school districts at the 20-mill floor.
Ohio’s longstanding program that lowers rates to hold taxes steady would control taxes in the remaining districts.
Auditor Galloway from Lake County said providing an inflationary cap “eliminates the single largest unvoted tax increase in Ohio history.”
And Elizabeth Baumgartner from the Ohio Chamber of Commerce warned rising property taxes discourages businesses interested in moving to Ohio and those that want to expand.
She explained a chamber-backed study found Ohio’s property taxes were 72% higher than in six peer states.
State Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, agreed that Ohio’s property taxes are high, but dug a bit deeper.
He described a study his office conducted of income, sales and property taxes in ten nearby states.
Ohio came in near the top for property and sales taxes, but dead last in income tax for high earners.
“We’ve continued to whittle down one of those three legs of the stool to the point where now we’ve created an imbalance,” he said.
“Whereas if you look at Pennsylvania and Michigan, states next to us, very similar to us in terms of economy, population, etc., all three of their categories are in the bottom half.”
Because Ohio’s rate reduction program doesn’t apply to inside millage, those taxes have always grown with property values.
Galloway stressed that by capping inside millage at inflation, as well, lawmakers would affect property taxes statewide.
“House Bill 335 provides relief for all,” he said, noting the overall savings for homeowners amounts to roughly $700 million.
Galloway’s only suggestion was for lawmakers to include an emergency clause so the bill takes effect before auditors begin their next round of valuations.
Smith asked if time is short, why not delay implementation until the next tax year so auditors have time to prepare?
“Yes,” Galloway said, “it would potentially be easier on our offices to have an entire year to put all this together and manage it — a certain comfort level. But I would suggest that our taxpayers don’t have that comfort level.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)In their competition for rural health care dollars from a new federal fund, states are seeking money to bolster emergency services, address chronic diseases, and recruit and train more doctors and nurses.
All 50 states submitted their applications to the federal government last week to get shares of the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program.
Congress created the program in response to concern from rural health care providers — as well as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle — about the effects of Medicaid cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed this summer.
A Stateline analysis of 10 states’ applications to the Rural Health Transformation Program found common focus areas, including expanding mobile health care access and bolstering emergency medical services. States also focused on chronic disease prevention programs, technological advancements and rural clinician recruitment.
Racial health disparities could widen as states grapple with Trump cuts, experts warn

Stateline examined proposals from states that had large rural populations or had released their proposals. Missouri, North Carolina and Oklahoma are among a dozen states that have expanded Medicaid and would be hardest hit by rural Medicaid cuts — each seeing at least $4.5 billion in reductions over 10 years. The other states whose proposals were examined are: Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Washington state and West Virginia.
Rural health care leaders told Stateline that states had to rush to develop the pitches. After the official funding notice was announced by the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), states had about seven weeks to put together their applications. Many held listening sessions with hospitals, clinics and community members, and opened public comment periods to help inform priorities. Others created advisory or working groups.
State officials and medical groups said the federal infusion of money is welcome, but isn’t enough to offset billions in Medicaid losses, and won’t be a magic bullet to solve a structural problem: a health care payment system that favors patient volume and doesn’t work for sparsely populated rural America. The new law cuts $911 billion from Medicaid over the next decade — with rural communities slated to lose about $137 billion, according to health policy research group KFF. The new rural health program could offset just over a third of cuts in rural areas, KFF estimates.
“It’s going to be a Band-Aid,” Toniann Richard, CEO of HCC Network, which runs six Missouri rural community health clinics, said about the grants. “How do we make sure that it’s not just a one-time Band-Aid — that it’s maybe a waterproof Band-Aid?”
More than 700 hospitals — roughly a third of rural U.S. hospitals — are at risk of closing because of financial problems, while rural labor and delivery units struggle to stay open and residents grapple with higher rates of chronic illness but live far from care.
Half of the Rural Health Transformation Program — $25 billion — will be distributed equally to states with approved applications, regardless of each state’s proportion of rural hospitals or population. The remaining half will be allocated by CMS based on the number of rural residents and rural health facilities in a state, as well as the state’s spending plans and policies, among other factors. CMS said it will decide on applications by the end of the year.
From mental health to tech innovation
CMS outlined priorities for the program, with each state developing its own approach to fulfilling them. Those include technological improvements, an expanded and sustainable workforce, new ways of coordinating care and chronic disease prevention. Rural residents are more likely to die early from conditions such as heart disease. Some states proposed new screening or telehealth initiatives for those conditions.
Helping rural areas keep clinicians also was a focus across the grant proposals. Several states said they would use funds to expand rural residencies and apprenticeships for medical school graduates to try to draw more providers to their areas.
Every rural and low-population Colorado county contains areas considered EMS deserts, the state said, proposing $45 million to $55 million over the next five years to expand rural EMS.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

Colorado and other states proposed increasing remote patient monitoring for rural patients living far from care. That’s a form of telehealth that helps doctors track patients’ health while they’re at home, such as through devices to monitor weight, blood pressure or blood sugar levels that send results digitally to clinicians. Doctors can then monitor for unmanaged blood sugar or sudden weight gain and discuss a plan with patients without “forcing folks to have to drive into the clinic,” said Michelle Mills, CEO of the Colorado Rural Health Center, the state’s nonprofit rural health office.
Overdose and suicide rates are often higher in rural communities; behavioral and mental health were addressed in several state applications.
West Virginia has the highest rate of opioid overdose deaths. The state released a grant proposal summary that has little information on mental health and drug use initiatives, but says addiction treatment would be “enhanced” to support a “drug-free workforce.”
North Carolina said it would grow community mental health clinics and integrate behavioral health within “regional care networks.” Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota and Washington also proposed initiatives focused on rural behavioral health care access or suicide prevention.
New Mexico proposed establishing a grant program that would allow rural communities to apply for and create pilot projects tailored to their own specific needs, and a program for specialists to consult with each other across the state. The state also proposed $363 million toward specialty care and chronic disease management for high-risk rural groups, including planning regionalized “specialty and maternal care networks.”
West Virginia said it would create a new rural transportation system that would fund rideshare and other transportation services, as well as coordinate with EMS and hospitals to more efficiently transport rural patients to care.
States are also taking varied approaches on how they would split the funds or connect care among regions. For example, Missouri and North Carolina would divide states into regional rural “hubs,” to target different communities’ needs. Missouri would integrate rural clinics, pharmacies and public health agencies by coordinating care for patients and sharing data.
Heidi Lucas, executive director of the Missouri Rural Health Association, advised the state on its application. One advantage of that regional model, she said, is that it allows low-income community health centers — also called federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) — to take the lead in specific regions that don’t have hospitals.










We've been screaming for decades about the need for money just like this to come in — but it's under the cloud of all of the other cuts that are coming, potentially with Medicaid.


– Heidi Lucas, executive director of the Missouri Rural Health Association


“In the southeast corner of the state, we’ve had multiple hospital closures, and so there, the FQHC is the only provider,” Lucas said.
“We’ve been screaming for decades about the need for money just like this to come in — but it’s under the cloud of all of the other cuts that are coming, potentially with Medicaid. … Knowing that that freight train is coming at us over the next decade,” she continued.
Oklahoma hasn’t provided details about its application. But Rich Rasmussen, president of the Oklahoma Hospital Association, said his team likewise proposed the state create a network of regional rural hospital hubs, through which hospitals could apply for resources. Each hub would have funding pools that could help pay for a range of services, from help for indigent patients to data services and workforce support.
North Dakota’s application said nearly 75% of its rural counties lack enough primary care clinicians. The state proposed retention and recruitment grants meant to incentivize practitioners to stay in rural areas, expanding rural housing and rotations for clinicians in training, and offering on-site child care at rural health facilities. It also aims to target maternal health care deserts by training EMS workers to better respond to rural maternal health emergencies.
New Mexico, North Dakota and Washington proposed specific initiatives to support rural tribal communities. For example, North Dakota wants to revamp electronic health records systems in tribal communities, as many rural, underfunded tribal health facilities use outdated systems that make it harder to transfer and access patient records.
Democratic state Rep. Jayme Davis is a member of the state’s Rural Health Transformation Committee, a group of lawmakers that recommended draft state legislation based on the grant application. She said she helped advocate for tribal communities’ needs. Native people make up about 5% of North Dakota’s population.
“I have an elderly parent and aunts and uncles, and going to Fargo is a strain on them,” she said of her family, who live in Rolette, 3 1/2 hours from Fargo.
Maryland’s plan is divided into three initiatives: recruiting and training new rural health providers and students; creating more sustainable ways for patients to access care, such as mobile health care units dedicated to each rural region; and nutrition and food programs that connect local farm harvests with rural hunger “hot spots.”
Hospitals’ concerns
Health care officials in several states said they worry that the new program will not be enough to offset looming Medicaid cuts.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

In Oklahoma, about 63% of rural hospitals are at risk of closure, and more than a quarter are at immediate risk. Ahead of the grant application, the state’s hospital association provided financial vulnerability assessments of the hospitals to help inform the state’s application priorities.
Rasmussen, of the Oklahoma hospital association, said one of his biggest concerns is the new law’s decrease of state-directed payment programs have helped struggling hospitals offset low reimbursement rates.
“It’s the rural hospitals that took the cuts by Congress,” he said, noting that over the next decade, Oklahoma would lose $6.7 billion due to Medicaid cuts. “Whatever our state receives is not going to come anywhere close to offsetting those costs.”
The rural grant program restricts how awarded funds can be spent. Dollars allocated to states must be used for specific purposes, meaning states cannot dole out direct funds to rural hospitals or rural clinics. For example, funds can’t be used for new construction and services already reimbursable by programs such as Medicaid.
CMS has also put limits on how much can be used for each approved purpose. There is a 15% cap on how much of the award can go directly to providers.
“That cap is fairly low from a lot of folks’ perspective,” said Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer of the National Rural Health Association, which represents rural health care providers. “It is in no way direct payments to rural hospitals or rural clinics, and it’s not even necessarily a guarantee in every state that those entities will be receiving funding, although I would hope so, given the general intent of the program.”
Weatherford Regional Hospital in western Oklahoma is the only critical access hospital still delivering babies in the state, according to the Oklahoma Hospital Association.
“For our hospital, we barely make a profit,” said Darin Farrell, president and CEO of the hospital, who added that he worries his facility won’t be able to maintain obstetrics after Medicaid cuts down the line. “If they don’t put something else to fill the gap of those cuts that are coming, then we’re all going to have to decide what services are the most vital.”
In West Virginia, more than half of the population lives in a rural area and about a dozen rural hospitals are at risk of closure, according to a report by the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. Jim Kaufman, president and CEO of the West Virginia Hospital Association, which met with Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s office to provide feedback ahead of the application deadline, said the fund will not be enough to offset Medicaid cuts.
“We’re estimating we’re going to lose more than a billion dollars once all the cuts are fully implemented, just from the hospitals in West Virginia,” he said. “So while this rural health application does provide some opportunity to look at transforming rural health care, it will not replace the dollars that the hospitals are losing alone.”

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Both the whistleblower and the startup investment firm she accused of corruption testified last week during the civil trial regarding the alleged scandal inside the retired teachers’ pension fund board.
Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Karen Held Phipps is set to decide whether or not she should remove State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) board chair Rudy Fichtenbaum from his position, and if he and former board member Wade Steen should be banned from ever returning to public pensions.
The scandal centers on Steen and Fichtenbaum and their relationship with startup investment firm QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel.
This case began with a whistleblower letter sent to government officials in May of 2024. That month, the governor received a 14-page memo alleging a massive public corruption scheme brewing and moving quickly within STRS.
In 2020, Metcalf and Tremmel set their eyes on STRS, according to the document.
The documents claim that they — despite having no clients and no track record — tried to convince STRS members to partner with them and provide them with $65 billion.
Steen and Fichtenbaum had allegedly been bidding continuously, pitching QED’s direct documents to board members and proclaiming the company’s talking points to other staff.
Soon after, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost filed a lawsuit to remove Steen and Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract-steering “scheme” that could benefit them.
Yost started the investigation after the memo, now known as being prepared by STRS employees, alleged that Steen and Fichtenbaum had been bidding on QED.
The AG states that they should be punished because they broke their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and trust when “colluding” with QED.
STRS Chief Legal Counsel Stacey Wideman testified on the stand, confirming that she and another colleague wrote the whistleblower letter.
Wideman, who has worked at the pension fund for more than a decade, started drafting her concerns years ago, she said.
“Our intention over the course of this, starting in 2021, was to document these unusual kinds of unprecedented things that were occurring at STRS that caused us to believe that the teachers’ money could be at risk,” Wideman said.
Metcalf took the stand, explaining how he got involved with QED after believing that STRS was not being honest with the investment reports and subsequently, bonuses to staff.
“I was concerned that STRS investment mismanagement had resulted in a decrease in benefits to Ohio teachers,” Metcalf said.
The state said that Metcalf worked behind the scenes to try to secure a $65 billion deal.
Wideman pointed out concerns that Steen and Fichtenbaum were too close to Metcalf.
Communications obtained via a records request of a court filing reveal that QED associates consistently told then-board member Steen what questions to ask, gave him documents to propose, and pushed him to follow its plan.
“I am writing content as though I am Mr. Steen,” Metcalf said during cross-examination.
The defense said getting advice isn’t a crime, but the state asked if getting advice meant sharing confidential documents with Metcalf.
“Staff often stamp things confidential that I did not believe was confidential,” Steen said.
When asked by the judge if he ever confirmed it wasn’t confidential, Steen said no.
But with Steen already off the board, his team argues that this case is meaningless. But for Wideman, it isn’t.
Fichtenbaum told us in mid-2024 that he would be open to still considering a deal with QED.
“I don’t think we were really, ever even given a fair shot at trying to articulate and explain why we thought this was something that was worthwhile looking into,” Fichtenbaum said about QED in 2024.
Asked if he was still considering QED, he responded, “I don’t know at this point.”
“I think that the idea that they had about earning fees is not a bad idea.”
He was asked again if he would choose QED.
“I think that — would it be worth having somebody vetting that idea and looking at it?” he responded, shrugging.
“I think we should always be looking for ways to try and make money with and take less risk for the pension.”
As we have continued the dozens of reports on the topic, our investigation in September 2024 revealed that STRS was, once again, moving to hire a firm that allegedly lacked experience and personal ties to the board leaders, according to senior staff.
After our report, the board chose not to move forward with the firm that has been the subject of my investigations.
Wideman said her intent in sending the letter was to ask for help investigating why QED was “still lingering at STRS years after failing due diligence.”
Each side is drafting its written closing arguments, and the judge will rule in the next couple of months.

(Photo by Lord Henri Voton/E+ via Getty Images)My friend with whom I serve on a nonprofit board works for the military as a social worker. She said that the military has gone through a difficult time during the government shutdown. She truly cares about those who serve our country and their precious families. She is their advocate.
The shutdown affected millions of Americans and many, many Kansans. The pain of loss is great, and the trauma is great. As I drive down the road each day, the anger and grief in people’s eyes is apparent. There has already been so much loss and tumult and change and trauma. With everything going on in our nation, it’s difficult to find hope.
Just look at the federal workers. They may have a job today but maybe not tomorrow. It’s all very sad to me.
Alan Wolfelt is a grief counselor in Colorado who has written numerous books on change and loss. Valeo Behavioral Health Care offered an educational class about one of his books on grief taught by Shelley Endsley. About 10 people came together to learn and to heal from trauma. We discussed the pain of losing a parent, a partner, job loss, relationship loss — you name it, we discussed it. Shelley did a fabulous job facilitating the group. We even had snacks, with fruit and bagels. It was a gift.
How do we heal the soul of America, and how do we heal the spirit of Kansas?
How do we learn how to be kind to one another during such grief-ridden times? I would say find solace in the little things — buying someone’s McDonald’s breakfast, taking groceries to a senior neighbor who can’t leave home. It doesn’t take much. We need to get creative and reach out. As the golden rule states, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” The task is clear: Dare to be kind in a hateful world.
I grew up in the 1980s, and one of the great eighties movies was The NeverEnding Story. It’s about a boy who loses his mom and is bullied at school. He reads a book that opens him up to his imagination. He learns to find hope and healing from the pain of being bullied and the loss of his mom. Perhaps that is an idea for us. We can open a beloved book, where we can lose ourselves and take heart. Books can help heal our hurts. Books can shine light in a dark world.
We can also find inspiration through music. I love the song, “Viva la Vida” by Coldplay. Chris Martin sings about how he used to be powerful in the world but now he has been humbled. I can relate. I feel like I used to be on top of my game, and now I am just hanging in there. That song gives me comfort.
Here’s the point: There is hope in times like these. It may seem like the end is near. However, through kindness to others, reaching out, reading inspiring books, listening to inspiring music and so much more, we can help heal our wounds of loss and trauma.
I’m not trying to be emotional, but we all have felt a little hurt these days. Let’s not give up. Let’s hold each other up and move forward one step at a time.

(Photo from NASA Glenn Research Center website.)As a physics professor at Ohio State University, I’ve written a few op-eds this year to explain how decision making in Washington has thrown a serious wrench into the career plans of a generation of young scientists both nationally and in Ohio. 
I’ve worked with reporters to highlight the cancellation threat to nearly complete projects like the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which professors and students in Ohio State’s Department of Astronomy have been working on for over a decade.
Now I am speaking out because the federal government has been shut down since a funding lapse began on October 1. 
As a scientist it is not my mission to explain why we’ve reached this point or what it will take to climb out of it. 
But I can explain that when the government shuts down, many federal employees have to stay home, and this includes scientists at government labs and staff members at science funding agencies who help keep America’s science and technology machine going.
Ohio is a scientific powerhouse.

We have an Air Force R&D presence larger than any other state that is housed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. 
Further north we have the NASA Glenn research center, which is where every new NASA satellite is sent for testing. 
In Columbus, Ohio State University received nearly $800 million in federal research grants last year, and the Battelle Institute is no less connected to federal funding sources and research.
The shutdown has had an immediate impact on regularly scheduled meetings between government scientists and university researchers. 
In my research group, meetings with research scientists at Wright Patterson AFB to discuss experiments funded by the Air Force Office of Science Research haven’t happened since September. 
Another OSU physics professor’s collaboration with the Air Force to develop secure quantum communications has been interrupted. 
In many cases, the projects being impacted and the government workers being furloughed don’t depend on the current budget negotiations in congress.
My colleagues in the biological sciences are perhaps even more profoundly affected. 
In Ohio alone, the National Institute of Health (NIH) funds over a billion dollars of medical and biological research projects each year. 
With NIH staffers furloughed, this creates problems for researchers trying to run existing projects. 
And the funding of new NIH projects is delayed because long-planned “scientific merit reviews” are indefinitely postponed. 
It is hard to find the right metaphor for this disruption, but imagine if OSU announced that its annual Pelotonia fund raiser might be cancelled next year. 
This would jeopardize something like $26 million dollars of continued funding to advance projects towards improving cancer care. 
Now imagine if, instead of $26 million dollars, like the Pelotonia raised last year, it typically brought in 25 times as much, and imagine this uncertainty affecting every major medical research center in the country. 
This begins to communicate the mess that the impasse in Congress is producing.
Scientists are not interested in debating who’s suffering the most from the shutdown. 
If the Trump administration uses the shutdown to justify further “reductions in force” at scientific agencies, or if funding interruptions prompt universities to close research labs, and scale back Ph.D. programs, what is there to gain by comparing this chaos to anything?
 Careers to advance the scientific expertise of our country are being ruined.
I wish I could say that the threat to the enterprise of American science was theoretical in some way, but these times give me no such luxury.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Bumping all the way up against her deadline to decide what congressional boundaries will govern Utah’s 2026 elections, 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson issued a key decision in the state’s court-ordered redistricting battle late Monday. 
In her ruling, Gibson overwhelmingly sided with the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the Utah Legislature, blocking the Republican-controlled Legislature’s map C from being used in the 2026 elections while instead approving one of the plaintiffs’ submitted alternatives, known as Map 1. 
The Legislature’s map, she wrote, “fails in many ways to comply with Proposition 4,” a 2018 voter-approved law establishing an independent redistricting process and neutral map-drawing criteria.

“In sum, the record overwhelmingly supports the Court’s conclusion that Map C exhibits substantial pro-Republican bias,” the judge wrote in the 89-page ruling. 
Her order came at about 11:40 p.m. Monday, minutes before midnight on the day the state’s top election officials said would be the latest possible date to set a congressional map in order to give county clerks enough time to prepare for candidate filings in January.
The judge’s selection gives Democratic candidates a good chance at one of Utah’s U.S. House seats in next year’s midterm elections, at a time when redistricting shuffles are playing out around the country and both major parties are pulling for the majority.
Utah House and Senate Democratic lawmakers issued a prepared statement after midnight reacting to the ruling with “a deep sense of hope and relief.”
“This is a win for every Utahn,” the statement said. “We took an oath to serve the people of Utah, and fair representation is the truest measure of that promise.”
Gibson, in a ruling earlier this summer, voided Utah’s last congressional map that the Utah Legislature set in 2021. In that decision, the judge ruled their map was the result of an unconstitutional process after lawmakers that year undid a 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative known as Proposition 4, which established an independent redistricting commission and neutral map-drawing criteria meant to guard against gerrymandering. 
To replace the 2021 map in time for the 2026 elections, Gibson ordered a “remedial” court process, giving the Utah Legislature and the plaintiffs suing state officials the opportunity to submit map proposals for her to pick from. She also restored Proposition 4 as law. 
In a special session last month, the GOP-controlled Utah Legislature voted “under protest” to submit a map known as map C — one that Utah Republican Party leaders urged their members to support as the least damaging option. 
Democrats argued that map C was the worst choice — especially when paired with a bill, SB1011, that the Legislature also voted to approve to require the state’s next congressional maps (including the one picked by Gibson) to pass three statistical tests meant to bar the maps from favoring one party over another. 
Those tests (particularly one known as the partisan bias test) were problematic to use in a “lopsided” state like Utah, the plaintiffs argued, where active registered Republicans (916,236) outnumber Democrats (238,979) statewide by more than 677,000 voters. Republicans, however, argued in favor of codifying the three tests to clarify “vague” language in Proposition 4 and use their “discretion” to decide the “best available data and scientific methods” to use in evaluating maps, as Proposition 4 requires. 
That prompted the plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit — which include the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, the Campaign Legal Center and a handful of Salt Lake County voters — to file another complaint in court. 
Redistricting plaintiffs: Judge has ‘no choice’ but to void Utah Legislature’s map, pick another

They urged Gibson to block SB1011, alleging it “cherry picks” flawed statistical tests for states like Utah while accusing Utah lawmakers of again passing a law that “impaired” Proposition 4, therefore violating their right to alter and reform their government through a ballot initiative. 
Gibson, in her ruling, agreed with plaintiffs’ arguments on SB1011 too — and preliminarily blocked it from taking effect. 
“Map C does not abide by Proposition 4’s traditional redistricting criteria ‘to the greatest extent practicable,’” Gibson wrote. “And, based on the evidence presented, the Court finds that Map C was drawn with the purpose to favor Republicans — a conclusion that follows from even S.B. 1011’s metric for partisan intent — and it unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.”
By granting the preliminary injunction, SB1011 “is not the governing law for this remedial proceeding,” Gibson ruled.
Leading up to Monday night’s ruling, Gibson listened to more than 15 hours of testimony and fielded over 1,000 pages of evidence submitted by attorneys for the Legislature and the plaintiffs, each side citing competing redistricting experts in their arguments over why the judge should pick their preferred maps. 
While alleging map C fell short of adhering to Proposition 4, the plaintiffs submitted two other map options for the judge to consider. 
The plaintiffs’ Map 1, they said, came from a set of 10,000 maps “generated by a computer algorithm designed to comply with Proposition 4’s priority-ordered redistricting criteria without considering partisan data.” It splits only one city (Midvale) and “has a significant population overlap” with the Orange and Purple maps proposed by the Independent Redistricting Commission in 2018. 
Utah Legislature picks congressional map supported by Republican party

The plaintiffs also described their proposed Map 2 as a “least change” map based on the Legislature’s adopted map C but with “changes made to correct its failures to conform to Proposition 4’s requirements,” splitting only one city (Pleasant Grove). 
From the other corner, legislative attorneys argued that lawmakers’ map C complied with Proposition 4’s ranked criteria, which prioritizes minimization of city and county splits first while also requiring prioritization of other redistricting principles like compactness, contiguity, respecting traditional neighborhoods and communities of interest, and following geographic features. 
Map C split three cities (Millcreek, North Salt Lake and Pleasant Grove) into 11 pieces and three counties (Salt Lake, Utah and Weber counties) into seven pieces. The plaintiffs’ maps each split one city into two pieces (Map 1 split Midvale while Map 2 split Pleasant Grove) and three counties into six pieces (Salt Lake, Utah and Weber counties, in both maps). 
Gibson, in her ruling Monday, sided with the plaintiffs’ arguments that the Legislature’s map did not comply with Proposition 4, was drawn with consideration of partisan political data, violated Proposition 4’s ban on partisan gerrymandering, and unduly favored the Republican Party over the Democratic Party. 
While Utah’s Republican legislative leaders have said they don’t think the judge would have the constitutional authority to pick another map other than Map C, Gibson wrote in her decision that state and federal courts have supported court-ordered redistricting processes when legislatures fail to enact legal maps.

“This Court approaches this task somewhat reluctantly,” Gibson wrote. “But this is the remedial process recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court and by other state courts, agreed to by the parties in this case, and ordered by the Court. Based on the evidence — and after an evidentiary hearing — the Court found that Map C does not comply with Proposition 4’s requirements.”
To ensure “Utahns cast ballots under a congressional map that is equally apportioned under both federal and state constitutional requirements and that otherwise complies with Utah’s law on redistricting in Proposition 4,” Gibson said she must now choose a congressional map by the Nov. 10 deadline.
“The Court’s ruling on which congressional map will be adopted is not based on any policy,” she wrote. “Rather, it will be based on the law.”
What now?
The judge’s ruling gives more clarity — for now — when it comes to what Utah’s 2026 congressional boundaries will look like next year. 
But there’s still plenty of uncertainty over the future of Utah’s redistricting process. 
In continued angst over Proposition 4 — arguing the narrowly-passed law jeopardizes Utah’s “constitutional order” by removing the power of map-drawing from legislators — Utah Republican Party leaders and the political issues committee called Utahns for Representative Government are pursuing another ballot initiative to ask voters to repeal Proposition 4 during the 2026 elections. 
Another redistricting twist: Utah GOP changes tactics to repeal independent map-drawing law

For that ballot initiative, the group has been holding a series of public hearings across the state, including seven Monday night. To qualify the repeal question for the 2026 ballot, the group will need to collect at least 140,748 valid signatures from registered voters across Utah while meeting specific thresholds in at least 26 of Utah’s 29 Senate districts. 
Initially, the Utah Republican Party had also said it would pursue a referendum on map C — the same map it had urged Utahns to support — but last week Utah GOP Chair Rob Axson told reporters party leaders decided against pursuing signatures for that effort, saying they now plan to put all of their effort behind the initiative to repeal Proposition 4. 
“The only way to repeal a law that was passed through initiative, with Utah’s current understanding following court decisions, is through another initiative. The initiative has always been the primary focus of what we’re doing. Nothing has changed there,” Axson told ABC4.
Utah’s Republican leaders have also said they intend to continue to fight Gibson’s rulings in court by appealing the case to the Utah Supreme Court, and if necessary the U.S. Supreme Court. 
But because the lieutenant governor’s office, which oversees the state’s elections, has said Nov. 10 would be the drop-dead deadline to determine the 2026 congressional map, it’s likely the map Gibson picked will indeed be used for next year’s election. 
But for 2028? More court battles and legislative wrangling are likely to play out to determine the future of redistricting in Utah. 
Additionally, Gibson is likely to continue to catch the ire of Utah’s Republican legislative leaders. During the Oct. 6 special session when the Legislature implemented map C, some Republican legislators indicated they would entertain the idea of pursuing articles of impeachment against Gibson if she didn’t pick their preferred map.

On the Senate floor that day, Sen. Dan McCay, R-Riverton, characterized Gibson’s court-ordered redistricting process as a “joke” and a “farce.” And Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, argued that the Utah Constitution says “the only way a map can be accepted is by approval by the Legislature.” 
“It is our duty as a Legislature to approve a map, otherwise there is no other means by which a map may be used, even if parties ask for it,” Brammer said. “It would be a malfeasance in office — a malfeasance in office — for a court to attempt to accept a map that has not been approved by the Legislature, or for a lieutenant governor to certify and use a map that has not been approved by the Legislature.” 
Under Utah law, elected officials and judges can only be impeached for “high crimes and misdemeanors or malfeasance in office.” Any impeachment proceedings would also be required to start in the House.
When pressed by reporters, House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, would not say whether the House would be open to considering articles of impeachment against Gibson, saying, “I’m not going to get into what the House is going to do in a theoretical (situation).” However, he also said the Legislature will “do all we can to protect the power given to it in the Constitution.” 
“Nowhere in the Constitution does it allow for a judge to be able to pick a map,” Schultz said at the time. “And we will adamantly defend that, to whatever means necessary.”

Ned Lamont vetoed House Bill 5002, he halted the most substantial statewide progress we have seen in years on housing. That bill was shaped in public. Residents testified. Local volunteers showed up. Advocates brought data and lived experience. Legislators listened. The public did everything democracy requires when asked.
The new bill coming before lawmakers this week was drafted privately by a limited set of insiders and released only on November 7 — giving advocates, experts, and residents fewer than seven days to review it before a special-session vote.
It was not drafted with the public, not with the hundreds who testified, not with the experts, planners, tenants, or developers who worked for months on HB 5002 — but only with the insiders in the room. The rest of Connecticut is being told to wait quietly while a final version is pushed to vote on Wednesday and Thursday. 
That is not transparency. That is not a partnership. That is not how a state in a housing crisis should make policy.
Here is who is being left out:
Renters in New London who have endured relentless rent hikes. Windham families who are dreaming of owning a home. Seniors in Montville, Lisbon, and Killingly who just want to stay near their families. Employers in Groton and Norwich who cannot fill jobs because workers cannot find housing nearby. The advocates who helped shape HB 5002. 
The experts, the builders, and the tenants were all left out.  So were the thousands of residents who initially testified and mobilized because their housing stability is at risk.
When legislation is created only by those already in positions of power, we get the same results that got us into this crisis. We end up wondering why bills pass but rents keep rising, zoning stays restrictive, and displacement accelerates. The answer is simple. Solutions that exclude the people living the problem will never be bold enough to solve it.
Here is the truth. A rushed, watered-down, privately negotiated bill is not progress. A bad secret bill is worse than no bill at all. It creates the illusion of action while allowing the crisis to deepen.
It is now planned that the revised bill could be brought to the floor for a vote as soon as November 12 or 13, with no meaningful opportunity for advocates, experts, practitioners, and residents to weigh in. The people who will live with the consequences are expected to accept them blindly. That is unacceptable.
Communities in Eastern Connecticut are doing their part. From Ledyard to Mansfield and New London to Hebron, towns have encouraged and approved new senior apartments, homeownership opportunities, and stable homes.  Planners and volunteers are putting in the work to make housing more attainable. They deserve a state policy framework shaped with transparency and partnership. And the residents who lie awake at night worried about next month’s rent deserve to know that their stories still matter. 
Housing is not theoretical here. It is the couple sleeping in their car in Waterford. It is the nurse commuting from Rhode Island.  It is the family who can barely afford the rent, let alone buy a home someday.  It is the veteran who cannot afford to live in the town where he raised his children.  It’s our neighbors being forced out by predatory private equity landlords.  
If leaders are confident in this bill, they should show it to the public now. Explain what changed. Explain who influenced those changes. Explain why those of us closest to residents were pushed out of the room.
This is a defining moment for Connecticut. We either insist on accountability and shared responsibility, or accept a system in which only those already in power decide who belongs, where decisions are made in the dark.
Residents need to speak up.  Demand a housing future written with, not for, the people who need it most.  
Open the doors. Restore trust. Connecticut’s families cannot afford closed-door decisions that look like momentum but leave them further behind.

You have spent the last five hours trying to explain to a government bureaucrat why there is a “clear public need” for the services your firm provides while a party with a financial interest in your failure tries to prove that no such need exists, all within a system explicitly designed to prevent firms like yours from expanding their services. 
With the conclusion of the hearing, you have now done all you can. All that remains is for the hearing officer to deliver his verdict. If he approves your application, great. If not, tough luck.
Such is the situation in which many people in the healthcare system find themselves in those states where Certificate of Need (CON) laws are still on the books, including Connecticut. These laws require healthcare providers to prove that there is a “clear public need” before they introduce or expand their services in an area, on the theory that this will prevent unnecessary capital expenditures by hospitals and thus contain healthcare costs. certificate-of-need laws are also often justified as a means to promote access to healthcare. Unfortunately, the weight of the evidence is that certificate-of-need laws have no measurable impact on healthcare costs, and a recent study, while not finding a statistically significant relationship, suggested that these laws considerably decrease healthcare access.
I do not have the means to replicate studies myself. I do, however, have access to the dockets for every certificate-of-need application in the state of Connecticut filed within the last few years. I spent some time over the summer looking through a few of them to gain a more complete picture of the certificate-of-need system beyond that given by the numbers. One case in particular stood out to me as putting every negative aspect of the system on full display.
Encompass Danbury
On August 29, 2025, Encompass Health opened the doors of a new rehab hospital in Danbury to care for patients who had suffered from strokes or bone injuries and could not receive adequate treatment elsewhere in Connecticut. Danbury’s mayor, Roberto Alves, was pleased to announce the occasion, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal thanked Encompass and remarked that such care has “helped save money because it prevents injuries and illnesses from recurring.” 
Left unmentioned was the fact that Encompass could have opened its doors two years earlier, had it not been for the Office of Health Strategy (OHS), the state agency responsible for administering Connecticut’s certificate-of-need program.
On August 14, 2020, Encompass filed a certificate-of-need application asking for permission to open a new rehab hospital in Danbury. Among other things, their application included multiple studies indicating the absence of this type of care in western Connecticut, plentiful testimony from doctors lamenting that they had been forced to send patients to Massachusetts for treatment, and supportive letters from the mayor and from two state representatives. Under these circumstances, the granting of a certificate of need should have been all but guaranteed.
Unfortunately for Encompass, while the public welcomed their services, the Nuvance-owned Danbury Hospital did not.  Nuvance alleged that there was, in fact, no gap in care in western Connecticut, that competition from Encompass would somehow increase the cost of rehabilitative care, and, worst of all, that allowing Encompass to operate would create an “unnecessary duplication of services.” Rather then expressing good-faith concern for patients’ pocketbooks, Nuvance was really worried that many patients would choose Encompass over them, thus hurting their bottom line.
That Nuvance’s allegations were without merit did not matter: OHS had to give them time to testify and present evidence, turning an ordinary hearing into an informal bench trial. This “trial” was held in October 2021, over a year after filing, over a Zoom call lasting from 10 in the morning to five in the evening. Over the course of the hearing, Nuvance tried to prove that it had enough bed capacity to service the rehab patients, while Encompass countered that it provided more intensive care than Nuvance and pointed to evidence that less intensive care was not a substitute for more intensive care.
After the hearing, there was silence for nearly a year. OHS finally released a proposed decision in 2022, denying the certificate of need. The reasoning was extensive, but boiled down to failure to demonstrate “clear public need” and failure to demonstrate that there would be no “unnecessary duplication of services.” Encompass appealed to then-Commissioner Deidre Gifford. Among other things, they pointed out that the author of the decision was inexperienced, committed numerous errors when stating the facts of the case, and improperly discounted Encompass’ methodology for determining the existence of a gap in rehab services.
While not relevant to the adjudication of the case, but a good indicator of the soundness of the certificate-of-need system, Encompass noted that Nuvance had pressured physicians to not voice support for the new facility and that, while OHS was dragging its feet, another firm had filed a certificate of need asking to open an intensive rehab facility in the same area. Thankfully for everyone (except for Nuvance’s corporate management), Gifford entered a final decision determining that Encompass’ services were needed and granting the certificate of need.
General problems with CONs
The Encompass case reveals many problems with certificates of need, the first of which is that they take too long. While there has been significant improvement over the past few years, the typical certificate-of-need case still takes over six months to process. These are six months where nothing can be done until the fate of the application is decided. Not only does the firm requesting a certificate of need pay the monetary cost of construction delays, but patients that could have been treated during that time pay with their health.
In addition to costs created by the delay, the firm must spend time and money producing the application and compiling the required information, as well as retain an attorney to guide them through the process and represent them at the hearing. While exact numbers are hard to come by, the typical certificate of need must cost over a $100,000.
Even so, if compliance costs were the only problem with certificates of need, I would probably not be writing this article. But certificate-of-need laws do evil by many means, the most pernicious of which is the intervenor system. By this system, established providers are allowed to weaponize the state government to protect their profits from competition by forcing applicants to fight both OHS and the intervenor and by convincing OHS to condition its approval on the applicant’s acceptance of unfavorable terms. If we despise officials who corruptly use their power to pick winners and losers, we ought to abhor a system that is designed to benefit one party at the expense of the other.
Finally, certificates of need are, to put it mildly, economic nonsense. Even those unfamiliar with the subject are aware that, when the supply of a good or service increases, its per-unit cost decreases. Most are also aware that, with a greater abundance of firms in a given field, competition between these firms will drive down the cost and raise the quality and specialization of care. Certificate-of-need laws flip this logic on its head: they purport to contain costs by reducing the supply of healthcare in a region. Worse, certificate-of-need laws deride competition— the lifeblood of capitalism and the essence of what makes America great— as nothing more than an “unnecessary duplication of services.”
The path forward is clear: certificate-of-need laws ought to be ended, not mended. There is little evidence that certificate-of-need laws lower the cost of or increase access to healthcare and considerable evidence that they have the opposite effect. At best, they pose an unnecessary hurdle for new health care projects in Connecticut; at worst, they reduce the availability of care in the state and harm patients’ health. As the legislature goes into session, they will be primarily concerned with addressing housing prices and federal funding cuts. 
They should consider abolishing certificates of need as well.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-11 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"While CT stalls, immigrant families suffer",Rochelle Palache,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/11/while-ct-stalls-immigrant-families-suffer/,"We applaud lawmakers' efforts this year to strengthen protections for immigrants, but for this upcoming special session, Connecticut must do more.","During this time of unprecedented attack on our immigrant communities, it has never become more important for state and local governments to demonstrate their solidarity with residents through unabashed support and action. 
We’ve seen some  strong acts of solidarity: Chicago making it so that ICE agents can be arrested over unlawful actions, Boston’s Mayor Michelle Wu’s refusal to rescind Boston’s welcoming policies despite direct federal threats if she didn’t, and California’s recent signing into law a bill that protects schools and public hospitals from federal law enforcement officers, including ICE.
But while these efforts to protect immigrants blossom across the country, over here in Connecticut, one can’t help but wonder: why isn’t our leadership doing more?
One of the biggest efforts to stand with immigrant communities this past legislative session was led by a coalition seeking to modify Connecticut’s Trust Act, which outlines the extent to which local and state officials can work with the federal government to detain immigrants. After months of advocacy, rallies, petitions, and phone banking, a significant win was had: individuals can now sue over violations of the Trust Act, and there has been an expansion of which state officials are covered by the law. These are helpful and necessary additions – but to ensure the safety and security of our most vulnerable, they must go further.
I work directly with many immigrants as the leader of 32BJ SEIU in Connecticut, one of the largest majority immigrant unions in the country. Not only does our union recognize the hard work and values that immigrants bring to our country, but our membership also exemplifies those assets. Across the 12 states where our union operates, 32BJ members come from 64 countries and speak 28 different languages. Many came to the U.S. for economic opportunity, others seeking safety for themselves and their families.
Their stories reflect my own – when I immigrated from Jamaica to the U.S. in 1999 to pursue my degree at Smith College, I brought with me my dreams and hopes of a better future. It is now my honor to work with the most vulnerable in our society to build their power, so they can forge a future where their children can succeed.
However, for many of our members, these dreams have been abruptly placed on pause as seizures by ICE agents have increased in Connecticut. Immigrants of all statuses now live in fear of their loved ones being snatched off the streets, or of being taken themselves. Raids at everyday locations, like car washes in Hamden, Newington, and Southington, have had a chilling impact, with many immigrants now withdrawing behind locked doors, unsure of who to trust.
We’re aware that the federal administration’s aggressive targeting of immigrants hinders the willingness of all immigrant workers — no matter their status — to report any mistreatment at work they’re facing. According to the Economic Policy Institute, workers born outside of the United States are more likely to experience minimum wage violations than their native counterparts. How likely is it that workers are going to come forward knowing the federal administration is targeting them more aggressively?
While we applaud the legislature and governor’s efforts this year to strengthen protections for immigrants, for this upcoming special session, Connecticut must do more, including:

Protecting personal information held by state agencies from federal government
Prohibiting the use of state resources for immigration enforcement
Protecting and guaranteeing Medicaid coverage regardless of immigration status

These additional provisions aren’t excessive – they’re essential to safeguarding immigrants in Connecticut. This administration has shown no limits in its determination to prioritize detention and deportation over the right to  basic survival, as evidenced by the handing over of 79 million Medicaid recipients’ personal data to ICE, cutting or refusing to fully fund social services like SNAP while allocating billions to ICE, and drawing new restrictions around Medicaid that prevents many immigrants from having coverage. The more time that passes, the more time ICE has to further sow fear and anxiety in our communities.
We may no longer have the luxury of time, but we have the advantage of the upcoming special session. And it’s not just organizations like 32BJ, alongside our allies and partners, who are pushing for enhanced immigration protections. Unprecedented electoral wins across the country and here in Connecticut, including several flipped seats, demonstrate how people are voting for representatives that have the interests of working families and immigrants in mind. This should serve as a powerful message to our legislature here.
It’s still not too late for Connecticut to prioritize more robust, direct protections for immigrants and defend those who are very much a part of what makes Connecticut great.

(U.S. Army National Guard photo by Spc. Ericka Gillespie)Gov. Mike Dunleavy signed an extension of the state’s disaster declaration on Saturday to continue emergency response and recovery efforts following the Western Alaska storms, including the remnants of Typhoon Halong. 
The original disaster declaration signed on Oct. 9 was set to expire on Sunday.
“The 30-day extension will enable recovery efforts to continue unencumbered so that the maximized amount of work can be completed before the onset of the winter freeze up in the region,” according to a statement from the governor’s office. 
The governor requested concurrence from leaders of the Alaska State Legislature and was met with support.
“I am in complete agreement on the 30 day extension and appreciate the Governor’s amended Disaster Declaration,” said Alaska State Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, in a statement.
“It’s been a yeoman’s job by everyone, and I’m very impressed by the dedication and the amount of time put in,” said Alaska Speaker of the House Rep. Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham. 
He said the extension is necessary. “It just makes good sense,” he said. “In a race with freeze-up and making as much progress as possible to get local residents back in their homes, if that is possible, in this very short amount of time that’s available.”
The disaster recovery effort on the Western Alaska coast is still underway, almost a month after a series of fall storms damaged or devastated coastal villages and displaced thousands of residents, primarily in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region. Recovery operations are focused on restoring critical infrastructure, including water, power, communications, and emergency home and boardwalk repairs, according to an update on Friday from the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.
The state’s disaster response effort is coordinating with federal agencies, regional tribal organizations, non-profits and local partners. The Trump administration announced a federal disaster declaration for Alaska on Oct. 22, promising a 100 percent cost share for the state’s relief efforts for 90 days, through January, according to the governor’s office. 
The Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management did not respond to a request for a cost estimate of the disaster relief effort to date, on Monday.
As of Friday, the most recent division update, the state has received 1,400 applications for state Individual Assistance and 719 applications for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Applications are still open.

The infected person contracted the virus during international travel, and the public was potentially exposed to that person Sunday evening at Armstrong New Orleans Airport, the Louisiana Department of Health said in a news release. The traveler with measles came through Concourse B and was outside the airport’s security checkpoint between 5-8:30 p.m.
Anyone who was on the same flight as the infected person is being notified, according to the health department.  
Officials said the infected person was not hospitalized and will remain in isolation until they are no longer infected. They were only identified as a resident of Region 9, which includes Livingston, St. Helena, St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, and Washington parishes. Whether the person had received the measles vaccine was not known.
No additional information about the person was provided, with officials citing patient confidentiality.
Measles is highly contagious, especially among people who have not received the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. Its infection rate is 90% among people who are unvaccinated and exposed. 
The virus can be especially dangerous for babies and young children, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems. Measles can result in hospitalization and, in extreme cases, death. 
Measles symptoms typically present themselves seven to 12 days after exposure but can take up to 21 days to appear. Symptoms include: a fever of 101° F or higher; red, watery eyes; cough; runny nose; and a red and blotchy rash that appears after other symptoms, usually on the face at the hairline, and moves down the body.
Persons who believe they have been infected with measles should notify their health care provider before they see them in person to lower the risk for other patients and medical staff.

The Legislature approved funds in case the federal government doesn’t fully fund food assistance over the holidays. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)The New Mexico Legislature’s second special session ended after about four hours Monday, with both chambers quickly approving an allocation of up to $162.5 million to cover statewide food assistance through the start of next year in case it’s needed.
Acting Gov. Howie Morales also swiftly signed the bill early Monday evening.
Ultimately, the House voted 52-9, and the Senate voted 30-6, to approve a spending package with $162.5 million for SNAP going forward, plus $30 million to replenish a fund that paid for the 10 days’ worth of SNAP that ran out Monday. Only Republicans voted against the measure.
Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup), the Senate Finance chair, said before the vote Monday that weekly payments totaling about $20 million will go to every SNAP recipient statewide beginning Dec. 1, unless the federal government reopens and begins paying for SNAP in full by then. The bill includes a provision that automatically ends the state payments when the government reopens.
New Mexico will supply $30M in emergency funding for food assistance

If federal funding lapses again, state funded emergency food benefits in House Bill 1 will be loaded on to New Mexicans’ EBT cards on a weekly basis until it’s restored or until the state Legislature returns for its regular session starting Jan. 20, 2026.
The spending package the lawmakers approved by a wide margin occurs amid a federal government shutdown that threatened to abruptly halt Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program payments to about 460,000 New Mexicans. 
Upon its passage, both state House and Senate Democrats issued news releases throughout the session and in statements following its end noted that the state had stepped in to counter the Trump administration. 
“Once again, our state is coming together to deliver the critical services New Mexicans cannot live without,” House Speaker Javier Martinez (D-Albuquerque) said in a news release. 
Even as a possible deal emerged Sunday evening in the U.S. Senate, state Democrats in the majority said the chaotic back-and-forth between President Donald Trump and federal judges prompted them to take it upon themselves to ensure roughly one in five New Mexicans have money to eat over the holidays. 
Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo confirmed the state paid 100% of November SNAP benefits on Friday when ordered to do so by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and then was subsequently “ordered to claw that back. We are in the middle of a very confusing legal storm right now,” she said, “so the truth is, this is going to play out in the courts…We have issued those benefits in New Mexico, but we are also going to have to comply with whatever ultimate guidance we receive.”
Trump underscored the legal turmoil when his top litigator on Monday told the Supreme Court the administration was continuing its appeal of a federal ruling ordering it to pay full SNAP benefits to 42 million Americans. 
While New Mexico lawmakers committed to continuing to pay for SNAP if needed, Muñoz and other Democrats said conversations are ongoing with federal elected officials to reimburse New Mexico and other states that fronted their own funds for SNAP during the shutdown. 
NM Gov’s office says residents will continue to receive food assistance benefits

One possible vehicle could be the continuing resolution used to pay back federal workers and reopen the government, leaders said. 
“States — red, blue — we all stepped up to fill a gap here, a critical gap, so that reimbursement really needs to come,” said Majority Leader Sen. Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe)in a news conference after the Senate adjourned. 
The Republicans who voted against the measures said they did so largely because they blamed United States Senate Democrats, and particularly New Mexico’s Ben Ray Lujàn and Martin Heinrich, for the shutdown and the harm it caused. 
“When it comes to what happened in Washington, let’s be very clear,” said Sen. Craig Brandt (R-Rio Rancho). “Ben Ray Lujàn and Martin Heinrich voted to use the people of New Mexico as pawns to force the government to pay for subsidies for the unaffordable Care Act.”
Expiring Affordable Care Act health care insurance tax credits have been at the crux of the partisan division over the federal spending bill.
Shutdown battle ebbs, but Trump won’t give up trying to withhold full SNAP benefits

In response to that criticism from Brandt and others, Heinrich told Source New Mexico in a statement that Republicans “want us to pass a Republican funding bill that would result in working class New Mexicans paying thousands, even tens of thousands of dollars, more next year for their healthcare.”
Both Heinrich and Luján, along with most Democrats in the U.S. Senate, voted Sunday against a bill to reopen the government, citing the health insurance tax credits.
“We refuse to let Donald Trump bully us into choosing between a mother in Roswell feeding her kids, a couple in Española affording their health care premiums, or a VA employee in Albuquerque making their next rent payment,” Heinrich and Luján said in a joint statement following the vote.
Republicans also raised questions about New Mexico’s high status among states with the highest SNAP error rates, which are accidental over- or under-paying of SNAP recipients due to errors from applicants or state officials overseeing the program. According to state officials, the state has an error rate of 14.6%. 
US Senate advances bill to end record-breaking government shutdown

Seeking ways to bring down the error rate, Republicans in both chambers introduced amendments that provide the state Health Care Authority $50,000 to evaluate ways to bring down the SNAP error rate.
The error rate could cost state taxpayers significantly. If the state does not reduce its error rate in the next few years, provisions in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” will shift 15% of the state’s total SNAP spending onto the state, which amounts to $173 million, according to recent estimates. 
Health Care Authority Kari Armijo said the state’s high error rate is, at least in part, a product of the COVID-19 pandemic’s loosening of restrictions to receive SNAP. The state waived some reporting requirements, which was allowed but drove the error rate higher, Armijo explained in a committee hearing Monday. 
“We did that intentionally to keep New Mexicans fed,” she said. 
Democrat sponsors of the spending bill agreed to accept Republican amendments to appropriate $50,000 to evaluate the cause of the error rate. 
But Wirth also called the provisions “draconian,” saying he hopes Congress reconsiders the “error rate” penalty, which he said will hurt not only the state but also SNAP recipients. 
“Given New Mexico’s in the same position with a whole string of red states, I think Congress needs to take a deep breath and look at this and go back,” he said. “And really kind of look at the impact and the harm that’s causing.”

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)It’s been less than a week since Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherill won the governor’s race, and Democrats are lining up to run for her House seat.
The race to represent the 11th Congressional District includes a former congressman, an ex-Obama administration staffer, two county commissioners, and a mayor.
“I think the more people that jump in, the better,” said Brendan Gill, an Essex County commissioner and political strategist who formally launched his campaign for Sherrill’s seat on Monday.
Gill, standing alongside supporters in the pouring rain outside his childhood home in Montclair, touted his ties to the Essex County town and his work in organizing Democrats to help elect Sherrill governor last week.
“I think what will ultimately be the differentiator for my candidacy is what you saw here today, is that community, deep roots and local support, because people know what I’ve done, they know that I’ve delivered, and they know I can do it in the future,” Gill said.
Gill is expected to face former Rep. Tom Malinowski, Passaic County Commissioner John Bartlett, White House alum Cammie Croft, and Morris Township Mayor Jeff Grayzel, among others.
The campaign is expected to be fierce. Montclair Mayor Renee Baskerville appeared to take a shot at Malinowski Monday when she noted that Gill is running for Congress “where he actually lives.”
Malinowski lives in Hunterdon County. The 11th District includes parts of Morris, Essex, and Passaic counties.
Former Rep. Tom Malinowski (Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
In a statement, Malinowski said he works in the 11th District — he teaches at Seton Hall University — and will be a voting resident of it before the primary.
“I’m the only candidate in the race who has represented any part of the 11th District in Congress, the only one with experience fighting Trump and delivering for New Jersey communities as a member of Congress, and the only one who will be battle ready the day I’m elected,” Malinowski said.
Malinowski represented the 7th Congressional District for two terms starting in 2019 — he was elected to Congress in the same Democratic wave that propelled Sherrill there — before losing reelection in 2022 to Rep. Tom Kean Jr. (R). When Malinowski was first elected to the 7th District, it included some towns that are now in the 11th District.
“I’m running for Congress again, to pick up where my friend Mikie Sherrill left off,” Malinowski said in a video launching his campaign last week.
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who is leaving office after two terms in January, endorsed Gill while speaking with reporters at an unrelated event Monday. Murphy noted it’s an “impressive field” of candidates, but acknowledged he “wouldn’t be here without Brendan’s support.”
Gill managed Murphy’s first campaign for governor in 2017, and prior to that managed campaigns for Sen. Cory Booker and the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg.
It’s not entirely clear when the candidates will compete to succeed Sherrill, whose current House term runs until Jan. 3, 2027. She has yet to resign from the House, and the governor cannot call a special election to find her replacement until she does. She becomes governor on Jan. 20 and cannot also serve in Congress.
She said last week she’d work with leadership in both the House and the state Legislature to “get a new person in that seat.” She said she “likely won’t be getting involved.”
The 11th District had been a Republican stronghold before Sherrill won it in 2018. Its boundaries have since been redrawn to make it safer for Democrats to win.

About 97% of all 170,000 recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in Maine will receive full benefits, and others will get about 65%, which includes mostly new SNAP applicants, according to public guidance issued by the Office for Family Independence, which is part of the state health department that administers the program.
Whether Maine will be on the hook for paying for the already issued November benefits remains to be determined, but that seems unlikely, according to Justin Strasburger, executive director of anti-hunger nonprofit Full Plates, Full Potential.
“The good, stable news is about the SNAP recipients themselves. They have the funds for the month of November,” he said. “The state and federal government may end up having to go back and forth and figure out who is paying for all of this.”
Shutdown battle ebbs, but Trump won’t give up trying to withhold full SNAP benefits

On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture directed states to make full SNAP benefits available to recipients, following a lower court ruling. Maine was among several states to follow that guidance, directing the vendor that issues benefits on EBT cards to make them available by Monday. But the Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which paused the order late Friday, and returned to the court Monday to continue its fight against releasing full payments. 
“That the President would then petition the highest court to deny food to hungry families and seniors is beyond belief and is callous and cruel,” Gov. Janet Mills said in a statement on Sunday. “The President should not be directing states to take food out of the mouths of the hungry.”
Several lower courts have ordered USDA to release full SNAP payments, but whether the federal government will be reimbursing the vendors that administer benefits is unclear.
“How this all plays out in the courts is still, you know, up for debate, and it is not fully settled, sadly,” Strasburger said. “So until the shutdown is over, I think we’re going to continue to have some question marks about all this and lots of legal action.”

State Sen. Matt Claman, D-Anchorage, announced his candidacy on Monday. He is the second Democrat in the race, after former Senate Minority Leader Tom Begich, also of Anchorage. The other 12 declared candidates are Republicans.
Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, is term-limited and not running.
Claman, an attorney and former Anchorage Assembly chair and acting mayor, has served in the Legislature since 2015. He served first in the House before being elected to the Senate in 2022. He is among the leaders of that body’s bipartisan majority caucus and chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee.
In a statement, Claman referred to his experience in the bipartisan caucus.
“As Governor, I’ll work every day to ensure our state government reflects the values we all share: safe streets, great schools, business-friendly regulations, and a growing economy that works for businesses and working families,” he said in the statement. “Our state deserves a leader who listens to and works together with the people of Alaska, leads with care, upholds our constitution, and sets partisanship aside to deliver real results. That’s exactly what I’ve done in the Legislature and what I’ll do for you as your governor.”
Claman, who represents West Anchorage, was reelected to the Senate last year. He would not be up for reelection until 2028.
In a brief interview Monday, Claman said he timed his announcement with fundraising rules in mind.
“It’s basically a year before the election. Because of the limits on fundraising – and I’m not going to resign – I need to get started before the session,” he said.
Under state law, sitting legislators may not raise campaign funds during legislative sessions, which in 2026 is scheduled to run from Jan. 21 to May 20.
Claman said he started sending out fundraising solidifications after he filed his notice of intent to run for governor.
Former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola is considered by observers to be the strongest potential Democratic candidate for governor, but she is also a possible candidate for U.S. Senate. Several Democratic leaders have urged her to challenge Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, who is up for reelection next year.
The primary election date is Aug. 18, 2026. The candidate filing deadline is June 1.
Alaska’s gubernatorial candidates will compete in an open primary, with the top four finishers facing off in the general election under the state’s ranked-choice system.

(Julie O'Donoghue/Illuminator) The Louisiana Board of Ethics confirmed Friday that elected officials and political candidates can use their campaign money for expenses related to Washington Mardi Gras following a law change earlier this year. 

The ethics board issued an advisory opinion last week to Mandeville Mayor Clay Madden, stating he can legally use campaign funds to cover his Washington Mardi Gras expenses. Madden intends to go to the event, which take place in 2026 during the last week of January, in his official capacity as a city representative. 
“The Mayor intends to travel to the 2026 ‘Washington Mardi Gras’ event to engage in meetings with various stakeholders, including constituents, other municipal leaders, parish presidents, state legislators, and U.S. senators and representatives,” Elizabeth Sconzert, Mandeville’s city attorney, wrote in an email to the ethics board in August. 
Washington Mardi Gras is an annual, four-day festival held in the nation’s capital featuring a formal Mardi Gras ball, parade, black-tie gala, business luncheons, political fundraisers and several parties thrown by and for the politically connected. Some of Louisiana’s large companies and lobbyists are among the most visible sponsors of the event.

Including airfare, hotel stays, krewe membership dues, event tickets and formal attire, it easily costs thousands of dollars for an individual to take part in the festivities. 
Elected officials have, for years, used their campaign funds to go to Washington Mardi Gras, held at the Washington Hilton Hotel. Nearly $600,000 from Louisiana campaigns and political action committees accounts went to cover Washington Mardi Gras expenses in 2024 alone.  

But whether all this spending was allowed under state ethics laws has been unclear. The ethics board’s guidance on whether political campaign money could be used for Mardi Gras-related expenses has been muddled. 
State law generally bans the use of campaign funds and political action committee money for “personal use,” but the Louisiana Legislature carved out a explicit exception for Washington Mardi Gras spending earlier this year. 

Under the new law, political candidates can use their campaign accounts to cover costs related to their attendance, as well as that of their spouses and children, at “events related to the Mardi Gras celebration in Washington D.C.” 

Prior to the law change, legislators had complained the ethics board was scrutinizing campaign account spending on Washington Mardi Gras.

Chuck Schumer of New York, accompanied by Democratic U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, points to a poster depicting rising medical costs if Congress allows the Affordable Care Act tax credits to expire. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Late Sunday night, seven Democratic U.S. senators, including Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman, and one Independent, joined their Republican colleagues to overcome the filibuster and move forward on a vote to reopen the government. It’s a signal that the ongoing shutdown, which has now lasted a record 40 days, may be coming to an end soon. 
But Congressman Brendan Boyle (D-Philadelphia) is calling on his colleagues to reject the current proposal should it make it to the House.
“This bill that does not in any way address the health care crisis, and only includes a vague reference to a promise of a senate vote a month from now, is wholly insufficient to address the health care crisis facing the American people,” Boyle said at a press conference Monday.
The shutdown was initiated by Democrats, who demanded Republicans restore what are known as enhanced premium tax credits for people receiving health care through the Affordable Care Act. Without the Premium Tax Credits, nearly 22 million Americans, including around 500,000 Pennsylvanians, could see their monthly health care premiums rise by more than double the current rates on average.

For nearly 40 days, Democrats refused to join Republicans in voting to fund the government without a deal in place to restore the Premium Tax Credits before they expire at the end of the year. But on Sunday, they agreed to fund the government through January, with only a promise from Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) that the chamber will vote on extending them in the coming month.
“We have a pinky promise of a possible future vote with no guarantee of passage and no commitment from House Republican leadership or the White House,” Boyle said. “So what we essentially have is a promise about nothing.”
Boyle was joined by Vicki Miller, the leader of Indivisible Philadelphia, an organization that advocates for progressive causes. 
Miller said Democratic senators who voted to move forward with a vote to reopen the government were effectively turning on voters across the country who handed the party a series of wins in local and statewide elections last Tuesday, including maintaining a liberal majority on Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court.
“We succeed in giving the Democrats a huge victory,” she said. “We are just surprised that they would give in this easily.”
Fetterman, who has opposed the shutdown since it began, was one of the Democrats who voted with his GOP colleagues to move forward with a vote to reopen the government.
“After 40 days as a consistent voice against shutting our government down, I voted YES for the 15th time to REOPEN,” Fetterman wrote on the social media platform X. “I’m sorry to our military, SNAP recipients, gov workers, and Capitol Police who haven’t been paid in weeks. It should’ve never come to this. This was a failure.”
As a result of the shutdown, access to food assistance funding for millions of Americans has been threatened, delayed or stopped, and many government employees, including some members of the military, have gone without pay. 
The proposed deal to end the shutdown, however, would restore federal workers who were laid off in the last 40 days and ensure backpay for furloughed federal workers, which the Trump administration has argued they aren’t required to do, despite 2019 legislation signed in the president’s first term requiring it. It would also fund the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program through September 2026.
Maureen May, president of the Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals, joined Boyle on Monday in opposing the move by Fetterman, six of his Democratic colleagues and Sen. Angus King of Maine (an independent who caucuses with Democrats) to accept the deal and help Republicans overcome the filibuster. 
Shutdown battle ebbs, but Trump won’t give up trying to withhold full SNAP benefits

From her perspective, the issue of ensuring that health care is affordable, is worth the temporary pain of a federal government shutdown. 
Working as a nurse before the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2008, she said she’s seen what happens when patients can’t afford health insurance.
“Patients will end up in the emergency room. People will skip their meds. They’ll ration. Our patients will be sicker coming into the ER,” she said. “These are the consequences of 150,000 people losing their premium cuts and being able to take care of them and their families.”
The Pennsylvania Insurance Department has estimated that 150,000 Pennsylvanians may lose health insurance altogether if the enhanced premium tax credits expire and the monthly premiums on their marketplace plans increase.
To pass the proposed bill the Senate will still have to take a formal vote on it, which is expected as soon as Monday night. Then, the House would have to agree to the bill before it goes to President Donald Trump for his signature.
While only simple majorities in the House and Senate are required, and both chambers controlled by Republicans, Boyle says he will continue to fight to keep the government shutdown without a firm agreement to extend the enhanced premium tax credits.
“We have total unity among House Democrats from our leader all the way down,” Boyle said. “We had a couple of House Republicans vote against this the first time. There are going to be a number – maybe a couple dozen or more – Congressional Republicans facing very challenging reelections next year. They have every interest to work with us on this issue and solve this health care crisis now.”
Yet it’s unclear if any Republican will relent. 
Rep. Scott Perry (R-Cumberland), a member of the Freedom Caucus who represents one of Pennsylvania’s most competitive districts — the 10th, has said he will hold firm.
“After 41 days of ‘leveraging’ people’s lives, at least 8 Democrats seem to be getting the message that the attempt to force through their most radical demands onto the backs of the American People isn’t going to work,” he wrote on Facebook. “WE NEED TO GET BACK TO WORK.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Schumer-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-11-10 19:57:52.657442
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-11 00:21:50+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Massachusetts health care is in trouble,Paul Hattis,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/massachusetts-health-care-is-in-trouble/,A confluence of challenges points to very hard times ahead for the Massachusetts health care system.,"WEDNESDAY IS THE Massachusetts Health Policy Commission’s annual Health Care Cost Trends Hearings, when we hear remarks from state leaders and questions posed by members of the commission to panelists who represent various constituencies in the Massachusetts health care ecosystem. 
Massachusetts health care over the years has tended to resemble the “Perils of Pauline” — with one train or another barreling down the tracks toward us. Somehow, however, the system has always survived more or less intact.    
This year, things seem quite different, and the hearings come as the well-being of the health care system is under a greater series of threats than any time in recent history. A confluence of challenges points to very hard times for the Massachusetts health care system.   
Here are the main areas of concern.   
System and Family Unaffordability: During the time since the HPC came into existence in 2012, we have not witnessed the sort of health care spending and premium growth that we are seeing right now. Per capita state spending growth continued its three-year rise above the 3.6 percent benchmark, with the most recent measure more than double that target, at 8.6 percent.  
That growth is being driven by hospital and pharmaceutical spending, and is now reflected in double-digit premium increases across all forms of commercial insurance. This fall, the Division of Insurance, after rejecting even higher rates, approved an average increase of 13.4 percent for the individual and small group market for 2026. Our state’s own insurance plan for state workers and retirees, overseen by the Group Insurance Commission, had to seek a $250 million bailout for the fiscal year in June because the upward trend in medical care spending and use of the GLP-1 weight loss drugs by plan beneficiaries had blown away actuarial estimates for pharmaceutical utilization. In all, more than 40 percent of residents report difficulty in paying for health care. 
Upcoming Growth of the Under- and Uninsured: Ever since passage of the 2006 health care reform law known as Romneycare, Massachusetts has not seen significant yearly increases in the number of uninsured in the state. But passage earlier this year of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (House Resolution 1), which will trigger over $1 trillion in cuts to health and human service programs nationally, especially for Medicaid, over 10 years, will likely result in about 10 million Americans losing Medicaid coverage over the decade.  
A Blue Cross Blue Foundation of Massachusetts study estimates that the number of uninsured in Massachusetts will increase by more than 50 percent based on this law alone, which adds new work requirement and paperwork burdens for maintaining Medicaid coverage and new verification requirements for buyers of subsidized plans on Affordable Care Act exchanges.  
Many more are now expected to drop ACA coverage, sold here through the Health Connector, if enhanced ACA premium subsidies, set to expire on December 31, are not renewed—now even more likely to occur as the move to reopen the federal government came without any deal to maintain them. Add to this a good number more who obtain coverage through the merged market or through employers and are healthy—who may either buy plans with more cost sharing or forego coverage altogether.  
Hospitals: We are accustomed to the reality that the story of Massachusetts hospitals, like those in other states, has become a tale of two cities. “Emerald City” providers such as Mass General Brigham, Boston Children’s, and Dana-Farber are secure, while a growing set of “Gotham City” providers, such as Baystate Health and Tufts Medicine, are financially challenged and in need of state support.  
Medicaid cuts are especially threatening to the “Gotham City” group as they face increasing numbers of uninsured patients. In late September, Gov. Healey and the Legislature approved $200 million in supplemental payments to hospitals, though this is no way represents a long-term fix for the most challenged in the group. 
Even the wealthier providers, however, despite net asset increases fueled by investment gains, are challenged to stay financially stable right now. Well-heeled Mass General Brigham recently announced staff layoffs and other cuts to protect their bottom line.  
Recissions and planned future cuts to the National Institutes of Health budget by the Trump administration are an added serious threat to our “Emerald City” providers, who are among the top recipients of federal research in the nation. Added to this group’s challenges is that the state’s biopharma industry is now shedding jobs and failing to attract much new investment. This will likely have spillover effects on our major teaching hospitals, which often gain revenue from contracts with the biopharma industry. 
Community Health Centers: The state’s proud network of community health centers are triple losers from President Trump’s policies.  Attacks on immigrants will eliminate Medicaid even for those with legal status. Many others who rely on subsidized Health Connector plans will become uninsured patients. Meanwhile, changes to the federal drug purchasing program that allow health centers to gain some margin by reselling drugs they obtain at a discount is slated to be cut back, threatening this important revenue stream that allows many to get to breakeven on operations.   
The Legislature, mindful of these cuts, allocated $35 million to them directly, plus a share of the $77 million identified for the Health Safety Net Trust Fund. Even with this help, the future is very uncertain for a number of health centers. 
Primary Care: Primary care remains broken as we await policy recommendations from the state commission established to address inadequate availability, payments, and burnout among those in this sector. The crisis is moving some to unionize, while others are moving into concierge or direct primary care practices. 
Meanwhile, big for-profit companies remain active trying their own approaches to getting richer through primary care. Optum-owned Atrius Health is acquiring Acton Medical Associates to gain market share, while CVS and Mass General Brigham decided there is money to be made by joining together to turn Minute Clinics into primary care outlets in 27 locations with what appears to be MGB-branded solo nurse practitioners holding down the store.  
It remains unclear whether any of these developments will ameliorate the primary care shortage that keeps getting worse. 
Insurers: Finally, our dominant non-profit insurers, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Point 32, a duo we expected to be stable in good times and bad, have been losing significant money these past few years. There is mounting worry that Point 32’s growing financial hole and diminishing reserves may trigger a buyout proposal from a national for-profit. This would be a cataclysmic moment for Massachusetts’s mostly non-profit insurance system. And Blue Cross, which saw $400 million-plus in losses last year, and expects a negative operating margin of $700+ million in 2025, may not be immune from wanting to explore a conversion or a merger to strengthen its capital base. 
When you put all of this together, the threats to the public health, health care provider, and health care training ecosystem in Massachusetts are as serious as any we’ve seen in decades.  
It will be one thing for those speaking at this week’s Health Policy Commission hearings to tee up the serious, multifaceted challenges we’re facing. The real test will be charting a course of action that lays out a plan for what to do about it all.

The 12-member panel returned the verdicts Monday, finding Denroy Dasent guilty in a pair of killings that took place on the same night in Burlington and South Burlington in 2022.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
BURLINGTON — A jury convicted a former Burlington man of two counts of murder in the fatal shootings of two men on the same night in neighboring towns more than three years ago.
Denroy Dasent’s defense team had argued that it was a case of mistaken identity, while the prosecutors said the evidence “unequivocally” pointed to Dasent as the killer.
Jurors deliberated more than four hours before returning the guilty verdicts against Dasent on two charges of second-degree murder. The charges stem from the fatal shootings on Oct. 2, 2022, of 40-year-old Sheiknoor Osman and 37-year-old Brian K. Billings II. 
The jury’s verdict Monday followed a trial that stretched over five days in Chittenden County Superior criminal court in Burlington. 
Chittenden County State’s Attorney Sarah George, whose office prosecuted the case, spoke to reporters outside the courtroom and thanked the jurors. She said of the verdict, “It came with an amount of time that showed the jury took it very seriously.” 
George said the motive for the two killings remains unclear.
Dasent’s defense team declined to comment. 
Dasent, who fidgeted in his chair at the defense table throughout the trial and at times clasped his hands in front of himself, did not appear to display any emotions as the jury foreperson announced the verdicts. Dasent did not testify in his own defense.
Many of Billings’ family and friends, who said Billings was known as “Little B,” attended each day of the trial. Several of them cried as the verdicts were read. It was not clear if Osman had family members in the courtroom. 
Billings’ family members in a written statement after the verdict thanked the police investigators, the prosecutor team and the jury. 
“Brian was a Dad first and foremost and his fiancé Kylie and his children were his whole world,” the statement read. 
“These past three years have been the hardest of our lives,” the statement added. “Our ‘new normal’ is heartbreaking and hard to navigate and anything but normal. B was a good man with a huge heart, who loved everyone!! His smile came easy and his laughter contagious.”
Eyewitness testimony
The prosecutors during the trial highlighted eyewitness accounts as well as other evidence tying Dasent to the killings. That testimony included a firearms expert who connected shell casings recovered from both shooting scenes to a gun Dasent told investigators he had thrown into Lake Champlain moments before he was arrested.
Prosecutors presented little information about the connection, if any, between Dasent and the two victims. At the time of the shootings, Osman had been dating Billings’ sister.
Dasent’s defense attorneys contended throughout the trial that neither the evidence nor testimony clearly identified their client as the killer in either case.
Dasent, 55, has been jailed since his arrest shortly after the two deadly shootings. He had pleaded not guilty to the charges and remained in custody without bail pending his trial.
Tricia Guyette had testified on the trial’s first day that a man had forced his way into the Pine Street apartment where she had been with Osman on the night of the deadly attack a little after 8 p.m.
She told jurors Osman was in bed when the man entered the room. That man, armed with a Glock gun, repeatedly shot Osman, Guyette testified, adding that the shooter did not speak or display any emotions. 
In a 911 call Guyette made after the shooting, a recording of which was played for jurors in court, the only description she provided of the shooter was that he was a Black man. She later told police she was aware the shooter was known to others as “Denny” and said he was a frequent visitor to the Pine Street residence, which was a place where people would use and buy drugs. 
The second fatal shooting took place about three hours later, around 11 p.m., at the Swiss Host Motel in South Burlington. Kylie Clark, who lived there with Billings, testified during the trial that a person had come to the door that night seeking to speak to Billings and Billings went outside to talk to him.   
Clark told jurors she heard gunshots moments later, and Billings came back into the apartment bleeding. He collapsed and died, she said.  
Clark testified that she and Billings knew the person who had come to their door that night as “Delroy.” She said she knew that “Delroy” had lived at the Swiss Host Motel in the past and that he operated a restaurant in the food court of the University Mall in South Burlington. Denroy Dasent along with his wife had run the Island Passion restaurant at the mall.
Both Clark and Guyette identified Dasent as the shooter during their testimony, pointing to him at the defense table as he sat between his two attorneys.  
Dasent’s statements
Prosecutors during the trial played police video of Dasent as he was taken into custody on Burlington’s waterfront shortly after the second killing. Police had pursued Dasent there after spotting a tan sport-utility vehicle he was driving that matched the description of the vehicle witnessed earlier that night near the scene of the Pine Street homicide. 
In that video, Dasent said that he had “clapped” two people, a term that Burlington Police Lt. Michael Beliveau told jurors during his testimony meant he had killed them. Dasent could also be heard on the video stating, “I will kill for my kids.” 
In another police video, Dasent could be heard repeatedly referring to Osman by his nickname, “Snake,” and he appeared to make disparaging remarks about both Billings and Osman. He also could be heard alleging inappropriate behavior from the two men.
At one point during the questioning from the investigators, Dasent was asked what offenses he should face and he described himself as a “vigilante.”
Chittenden County Deputy State’s Attorney Sally Adams, in her more than hourlong closing argument Monday, told jurors those allegations against the two men were “nonsensical.” She said there was no evidence to back up those claims from Dasent. 
Defense attorney Daniel Maguire, in his much shorter closing remarks to the jury, said it was difficult to make too much about what his client told detectives after his arrest since it couldn’t be heard clearly and he appeared highly agitated.
Maguire told jurors that he didn’t believe that Dasent offered any “rational” motive for why he would want to carry out either of the fatal shootings.
Maguire also highlighted in closing argument the testimony of Keith Winters, who told jurors from the witness stand that he lived next door to Clark and Billings at the Swiss Host Motel at the time of the shooting there.
Winters testified that a person had come to his door shortly before the shooting asking who his neighbor was. Winters said he told the man that his neighbor was Brian Billings. 
Next, Winters testified, he heard gunshots outside his residence and he called police.
Winters told jurors he could not say with any certainty that the man who came to his apartment that night was Dasent. He said the lighting was bad, making it difficult to see. Winters called the man “polite” and noted he did not have an accent. Dasent had a heavy Caribbean accent in recordings of his voice played by prosecutors in the trial.
Maguire also raised questions about inconsistencies in Guyette’s testimony, saying she testified that the shooter spoke with an accent but also testified that the shooter did not speak during the shooting at the Pine Street apartment.
During their deliberations Monday, the jurors listened to an audio playback of Guyette’s testimony and they rewatched two police videos in which Dasent provided statements.
Gun evidence
Prosecutors also presented video evidence of Dasent telling police that while he was at the waterfront prior to his arrest, he threw a gun into the lake. A state police dive team found a Glock gun two days after the shootings in the lake near where Dasent was taken into custody.
Harry Jeppe, a firearms examiner with the Vermont Forensic Laboratory, told jurors that his analysis of markings on the shell casings recovered from both fatal shooting scenes showed they were fired from that same Glock recovered from the lake. 
The serial number of the weapon also matched a weapon Dasent’s wife, Suesan Dasent, testified during the trial that she had purchased in 2021 at a Chittenden County sporting goods store.
Suesan Dasent did not initially appear in court to testify. Police had to go and find her and take her into custody, bringing her to court to take the witness stand for the prosecution.
She testified that she kept the Glock gun in a locked case, and the key to the case was on the same ring as those for the tan Toyota 4Runner she owned with her husband. That was the same vehicle police found at the waterfront when they arrested Denroy Dasent.
Each murder charge against Dasent carries the possibility of life in prison. No sentencing date was immediately set.

Two Montana communities have expressed substantial interest in becoming the location for a new state women’s prison facility following a Department of Corrections request for information. Two more responded to the state’s request for information but cited resident concerns and opposition in their submission. 
The Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Commission and City of Deer Lodge expressed strong desire for consideration, as did Big Horn County and Hardin, which said their southeastern location was the “most appropriate and advantageous.”
Butte-Silver Bow and Jefferson also submitted responses, but acknowledged residents expressed serious concerns and opposition to becoming a new prison site. 
Montana’s state-run correctional facilities have been faced with overcrowding for years, and the issue drew a lot of discussion in Helena during the Legislature.
During the 2025 session, lawmakers appropriated $436 million to address capacity issues throughout the state.
One funding allocation came from House Bill 833, sponsored by Rep. John Fitzpatrick, R-Anaconda, which set aside roughly $250 million to construct a new women’s prison or renovate an existing facility.
In an interview with the Daily Montanan during the session, Fitzpatrick said the women’s prison in Billings houses 240 people, Montana needs beds for at least 400.
“Unlike the men, we have no place to put them out of state,” he told the Daily Montanan. The state has contracts to send male inmates to privately run prisons in other states. 
Fitzpatrick’s bill includes a study the Department of Corrections will lead to determine a new location for a women’s prison — not excluding Billings or Deer Lodge, where the men’s prison is located, but not favoring them either, he said.
“It could be anywhere,” Fitzpatrick said.
The Department of Corrections sent out a Request for Information on Sept. 10 seeking feedback from local communities interested in being an option to host the prison.
Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Commission voted unanimously on a resolution indicating its support for locating a new prison in the county and submitted an 18-page packet detailing the county’s history with running state-controlled institutions. 
“We believe that the long-term success of the new prison rests with siting it in a location where it will be welcomed rather than another community where the state simply owns land but where the local population may be hostile, skeptical, or indifferent to having the facility in its midst,” Commission Chairman Mike Beausoleil wrote. 
The Montana State Prison has been located in Deer Lodge since 1871 when it was founded as a territorial prison, and the Montana State Hospital at Warm Springs began as a territorial facility in 1877. 
The Montana Tuberculosis Sanitarium at Galen opened in 1913 and was also operated to house developmentally disabled residents and as a site for a state alcohol treatment program, according to the county’s documents. 
“State institutions have been a part of Deer Lodge County’s economy and culture for over 150 years,” the proposal states. “… While Anaconda is famous for its once massive copper smelter and owes its existence to the birth of copper mining in Butte, the state institutions were a vital source of income within the county. It is not hyperbole to say that after the smelter closed in 1981, it was employment at the state hospital and, especially, the state prison which kept Anaconda alive.”
Deer Lodge County offered two potential locations for a new women’s prison, one adjacent to the Montana State Hospital Forensic Unit at Galen, and two sites adjacent to the Montana State Hospital at Warm Springs. 
At a public hearing held by the county commission, only six individuals opposed the plan, according to county staff. 
Big Horn County and the city of Hardin touted community experience with similar facilities and a readiness to begin building immediately.
“Hardin brings relevant experience through past correctional facility operations, which have helped develop leadership familiar with the demands of such institutions,” Hardin Mayor Joe Purcell wrote in a letter of support. “Importantly, this proposal has strong community and political support. We view this as a valuable partnership — one that meets a critical public safety need for the state while offering lasting economic benefits for our region.”
Big Horn County’s proposal emphasizes proactive actions already taken by the county and Hardin to expedite the building of a women’s prison. 
The proposal identifies over 1,000 acres of county-owned land “that is ready for correctional use,” with an estimated $15 million-$20 million in infrastructure savings compared to using a barren site, and the possibility of donating the land to the state to jumpstart the project. 
The county also cited an elevated unemployment rate of 5.8% as a “ready and available labor pool” to mitigate a risk of staffing shortages at the new facility, as well as the proximity to two tribal colleges, which could aid in developing and implementing vocational training for inmates and staff. 
Big Horn’s proposal is also backed by the Northern Cheyenne Tribe and the Crow Tribe of Indians.  
Both Butte-Silver Bow and Jefferson County’s responses sent to DOC highlighted community opposition to a new prison facility. 
In a letter, Butte-Silver Bow Chief Executive J.P. Gallagher wrote that the prison “is not perceived as a benefit to community development,” citing workforce concerns, and a lack of housing and infrastructure capacity. A piece of state-owned land in the county that could be considered is smaller than the 40 acres DOC set as a minimum. 
He wrote that the city-county commission had sent a letter seeking more information from DOC, but did not receive a response.
The community of Boulder, meanwhile, saw “almost all” attendees at a public meeting oppose the idea of a new corrections facility in the town, though “comments from constituents aside from the meeting have mostly been supportive.”
Boulder is already home to the former Riverside Special Needs Unit, where in May, DOC relocated 50 female inmates from the Montana Women’s Prison in Billings to reduce overcrowding. 
The state owns a 122-acre parcel that includes the Riverside facility. There are additional similar facilities nearby, including the Elkhorn Treatment Center and a campus of the Yellowstone Boys and Girls Ranch. 
The letter sent from the county cited concerns with local workforce staffing, Boulder’s volunteer-run emergency service programs, and the available medical and behavioral health services locally. 
Neither the county commission nor city officials provided letters of support for a Boulder-based correctional facility. 
According to the Department of Corrections secure facility dashboard, there are currently 246 inmates at the Montana Women’s Prison, which has an operational capacity of 250, in addition to the 50 inmates at the Riverside Facility in Boulder.  
Meanwhile, the Montana State Prison in Deer Lodge, has 1,514 inmates with a capacity of 1,551. A total of 1,500 inmates are currently housed in contracted facilities, including one in Shelby and one in Dawson County.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-0188-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-10 19:57:52.657442

All three members of Vermont’s congressional delegation say they’re opposed to a tentative deal advancing in the U.S. Senate Monday that would end the historic federal government shutdown.
The proposal had support from eight members of the Senate’s Democratic caucus even though it would not immediately extend the health insurance tax credits that have been central to Democrats’ demands throughout the impasse. Vermont’s independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Democratic Sen. Peter Welch were not among those who joined most Republicans to pass a procedural vote on the measure late Sunday.
The now-bipartisan plan, which still needed to clear a number of hurdles as of Monday evening, would fund the federal government through at least Jan. 30, 2026, as well as provide full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, through Sept. 30, 2026, among other provisions.

In exchange for their support, the eight senators who crossed party lines — including New Hampshire Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, both Democrats, and Maine Sen. Angus King, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats — have a commitment from President Donald Trump’s administration to rehire federal workers fired at the start of the shutdown. They also received a promise from Senate GOP leaders for a December floor vote on legislation that would extend the expiring Affordable Care Act credits, which are slated to lapse at the end of 2025.
The subsidies help millions of low- and middle-income people afford the cost of their health insurance premiums. Without them, tens of thousands of people in Vermont would see their health care costs skyrocket, and many would likely no longer be able to afford coverage.
That’s the reason the state’s congressional delegation criticized the funding deal: the promise of a future vote, they argue, does not guarantee any subsidy extension would actually become law. 
Sanders said on the Senate floor Sunday that the assurance of a December vote is “a totally meaningless gesture” because he does not believe the Republican-controlled House would actually take up such a measure, nor would Trump sign it into law.

“Tonight was not a good night,” Sanders said in a separate video statement posted to his social media feeds later on Sunday. “This was a very, very bad vote.”
Welch, in an interview Monday afternoon, said he was disappointed that eight of his fellow caucus members backed the GOP-led proposal and said he intended to continue voting against the plan in the coming days.
Reporting by The Hill last week named Welch as one of a group of Democratic senators who had been meeting in the U.S. Capitol to discuss a resolution to the shutdown. The group also included Shaheen, Hassan and King, who ultimately voted for Sunday’s deal.
Welch said Monday that meeting was one of a number of different negotiations he has been part of in recent weeks, with senators from both parties, to attempt to find a breakthrough on the shutdown. He said he had consistently advocated for extending the health care credits in all of those conversations. Once the discussion turned more toward the idea of a future vote on the health insurance subsidies, rather than an extension written into a deal to reopen the government, he said he stepped away.
“That’s when I was unable to continue in those negotiations — because I believe we had to have an outcome that would guarantee relief to the folks in Vermont, and around the country, who depend on these,” the senator said.
It was not entirely clear Monday evening when the Senate would vote again on the possible breakthrough legislation. Assuming it clears the Senate, the measure would then go to the House for further consideration. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Monday told reporters his colleagues should start returning to the Capitol as soon as possible.

Vermont’s sole U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, a Democrat, said in an interview Monday that she thought it was “a mistake” for eight members of her party’s Senate caucus to side with Republicans. Her party needs to “hold the damn line,” she said, as they have done for the past five-plus weeks. The shutdown was in its 41st day on Monday, now by far the longest in U.S. history.
“We’re fools if we think that at this moment, at the eleventh hour, this promise of a vote to extend the ACA subsidies is anything other than just a game,” Balint said. 
She said she did not think Republicans had any viable plan to improve people’s access to health care. Instead, she sees the party’s opposition to making the expanded health insurance subsidies permanent as its latest effort to dismantle key provisions of the Affordable Care Act.
If the version of the deal being advanced in the Senate reaches the House, Balint said Monday, “It’s a ‘hell no’ from me.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-10 23:57:55+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi begins issuing partial SNAP benefits amid federal government shutdown,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/10/mississippi-begins-issuing-partial-snap-benefits/,Confusion over how states should distribute the benefits has mounted in the past week after the Trump administration contested a court order directing the federal government to issue full benefits.,"Mississippi will begin distributing up to 65% of food assistance benefits for the month of November to recipients, the Mississippi Department of Human Services announced Monday. 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits are distributed on a rolling basis between the 4th and 21st of each month. Recipients who were scheduled to receive SNAP benefits earlier this month but have not yet due to the federal government shutdown will begin receiving partial assistance as early as today, the agency said in a press release. Others will receive their benefits on their regularly scheduled date.
Mississippi is distributing up to 65% of SNAP benefits to recipients in accordance with guidance from the United States Department of Agriculture, the federal agency that administers the program, said the state Department of Human Services in a statement. Full benefits will be distributed once the federal government approves their release. 
“Benefit amounts have been set by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service, not MDHS,” the statement said.
Beneficiaries in Mississippi receive $183 on average in food assistance per month, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Partial benefits for the average beneficiary would amount to a loss of about $65 in aid in November. 
“The hardworking families in Mississippi who already struggle to make ends meet and have tight budgets that include SNAP help are relying on them to ensure wellness in their homes,” Dr. Patricia Tibbs, the president of the Mississippi Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, previously told Mississippi Today.
Confusion over how states should distribute the benefits has mounted in the past week after the Trump administration contested a court order directing the federal government to issue full benefits. 
New food assistance benefits have not been issued to Mississippians since Nov. 1. Food assistance has continued to flow in past shutdowns, but the federal government said Oct. 24 that it could not use emergency funds to pay for the program, spurring a legal battle over the paused benefits.
Federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ordered the federal government on Oct. 31 to use emergency funds to continue funding the program after more than two dozen states sued the Trump administration over its refusal to issue the benefits. 
The federal Department of Agriculture initially told states to distribute no more than half of November’s SNAP benefits, before later revising that guidance to instruct states to issue up to 65 percent of benefits. A federal judge in Rhode Island then ordered the agency to fund the program in full. 
The Trump administration released guidance Nov. 7 indicating it was “working towards implementing” full benefits, even as it appealed a court ruling. Twenty states, including New York, California and North Carolina, began to issue full benefits, but after a stay of the order, the administration ordered states to “undo” the issuance of full benefits and warned it would penalize states that proceeded. 
A federal judge then temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ordering states to roll back full SNAP payments. On Monday, the administration returned to the Supreme Court in another attempt to halt full funding for food assistance. 
The federal government shutdown, now reaching 41 days, is the longest in U.S. history, but Congress appeared closer than ever to reaching a resolution on Monday. That latest development came after eight senators broke ranks with Democrats and joined Republicans in a vote to fund the government through Jan. 30 Sunday night. The legislation still needs to pass the House in order for the shutdown to end.
About 1 in 8 Mississippians — over 350,000 people — receive food assistance through SNAP. More than 67% of participants are in households with children, and about 41% are in households with older adults or adults with a disability. In four Mississippi counties, over a third of residents rely on the program to purchase food, according to a report from WLBT. 
Republican Gov. Tate Reeves has previously said he will not move for Mississippi to bridge the gap in the food assistance program until the federal shutdown ends, even though pediatricians and some state legislators urged the governor to do so. 
“There is sadly no simple way for state government to just step in and pay the hundreds of millions of dollars in harm that this shutdown by the Washington Democrats is causing,” he wrote in a social media post Oct. 27. 
The day before benefits were paused, Reeves requested a waiver from the federal government to restrict the use of food assistance benefits to purchase sugary food and drinks. If approved, the changes would take effect in 2027. 
Other changes to SNAP benefits are set to take effect this month as a result of federal budget legislation President Donald Trump signed into law in July. The law increases the existing work requirement’s upper age limit from 54 to 65 and extends the requirement to people who were previously exempt: veterans, those facing homelessness and young people aging out of foster care. There is still a caregiver exemption, but to qualify, parents must have children younger than 14 — down from age 18.
Recipients do not have to do anything to receive their benefits, according to the press release from the state Department of Human Services. They should ensure all household and requested information is up-to-date, complete and scheduled interviews and register for a ConnectEBT account.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/05140357/3X0A2282.jpg,,,2025-11-10 19:57:52.657442

(Getty Images)After facing public outcry, the Salt Lake County Council Republican majority voted to extend the life of four affordable child care centers the county owns and subsidizes until the end of May of 2026 with a rate increase.
The council held a quick special meeting Tuesday where members voted 5-3 to continue the programs that families of 270 children rely on through next year, for an added fee. But, still staring down an end date, parents have only a temporary sense of relief. 
“I think they’re really focusing on kicking this problem down the road, instead of addressing it now,” said Mackenzie Miller, a parent of a 3-year-old who goes to the Magna Recreation Center day care.

According to a child care service analysis the Salt Lake County Council commissioned, monthly rates are different depending on kids’ ages and services, with participating families paying $460 for all-day preschool, $290 for before- and after-school programs, and $470 for summer camp, among other programs. 
County fees are about 50% to 60% below market rates resulting in an annual county subsidy of $2 million, the study says. To close the gap, the county would need to require a minimum 20% annual rate bump for five years. That’s an amount that some parents are willing to pay this year, instead of the full closure of the centers, and come 2026, those who decide to remain at their centers will have to start paying.

Miller is frustrated that the County Council hasn’t entertained any other solutions to keep the centers afloat. “They’re just focused on cutting it,” he said.
“They said, ‘You got two months. We’re closing at the end of the year. Good luck.’ And I was kind of just shocked, really, that they could just do that,” Miller said.
Since the closure decision, parents have been organizing, attending meetings at the county building, and collecting signatures for a petition to keep the centers open.
‘No’ as protest
Democratic council members voted against Republican council member Aimee Winder Newton’s proposal to extend the center’s time out of protest.
“I am grateful that hopefully the result of this vote will give families more time. I think this has been enormously stressful for families,” said council member Suzanne Harrison, a Democrat. “But I plan to vote no out of protest for there hasn’t been a good process to figure out solutions that would have been fiscally sustainable and viable to keep the programs open indefinitely or longer.”
That’s a sentiment Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson shared during the meeting.



Let us know what you think...


 


“I just want to be clear, my position is we should have taken the time necessary to make these day cares viable; look at market forces, indeed ask the families to pay more, set new terms if need be,” Wilson said.
Wilson also cautioned the council that the county’s administration is her role.
“I want to make sure that there’s coordination and understanding from the divisions and departments that work within this space, rather than council members leaning into an administrative role as we look at next steps,” Wilson said.
When the centers’ closure was put up for vote in late October, Republicans said that with $2 million dedicated to 270 kids a year, the county wasn’t being equitable. On Monday council chair Dea Theodore also referred to the nearly 20% tax increase Wilson proposed this year.
This is definitely extending some time for these families, and we do want to help them, too, with this process,” Theodore said. “But I also want to point out that this is due to a tax increase and some failures on the administration by letting it get to this point.”
The council also voted unanimously to work on an incentive for staff members to remain in place during the wind-down period.
​​Sharon Roux, the county’s human resources director said during the meeting “as we have a state licensure requirement, we have to have certain staffing ratios, and so it will be really critical for the viability of this program and to make it available through the end of May that we keep staff in place in order to do that.”
The uncertainty brought by the decision to close the day care centers with little notice has already taken a toll on employees, though, said council member Ross Romero. 
“Besides being a provider, we’re also an employer, and it really does feel like the employees’ voice was not considered very well in this decision to close these day cares,” Romero said, “so much so that we’ve had people already leave the county employment or looking to leave the county employment because of the uncertainty.”

(Photo by Jennifer Smith/CommonWealth Beacon)Massachusetts could render its 2030 climate commitments null and void under new sweeping legislation being fast-tracked by the House, according to a copy of the bill viewed by CommonWealth Beacon.
The measure, led by Rep. Mark Cusack, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, would grant Massachusetts “immunity” should the state miss its target if the top environmental official in Massachusetts attributes that outcome to “the actions or inactions of the federal government.”
In such an instance, the state’s goal to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels would become “advisory in nature and unenforceable.”
These changes to the state’s bedrock climate law, along with other major shifts in state climate policy like offshore wind procurements and energy efficiency funding, are currently under consideration by lawmakers on the House panel and could be quickly advanced.
Cusack is aiming to move the legislation out of the House with a floor vote before lawmakers break for the year on November 19 after a poll of committee members closes on Wednesday. He says he has House Speaker Ron Mariano’s support to do just that, though a spokesperson for the speaker said he hasn’t yet taken an official position.
The bill leaves in place the state’s long-term goal of cutting emissions by 85 percent by 2050.
“The number one goal is to save money and adjust to the reality with clean energy,” Cusack said in an interview. “This is a bill that saves significant money, real hard dollars, that people will see the impact of, while also dealing with the assault we’ve gone through,” he said, referring to moves by the Trump administration to roll back climate initiatives, “and planning for the future by not touching any mandates farther out. We want to get there, but if we’re going to miss our mandates, and it’s not the fault of ours, it’s incumbent on us not to get sued and not have the ratepayers be on the hook.”
The plan reverberating around Beacon Hill, as first reported by CommonWealth Beacon last week, is sure to put lawmakers in a politically difficult position and test their willingness to defend the climate commitments enacted just four years ago. And it forces them to confront the drastic changes President Trump has made to Massachusetts’s efforts to transition to a clean energy economy, including stalled offshore wind permitting and revoked funding for solar energy and electric vehicles, as the onset of winter stokes residents’ anxiety over energy costs.
Cusack’s measure would cap the budget for the state’s energy efficiency program, Mass Save, at $4 billion, marking a $500 million cut from its current budget as approved by the Department of Public Utilities.
The bill would even reduce the already-approved Mass Save budget by more than $300 million over the course of three years until 2027, with a focus on trimming the money that Mass Save spends on marketing and advertising. The program upgrades homes with heat pump installations and weatherization through a collaboration among the state’s utility companies, but it has become a contentious point in the state’s affordability debates because it is funded by ratepayers and appears as a line item on electric bills.
The legislation would similarly render Mass Save’s emissions reduction goals through 2030 — which are currently 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide under the program’s current three-year budget — as “advisory, non-binding, and non-enforceable.” Since buildings are the second-most polluting sector in Massachusetts, the Mass Save goals are a key part of the state’s strategy to meet the overall 2030 targets.
Mass Save delivered $2.8 billion in total benefits last year and has reduced annual electricity consumption dramatically, according to program data.
The bill would also push back the state’s statutory deadline to contract for 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind by two years, from 2027 to 2029, in order to respond to “uncertainty surrounding federal permitting” and “changing market conditions,” according to a bill summary.
The legislation represents Cusack’s overhaul of Gov. Maura Healey’s energy affordability package filed earlier this year, which contained none of these provisions. Cusack’s bill is moving as an entirely new measure outside of regular procedure, meaning he can move on his own track through the House without consent from his counterpart on the joint committee, Sen. Michael Barrett.
In order to become law, however, it would still need Senate approval – likely a long shot.
“People always criticize the process when they can’t criticize the substance of the bill,” Cusack said when asked if the measure is more for messaging or negotiation than something that can become law. “We took the perspective of, what’s a bill that saves the ratepayer money, makes our commitment to clean energy, and our competitiveness economically? That was the focus. It wasn’t a focus of, can I get 21 votes in the Senate? I don’t serve in the Senate. Not my monkey, not my circus.”
Still, the fact that such a measure appears to be advancing in the House is a sign of just how far the pendulum has swung on climate policy and a renewed sensitivity to the costs of clean power.
Healey didn’t directly address the House plan when asked at a press conference on Monday as her legislation devolves into a broader fight over climate goals.
“I haven’t seen the outlines of any specific plan on that,” she said, adding that she’s going to continue to work with the Legislature on her energy affordability bill. “There are other things in that legislation that will, right now, help us reduce energy costs. That’s what we’ve got to focus on,” Healey said.
The new measure from Cusack is bound to further upset climate advocates and progressives in Massachusetts, some of whom are already urging action in response.
Sierra Club Massachusetts, Mass Power Forward, and Progressive Mass have all mobilized their networks to contact state lawmakers just since Friday to express their opposition to the House bill.
The measure would also make reforms to various agencies and the utilities, including a proposal similar to Healey’s to expand the state’s ability to procure clean energy. That provision would set the Department of Energy Resources on a path to procure 10,000 megawatts of solar and 10,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2040.
DPU would also no longer be required to calculate the social value of greenhouse gas emissions when evaluating cost-effectiveness of the Mass Save program and other efforts to reduce energy demand.
And the legislation cuts the amount of clean energy that utilities must purchase in Massachusetts each year from a 3 percent annual increase to 1 percent until 2033.
On solar power, Cusack is also aiming to reduce net-metering compensation rates and raise a limit on municipal solar generation from 10 megawatts to 20 megawatts, a cap that has been cause for concern for cities and towns around the state.
“These are hard savings coming back to the ratepayers here, and that’s what drove this bill,” Cusack said. “That was the number one goal from the onset and from my appointment [to this committee] and my charge from the Speaker and the rest of the House: How do we save people money? How do we lower our energy costs? How do we make sure that our energy costs aren’t a major hindrance to affordability of living, to doing business? And what does that mean long term for our economy, where we still want to be a hub of clean tech and clean energy and move away from fossil fuels?”

The memo had left states unsure how to proceed, and some refused to obey it.President Donald Trump and top administration officials have resisted calls to fund November SNAP benefits during the shutdown that began Oct. 1. They argue that because Congress had not appropriated any money for the program for the fiscal year that began that date, USDA lacked the legal authority to make payments. That position was a reversal from the first Trump administration’s 2019 guidance and a shutdown plan the department published Sept. 30, then deleted, and has sparked several court challenges.About 42 million people, about 1 in 8 Americans, use SNAP. Monday was the 41st day of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.Trump attorney seeks high court pauseIn an afternoon brief following his morning notice to the high court, U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer largely repeated the argument he made in an initial appeal to the high court Nov. 7. Sauer said courts could not command the USDA to “raid” a fund for child nutrition programs that holds about $23 billion, so as to fund a roughly $4 billion shortfall for SNAP in the short term.He added Monday that the lower courts’ orders threaten to derail a deal in the Senate to reopen the government, expected to be completed this week.“Literally at the eleventh hour, those orders inject the federal courts into the political branches’ closing efforts to end this shutdown,” Sauer wrote. “But the answer to this crisis is not for federal courts to reallocate resources without lawful authority. The only way to end this crisis—which the Executive is adamant to end—is for Congress to reopen the government.”Sauer’s brief came after Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson ordered the government to say how it would proceed in light of the 1st Circuit order late Sunday and gave the coalition of nonprofit groups and municipal government that brought the original suit until 8 a.m. Eastern on Tuesday to respond.Massachusetts federal judge slams USDAAt an afternoon hearing in Massachusetts, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani denounced USDA’s Saturday night demand that states return authorized funding and maintained a temporary restraining order blocking it from going into effect.The Saturday night memo called on states to “immediately undo” actions to send benefits to people who use SNAP.But the states had been complying with a midday Nov. 7 memo from the same department official that instructed them to process full benefits in accordance with the Rhode Island order, Talwani said. “What you have right now is confusion of the agency's own making,” Talwani said.Keith Becker, who represented the administration in the hearing, said that guidance was meant to keep states from distributing benefits while the Supreme Court stay, issued late Nov. 7, was in place. Minnesota authorized benefits after the Supreme Court order, he said.Talwani said he had provided no evidence of that.Becker also said Wisconsin, Oregon and Michigan sent out benefits between the time of the Rhode Island order and the Nov. 7 guidance telling states to issue benefits, but Talwani said they were complying with the Rhode Island court order.The Saturday letter to states was inappropriate, she added.“It seems to me that the states acted fairly reasonably to follow your Nov. 7 guideline,” she said. “Even if there is a mistake here, the notion that the next move, on Saturday night, is a blustering order, that they're all going to be sued, and this thing and that thing — we're trying to get … benefits to people who need food.”She also said the administration appeared to be using Americans who use SNAP as political leverage, noting that even as the shutdown appears near its end, the administration was refusing to transfer reserve money from a fund that had enough to stay solvent into the spring.“You've chosen not to pay your benefits at this point, and it's hard to see how it's not just being used as a leverage point,” she said. “I understand that there's nice language about saying it’s for child nutrition, but it doesn't really ring true right now.”Appeals court rulingFederal courts have issued a flurry of rulings on the matter since groups, cities and Democratic states sued to force Trump to release November benefits late last month. The late Sunday ruling came from a three-judge panel of the 1st Circuit, which upheld a Thursday order from U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. that the government forfeited its option to issue partial November benefits when it missed a Nov. 5 deadline McConnell had set.USDA had argued that making partial SNAP payments, which it had never done before, would be difficult. But it made no plans to prepare those partial benefits nearly a month into the shutdown, Judge Julie Rikelman wrote in the panel’s opinion.“The record here shows that the government sat on its hands for nearly a month, unprepared to make partial payments, while people who rely on SNAP received no benefits a week into November and counting,” Rikelman wrote. “In light of these unique facts, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in requiring full payment of November SNAP benefits.”The U.S. Senate is expected to vote Monday night on a bill to end the shutdown. The measure is likely to pass after advancing in a key procedural vote Sunday, but the House would still need to clear it and Trump would have to sign it before the government will reopen.

The Trump administration would rather preserve its own sense of power than preserve the lives and wellbeing of hungry Americans.” Republicans have blamed Democrats for the lack of benefits payments, which they say could have been avoided if enough Senate Democrats voted with Republicans for a bill that would have temporarily reopened the government at current spending levels. California Democrat Adam Schiff “voted against funding SNAP 15 times,” the Senate GOP X account wrote in response to a tweet from Schiff. “If he wants to fund SNAP, he should join the eight other Democrats who have voted to reopen the government instead.All but three Senate Democrats voted against the measure in 14 consecutive votes. Most continued to oppose the 15th vote Sunday, but seven Democrats and independent Sen.

(Photo by Allan Swart/Getty Images)A federal judge on Monday again converted a temporary restraining order to a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a state law that requires displays of the Ten Commandments in public schools. 
The injunction applies to the Lakeside School District. U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks allowed the Garland County district to be added as a defendant in the lawsuit and ordered the displays to be removed from its schools last month.
Arkansas Attorney Tim Griffin immediately appealed the decision to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Seven families of various religious and nonreligious backgrounds filed the original lawsuit against four Northwest Arkansas school districts. They argued that Act 573 of 2025, which requires public schools to “prominently” display a “historical representation” of the Ten Commandments in classrooms and libraries, was unconstitutional because it violated their First Amendment rights. 
Brooks agreed, and issued a preliminary injunction in August to block the law from being enforced in those four districts. The Conway School District was later added as a defendant in the case. Brooks issued a temporary restraining order against the Central Arkansas district, which he converted into a preliminary injunction in September.

In his two-page ruling Monday, Brooks noted that Lakeside was the only one of the school district defendants that filed a response opposing a motion for a preliminary injunction. The district adopted and incorporated arguments raised by the Conway School District, he said.
“The Court already explained why Conway’s arguments were either moot or nonsensical…and the same reasoning applies to Lakeside,” Brooks wrote. 
The state, which is being represented by Griffin, also submitted a brief urging the court to reconsider its decision to block the districts’ compliance with the new state law. However, Brooks said the state offered no new law to support its request. 
Additionally, Brooks said the Lakeside plaintiffs who were added to the case last month — Christine Benson and her minor child, B.B. — are similarly situated to all other plaintiffs in the lawsuit, and the new state law is “likely to substantially interfere with her ability to direct the religious upbringing of her child and to violate their First Amendment rights.” 
“The Court also rejects the State’s request for a more tailored ‘bubble injunction’ that would apply only to B.B.’s classrooms; such tailoring would be infeasible, unworkable, and inadequate to completely relieve the injury to Ms. Benson’s and B.B.’s religious rights,” Brooks wrote. 
The converted preliminary injunction will remain effective “until this matter is decided on the merits,” according to Monday’s order.

(Getty Images)LINCOLN — In 1981, then-Nebraska Gov. Charlie Thone was asked to submit three nominees to fill a vacancy on the state’s slice of the U.S. District Court.
His three nominees were “Arlen Beam, C.A. Beam and Clarence Arlen Beam.”
“He was my unanimous choice,” he told an interviewer later.
Beam ended up serving 38 years on the federal bench, eventually joining the prestigious U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit.
The judge died Oct. 31 at the age of 95.

Beam is remembered as having an ideal temperament for a judge who never forgot his small town upbringing in the Sandhills ranching town of Stapleton.
His pathway to the bench was unconventional. After graduating from the University of Nebraska in 1951 with an ROTC commission, he was called to serve in the Korean War.
At the time, any officer could represent an enlisted man in a court martial procedure. Beam’s first case ended in an acquittal, which he joked was his “first mistake,” because he got more and more cases referred to him, he said in an article eight years ago in the Nebraska Alumni Association magazine.
After learning that he loved practicing law and finishing his service in Korea, Beam enrolled at the NU School of Law in 1953. But the rigors of working full time to support his family, law school homework and his wife’s health problems became too much. He dropped out and took a job working for a seed corn company.
Ultimately, he returned to law school, graduating at age 35. Beam initially worked for the Lincoln law firm of Chambers, Holland & Dudgeon, which later became Knudsen, Berkheimer, Endacott & Beam.
He was active in Republican politics, serving as campaign director in 1964 for Barry Goldwater, and helped Thone as a legal advisor win the GOP’s nomination to become the party’s candidate for U.S. House of Representatives in 1970.
A former law colleague, Larry Ruth of Lincoln, said Beam taught him a lot about the art of lobbying and to use “an abundance of caution” by being thoroughly prepared for a case.
Beam grew up on a ranch, played 6-man football in Stapleton, which had a population of 350 then, and subscribed to the “Stapleton Enterprise” newspaper until his death.
“He never lost track of the fact that he was from Stapleton and that he learned a lot of things from Stapleton about what’s right and wrong and how to work,” Ruth said.
Thone, in the Nebraska Alumni Association article, told reporter Charlyne Berens that Beam had the ideal disposition to become a judge. Ruth said he never recalled hearing Beam raise his voice.
On the federal bench, Beam wrote more than 2,700 opinions, according to an obituary on Wyuka.com. The cases ranged from the Kansas City school district’s desegregation plan and a sexual harassment lawsuit involving then Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton to the viability of federal laws that criminalized medical marijuana in California.
The judge took senior status in 2001, but continued to participate in rulings until retiring from the bench in 2020.
He and his wife of 74 years, Betty, raised five boys. She passed away in May.
A public memorial service for the judge and his wife is planned for noon on Nov. 21 at Eastridge Presbyterian Church, 1135 Eastridge Drive, in Lincoln. Burial will be private.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma again could see a push to open a religious charter school, with a Florida-based Jewish organization expressing intent to apply for state authorization.
If approved, Ben Gamla Jewish Charter School would operate as an online-based virtual charter school teaching Jewish religious studies and Oklahoma academic standards.
A previous attempt to open a publicly funded Catholic charter school in the state failed before the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year. A deadlocked vote upheld the Oklahoma Supreme Court’s ruling against St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School.
Leading the effort is the National Ben Gamla Jewish Charter School Foundation, which has opened six non-religious Hebrew-English charter schools in Florida. 
Peter Deutsch, a former Democratic U.S. representative and the founder of Ben Gamla schools, submitted a letter of intent on Nov. 3 to apply for charter authorization with the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board. A formal application has not yet been submitted for the school, and the board cannot take a vote until that happens.
“Ben Gamla envisions Oklahoma students gaining a rigorous, values-based education that integrates general academic excellence with Jewish religious learning and ethical development,” Deutsch wrote.

The Statewide Charter School Board backed local Catholic leaders’ attempt to open a religious, taxpayer-funded school. In 2023, a previous version of the board, which at the time focused solely on virtual charter schools, cast the landmark vote to approve St. Isidore’s founding application. The school quickly became entangled in multiple lawsuits and never opened its doors.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa have ended their pursuit of charter-school funding and are now opening a private online school called St. Carlo Acutis Classical Academy. 
Brett Farley, a member of St. Isidore’s board of directors, is listed in Deutsch’s letter as part of the Oklahoma Jewish school’s founding team. He declined to comment Monday.
The school’s founders are aiming to open with 40 students by the 2026-27 academic year, according to Deutsch’s letter. The state board, though, typically requires at least 18 months of preparation between the date a charter’s application was submitted and its first day of school.
Board chairperson Brian Shellem said he hasn’t yet read Deutsch’s letter of intent, but he didn’t dismiss the idea of another religious charter applicant.
“We’re going to consider their application,” Shellem said. “I think we need to give everyone an unbiased approach. Before we look at their (letter of intent), before we look at their application, I’m not going to prejudge something. I haven’t seen it.”

The Catholic charter school had staunch support from Gov. Kevin Stitt and other state leaders, who said it would expand quality education options for Oklahoma families. St. Isidore would have been the first charter school in the nation to advocate for a particular religion while relying chiefly on taxpayer funds. 
Attorney General Gentner Drummond led the legal fight against the school, contending it would “eviscerate” constitutional church-state separation.
“This matter has already been resolved after the state Supreme Court’s ruling to prevent taxpayer funded religious charter schools was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year,” Leslie Berger, a spokesperson for the attorney general, said Monday. “Our office will oppose any attempts to undermine the rule of law.”
Including the Ben Gamla school, the Statewide Charter School Board received eight letters of intent from potential applicants this year, an unusually high number that executive director Rebecca Wilkinson said is an “anomaly.” None but the Jewish school indicated they would adopt a religion.
Two applications have already been submitted — one from Southwest Academy Charter School and another from Tempo Montessori Charter School. 
The board has 90 days after receiving an application to consider it. Shellem said votes on Southwest Academy and Tempo Montessori are “more than likely not” happening until 2026.
Moore Public Schools has already rejected Southwest Academy’s application to open with a classical-education-inspired curriculum. That rejection is a necessary step before a brick-and-mortar charter can apply at the state level. Virtual charter schools can apply directly to the state board.
Southwest Academy’s board president, Angie Ritter, said the school’s projected enrollment is 160 students in pre-K through second grade starting in August 2027. The founders are in lease negotiations with Regency Park Baptist Church for a school location, she said.

The charter academy would create another option for Moore parents who are priced out of private education and are unable to homeschool, Ritter said in a presentation to the state board.
“We believe that we can meet this need head-on by removing all of the financial barriers that would be there for parents and give them a high-quality option that’s tuition free,” she said.
Tempo Montessori would operate within the district boundaries of Union Public Schools in Tulsa. Union’s school board rejected its charter application on Oct. 20.
Tempo’s founding executive director Diane Beckham established the state’s first public Montessori school at Emerson Elementary in Tulsa Public Schools. She and TPS later opened two more programs within the district with the hands-on, student-led style of Montessori instruction. 
Opening a charter school would grant greater flexibility than operating as part of a school district, Beckham told the Statewide Charter School Board in a presentation Monday.
Every child learns at his or her own pace, she said, hence the name Tempo. 
The school is preparing to operate out of Destiny Church in Broken Arrow with a year-round calendar, featuring no breaks longer than four weeks. Beckham projected a year-one enrollment of 150 students in pre-K, kindergarten and sixth grade.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-10 23:41:03+00:00,CT Mirror,Swelling CT revenues could intensify response to federal cuts,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/10/swelling-ct-revenues-could-intensify-response-to-federal-cuts/,The CT revenue projections — about $1.1 billion in extra revenue this fiscal year — likely will expand calls for more state tax cuts.,"Already anticipating huge surpluses this budget cycle and next, Connecticut’s coffers will swell even more, state analysts projected Monday, thanks to surging income and business tax receipts tied to a robust stock market in 2025.
The swelling projections — about $1.1 billion in extra revenue this fiscal year and an average of $500 million more in each of the next two — likely will expand calls for further state tax cuts and greater investments in human service programs to assist Connecticut households strained by tightening federal budget policies.
“Today’s consensus revenue forecast shows continued economic growth in Connecticut for families and businesses alike,” Gov. Ned Lamont said late Monday after his budget staff and the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis released their first joint revenue forecast for the fiscal year. The two agencies will revise those projections twice more before the budget year ends June 30, on Jan. 15 and on April 30.
The new report does show that federal cuts to the corporate tax rate effectively will cost Connecticut hundreds of millions in state receipts from major companies over the coming years. But that will be more than offset by Wall Street, and by steadier and less flashy growth in sales tax receipts and income tax payments from wages and general earnings.
“While our state’s economy will always be influenced by external factors,” Lamont added, “we in Connecticut are staying on the right track where we can control our future.”
Analysts: Revenues grow through the 2020s
At first glance, Connecticut’s budget is taking a hit this fiscal year.
The General Fund, which represents about 90% of the $27.2 billion overall state budget and covers most operating expenses, will collect $135 million less than analysts had projected. The fund, previous projected to finish $322 million in the black, now should have about $190 million left over.
President Donald Trump and Congress adopted a broad series of household and corporate income tax reductions last July, paying for a portion of them with deep cuts to Medicaid and other human service programs.
And because Connecticut links its corporate tax system to the federal code — as do several other states — analysts say those changes will cost Connecticut more than $100 million, on average, across this fiscal year and the next two.
But just outside the formal budget, there is good news that overwhelms the bad.
Since 2017, Connecticut has used a special savings program that captures much of its income and business tax receipts linked to investment earnings before they even arrive in the formal budget, so legislators cannot spend them.
And the forecast released Monday says this category will generate almost $1.1 billion more than expected this year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Monday up almost 7% for 2025. The Standard and Poor’s 500, another key market index, closed up almost 14% for the year.
Given that projected savings and the General Fund’s estimated operating balance, Connecticut now expects to close its books June 30 with about $2 billion unspent, one of the largest surpluses in state history and greater than the $1.8 billion cushion the state has averaged since 2017, when aggressive new budget caps were established.
Analysts also boosted their expectations for total state revenues by more than $650 million next fiscal year and by another $350 million in 2027-28.
CT lawmakers eye tax relief, more state services, to counter federal cuts
Majority Democrats in the General Assembly have become increasingly critical of these surpluses, which have been used chiefly to build reserves and reduce Connecticut’s hefty pension debt.
Many Democratic lawmakers and progressive organizations argue the savings program is excessive and should be scaled back some to restore more funds for education, health care, municipal aid and other core services.
“These [revenue] numbers show what our coalition has been saying for years: our problem in Connecticut is the lack of political will to spend the money we already have. It’s time for our governor and his budget team to put families first and reconsider the fiscal roadblocks so we can stop hoarding money and start responding to the needs in our communities, which get worse every year,” said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All, a progressive coalition of more than 60 faith, labor and other civic organizations.
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, has been one of the budget cap’s chief defenders, often teaming with minority Republicans to argue they should be changed little or not at all.
Many of Lamont’s fellow Democrats in the legislature’s majority argue it’s excessive, pulling too much revenue from education, health care and other core services.
But while the GOP has been wary to ease budget caps to increase spending, more Republicans are talking about saving less — if it means Connecticut can finance more state tax cuts.
House Republicans last month proposed what would amount to one of the largest state income tax cuts in Connecticut history.
The GOP wants to boost an income tax credit that offsets a portion of middle-class households’ municipal property tax bill from a maximum of $300 to as much as $1,000. The initiative would cost the state, Republicans estimate, about $500 million per year.
“We need property tax relief, and our caucus stands by that,” House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said Monday, adding that Republicans will push hard for this when the regular 2026 legislative session opens Feb. 4. “Our property taxes have been squeezed to the bone, and people cannot pay the levels they’ve been required to pay to maintain public services.”
Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the tax-writing Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, said Monday she expects lawmakers from both parties will seek state tax relief to help Connecticut households hurt by federal cuts to human service programs.
“I’m sure there will be” bipartisan interest, she said, “particularly given the volatility at the federal level and what we anticipate to be pretty massive costs inflicted on us by federal policies. Our [budget caps] will be under pressure.”
Many legislators also are expected to call for greater state spending as well, though, in the coming years, with a particular focus on Medicaid, a massive health care program that faces deep federal cuts in 2027 and 2028.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_009-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 18:57:28.703208

This story was originally by The 19th.
The Supreme Court will not hear a case to overturn marriage equality, it announced on Monday. The justices have rejected a petition from Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue licenses in the state a decade ago.
Davis’ petition has been closely watched, but was seen as a long shot.
For the past decade, Davis  has been battling against giving marriage licenses to same-sex couples. She was jailed for six days and fined $100,000 plus attorney’s fees for refusing to do so.
It is the second time Davis petitioned the court to hear her case. She made similar arguments five years ago, and the court also declined to take up the case then.
“Davis possesses a sincerely held religious belief that marriage is a union between one man and one woman,” her petition to the high court stated.
She was largely viewed as one of few Americans with legal standing to challenge the 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that made marriage equality the law of the land.  But LGBTQ+ legal scholars have stated that her legal standing was still shaky and that the foundation for marriage equality remains strong.
Still, Kevin Jennings, CEO of Lambda Legal, the nation’s largest LGBTQ+ legal organization said in a statement that now is not a time for LGBTQ+ advocates to let their guard down.
“This frivolous case now belongs in the trash bin of history,” Jennings said. “But let’s not be naïve: our opponents are well-resourced and determined.”
A majority of Americans would lose access to marriage equality if Obergefell  was overturned; 35 states have either a constitutional ban on marriage equality or a statute prohibiting LGBTQ+ couples from marrying. Some have both.
However, in 2022, Congress passed the Respect for Marriage Act, a law that forces states to recognize out-of-state marriages and that grandfathers pre-existing same-sex marriages into law. As a result, married LGBTQ+ couples would remain married and couples wanting to get married could do so by traveling to other states that allow marriage equality.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LGBT-1024x679-1.jpg,,,2025-11-10 18:57:28.703208
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-10 23:40:03+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,House moves forward with bill to weaken 2030 climate goals,Jordan Wolman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/energy/house-moves-forward-with-bill-to-weaken-2030-climate-goals/,"The plan reverberating around Beacon Hill, as first reported by CommonWealth Beacon last week, is sure to put lawmakers in a politically difficult position and test their willingness to defend the climate commitments enacted just four years ago.","MASSACHUSETTS COULD RENDER its 2030 climate commitments null and void under new sweeping legislation being fast-tracked by the House, according to a copy of the bill viewed by CommonWealth Beacon.  
The measure, led by Rep. Mark Cusack, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, would grant Massachusetts “immunity” should the state miss its target if the top environmental official in Massachusetts attributes that outcome to “the actions or inactions of the federal government.” 
In such an instance, the state’s goal to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels would become “advisory in nature and unenforceable.” 
These changes to the state’s bedrock climate law, along with other major shifts in state climate policy like offshore wind procurements and energy efficiency funding, are currently under consideration by lawmakers on the House panel and could be quickly advanced. 
Cusack is aiming to move the legislation out of the House with a floor vote before lawmakers break for the year on November 19 after a poll of committee members closes on Wednesday. He says he has House Speaker Ron Mariano’s support to do just that, though a spokesperson for the speaker said he hasn’t yet taken an official position. 
The bill leaves in place the state’s long-term goal of cutting emissions by 85 percent by 2050. 
“The number one goal is to save money and adjust to the reality with clean energy,” Cusack said in an interview. “This is a bill that saves significant money, real hard dollars, that people will see the impact of, while also dealing with the assault we’ve gone through,” he said, referring to moves by the Trump administration to roll back climate initiatives, “and planning for the future by not touching any mandates farther out. We want to get there, but if we’re going to miss our mandates, and it’s not the fault of ours, it’s incumbent on us not to get sued and not have the ratepayers be on the hook.” 
The plan reverberating around Beacon Hill, as first reported by CommonWealth Beacon last week, is sure to put lawmakers in a politically difficult position and test their willingness to defend the climate commitments enacted just four years ago. And it forces them to confront the drastic changes President Trump has made to Massachusetts’s efforts to transition to a clean energy economy, including stalled offshore wind permitting and revoked funding for solar energy and electric vehicles, as the onset of winter stokes residents’ anxiety over energy costs. 
Cusack’s measure would cap the budget for the state’s energy efficiency program, Mass Save, at $4 billion, marking a $500 million cut from its current budget as approved by the Department of Public Utilities.  
The bill would even reduce the already-approved Mass Save budget by more than $300 million over the course of three years until 2027, with a focus on trimming the money that Mass Save spends on marketing and advertising. The program upgrades homes with heat pump installations and weatherization through a collaboration among the state’s utility companies, but it has become a contentious point in the state’s affordability debates because it is funded by ratepayers and appears as a line item on electric bills.  
The legislation would similarly render Mass Save’s emissions reduction goals through 2030 — which are currently 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide under the program’s current three-year budget — as “advisory, non-binding, and non-enforceable.” Since buildings are the second-most polluting sector in Massachusetts, the Mass Save goals are a key part of the state’s strategy to meet the overall 2030 targets. 
Mass Save delivered $2.8 billion in total benefits last year and has reduced annual electricity consumption dramatically, according to program data. 
The bill would also push back the state’s statutory deadline to contract for 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind by two years, from 2027 to 2029, in order to respond to “uncertainty surrounding federal permitting” and “changing market conditions,” according to a bill summary. 
The legislation represents Cusack’s overhaul of Gov. Maura Healey’s energy affordability package filed earlier this year, which contained none of these provisions. Cusack’s bill is moving as an entirely new measure outside of regular procedure, meaning he can move on his own track through the House without consent from his counterpart on the joint committee, Sen. Michael Barrett.  
In order to become law, however, it would still need Senate approval – likely a long shot.  
“People always criticize the process when they can’t criticize the substance of the bill,” Cusack said when asked if the measure is more for messaging or negotiation than something that can become law. “We took the perspective of, what’s a bill that saves the ratepayer money, makes our commitment to clean energy, and our competitiveness economically? That was the focus. It wasn’t a focus of, can I get 21 votes in the Senate? I don’t serve in the Senate. Not my monkey, not my circus.” 
Still, the fact that such a measure appears to be advancing in the House is a sign of just how far the pendulum has swung on climate policy and a renewed sensitivity to the costs of clean power.  
Healey didn’t directly address the House plan when asked at a press conference on Monday as her legislation devolves into a broader fight over climate goals. 
“I haven’t seen the outlines of any specific plan on that,” she said, adding that she’s going to continue to work with the Legislature on her energy affordability bill. “There are other things in that legislation that will, right now, help us reduce energy costs. That’s what we’ve got to focus on.”  
The new measure from Cusack is bound to further upset climate advocates and progressives in Massachusetts, some of whom are already urging action in response.  
Sierra Club Massachusetts, Mass Power Forward, and Progressive Mass have all mobilized their networks to contact state lawmakers just since Friday to express their opposition to the House bill.  
The measure would also make reforms to various agencies and the utilities, including a proposal similar to Healey’s to expand the state’s ability to procure clean energy. That provision would set the Department of Energy Resources on a path to procure 10,000 megawatts of solar and 10,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2040.  
DPU would also no longer be required to calculate the social value of greenhouse gas emissions when evaluating cost-effectiveness of the Mass Save program and other efforts to reduce energy demand.  
And the legislation cuts the amount of clean energy that utilities must purchase in Massachusetts each year from a 3 percent annual increase to 1 percent until 2033.  
On solar power, Cusack is also aiming to reduce net-metering compensation rates and raise a limit on municipal solar generation from 10 megawatts to 20 megawatts, a cap that has been cause for concern for cities and towns around the state.  
“These are hard savings coming back to the ratepayers here, and that’s what drove this bill,” Cusack said. “That was the number one goal from the onset and from my appointment [to this committee] and my charge from the Speaker and the rest of the House: How do we save people money? How do we lower our energy costs? How do we make sure that our energy costs aren’t a major hindrance to affordability of living, to doing business? And what does that mean long term for our economy, where we still want to be a hub of clean tech and clean energy and move away from fossil fuels?”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_6282-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C576&amp;quality=89&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-10 18:57:28.703208

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)KEOSAUQUA — Before heading back to Washington, D.C., to vote on a measure to end the government shutdown, U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks faced a fiery crowd Monday at a town hall in Keosauqua.
Members of the audience yelled as the Republican representative spoke about her support of Medicaid changes made in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. She also discussed her position on Democrats’ calls to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits.
The event came as the U.S. Senate moved Monday toward approving stopgap funding measures to reopen the government until Jan. 30, approaching the end of the longest shutdown in national history. Senate Democrats had refused to advance stopgap spending bills if enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, set to expire at the end of the year, were not extended. On Sunday, seven Senate Democrats and one independent voted to advance a continuing resolution that did not include language on the ACA tax credits, though Republican leadership has promised a future vote will be held on the issue.
Regardless of the Senate’s action, the continuing resolution to end the shutdown must also get House approval before heading to President Donald Trump. Miller-Meeks told the crowd in Keosauqua she would be heading back to Washington, D.C., to vote on the measure following the town hall.
“As a matter of fact, just a few hours ago, we were on a conference call with Speaker (Mike) Johnson and he wants us to return to D.C. now,” Miller-Meeks said. “I wasn’t going to cancel this town hall. So we’ve committed to doing this, and then we’ll head back to D.C. and hopefully, as early as possible, it’ll be on Wednesday that we would have a vote on funding the government.”
Democrats’ criticize lack of public forums
Democrats have criticized Miller-Meeks for saying at a Johnson County Republicans of Iowa meeting in August she would hold public town halls “when hell freezes over.” While Miller-Meeks has held town halls remotely in recent weeks, including a telephone town hall Oct. 15 with 10,700 participants, the Keosauqua event was her first in-person public town hall this year.
Katie Smith, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a statement Miller-Meeks’ town hall shows that she is not committed to being easily accessible to her constituents.
“Mariannette Miller-Meeks told Iowans she won’t do her job until hell freezes over,” Smith said in a statement. “That’s the kind of representation Iowans have come to expect from Miller-Meeks: the rare instances she does show up, it’s paying meaningless lip service to Iowans while making it as difficult as possible for them to see her in public and hold her accountable.”
House GOP campaign officials told members of the caucus earlier in the year to avoid hosting in-person town halls, as Republican members of Congress across the country have faced angry crowds at public meetings who are upset with cuts to public programs like SNAP and Medicaid as well as actions taken by the Trump administration. Iowa’s U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst gained national attention for saying, “well, we all are going to die,” at a May town hall when a woman shouted that people will die because of the Medicaid cuts made in the budget reconciliation law.
Health care debate contentious
Dissatisfaction with Republican policies on health care were also a major point of contention at the Monday town hall. Kadie Johansson, the general manager of KILJ Radio, moderated the event, reading questions written down by Iowa 1st Congressional District residents, which included several questions about Medicaid.
The audience cheered when Johansson read a question asking, “Why did you allow your committee to put in place the largest cuts to Medicaid in the program’s entire history?” Miller-Meeks responded by thanking the crowd for cheering for the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee’s vote to “strengthen and preserve Medicaid” through implementing work requirements and removing coverage for immigrants who lack legal residency status and ineligible people.
Congressional Budget Office estimates found the changes to Medicaid made in the budget reconciliation bill will reduce spending on the program by $625 billion over 10 years. Miller-Meeks said current spending on the program is “unsustainable,” and that the changes are a way to ensure the health coverage program’s continued existence to provide health care for “those who Medicaid was intended for: children, pregnant women, those with disabilities and those seniors or veterans who are dual-eligible.”
Another question raised reports that health care premiums will double for people covered through Health Insurance Marketplaces unless the enhanced tax credits are extended.
Miller-Meeks said there was misinformation circulating about Democrats’ calls to extend these ACA tax credits, saying the subsidies in question were put in place to assist health insurance companies during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“What expired was COVID-era enhanced premium tax cuts, where that money goes directly to profitable insurance companies,” Miller-Meeks said. “It was a corporate welfare bailout to the health insurance companies done by the Democrats in 2021. … They were then redone in 2022 through the (Inflation Reduction Act). Those are enhanced premium tax credits. It’s minimal number of people … the ACA premium tax credits were not changed. That’s in the regular appropriation process.”
She said Republicans have lowered costs for people in need through the increased tax subsidies for children and senior citizens through the budget reconciliation bill, but said the ACA subsidies were unchanged in the GOP spending plan.
At an October fundraiser, Miller-Meeks told supporters that she did not support Democrats’ shutdown demands on extending the tax credits after they lost control of both chambers of Congress in the 2024 election.
“I don’t like Democrats shutting down the government over something that they could not get done when they had the House, the Senate and the White House, and now they expect us to do their job for them,” Miller-Meeks said in October. “They expect us to extend something that they couldn’t do themselves.”
Other questions focused on Trump and his administration’s policies, with several constituents saying the president’s tariff policies have negatively impacted Iowa farmers. The Iowa Republican said she believes tariffs “can be a negotiating tool,” and said she believes many of the issues farmers are facing are due to high input costs, which she said “occurred when we had record-high inflation under the Biden administration.” She also emphasized there has not been a vote on tariffs in the House.
Additionally, there were multiple questions with calls for Miller-Meeks to support the release of the “Epstein files,” or Department of Justice information on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Miller-Meeks said she supports releasing information on Epstein, but said there needs to be a larger focus on protecting Epstein’s victims in these discussions.
The race for Iowa’s 1st Congressional District is expected to be one of the most competitive in the nation in 2026, with political forecasters like Cook Political Report rating the race as a “toss-up.” Miller-Meeks has won reelection with tight margins in recent election cycles, winning against Democrat Christina Bohannan in 2024 by less than 800 votes. She won her first election to the U.S. House in 2020 by just six votes.
Bohannan is running again to challenge Miller-Meeks in 2026. There are also two other Democrats competing to become the candidate to face her in the general election — Travis Terrell and Taylor Wettach. Republican David Pautsch, who also ran for the seat in 2024, is running a primary campaign against Miller-Meeks in the upcoming election.

Caleb Hemmer, a Nashville Democrat, announced on Nov. 10 he will not run for a third term in office. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Democratic Rep. Caleb Hemmer of Nashville is set to leave the Tennessee legislature after two terms.
Hemmer, who represents District 59 in southern Davidson County, announced Monday he will not seek a third two-year term in 2026.
A healthcare executive, Hemmer said he wants to spend more time with his two children and wife and meet work commitments as well.
Hemmer passed bills dealing with maternal health, university-sponsored lab schools, affordable housing and children’s mental health.
“These were all promises I made during my campaign, and I’ve stayed focused on delivering real legislation that makes a real difference in the lives of Tennesseans,” he said in a statement.
Hemmer made some noise as a lawmaker when he filed an ethics complaint against Education Commissioner Lizzette Reynolds for allowing ExcelinEd, a pro-charter and pro-voucher group that previously employed her, to pay for two out-of-state conferences.
The Tennessee Ethics Commission dismissed the complaint, mainly because she paid back more than $2,000 to the organization. She was later reimbursed by the state.
Acceptance of such a gift from groups that hire lobbyists is a violation of state law and an order by Gov. Bill Lee. The governor also ran afoul of state ethics laws by allowing Alliance Defending Freedom, an Arizona-based conservative Christian group, to fund his expenses to speak at a summer conference in South Florida. The group used a state lobbyist to push bills, but Lee refused to repay the money because it had a 501(c)3 nonprofit tax designation.
In Hemmer’s parting statement, he urged constituents to continue holding elected officials “to the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct.”

Tony Evers reiterated Monday that Wisconsin won’t pull back the money that the state distributed to its FoodShare program late last week. “They [the federal government] want that money back — they’re not getting it back,” Evers said in a short news conference at a La Crosse food bank. “It’s for the people that […]","Gov. Tony Evers speaks to reporters at a food pantry in La Crosse on Monday. (Screenshot/CSPAN)Gov. Tony Evers reiterated Monday that Wisconsin won’t pull back the money that the state distributed to its FoodShare program late last week.
“They [the federal government] want that money back — they’re not getting it back,” Evers said in a short news conference at a La Crosse food bank. “It’s for the people that are part of this program.”
The Evers administration moved swiftly Thursday evening to funnel $104.4 million to Wisconsin’s FoodShare program after a federal court ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to fully fund November Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments.
Wisconsin FoodShare participants spent $9.9 million of the benefits on groceries Friday, according to the Evers administration.
By Monday, however, the administration said that it was lacking sufficient SNAP funds to reimburse retailers after the U.S. Treasury blocked the federal benefits payment to Wisconsin on Friday.
USDA said it would fully fund November’s SNAP payments in response to Thursday’s court order. Instead, however, the Trump administration petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the order and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson put it on hold for 48 hours.
On Saturday the Trump administration directed states to return a portion of their SNAP funds to the federal government.
“No,” Evers declared in response.
On Monday, Wisconsin joined more than two dozen states in a motion filed in federal court in Massachusetts to block the Trump administration’s Saturday directive.
The directive “underscores the arbitrary and capricious nature of their conduct in this matter and demonstrates the need for immediate relief,” the motion states. “USDA must make full benefits available to SNAP beneficiaries without delay, and the November 8 guidance should be enjoined.”
A federal judge temporarily blocked the directive Monday, Reuters reported.
On Monday afternoon, Evers toured WAFER Food Pantry in La Crosse, where he spoke with reporters about USDA’s order to states to pull back funds pushed out to electronic benefit cards used by SNAP recipients, including FoodShare users in Wisconsin.
“That’s embarrassing. That’s embarrassing for any president of the United States,” said Evers in a news conference that was televised on CSPAN.
“He [Trump] can claw all he wants,” Evers said. “It’s not going to happen. They have no authority to do that.”
Evers said that grocery stores should not have to wait for FoodShare funds that they are due when customers make purchases on their electronic benefits cards. “They should be getting reimbursed like they always have,” he said.
The state Department of Health Services and the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection both issued statements Monday warning retailers and grocery stores that are part of the FoodShare program that they cannot reject customers with funds legally loaded onto their QUEST benefit cards, and businesses cannot turn away people using the cards.
“While there haven’t been reports of people being turned away or of price gouging thus far, we want to make sure everyone is clear on the expectations. No one in Wisconsin should have to worry about their next meal,” said DATCP Secretary Randy Romanski.
Evers signed an anti-price-gouging order on Oct. 31.
In a letter Sunday to Wisconsin’s congressional delegation, Evers called the administration’s clawback attempt “a shocking and disturbing request—and one that should be condemned by every person, regardless of their political beliefs or party.”
Evers noted that the state’s three Democratic federal lawmakers have spoken up in opposition to the administration’s actions.
“I find it deeply troubling the rest of you have failed to do so,” he wrote, referring to Wisconsin’s seven Republican Congress members, “and I implore you to change that today.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)LEXINGTON — Republican leaders in the Kentucky legislature during a Monday conference forewarned of challenges to crafting a state budget next year, particularly with potential funding cuts and extra costs shifted to state governments for health care and food assistance.
A slew of state lawmakers shared their perspectives on the next state budget and other topics ranging from energy policy to transportation at the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce’s conference that served as a preview of the upcoming legislative session in 2026.
Lawmakers will meet at the start of next year to craft a two-year state budget consisting of more than $100 billion that funds local school districts, state agencies and covers a portion of costs for federal programs including Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income people and other qualifying recipients.  
State governments including Kentucky will also have to grapple with significant costs shifted to them by Congress for large federal assistance programs — namely Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — through the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer. 
“It will impact the way we do the budget,” said Kentucky House Speaker David Osborne, R-Prospect, speaking before the crowd of business interests. “I think this budget is going to present some unique challenges because there really are disparate ideas on how we approach this budget.” 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act shifted more administration costs to states for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides nearly 593,000 low-income Kentuckians with funding to buy food. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act also changed how much cost-share states cover for SNAP depending on how often a state makes an error in determining SNAP benefits for a recipient. 
Sen. Chris McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, the chair of the Kentucky Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee, told the crowd the increased SNAP costs would amount to an immediate $180 million “hit” to the state budget, also mentioning there would be “additional things” to address related to Medicaid in the future.
The Congressional Budget Office projected the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would reduce federal spending on Medicaid over a decade by $911 billion and increase the number of uninsured people by about 10 million. The National Conference of State Legislatures wrote that the decreased Medicaid spending is largely attributed to stricter eligibility for Medicaid — such as adding work requirements — and limiting the use of provider taxes that states use to cover their share of Medicaid costs. 
But McDaniel was clear the state legislature wouldn’t be a backstop for programs “negatively impacted” by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
“Rethink your strategy,” McDaniel said. “The state is not going to backfill federal programs that get changed. It’s just not going to happen. We simply do not have the bandwidth or the financial wherewithal to do so.”

Rep. James Tipton, R-Taylorsville, the chair of the Kentucky House Postsecondary Education Committee, said during the conference the legislature had to be ready “if change does come” in regards to education funding. Federal education budget proposals from the White House and U.S. House Republicans call for deep cuts to funding for the nation’s K-12 schools.
One lawmaker also brought up looming financial questions facing Kentucky hospitals with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, particularly the law limiting state taxes on health care providers that hospitals rely on to get better reimbursement rates for treating Medicaid patients. 
Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, the chair of the Senate Health Services Committee, mentioned to the crowd an assessment from the Kentucky Hospital Association that 35 hospitals in the state could close with the planned scale-down of provider taxes that hospitals rely on. Meredith told the Lantern he believed Congress would ultimately make changes to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
“I think our congressmen and women will say, ‘We’ve got to put a stop to this or make some adjustments,’” said Meredith, a former hospital CEO. “We can’t let 35 hospitals close. So something will happen.” 
State funding uncertainty
State lawmakers during the one-day conference also alluded to facing a tighter budget in the next year as a result of uncertainty in state revenue in part triggered by federal trade policy under President Donald Trump’s administration.
The Consensus Forecasting Group, a group of economists charged with creating state government revenue forecasts, during its last meeting in September projected state revenues would fall over $300 million short of what is budgeted for the new fiscal year that began in July. That projected shortfall amounted to about a 2% decrease of the more than $15 billion budget for the fiscal year. The chairman of the forecasting group cited uncertainty with tariffs and trade for the revised revenue projection, though Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear also noted the decreases in income tax revenue. 
The group will meet again in December to revisit its revenue projection for the current fiscal year and also project revenue for the upcoming two-year state budget to be considered by the legislature in 2026. 
A significant question facing lawmakers regarding state revenues is what to do with the state’s income tax rate, something that the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce and GOP leadership want to eventually eliminate. 
Osborne said there are “disparate” ideas on how to approach the state’s income tax rate this year and how much to spend from the billions of dollars in the state’s “rainy day” fund. 
The GOP-controlled legislature, through a landmark law passed in 2022, created a system of fiscal triggers related to state revenues and the state’s “rainy day” fund before it can lower the state’s income tax rate by a half percentage point.

It’s a shared goal of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce and GOP legislators to eliminate the state’s income tax rate, though the state failed to meet the system’s fiscal triggers this year to lower the income tax rate by another half percentage point in 2027. Fiscal triggers were hit last year, allowing the state income tax rate to drop 3.5% at the start of next year. The legislature changed the fiscal trigger system in this year’s legislative session to allow lawmakers to potentially reduce the income tax rate by less than a half percentage point. 
House Majority Floor Whip Jason Nemes, R-Louisville, argued on a panel with McDaniel that the legislature had actually met the fiscal triggers to reduce the income tax rate by another half percentage point in 2027. He asserted the timing was off for when revenue amounts were checked, arguing that not all state revenues had been accounted for. 
Osborne said it was the state budget director’s opinion that the fiscal triggers were not met. But he also said “we can make policy however we want to make it.” 
“There’s going to be conversations around this budget we haven’t had in the last several years that I think are going to be pretty interesting,” Osborne said. “Not necessarily disagreements or fights, but just different philosophies.”

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images)Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Richard Lindsay dismissed a lawsuit Monday that questioned whether Gov. Patrick Morrisey acted lawfully when he sent members of the West Virginia National Guard to Washington, D.C. earlier this year at the request of President Donald Trump.
The case was brought against the state by the West Virginia arm of the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the state Citizen Action Group. On Monday, Lindsay dismissed the case without prejudice, meaning it could be refiled if circumstances change. 
The ACLU and CAG were requesting Lindsay to issue a preliminary injunction that would have brought the West Virginia National Guard out of D.C. and sent back home. Since the court found that the deployment was lawful, no preliminary injunction was issued. 
Moreover, Lindsay said he was “persuaded” by arguments from Chris Etheredge, a lawyer with the Attorney General’s Office representing the state, to dismiss the case.
In general, Lindsay ruled that because Trump did request states to send their National Guard members to D.C., standards were met that made the deployment legal. The situation would have likely been different, he said, if the troops were sent to another state without the request and consent of that state’s governor.
“If the matter before this court was the deployment of our National Guard to another state over the objection of a state governor, then this court would have a problem with it,” Lindsay said. “[But] this case truly is different than every other National Guard deployment that’s been in the news over the last year. It’s an important fact to the extent that the president was acting within his authority according to local law [and federal law].”
Morrisey announced in August that he would be sending 300-400 members of the West Virginia National Guard to Washington D.C. after Trump declared a “public safety emergency” in the nation’s capital. That declaration ended in September, but troops have remained in the district.
In late September, a spokesperson for the state’s National Guard said members could remain in D.C. through November.
Monday was the third hearing held in the now-dismissed case. Lindsay said that, since the court found that the governor’s actions were legal, there was no further litigation necessary to prove alleged harm against CAG.
In their lawsuit, the ACLU argued that CAG was suffering real harm due to the National Guard deployment because staff were forced to use more time and resources to both educate the public about it and ensure the government acted properly. 
Etheredge argued in an earlier hearing that these alleged harms against CAG were not real and were not clear. He previously argued that the only parties who could claim to be “directly harmed” by the ongoing deployment are residents of D.C. or members of the Guard themselves.
Billy Wolfe, communications director for the ACLU, said in a statement Monday that the organization was “disappointed” in Lindsay’s ruling but was also “thankful that the court treated the issue with the attention it deserved.”
“The court was clear that [CAG] had a right to hold the government accountable, and that the governor’s authority to deploy the Guard is not absolute,” Wolfe wrote. “We’re going to keep an eye on this important issue.”

Trump issued a pardon for Jones, a longtime supporter, and others involved in a plan to overturn the 2020 election. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Republicans who came under legal scrutiny after allegedly playing a role in trying to overturn President Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss are celebrating after the president issued a sweeping preemptive pardon – though the presidential decree will have no direct effect on the languishing state racketeering case out of Fulton County.
In a proclamation, Trump said the pardons will end “a grave national injustice perpetrated upon the American people following the 2020 Presidential Election.” The pardons were issued Friday but announced Monday by a Justice Department official.
The document broadly applies to any U.S. citizen for activity related to schemes to create “alternate” slates of electors in attempts to certify a Trump victory in states where he lost, or for efforts to expose “voting fraud and vulnerabilities” in that year’s presidential election.
After losing in 2020, Trump undertook an unprecedented effort to overturn the election, and he continues to maintain without evidence that the election was rigged.
Fulton defendants
The pardon specifically names each of Trump’s 18 alleged co-conspirators in the 2023 case brought by the Fulton County District Attorney, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and fellow Trump attorneys Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro.
The defendants are accused of participating in a conspiracy to overturn the election results, including by casting fake electoral votes, convincing state officials to falsify results and pressuring Fulton County election worker Ruby Freeman to falsely state that she witnessed ballot fraud.

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis accused Trevian Kutti, a former publicist for celebrities including rapper Kanye West, of trying to frighten Freeman into casting doubt on Fulton County’s election system. Kutti celebrated receiving the pardon on Instagram Monday with a post featuring West’s song “Praise God.”
“WOKE UP THIS MORNING WITH PARDON FROM THE PRESIDENT. STILL UP ON TOP. THE DEVIL IS MY OPP. CAN’T PAY ME TO STOP! MY GOD AT THE TOP! THANK YOU @realdonaldtrump,” wrote Kutti, whose bio includes the phrase “I BEAT FANI WILLIS.”
Willis accused Jeffrey Clark, now a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget, of trying to overturn election results in 2020 when he was serving as acting assistant attorney general, including by falsely stating that the U.S. Department of Justice had “significant concerns” with the elections in Georgia and other states.
In July, a Washington disciplinary panel recommended Clark be disbarred.
In a statement on social media, Clark said he was surprised by the pardon but “deeply grateful” to Trump for giving it, even though it’s not likely to end his legal woes.
“I’m thankful to the Lord, President Trump, friends, and donors,” Clark said on social media. “I wish I could be declaring this legal nonsense over for good—a pardon should totally and abruptly kill off these federal bar and Georgia-federal attacks on me and many others. Sadly, that’s not immediate reality.”
Anthony Michael Kreis, a law professor at Georgia State University, called the pardon “an affront to democracy” for those who believe Trump and his allies tried to overturn the election, but he added that the case also illustrates the importance of state prosecutors in cases involving an allegation of a scheme to overturn a presidential election.
“Because a president enjoys sweeping immunity from criminal prosecution and because the president can provide pardons for federal crime, state prosecutors can be the best last option to deter presidential election fraud or secure accountability for those who assist a president in trying to hold onto power after they lose a re-election campaign,” he said.

But the Fulton case is far from solid ground at the moment.
After Willis was pulled off the case because of a “significant appearance of impropriety,” stemming from a romantic relationship she had with a special prosecutor she hired, Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee tasked Peter J. Skandalakis, executive director of the nonpartisan Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council, with appointing a new prosecutor.
The deadline for that appointment is Friday, and if none is found, McAfee will dismiss the entire indictment.
The search for a replacement continues, Skandalakis said in a statement Monday.
“My staff and I have been diligently working on this matter since the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the disqualification of the District Attorney’s Office,” he said. “We will continue to carry out our responsibilities without being influenced by matters outside the scope of our assigned task, with the goal of complying fully with Judge McAfee’s order.”

Trump’s pardon also specifically names so-called alternate electors from several states, including 16 from Georgia who met in the state Capitol in December 2020 to sign false certificates stating that Trump won and send them to Washington. Three alternate electors were also charged in the Fulton County election interference case: former Coffee County GOP chair Cathy Latham, former Georgia GOP chief David Shafer and state Sen. Shawn Still, a Johns Creek Republican who was recently named Senate GOP caucus chair.
Georgia’s highest-ranking alternate elector is Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, who participated in the plan while serving as a state senator. A special prosecutor ruled last year that Jones acted within the scope of his authority as a state legislator and that charges should not be brought against him. Trump has endorsed Jones in the 2026 race for governor in Georgia.
In a statement following the pardon, campaign spokesperson Kayla Lott characterized the case against Jones as political theater from Willis.
“After being cleared by the state prosecutor, this is the final confirmation that this whole thing was a charade led by Joe Biden and Fani Willis,” Lott said. “They owe the taxpayers an apology and a refund.”

Tracy Pennychuick (R-Montgomery) introduces her bill at a committee hearing in Trappe on Nov. 10, 2025. (Screenshot from livestream)A two-hour state Senate committee hearing explored the use of artificial intelligence to create images and videos depicting children — sometimes real, sometimes “synthetic” — in sexually suggestive poses or acts. 
Possession of these kinds of images is already illegal in Pennsylvania, but the technology continues to develop faster than legislation can keep up. Protecting children “from the harmful aspects of AI” is an ongoing goal for Sen. Tracy Pennycuick (R-Montgomery), whose newly authored bill was the focus of Monday’s Senate Majority Policy meeting. 
“We want to make sure our children are protected from bad actors,” said Pennycuick. “Children are now targeted in ways we never thought possible.” 
Mandated reporters in the state — including health care practitioners, teachers, clergymen and more — already must report suspected child abuse, which includes explicit materials, to law enforcement. Senate Bill 1050, would expand that to include content made by AI and builds upon previous laws that targeted deepfakes.

“Every day, I see the lifelong impact of what happens when a child’s body or image is misused,” said Leslie Slingsby, the CEO of services and operations at Mission Kids Advocacy Center in Montgomery County. “Today, technology is creating new ways for that harm to occur, even when a child was never physically present.”
Mission Kids provides specialized forensic interviews and trauma-informed therapy for children, pivoting to address AI-generated materials more recently. Not including so-called synthetic children — or images not based on one, unique child — throughout the state’s code is a “dangerous” loophole, Slingsby noted, that could allow consumers of these materials to work or volunteer with children. 
“Bringing AI-generated (child sex abuse materials) under mandated reporting law would, one, align in the spirit of child protection by recognizing that exploitation is exploitation, no matter how it’s created,” said Slingsby. “Second, gives investigators the authority to intervene early … and third, ensures protection for real children whose images are used, even if altered or fabricated.” 
In December, two Lancaster County juveniles were charged for creating dozens of AI-generated pornographic images of other minor students and a Buck County student was charged with a similar crime in July.
In both incidents, Pennycuick said mandated reporters “failed these students,” and one school allegedly contacted the perpetrator’s father, but not law enforcement.
 Tool for law enforcement

Angela Sperrazza, the chief deputy state attorney general with the General Child Predator Section, shared that just one referral for AI-generated child sexual abuse materials often reveals additional content. 
“Creating an explicit duty for mandated reporters to notify authorities when they believe a child has been victimized through child sexual abuse materials — traditional or AI-generated images — is a critical step toward early investigation and intervention,” said Sperrazza.
“A single referral can lead to the identification of devices, online networks, service providers and offenders before further harm can occur,” Sperrazza added.

The presence of this AI-generated media “has posed significant challenges” to law enforcement and prosecutors, said Gabriella Glenning, the assistant district attorney in Montgomery County. 
“Artificial intelligence has complicated the identification of (child sexual abuse material) victims, requiring substantial investigative resources to determine whether these images are authentic or digitally fabricated,” said Glenning. “It is now alarmingly simple to superimpose a person’s face onto altered images.” 
Glenning added that the suspicion of sexual exploitation and sexual extortion could be added to Pennycuick’s underlying bill, which could uncover blackmail attempts. Once reported to the state’s ChildLine, an investigator can determine if images or videos meet the criteria and how it was created.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)The next chance for Louisiana homeowners to apply for up to $10,000 to upgrade their roofs to better withstand hurricanes starts Wednesday, with 1,000 grants available in qualifying areas.
Applicants for Louisiana Fortify Homes Program grants must reside in its coastal zone or in the cities of Lake Charles, Sulphur or Westlake. Even if homeowners have applied in a previous round for the Fortify grants, they must register for the next grant lottery between 8 a.m. Wednesday and 5 p.m. Nov. 19. To register, homeowners must create a profile on the LFHP website, where they should click the login button to begin the process.
Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple announced Monday the grant program has reached the milestone of funding 10,000 roofing projects. The grant typically doesn’t cover the entire cost of roof improvements needed, meaning homeowners must be able to cover the balance in order to receive the state money. 
Anyone interested in the program is encouraged to review the eligibility information, homeowner responsibilities and other important information at fortifyhomes.la.gov to determine whether they meet requirements.
Among the requirements to receive a grant is that the home must be a primary residence, and homeowners will be required to verify they have a homestead exemption on the property during the application process. 
A program evaluator will also have to determine whether the home is in good repair, and it must have active residential insurance with wind coverage as well as flood coverage where required.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s two senators expressed disappointment Monday, the day after eight of their Democratic colleagues broke away from the party’s majority to join Republicans in passing a short-term deal that should reopen the federal government by later this week.
The compromise will bring the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history to an end but without securing extensions for Affordable Care Act subsidies.
US Senate advances bill to end record-breaking government shutdown

“When you’re looking at the damage to Rhode Island’s health care system — I thought this was a fight worth pursuing,” Whitehouse said to reporters over Zoom Monday morning.
The subsidies, which help lower-income Americans afford private health insurance and expire at year’s end, were the key reason Senate Democrats refused to go along with the Republican bill funding government services past Oct. 1. Without Congressional action, those earning under 400% of the poverty level will see reduced aid, while others lose it entirely.
Nearly 40,000 Rhode Islanders rely on tax credits to afford coverage.
U.S. Sen. Jack Reed in a video for members of Rhode Island’s press corps said he believed senators should have kept the pressure on what he said is a key pillar in entering and staying in the middle class.
“It is shameful that we’ll allow people to go without health care in the wealthiest country in the world,” Reed said.
The compromise includes only a promise that the Senate will vote on extending the subsidies by the second week of December. But Whitehouse said it never came with a guarantee that any Republicans will back the measure, nor does he believe it’s likely.
“Republicans seem to have a fetish for hurting health care,” Whitehouse said.
Reed too has his doubts.
“Their unwillingness to join us in a serious discussion about fixing this one problem — the tax credit for ACA health care — shows me that they’re not quite committed,” he said.
Though upset with his Democratic colleagues who broke ranks, he said he did not see the need to find a new majority leader who can ensure party unity. But Whitehouse said a lack of future compromise by Republicans could sway those who broke ranks from doing so again.
“If this is another Lucy pulls the football away from Charlie Brown moment, I think all eight of them will be very, very angry and upset,” he said.
The full Senate must still vote on the compromise continuing resolution, which would bar federal agencies from firing employees until Jan. 30 and fund the federal food assistance program through Sept. 30, 2026 — preventing potential disruptions if another shutdown occurs before then.










If this is another Lucy pulls the football away from Charlie Brown moment, I think all eight of them will be very, very angry and upset.


– U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse


Then the bill would head back to the House for consideration, where Democratic Reps. Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo have already voiced opposition without any provision extending health care subsidies.
“Trump and Republicans created a health care crisis we need to tackle,” Amo posted to X Sunday night. “Anything short of meaningful action on ACA tax credits doesn’t meet the moment.”
“My position has been that I will only vote for a budget that continues full affordable care act tax credit funding,” Magaziner posted.

Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, has been in question amid the ongoing federal government shutdown and varying court orders. 
SNAP uncertainty spiking demand at Idaho food banks

The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, which administers the program to more than 130,000 Idahoans, said it began distributing funds Nov. 7 and aims to complete distributions by Wednesday. 
“Idaho is in the process of issuing partial benefits based on previous federal guidance and does not expect to have to undo those benefits,” Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter said in an email to the Idaho Capital Sun. “(Health and Welfare) will move to full benefits as soon as guidance is received that directs that action.” 
The typical maximum allowable SNAP payment may already be reduced for participants based on a formula that takes into account income, household size and some living expenses. The reduced payments are roughly 65% of the maximum allotment, minus the program’s typical reductions. The average monthly benefit in Idaho is $178 per household member. 
Recipients are encouraged to check their EBT cards, which are used to pay for groceries, and look for updates on the agency’s website at healthandwelfare.idaho.gov.

 SNAP guidance was volatile amid shutdown and court battles, leaving recipients without assistance

The move follows weeks of varying, sometimes conflicting, federal guidance and court orders related to the program. 
Here’s how things changed for the program:

Oct. 1: Because Congress failed to approve spending for the next fiscal year, the federal government shut down on Oct. 1, which meant many federal agencies did not have authorization to spend additional money. 
Oct. 22: Idaho Health and Welfare announced it would pause SNAP payments in November because funding had dried up during the ongoing shutdown. The federal United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA, asked Idaho for the suspension. 
Oct. 24: The USDA, which administers SNAP federally, originally had a plan to tap contingency funds to continue paying the 42 million Americans who use the program, but reversed course and said it didn’t have the legal ability to continue making payments if the shutdown extended into November, the States Newsroom reported. 
Oct. 28, Oct. 30: The USDA’s decision to not provide more payments was challenged in two lawsuits in federal court systems in Massachusetts and in Rhode Island.  
Oct. 31:  A federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the USDA to either provide full payments or partial payments using the contingency fund. The judge provided a written version of the ruling Nov. 1. 
Nov. 3: In response to the Rhode Island judge’s order, the USDA said in court filings it would authorize payments of about 50% of the maximum benefit with the program’s typical deductions for household income. However, the federal agency later said it miscalculated the reduction and clarified the reductions would be closer to 35% of the maximum allotment.  
Nov. 4: President Donald Trump wrote on social media that no payments would be made until the government reopened, which conflicted with the court documents from the USDA. 
Nov. 6: The Rhode Island judge ordered the federal government to pay the full benefit to recipients for November. 
Nov. 7: The USDA told states it would release full funding for November to comply with the court order, States Newsroom reported. 

Later that same day, the Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking them to reverse the order to pay full benefits. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare distributed partial payments to about 15,000 Idahoans, the agency said. 
The Supreme Court that night temporarily blocked that lower court order to make the full payments, allowing the case to continue litigation in the lower appeals court. 


Nov. 8: Trump administration officials told states that provided full benefits to “undo” the action, and instead fund 65% of allotments. 
Nov. 9: The U.S. Senate on Sunday advanced a bill that would fund the government through the end of January, clearing a major hurdle toward potentially ending the shutdown, States Newsroom reported. 

 A separate federal appeals court denied the Trump administration’s request to halt the order to make full SNAP payments, the New York Times reported. 


Nov. 10: A federal judge in Massachusetts temporarily blocked the directive for states to “undo” full benefits.

Idaho’s health agency is continuing to disperse reduced payments until it receives further guidance. New SNAP applications continue to be accepted, the agency said. 
The situation may cause longer wait times at call centers and offices, Health and Welfare’s website said Monday.  
Benefits provided under the federal Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, program are unaffected, according to Health and Welfare’s website on Monday.

Ron DeSantis confers with base officials following a mass shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola on Dec. 6, 2019. (Photo via Governor's Office)A federal appeals court has reinstated a portion of a lawsuit filed against Saudi Arabia by survivors of servicemembers killed by a Saudi Air Force pilot training at the Pensacola Naval Air Station in 2019.
A federal trial judge had dismissed claims under numerous causes of action as precluded by the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act.
However, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled Monday that another law — the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act — would allow claims that the Saudi government failed to properly vet the accused shooter, Mohammed Saeed Al-Shamrani, despite extensive evidence he was affiliated with al-Qaida and adhered to extremist views.
The court rejected claims including that the Saudi government failed to properly supervise Al-Shamran or that his allegedly intentional crime fell under an exemption to that government’s sovereign immunity. The government wasn’t liable for alleged acts of omission in screening Al-Shamrani, the opinion says.
However, “The Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges that the Kingdom committed grossly negligent acts of commission rather than omission,” the court said.
Furthermore, in clearing Al-Shamrani to attended training at the NAS, the government cited “false information that was knowingly submitted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the United States,” the court continued.
“Second, the Amended Complaint asserts that on multiple occasions, Saudi Arabia conducted security screenings for Al Shamrani — deliberate and affirmative acts of will or exertion designed to accomplish an objective” of enrolling him in the training program.
“Third, Saudi Arabia nominated Al-Shamrani for, and awarded him, a scholarship which enabled him to go to Texas to learn English from August 2017 until May 2018, and then to participate in the flight training program at NAS Pensacola from May of 2018 until the time of the attack on December 6, 2019,” the court said.
‘Deliberate steps’
“These were all affirmative acts, deliberate steps undertaken by the Kingdom, not acts of omission. These acts enabled Al-Shamrani to enter and live at the military bases in San Antonio, Texas and then at NAS Pensacola. Finally, the Kingdom was responsible for the affirmative act of sending Al-Shamrani to the United States.”
Circuit Judge Stanley Marcus wrote the opinion for his colleagues Jill Pryor and Britt Grant. The ruling sends the case back to the trial court in the Northern District of Florida.
The shootings ended in the deaths of Airman Mohammed Sameh Haitham, Ensign Joshua Kaleb Watson, and Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters. Six other servicemembers and seven Escambia County Sheriff’s deputies were wounded.
Court records include evidence Al-Shamrani was affiliated with al-Qaida and advocated for:

“The killing of Shia Muslims, non-Muslims and people who do not pray;
“The unfounded conspiracy that the Shia sect of Islam was founded by Jews to divide Muslims;
That Christians and Jews are the enemy of Islam, particularly to the Sunnis; and
“That Islam is under attack and threatened by Christians, Jews and Western culture.”

“Al-Shamrani also echoed the radical and violent teachings of Anwar al-Awlaki, a Yemeni-American cleric and member of AQAP [al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula] who was described as ‘perhaps the most prolific jihadist ideologue of all time,” the court said.
“Despite the repeated public expression of extremist and violent views, Al-Shamrani was one of two students in his RSAF class of hundreds awarded a scholarship to enter a joint military program in the United States,” it continued.
“Taking the allegations presented in the Amended Complaint as true (as we must at this stage in the proceedings), we are satisfied that under the terms of the congressional enactment in JASTA, this bundle of claims falls within one of the exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity,” the court wrote.
“These claims are facially sufficient because they are based on a series of acts of commission (rather than acts of omission) taken by the Kingdom in hiring and vetting Al-Shamrani that rose to the level of gross negligence under Florida law.”
NAS Pensacola is home to the Naval Aviation Schools Command, which provides flight training to U.S. personnel plus members of allied armed forces. Al-Shamrani’s supervisors reportedly were unaware that he’d purchased the Glock-45 handgun he used in the shootings.
Following the shootings, Gov. Ron DeSantis said he expected the Saudi government to pay.
“I think there’s obviously going to be a lot of questions about this individual being a foreign national, being a part of the Saudi air force, and then to be here training on our soil to do this,” the governor said during a news conference at the base.

Prapass Pulsub/Getty Images) A former Iowa physician is suing a police detective who cited her for harassment after she publicly posted comments that she was “coming after” a former University of Iowa Hospitals colleague, who she called a “blue-eyed Hitler look alike.”
Dr. Ji Eun Lee is suing Detective Ian Mallory of the University of Iowa Police Department in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
In her lawsuit, Lee asserts that “university campuses should be a place where the value of free speech is upheld. However, at the University of Iowa, speech is tolerated only when it does not offend others.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit describes Lee as a medical doctor and “former U of I resident physician who was frustrated by the behavior of her former colleagues and leadership failures that permitted that behavior to go unpunished.” It alleges she “took to social media to share her frustrations” and that Mallory then later cited Lee for harassment when she continued to post such comments.
The lawsuit claims none of the speech that that led to the charge amounts to a “true threat,” and because of that, the U.S. Constitution does not permit punishment of such comments with criminal charges.
Lee included some of her own social media posts, some of which aren’t dated, as exhibits in her lawsuit against Mallory, including the following:
— A post referencing Karla Hemesath and Kate DuChene Hanrahan, two clinical professors of family and community medicine at the university, that said, “Hemesath? Still working on buttlickin #kateduchenehanrahan?”
— An Oct. 30, 2022, post in which Lee writes a definition of “sadism,” explaining it is “the desire and intention to hurt others, either verbally or physically, simply for the enjoyment of the act,” and which goes on to state, “Hey you f—ing Kate Thoma DuChene Hanrahan, Long time no see, you blue-eyed Hitler look alike. Actually a female version of it … I am a geriatrician now. I know what I am talking about … Keep yourselves busy. Cauz I am coming after you Aryan MOTHAF—ERS. You, your husbands, your children, your parents, you all going down. Taste some guilt, shame, depression, anxiety Attacks that we Minorities Face Every F—ing Day.”
— A post in which Lee writes, “I TELL YOU WHEN I STOP…. NOT YOU. NEVR YOU. ENUGH IS ENUGH. @bbs_us a third party should look into this unethical piece of crap@uihealthcare…”
Iowa Board of Medicine records indicate Lee’s license to practice in Iowa expired in June 2020, with no public record of discipline.
Lawsuit seeks punitive damages
In her lawsuit, Lee alleges that while working at UIHC, she came to believe other residents and supervisor physicians engaged in and tolerated disability discrimination and racism against minority resident physicians. Lee alleges she later used Facebook and X, formerly Twitter, to make comments that, “while direct and disparaging, did not threaten violence.”
On Dec. 19, 2022, Mallory received a report that Lee had made “online threats” to UIHC employees. The lawsuit alleges that Mallory’s summary report of his investigation states that “Dr. Lee’s writings were largely within the bounds of free speech but occasionally there were references to, ‘I’ll get you and your family’ directed towards some employees.”
On Jan. 14, 2023, Mallory sent Lee, then living in the Los Angeles area, a harassment warning by certified mail. In October 2023, the lawsuit claims, Lee decided to begin posting on social media about her dissatisfaction with various UIHC personnel. When Mallory learned of this, he called Lee and warned her that if she communicated with her former colleagues by posting comments about them on Twitter she would be criminally charged with harassment.
Lee continued to post about her former colleagues at UIHC and, her lawsuit claims, also posted a comment tied to the University of Iowa Police Department and its warning, stating, “I am not in the least bit threatened by this.”
On Nov. 9, 2023, Mallory filed a criminal complaint with the Johnson County Clerk of Court charging Lee with harassment.  In July 2024, the lawsuit claims, Lee learned there was a warrant for her arrest and hired an attorney who moved to dismiss the charge.
District Associate Judge Brandon Schrock granted the motion in an order dated May 30, 2025, ruling the criminal complaint “simply fails to allege conduct that would satisfy the elements of harassment” as outlined in Iowa law. The criminal complaint, Schrock found, “fails to state any facts which could be construed as intended to threaten, intimidate or alarm any of the prospective victims in this matter.”
While one post from Lee was alleged to constitute a true threat — the Oct. 30, 2022, ” I am coming after you” post — Schrock noted that it had been posted more than year before the criminal charge was filed on Nov. 10, 2023, and so it fell outside the statute of limitations for a simple misdemeanor.
The lawsuit alleges Mallory charged Lee with harassment “simply because she disobeyed” his warning to stop posting harassing comments about her former colleagues. It seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for violations of Lee’s First and 14th Amendment rights.
Mallory could not be reached for comment Monday and has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.
Court records indicate Lee graduated from Tufts University School of Medicine in 2017, receiving her M.D. degree there. She then began an internship and residency in family medicine at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.
Lee left the UIHC residency program in 2019 and two years later, completed a family medicine residency program at Michigan State University. She is currently employed at a hospital in the greater Los Angeles area and, according to her lawsuit, she is currently licensed to practice medicine in California.
In her lawsuit, Lee is represented by Alan R. Ostergren of Iowa’s Kirkwood Institute, a self-described “conservative public-interest law firm.” The institute describes itself as “nonpartisan” and has been recognized by the IRS as a tax-exempt public charity.

Campbell County firefighters seek $9.6M training center replacementCounty 17Campbell County fire officials are seeking to replace the county’s aging fire training center. Fire Chief Jeff Bender says the center is nearing the end of its lifespan and poses safety concerns for firefighter training and certification. An engineer evaluated the facility five years ago and estimated it had about five years left. Since then, the department has spent about $100,000 on repairs that Bender described as “band-aids on a broken leg,” County 17 reports. Read the full story.

This story by Phil Dodd was first published in The Bridge on Nov. 10, 2025.
Montpelier zoning permits refer to the renovation project at 140 Main Street in Montpelier as a hotel, but owner Pat Malone said the new business will operate more like a hybrid hotel, bed-and-breakfast, and Airbnb. Visitors will book online and get a code to open up their rooms, he said, but there will be no cooking facilities in the rooms, “though we will supply snacks for guests at breakfast.”
Previously, the large brick building was used as a law office. Malone said in addition to the rental rooms in the main building, there will also be rooms in a portion of the large carriage house behind the main structure. Both buildings on the property are listed as contributing structures on the National Register for Historic Places. Guests will have access to 13 parking spaces.
Construction inside and outside the property is underway, including the addition of a deck and patio for guests to sit outside in good weather. There will be a common room inside, and a room for a night manager. Malone said he hopes the building will be finished and ready to open in early spring.
Malone is currently operating two similar hospitality businesses — some of which do have kitchen facilities — in Barre and Waterbury Center, both listed on VRBO. A quick check showed prices for nightly stays in March 2026 running from $190 for one of the less expensive Barre units to $312 for a top-end Waterbury Center unit. 
“They do quite well,” he said. “We’re getting good demand in Barre, and we’re getting very good demand in Waterbury. So I think that Montpelier will do well.”
Malone said he might have converted the building to apartments instead, but city regulations that were adopted after the flood forbid apartments on the first floor. The city does allow hotel-type operations on first floors, he said. “I know a lot of people who would like first floor apartments,” but you can’t build those now, he said.
Malone has also been busy finishing up the renovation of the former Hugo’s restaurant location at 118 Main Street. That building will now house 25 single-room office suites with shared conference rooms, kitchenettes and common areas. It is a model he said he has successfully used in the upper floors of the former TD Bank building at the corner of State and Main streets in Montpelier.
A prior owner had signed a 20-year contract to heat the 118 Main building with the city’s district heat system, so Malone had to install expensive equipment so the district heat temperatures in the 25 rooms could be individually controlled. District heat is more expensive than alternative fuel sources, Malone said, but he decided “since I was paying for it, I probably should use it.”

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa saw its first snowfall over the past week, which Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said marked the “official end of the growing season.” 
While crop progress and condition statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are unavailable due to the ongoing government shutdown, Naig estimated that corn and soybean harvest in the state is coming to a close. 
“Based on my observations while traveling around the state and the conversations I’m having with farmers, harvest appears to be nearly complete,” Naig said in a statement Monday.

According to Naig, what he has heard from farmers is “in line” with five-year harvest averages that show 98% of soybeans and 91% of corn acres are typically harvested by mid-November. 
At this time last year, farmers had just 5% of corn left in the fields.
Brrr! Iowa’s first snow of the season 
State Climatologist Justin Glisan wrote in his weekly weather summary that temperatures took a “nose-dive” late into the Nov. 3 through Nov. 9 reporting period. 
Several towns in northwest Iowa reported the weekly low temperature of 13 degrees Fahrenheit, which Glisan said was 14 degrees below normal. 
Despite the drop in temperatures toward the end of the week, the overall average temperature for the period was 47.2 degrees. The statewide average was 3.4 degrees above the climatological normal. 
According to Glisan, more than 50 weather stations reported measurable snowfall during the reporting period. Pocahontas reported just slightly more than 5 inches of snow. 
The weekly precipitation average across the state was slightly under three-tenths of an inch, while the normal is 0.52 inch. 
The latest report from the U.S. Drought Monitor showed 81% of Iowa was in abnormally dry or drought conditions. About 15% of the state, mostly on the eastern edge, was in moderate drought conditions.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)State Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford, on Monday announced his support for redrawing Indiana’s congressional boundaries in a one-line statement.
“After careful consideration, researching the law and listening to my constituents, I have decided I will support mid-cycle congressional redistricting,” he said.
Koch is the 13th Senate Republican to signal support for new maps, with opposition from five senators in the 40-member GOP caucus. Others haven’t said their stance publicly.
He was the Senate sponsor of the 2021 bill that crafted new congressional and state legislative districts.
“The bill before you today is a result of a careful, collaborative effort and I believe it will serve our state well in the decade ahead,” Koch said during Senate debate on Oct. 1, 2021.
President Donald Trump and national Republicans have pushed Indiana and other GOP-led states to create more Republican U.S. seats by redistricting early. The next census isn’t scheduled until 2030.
Lawmakers will return Dec. 1 — at the behest of Gov. Mike Braun — to redistrict and make possible tax policy changes. Senate Republican leadership has said the chamber has not yet reached enough votes to pass a redistricting bill. A bill will need a majority of 26 votes or 25 with Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith breaking a tie in support.
Republicans currently have a 7-2 advantage in the state’s U.S. House delegation, with Democrats holding the 1st District in northwest Indiana and the 7th in Indianapolis.
In 2021, Koch touted the strength of the 1st District boundaries.

Wiggins, who also co-founded Victory Field Operations with consultant and Senate staffer Meghan Reckling, will now serve as Hall’s press secretary. No one from the House side of the press office was leaving to join the Senate side, Hall spokesperson Gideon D’Assandro told Michigan Advance.
Wiggins did not return a message seeking further comment on his reasoning for the departure from Nesbitt’s office. A message seeking comment from Joe Wicks, Nesbitt’s chief of staff, was not returned, either.
Last month, the Advance exclusively reported that Wiggins and Victory Field Operations were working for U.S. Rep. John James’ gubernatorial campaign. Nesbitt is also a candidate for governor and James is one of Nesbitt’s top rivals in the Republican gubernatorial hunt.
At least two well-connected Michigan political operatives told the Advance in a previous story that the situation was a clear conflict of interest, even if it wasn’t illegal in terms of Michigan election law.
Nesbitt staffer’s firm works for James campaign, raising ethics flags in GOP governor race

The Advance learned in October through public campaign finance data that Victory Field Operations was paid by James, not just for ballot access work but also political consulting via Mission Michigan, the issues-based political action committee supporting James.
Victory Field Operations was founded by Wiggins and Reckling, who is the chief of staff in the office of state Sen. Lana Theis (R-Brighton).
Mission Michigan was created in April to support James, and received a large $5 million contribution from Dan and Pamela DeVos, members of the prominent Republican DeVos family. The Detroit News’ editorial page editor, Kaitlyn Buss, wrote about the influx of cash from members of the DeVos family to Mission Michigan in May.
Michigan campaign finance reports show that the committee paid Victory Field Operations $40,000 for political strategy consulting, according to July and September filings.
James is viewed as a leading candidate for the office of governor on the Republican side, a campaign being waged against the better wishes of President Donald Trump and the leaders of the GOP majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Other Republicans seeking the GOP nomination include former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, Genesee County truck driver Anthony Hudson, former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard, pastor Ralph Rebandt and anti-property tax advocate Karla Wagner.

(Photo by Glen Stubbe/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota officials said Sunday they will not yank back food assistance that was distributed to recipients Friday, despite a weekend Trump administration order to do so. 
Here’s how we got to this point:
It starts with the shutdown
Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, expired at the end of October. Around 440,000 Minnesotans, most of whom are children, elderly or disabled, use SNAP to help pay for groceries.
SNAP recipients turned to food shelves in late October and early November as their monthly credits ran out and weren’t re-upped; at one food shelf, the Reformer witnessed volunteers turning away families for the first time, because there wasn’t enough food.
Minnesota and others sued, but then USDA pulled a slow one
At the end of October, advocates and some state attorneys general, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, filed two separate lawsuits to force the federal government to use contingency funds to pay for SNAP during the shutdown. 
The judge in the advocates’ suit in Rhode Island ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, to pay out full benefits by Nov. 3 or partial benefits by Nov. 5. The USDA sent states a methodology for calculating partial benefits on Nov. 3, but that process would take weeks or more to implement. 
The Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families last week couldn’t provide a timeline for when the benefits would be distributed according to the methodology provided by the USDA. 
Judge got mad, told USDA to pay up; Minnesotans got their credits
Then, on Thursday, the judge found that the USDA hadn’t complied with his earlier order — given the lengthy implementation timeline — and issued a new order requiring the Trump administration to send states the money to cover November SNAP benefits by Friday. The administration complied, sending out the full funding for the month, which Minnesota immediately distributed to recipients. 
SNAP recipients contacted by the Reformer confirmed that they received their benefits over the weekend. 
The state even sent some benefits earlier than planned to “protect Minnesotans during the uncertainty of potential future court orders.”
You knew this was coming: Roberts Court says, ‘hold up’
State officials knew the U.S. Department of Justice was appealing the federal judge’s order on behalf of the USDA. Late Friday night, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an emergency ruling pausing the requirement that the Trump administration pay out full benefits. 
USDA says ‘pay us back’
No longer bound by the court order, USDA sent out another memo Saturday ordering states to only pay out 65% of recipients’ November benefits, and to “immediately undo” any actions that had been taken to make full payments. 
Minnesota says ‘nah’ 
The Department of Children, Youth, and Families said in a press release the agency was “appalled” at Saturday’s instructions to claw back the payments.
“Minnesota does not have any mechanism for taking money back from SNAP recipients. We also believe it would be unjust to yank back these funds that are needed to feed families,” the press release reads. 
Ellison confirmed Monday that “the money is flowing” in Minnesota. 
“If there was one throughline here, it is that Donald Trump and his administration have been fighting tooth and nail not to feed hungry Americans,” Ellison said in a press conference alongside other blue state attorneys general involved in litigation over the program. 
Seems like shutdown might — might! — be coming to a close, ending SNAP uncertainty 
The U.S. Senate took preliminary steps Sunday night to pass a spending bill that would reopen the government — without Democrats’ key demand, to extend health insurance subsidies that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year. 
The package that passed a key Senate procedural hurdle Sunday would fund the government, including SNAP, through January. 
But long term, Republicans have cut food aid
As the funding fight carries on, larger changes are happening to SNAP. A GOP mega-law signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4 will cut funding for SNAP by around 20%, or $187 billion over 10 years.
The SNAP cuts come from expanded work requirements for parents of teenagers and people who can work and are between the ages of 55 and 64; changes to how utility and internet bills are counted against an applicant’s income when determining benefits; and cost shifts to the states.
The law also eliminated the SNAP-Ed program, which educated SNAP recipients on healthy eating and how to lead a physically active lifestyle, resulting in 60 layoffs at the University of Minnesota.
The expanded work requirements took effect Nov. 1.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/13-SNAP-1125-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 17:57:15.792330

(Kyle Sullivan, Bureau of Land Management/Flickr)A bipartisan piece of legislation that could have big impacts on the nation’s forest land continues to move quickly through Congress, pushing through a Senate committee last month.
The Fix Our Forests Act was introduced in the U.S. Senate in April and co-sponsored by Sen. Tim Sheehy, along with Senators from California, Utah and Colorado.
The legislation seeks to promote prescribed burns, expand the state-federal Good Neighbor Authority program, increase collaboration among fire agencies and improve reforestation efforts after fires. It also makes some rule changes that could impact how areas designated as high fire danger are managed and how projects in those areas proceed.
“Better stewardship of our forests is not a partisan issue; it’s an imperative to securing a stronger economy, healthier forests, and safer communities,” Sheehy said in a press release. “I’m proud to see the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act move forward in the legislative process, and I’ll continue fighting alongside my colleagues to enact commonsense reforms that ensure proper forest management, unleash the resource economy, and protect American communities from the threat of wildfire.”
The governors of those four states, including Gov. Greg Gianforte, signed on to a letter in support of the legislation in late October. The bill has already worked its way through the U.S. House, though doesn’t include new appropriated funds.
The legislation has received some support from environmental and outdoor advocacy groups, with the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership calling it a “comprehensive” approach to tackling forest health and wildfire issues. The Nature Conservancy and the National Audubon Society is also in support of the legislation.
But there has also been some concern with it, namely around how it could change the process of forest projects, especially those in a declared “emergency fireshed management” area. That’s a Biden-era designation which essentially prohibits projects from exploring alternatives on forestry projects — the only options are what’s called an “action” or “no action.” It essentially shortens the review period for projects within that designation.
Forestry actions falling within that designation are usually small in scope, but the federal legislation would push that number to include projects as large as 10,000 acres.
Even with the renewed interest in prescribed burns and other forestry projects to help with forest health, there’s still a lack of action, said Riva Duncan, the vice president of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, an advocacy group made up of former firefighters.
According to Forest Service data, hazardous fuels reduction work across their lands was down 38% in 2025 when compared with the same period during the previous four calendar years.
Federal cuts and Department of Government Efficiency actions caused chaos last winter and some mitigation projects never happened or were delayed. Between the cuts and needs for firefighters around the country, the work just isn’t getting done, she said.
And while DOGE actions mostly spared firefighters, supporting positions around fire mitigation work were not.
“There’s a huge network of specialists and biologists and things behind the scenes that do the environmental work to allow these fuels projects to continue,” Duncan said. “And so they were hit really hard by (DOGE cuts) and by the deferred resignations and things like that. A lot of issues are exacerbated by this administration, who has been very open about not supporting a Federal workforce.”
Prescribed burns can help mitigate risk by removing fuel that otherwise might add to the intensity of a fire. During the last 100 years the Forest Service has consistently embraced suppression as its main method of fire defense.
Land management policies “vilifying” fire have led to overgrowth and climate change continues to impact forests, Duncan said, adding suppression has been a renewed focus this summer. U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, who spent 14 years with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, has said the nation’s forests are in trouble because they’re not being logged enough.
“Every year the Chief of the Forest Service puts out their fire season letter, and it made pretty clear that suppression was going to be the primary focus,” Duncan said. “And I think when you look at the chief and his background coming from the timber industry, there are a lot of people who have commercial timber lands, commercial timber interests, who don’t like fire, who still will not recognize the value it brings. All it does is hurt their bottom line, right?”
Duncan also pointed out not all logging is necessarily fuel mitigation work and added she’s not specifically against logging; however, saying logging alone will solve the issue is disingenuous.
“A lot of people who want us to log more, want more trees to come off national forest lands, will try to make that argument,” Duncan said. “Sometimes it is, sometimes it’s not. Often it’s not.”
Grassroots Wildland Firefighters did submit a comment on the Fix Our Forests bill and she said it’s an acknowledgment that more fuel work needs to be done.
“Fire is non-partisan. It doesn’t recognize boundaries or recognize if it’s private or federal land, if it’s commercial versus being managed for ecological reasons,” Duncan said. “And so we need a comprehensive solution with everybody at the table who has a stake, and everybody has a stake.”

Free.,"US Senate in bipartisan vote passes bill to end record-breaking shutdown, House up next",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-bipartisan-vote-passes-bill-end-record-breaking-shutdown-house-next,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate approved a stopgap spending bill Monday that will end the longest government shutdown in American history once the measure becomes law later this week.The 60-40 vote sends the updated funding package back to the House, where lawmakers in that chamber are expected sometime during the next few days to clear the legislation for President Donald Trump’s signature. Shortly before the vote, Trump said he plans to follow the agreements included in the revised measure, including the reinstatement of thousands of federal workers who received layoff notices during the shutdown. “I’ll abide by the deal,” Trump said. “The deal is very good.”  Republicans, he added, will soon begin work on legislation to provide direct payments to Americans to help them afford the rising cost of health insurance, one of the core disagreements between the political parties that led to the shutdown. “We want a health care system where we pay the money to the people instead of the insurance companies,” Trump said from the Oval Office. “And I tell you, we are going to be working on that very hard over the next short period of time.”House members told to head to D.C.Earlier in the day, House Speaker Mike Johnson urged representatives to begin traveling back to Capitol Hill as soon as possible to ensure they arrive in time to vote on the bill to reopen the government, after the measure arrives from the Senate. The Louisiana Republican’s request came as airlines were forced to delay or cancel thousands of flights on the 41st day of the shutdown, a situation that could potentially impact a House vote on the stopgap spending bill if members don’t follow his advice. “The problem we have with air travel is that our air traffic controllers are overworked and unpaid. And many of them have called in sick,” Johnson said. “That’s a very stressful job and even more stressful, exponentially, when they’re having trouble providing for their families. And so air travel has been grinding to a halt in many places.”Johnson then told his colleagues in the House, which hasn’t been in session since mid-September, that lawmakers from both political parties “need to begin right now returning to the Hill.”Trump threatens air traffic controllersTrump took a markedly different tone over the challenges air traffic controllers have faced during the shutdown in a social media post that he published several hours before he spoke to reporters about the deal to reopen government. “All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!! Anyone who doesn’t will be substantially ‘docked,’” Trump wrote, without explaining what that would mean for workers who had to take time off since the shutdown began Oct. 1. Trump added that he would like to find a way to provide $10,000 bonuses to air traffic controllers who didn’t require any time off during the past six weeks.“For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU. You didn’t step up to help the U.S.A. against the FAKE DEMOCRAT ATTACK that was only meant to hurt our Country,” Trump wrote. “You will have a negative mark, at least in my mind, against your record. If you want to leave service in the near future, please do not hesitate to do so, with NO payment or severance of any kind!” An end in sightThe Senate-passed package will provide stopgap funding for much of the federal government through January 30, giving lawmakers a couple more months to work out agreement on nine of the dozen full-year spending bills.  The package holds several other provisions, including the full-year appropriations bills for the Agriculture Department, the Legislative Branch, military construction projects and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. Seven Democrats and one independent broke ranks Sunday on a procedural vote that advanced the package, drawing condemnation from some House members and outside advocacy groups unhappy that no solution was arrived at to counter skyrocketing health insurance premium increases for people in the Affordable Care Act marketplace.Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate, where bipartisanship is required for major bills to move forward under the 60-vote legislative filibuster. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said during a floor speech Monday he was “grateful that the end” of the stalemate was in sight. “We’re on the 41st day of this shutdown — nutrition benefits are in jeopardy; air travel is in an extremely precarious situation; our staffs and many, many other government workers have been working for nearly six weeks without pay,” Thune said. “I could spend an hour talking about all of the problems we’ve seen, which have snowballed the longer the shutdown has gone on. But all of us, Democrat and Republican, who voted for last night’s bill are well aware of the facts.”Schumer bid for deal on health care costs failsSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was far less celebratory after his bid to get Republicans to negotiate a deal on health care costs by forcing a shutdown failed. “The past few weeks have exposed with shocking clarity how warped Republican priorities truly are. While people’s health care costs have gone up, Republicans have come across as a party preoccupied with ballrooms, Argentina bailouts and private jets,” Schumer said. “Republicans' breach of trust with the American people is deep and perhaps irreversible.” “And now that they have failed to do anything to prevent premiums from going up, the anger that Americans feel against Donald Trump and the Republicans is going to get worse,” Schumer added. “Republicans had their chance to fix this and they blew it.

,DC,2025-11-10 22:36:45+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"US Senate on verge of passing bill to end record-breaking shutdown, House up next",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-verge-passing-bill-end-record-breaking-shutdown-house-next,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate was on track to approve a stopgap spending bill Monday that will end the longest government shutdown in American history once the measure becomes law later this week.Senators are expected to vote before midnight after they wrap up a series of floor speeches as well as amendment and procedural votes. Trump said shortly before the votes were locked in that he plans to follow the agreements included in the revised measure, including the reinstatement of thousands of federal workers who received layoff notices during the shutdown. “I’ll abide by the deal,” Trump said. “The deal is very good.”  Republicans, he added, will soon begin work on legislation to provide direct payments to Americans to help them afford the rising cost of health insurance, one of the core disagreements between the political parties that led to the shutdown. “We want a health care system where we pay the money to the people instead of the insurance companies,” Trump said from the Oval Office. “And I tell you, we are going to be working on that very hard over the next short period of time.”House members told to head to D.C.Earlier in the day, House Speaker Mike Johnson urged representatives to begin traveling back to Capitol Hill as soon as possible to ensure they arrive in time to vote on the bill to reopen the government, after the measure arrives from the Senate. The Louisiana Republican’s request came as airlines were forced to delay or cancel thousands of flights on the 41st day of the shutdown, a situation that could potentially impact a House vote on the stopgap spending bill if members don’t follow his advice. “The problem we have with air travel is that our air traffic controllers are overworked and unpaid. And many of them have called in sick,” Johnson said. “That’s a very stressful job and even more stressful, exponentially, when they’re having trouble providing for their families. And so air travel has been grinding to a halt in many places.”Johnson then told his colleagues in the House, which hasn’t been in session since mid-September, that lawmakers from both political parties “need to begin right now returning to the Hill.”Trump threatens air traffic controllersTrump took a markedly different tone over the challenges air traffic controllers have faced during the shutdown in a social media post that he published several hours before he spoke to reporters about the deal to reopen government. “All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!! Anyone who doesn’t will be substantially ‘docked,’” Trump wrote, without explaining what that would mean for workers who had to take time off since the shutdown began Oct. 1. Trump added that he would like to find a way to provide $10,000 bonuses to air traffic controllers who didn’t require any time off during the past six weeks.“For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU. You didn’t step up to help the U.S.A. against the FAKE DEMOCRAT ATTACK that was only meant to hurt our Country,” Trump wrote. “You will have a negative mark, at least in my mind, against your record. If you want to leave service in the near future, please do not hesitate to do so, with NO payment or severance of any kind!” An end in sightThe package will provide stopgap funding for much of the federal government through January 30, giving lawmakers a couple more months to work out agreement on nine of the dozen full-year spending bills.  The package holds several other provisions, including the full-year appropriations bills for the Agriculture Department, the Legislative Branch, military construction projects and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. Seven Democrats and one independent broke ranks Sunday on a procedural vote that advanced the package, drawing condemnation from some House members and outside advocacy groups unhappy that no solution was arrived at to counter skyrocketing health insurance premium increases for people in the Affordable Care Act marketplace.Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate, where bipartisanship is required for major bills to move forward under the 60-vote legislative filibuster. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said during a floor speech Monday he was “grateful that the end” of the stalemate was in sight. “We’re on the 41st day of this shutdown — nutrition benefits are in jeopardy; air travel is in an extremely precarious situation; our staffs and many, many other government workers have been working for nearly six weeks without pay,” Thune said. “I could spend an hour talking about all of the problems we’ve seen, which have snowballed the longer the shutdown has gone on. But all of us, Democrat and Republican, who voted for last night’s bill are well aware of the facts.”Schumer bid for deal on health care costs failsSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was far less celebratory after his bid to get Republicans to negotiate a deal on health care costs by forcing a shutdown failed. “The past few weeks have exposed with shocking clarity how warped Republican priorities truly are. While people’s health care costs have gone up, Republicans have come across as a party preoccupied with ballrooms, Argentina bailouts and private jets,” Schumer said. “Republicans' breach of trust with the American people is deep and perhaps irreversible.” “And now that they have failed to do anything to prevent premiums from going up, the anger that Americans feel against Donald Trump and the Republicans is going to get worse,” Schumer added. “Republicans had their chance to fix this and they blew it. Americans will remember Republican intransigence every time they make a sky-high payment on health insurance.” Schumer was insistent throughout the shutdown that Democrats would only vote to advance a funding bill after lawmakers brokered a bipartisan deal to extend tax credits that are set to expire at the end of December for people who purchase their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace. That all changed on Sunday when Democratic Sens.

The store is a project started by Heppner, who is under indictment for financial fraud for allegedly siphoning $150 million from a now-bankrupt company. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Kansas Legislature's YouTube channel) TOPEKA — Texas businessman Brad Heppner’s insistence on construction of a grandiose $20 million grocery store in Hesston proved too complicated for the project to get off the ground before the unsealing of an indictment alleging he orchestrated a $150 million financial fraud.
Federal charges against Heppner, who was CEO of the Beneficient company in Dallas and a founder of the Beneficient Heartland Foundation in Hesston, were revealed days before an interim committee of the Kansas Legislature convened to review activities tied to Beneficient. The Legislature several years ago ordered state regulators to issue a unique bank charter to fuel Beneficient’s business catering to wealthy investors trying to unload illiquid assets. In exchange, Heppner promised to fund rural economic development in Kansas.
The House-Senate oversight committee was keen to hear from Beneficient executives about fallout from Heppner’s indictment for purportedly pilfering $150 million from a now-defunct company. The cash was allegedly funneled through Beneficient into other business entities for Heppner’s personal use. The U.S. Department of Justice offered no indication the alleged malfeasance involved the Heartland Foundation.
The bipartisan legislative committee also was eager for an update on the effort to deliver on Heppner’s 2022 promise to build a grocery store in Hesston, where he grew up. Hesston has 3,400 residents and has been without a grocery store since 2018.
Financing for the downtown grocery store would be derived from the Heartland Foundation. It was established with an initial donation of about $6.5 million from Heppner and his wife, Aurelia. Cash or stock generated by Beneficient’s asset-management business would be sent to the foundation.
Denise Goevert, chair of the board of directors of Beneficient Heartland Foundation, told state legislators that Heppner’s absence from the grocery store conversation in Hesston would allow community members to take the lead. It should clear the path for a more basic store costing less than $10 million, she said.
“You guys get rid of the stupid underground parking garage?” asked Rep. Rick Hoheisel, a Wichita Republican and chairman of the interim committee.
“Thank you, yes, and no tunnel,” said Goevert, eliciting a few chuckles in the Capitol meeting room.
“I call it like I see it guys,” Hoheisel said.
 
Climate-controlled parking
Heppner’s plan called for a “climate-controlled, weather-friendly garage that keeps shoppers out of the elements.” There would be golf carts with free battery chargers, but also parking capacity “exceeding town ordinances.” Heppner pushed for a store of 18,000 to 20,000 square feet of space at street level, a delicatessen-style restaurant, a bakery, an on-site butcher, locally sourced produce and German food specialties.
Sen. Stephen Owens, a Hesston Republican and a member of the interim legislative committee, said Heppner’s vision was “quite ostentatious.”
Owens was a member of the foundation board for more than one year but stepped down because he concluded that role could be viewed as a conflict of interest. He said the grocery project was important to Hesston’s future.
At the outset of planning for a grocery store in 2022, Heppner said his vision for the foundation was to demonstrate how Beneficient and rural Kansas communities could be “ambitious and work together.”
“My success today is built on a strong foundation of community and values, a reflection of the place where I grew up,” Heppner said at the time.
Heppner said during presentations to committees of the House and Senate hat he was inspired to pursue the grocery store idea because his mother expressed frustration Hesston didn’t have a market in town. Heppner resigned from Beneficient in June.
Meanwhile, Kansas banking commissioner David Herndon, who has limited jurisdiction over Beneficient’s activities in Kansas, told legislators the Office of State Bank Commissioner had information indicating the limited liability company formed by the Heartland Foundation to handle the grocery project “forfeited its standing in Kansas for failure to file its annual report with the secretary of state” by a July 15 deadline.
Goevert said she would check with the foundation’s accounting firm to determine why the LLC filing wasn’t made on time.
 
Overhaul grocery plan
In the legislative committee briefing, Goevert said Hesston community leaders involved with the foundation could sell as much as $1 million in real estate acquired by the foundation. That cash could be poured into a more reasonably sized grocery store, she said.
Goevert said the foundation also must find a way to reduce the amount of capital required to construct the store. Instead of relocating a Hesston lending institution and blending that vacant structure into a grocery store, she said, it might be possible to find an alternate site along Main Street that wouldn’t require expensive structural demolition or utility upgrades.
“With the change in leadership at Beneficient, we’ve taken a step back as a board to evaluate our initial plan,” she said. “This has been a challenge, and especially within the last several months.”
Goevert, a former Hesston school teacher, owns The Nest, a store near Main Street occupying retail space made possible by the foundation.
The new grocery store must be large enough serve needs of local residents doing their grocery shopping and help drive prosperity in nearby businesses, she said.
“We need a sustainable grocery store,” Goevert said. “As a board, we are focused on simplifying and streamlining the grocery store project.”
Optimistically, she said, the right-sized project in proximity to Main Street could come to fruition in 2027. White’s Foodliner, which operates grocery stores in Kingman, Linsborg, Lyons and other Kansas communities, remains committed to managing a new store in Hesston, she said.
“We know there is a desire for visible activity,” she said. “We need to be moving forward at a a faster pace.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Denise-Goevert-hesston-2-1024x577.png,,,2025-11-10 17:57:15.792330

Jim Pillen appointed Douglas County District Court Judge Derek R. Vaughn on Monday as the next associate justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court.
The appointment for the Supreme Court’s Second Judicial District replaces the first woman on Nebraska’s high court with the high court’s first person of color, according to state records and national data since 1960.

Vaughn served Douglas County as a county court judge for a decade before Pillen elevated him to the district court two years ago. He will represent the Omaha-area seat previously held by former Justice Lindsey Miller-Lerman, who retired Oct. 31, having served since 1998.
“I’m ready to pull my sleeves up and ready to get to work,” Vaughn said Monday.
‘I see people for people’
Vaughn graduated from the Nebraska College of Law in 1999 and served in the Douglas County Attorney’s Office between then and 2013, when former Gov. Dave Heineman appointed him to the county bench. Vaughn handled civil and criminal cases, as well as cases in problem-solving courts. He also is now one of four drug court judges in Douglas County.

As a prosecutor, Vaughn said he worked with people at their worst — including some without hope or family support — whom he wanted to provide second chances. As a judge, Vaughn said he came “full circle” and encouraged and motivated people facing similar situations in his courtroom.
“People may be telling you that you’re nothing, and I’m saying that you matter, you’re somebody,” Vaughn said of that work. “It’s wonderful when the light clicks back on.”
He continued: “I see people for people, and I’m going to treat people the way that I would want to be treated, with respect, with dignity.”
‘Unmatched’ love for family, community
Pillen said Vaughn’s background in a family that believes in the power of education and public service, as well as his dedication to community, were among the qualities that stood out for the appointment. The governor described Vaughn’s love of family and community as “unmatched.”
“It is the combination of that court experience, community involvement, incredible reputation and commitment to our state that makes Justice Vaughn a great choice to serve in our state Supreme Court,” Pillen said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Omaha attorney Patrick Guinan and Vaughn were the only candidates to apply for the Supreme Court seat. The duo faced public interviews in mid-October and both applicants were forwarded to Pillen for his consideration. At least two candidates must be considered for judicial appointments.
Vaughn said the lack of lawyers seeking vacant judgeships, particularly in more rural areas, is one the biggest challenges facing the judicial branch and that the “next generation of judges” needs to be engaged. Pillen agreed in wanting to emphasize the privilege of being a public servant.
The Nebraska Supreme Court consists of six associate justices who serve specific judicial districts and a chief justice who serves the state at large. Every member of the state Supreme Court attended Vaughn’s appointment ceremony.
Nebraska Supreme Court justices are paid a salary of $228,431.18. District court judges are paid $211,298.84.
Vaughn’s appointment will head to voters in the Second Judicial District beginning in the 2028 general election. If retained, he would face a retention vote every six years, pursuant to the Nebraska Constitution.
Day in court
As a trial court judge, Vaughn said he viewed himself as the impartial “referee” for lawyers and worked to ensure that the process was fair. He said he would take that understanding to the Supreme Court and that he often tells people, “I have no agenda. This is your day in court.”
“I want people to feel that even if you’re upset with the decision, that you were heard and that whatever position that you may be taking, that it was considered, and you can understand the reasoning behind the opinions,” Vaughn said.

Vaughn said the Supreme Court seemed a “natural fit.” He noted that his father was the first African American game management agent for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the first African American U.S. marshal for the District of Nebraska. His mother was a long-time teacher. He said he grew up with “outstanding role models” who encouraged education.
“Never forget where you came from and be involved,” Vaughn said. “Do the best that you can do.”
Vaughn said he interviewed with Pillen one morning in Lincoln and had to return to Omaha for court. Vaughn said he was “elated” and “speechless” to learn he would be appointed, earning a laugh from family when he said he is “not normally lost for words.”
Vaughn’s wife, two adult children, mother, nieces, sisters and pastor joined him Monday.
“This is my village here, at least part of my village, and I’m so honored and humbled just to be here today,” Vaughn said. “Thank you, Governor Pillen, for this amazing opportunity.”
A ‘people person’
Nebraska Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly, a former county attorney for Lancaster County and later U.S. attorney for Nebraska, has helped Pillen with his now-three Supreme Court appointments. Pillen elevated Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke in November 2024 and selected now-Justice Jason Bergevin to succeed Funke

Kelly said he has known Vaughn for more than 20 years across two county attorneys’ offices. Kelly said Vaughn is a “likable guy” and “people person” who became a fast friend.
“He’s a great guy to know and great to watch him in the community and the things that he does off the bench that keep him keyed in,” Kelly said.
Pillen said he has been in Vaughn’s community many times over the past three years as governor and always saw Vaughn as an active member with a great heart. Pillen said Vaughn is the same man he was when he became a county judge in 2013.
“I’m focused on people’s eyes, not their color, not where they’re at, just on their eyes and who they are. Eyes are the gateway,” Pillen said. “I couldn’t be more proud to have appointed Judge Vaughn.”

ByHeart recalled two lots of infant formula on Saturday, according to a Centers for Disease Control Prevention post on the investigation. The recall of the formula, which makes up less than 1% of infant formula sales, won’t cause shortages, the CDC said.
The 13 suspected or confirmed botulism cases come from 10 states and includes one case in Minnesota from August. No deaths have been reported.
Botulism is a serious, rare and potentially fatal illness caused by ingesting a poison called botulinum toxin that is produced by a bacteria. The illness is highly treatable but, when untreated, can lead to difficulty breathing, paralysis and death. The best known way infants under 12 months get botulism is through ingesting honey.
The CDC says that parents should throw away or return recalled formula, wash items that have touched any recalled formula and seek immediate medical care if an infant has consumed ByHeart formula and has symptoms of botulism.
Symptoms include difficulty feeding and swallowing, loss of head control, constipation, a weak cry and decreased facial expression. Though symptoms usually begin 18 to 36 hours after ingesting the toxin, CDC’s notice also warns that symptoms can take as long as weeks to develop.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/formula-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-10 17:57:15.792330

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota has submitted a request to the federal government to prohibit North Dakotans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from using their benefits to buy soft drinks, energy drinks or candy. 
If approved, products like chewing gum, chocolate-covered nuts, sweetened cereal bars and energy shots will soon be off-limits under the program.
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services submitted the waiver request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture in late October. The state wrote in the proposal that it would  take roughly eight months to implement the changes.
“This waiver request addresses public health challenges across ND by aiming to improve the nutritional well-being of SNAP participants,” the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services wrote in the document.
The new policy would require the roughly 600 retailers that take SNAP benefits in North Dakota to update their sales systems so that any attempt to purchase prohibited items with SNAP money is automatically declined, according to the waiver request.
Partial food assistance benefits available in North Dakota

The state is pursuing the food ban in part to secure more money from the federal government’s $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. While states will get at least $500 million from the grant, federal guidelines state that they could be eligible for more if they implement certain health-related policies, including SNAP waivers.
In its application for Rural Health Transformation Program money submitted earlier this week, the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services wrote that it expects its SNAP waiver to be approved in early November.
The waiver request states that soft drinks would include “any carbonated, nonalcoholic beverages that contain water, a sweetening agent” and flavoring. The definition specifically excludes carbonated flavored water and powdered drink flavorings.
The waiver request defines energy drinks as beverages made “to enhance energy, alertness, or physical performance” that contain stimulants like “fortified caffeine, guarana, glucuronolactone or taurine.” It says sports drinks like Powerade and Gatorade don’t fall under this category.
Candy is defined in the proposal as products containing “sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners in combination with chocolate, fruits, nuts, or other ingredients or flavorings in the form of bars, drops, or pieces.” The definition excludes food containing flour and food that must be refrigerated. It says honey, sugar, molasses, maple syrup and corn syrup by themselves don’t count as candy.
According to the document, “chocolate covered nuts, candy coated nuts, honey roasted nuts, caramel apples, trail mix with candy pieces” would all count as candy. Sweetened cereal bars without flour and energy bars “containing a ‘supplemental facts’ box” would also be considered candy, it states.
The waiver request indicates that it won’t cost much money for the state of North Dakota to implement the food restrictions because most of those expenses will be carried by retailers that accept SNAP benefits.

The North Dakota state government will soon begin reaching out to those businesses to notify them of the change. It will provide them with technical assistance if needed, the proposal states.
It also says the state will be taking steps to ensure SNAP recipients in North Dakota are informed of the changes.
According to the proposal, about 83,000 North Dakotans received SNAP benefits during the 2025 fiscal year.

The rainbow flag of the gay pride movement and the flag of the United States | Getty ImagesThe United States Supreme Court has declined to revisit the 2015 landmark ruling that gave same-sex couples marriage equality, a failure for former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis.
Davis made national headlines in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses to several same-sex couples based on her religious beliefs. With the help of conservative legal firm Liberty Counsel, Davis has tried to avoid paying $100,000 as ordered by a federal jury to one of the couples she refused, David Ermold and David Moore. She ultimately tried to use that appeal to challenge Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that required states to license same-sex marriages.
The nation’s highest court on Monday said it will not hear the challenge.
Mat Staver, Liberty Counsel’s founder and chairman who represents Davis, said he “will continue to work to overturn Obergefell.”
“Davis was jailed, hauled before a jury, and now faces crippling monetary damages based on nothing more than purported hurt feelings,” Staver said. “By denying this petition, the High Court has let stand a decision to strip a government defendant of their immunity and any personal First Amendment defense for their religious expression.”

Kevin Jennings, the CEO of Lambda Legal, a pro-LGBTQ+ advocacy law firm, called the case “frivolous” in celebrating its defeat.
“This is a victory not only for the LGBTQ+ community, but for everyone who believes in our Constitution and the rule of law. The court’s decision reaffirms a simple fact: equal protection of the law applies to all, not just some,” Jennings said in a statement. “This frivolous case now belongs in the trash bin of history.”
Jenny Pizer, Lambda Legal’s senior director of strategic initiatives said the decision to not hear the case by the Supreme Court “rightly leaves marriage equality crystal clear and undisturbed.”
Pizer said LGBTQ+ people and their families “still need vigilance and protection,” though.
“We secured the freedom to marry for same-sex couples over a decade ago in our landmark 2015 Supreme Court victory, Obergefell v. Hodges, thanks to the powerful stories of thousands of couples and their families throughout the country, including in our many court cases,” Pizer said. “The fundamental rights of liberty and equal protection that the court affirmed back then remain essential for all American families today.”

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Issues with outside vendors handling West Virginia’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits are the hold up to thousands of residents getting their food stamps amount, while some other states have already begun distributing benefits. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey told reporters on Monday that he is “aggressively” pushing vendors to get partial benefits loaded onto residents’ EBT cards — what they use to make food purchases with SNAP — as quickly as possible. 
A Saturday memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service said states should fund 65% of SNAP benefits, and West Virginia has to calculate that amount for about 275,000 residents who use the program.
Morrisey said the SNAP processing vendors were having “a lot of technical issues and feasibility issues.”
“I’ve made it clear that I want us to be running as fast as possible to be able to get these systems working,” he said. “I’ve had calls and meetings today on that to really challenge all the contractors to move very fast … They must. I mean, people’s lives are at stake, and we need people to do their job confidently.”
SNAP benefits were delayed for millions of Americans at the start of this month due to the federal government shutdown.
As a result, West Virginia food banks have seen a high increase in need. National Guard members continue to help with food distributions around the state.
Morrisey said that if the government reopens, he believed the state could quickly load EBT cards with full benefits for residents.
“I want to emphasize the quickest way all this comes to an end is for the shutdown to end, because what they say, from a technical perspective, is that they can more quickly load up the full benefits than any of the partial benefits,” the governor said. 
While West Virginia figures out its SNAP calculations, a national legal battle from the Trump administration over food stamps could impact the amount residents will receive, as well. 
A federal appeals court on Sunday rejected a bid from President Donald Trump to pay only partial benefits to Americans during the shutdown. In response, the Trump administration told the Supreme Court that it intends to continue seeking a stay of a lower court’s order requiring full payment of November SNAP benefits until the shutdown ends.
Morrisey announces another $2M for food banks, still mulling special legislative session 
While the SNAP processing issues continue, Morrisey announced another $2 million in funding on Monday for food banks, bringing the state’s contribution to more than $13 million.
“We don’t know the exact date in terms of when the government would be open, and I want to make sure that no one goes hungry,” Morrisey said. 
There is a bipartisan deal advancing in the U.S. Senate that could move to end the government shutdown after key Democrats split from their party Sunday night to join Republicans in moving the measure forward. The package restores pay and protections for federal workers and would also fully fund SNAP through next September.
It doesn’t extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire at the end of the year that Democrats had been holding out for.
The GOP-controlled House would still need to vote on it before it could head to Trump’s desk to be signed. 
Morrisey promised around $14 million to food banks during the SNAP delay and said he’d call in the Legislature for a special session to appropriate more funds if the need exceeds that amount. 
With the unknowns in Washington, D.C., Morrisey is still considering bringing in the Legislature.
“From the conversations with the food banks, we’re in a good position to at least Nov 17,” Morrisey said. “But I don’t want to fall behind this … So if it’s later today or tomorrow — I want to make sure that we’re gauging what’s going on — if I need to call the Legislature back in, I’ll probably know in the next 24 to 36 hours. I won’t be afraid to do it.”
The governor urged residents in need of a home food delivery to call or text 211, the state’s 24/7 helpline.

Sublette County resident is free while awaiting trial and isn’t required to post bond to stay out of jail. 
The post Infamous wolf captor Cody Roberts pleads not guilty, trial set for March appeared first on WyoFile .","PINEDALE—The Sublette County man who allegedly snowmobiled into a wolf and then brought it into a Western Wyoming bar for hours to amuse friends and family will fight his felony charge, sending one of the country’s highest-profile animal cruelty cases in years toward a trial. 
Appearing virtually before Sweetwater County District Court Judge Richard Lavery on Monday afternoon, Cody Roberts initially ran into technological issues — his camera wasn’t working for over five minutes, and the judge was requiring him to appear on video. Eventually, aided by Laramie attorney Rob Piper, who was also appearing by video, Roberts got his computer camera functioning. 
The legal proceedings lasted only about 15 minutes. Roberts told the judge he understood the charges being brought against him, which Lavery read from an amended indictment. 
Roberts “knowingly and with intent to cause undue suffering” … “tortured or tormented” a “male gray wolf,” the judge read from the charging document.
“How do you plead?” Lavery asked.
“Not guilty,” Roberts said.

Sublette County Prosecuting Attorney Clayton Melinkovich, who spearheaded the case against Roberts, did not speak in any depth about his case or foreshadow his legal arguments. 
On Feb. 29, 2024, Roberts brought the injured wolf into the Green River Bar in Daniel and tormented the muzzled animal for hours. The longtime resident, who owns a trucking business, was drinking and made a joke out of the wolf’s plight, according to an eyewitness. But the young wolf’s languid behavior suggested that it was suffering from massive internal injuries after reportedly being legally struck with a snowmobile until it was “barely conscious,” according to state officials.  
The resulting outrage was intense, inflamed both by photos that emerged from the night and the Wyoming Game and Fish Department’s initial response. Wardens fined him $250 for possession of warm-blooded wildlife instead of forcing him to make a mandatory court appearance and face possible stiffer penalties. 
By mid-April 2024, Robert’s treatment of the wolf had drawn intense scorn and indignation, which filtered in from around the world. The online outrage was so overwhelming that the state of Wyoming had to cease tourism promotion on its social media channels. 
Monday’s arraignment was the first time that Roberts had publicly addressed his actions. WyoFile has made repeated attempts to interview him without success. 
During his Monday arraignment, neither Roberts, nor his attorney, Piper, spoke about the events from spring 2024. 
Shortly after the treatment of the wolf blew up in the media, Sublette County law enforcement officials made it clear they disagreed with Game and Fish’s interpretation of Wyoming’s animal cruelty statutes. The state agency maintained that those laws — which carry more severe penalties — didn’t apply because of the wolf’s “predatory animal” status. The county opened its own probe that stayed active for more than a year, examining whether Roberts should be charged with felony animal cruelty.

Ultimately, Melinkovich turned the decision to indict Roberts over to a grand jury — a rarely used tool in the state court system that gave the county attorney subpoena power and the ability to examine witnesses who weren’t otherwise willing to testify. 
The grand jury proceedings last summer occurred behind closed doors and all associated records are sealed. On Aug. 20, the 12-person panel returned a “true bill” resulting in the indictment against Roberts, charging him with a felony that could carry up to two years in jail.
The county’s prosecuting attorney did not ask Lavery that Roberts be booked into custody, nor did he ask that Roberts post a monetary bond to remain out of jail.
“I see no concerns with Mr. Roberts not remaining or returning to the area to face these charges at trial,” Melinkovich said. 
Roberts’ trial is scheduled for 9 a.m. March 9. 
Although the first step in the felony charges against Roberts was held virtually, a video feed of the proceedings was streamed at the Sublette County District Court.  
Only five people were present in the room, and four of them were journalists. The only other member of the public who showed up was Peggy Bell, who said she was Robert’s middle school librarian. 
“I support Cody 100%,” Bell said.

(Screenshot by South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Department of Social Services says it began preparations over the weekend to issue partial food assistance benefits for this month, but the department is also keeping open the possibility that it could pay full benefits.
In either case, said an advisory on the department’s website as of Monday afternoon, benefits won’t come until “later this week.” The 10th day of the month, which was Monday, is the normal day for payment of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in the state.
RF Buche, whose Buche Foods stores serve many SNAP participants in South Dakota, said it’s not clear when benefits might come or whether those benefits will be the full amount or a partial amount.
“Right now, we’re just sitting and waiting,” Buche said. “Waiting to hear what comes next, and hoping that what we hear next will be accurate.”
Rapidly changing situation
The confusion comes in response to federal government shutdown-related chaos affecting the program that helps 42 million Americans, including 75,000 South Dakotans, afford groceries.
On Thursday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to pay the program’s full November benefits, despite the ongoing shutdown.
South Dakota won’t tap reserve funds to fill federal food assistance gap, governor says

On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture told states it was releasing full November funding for SNAP, and the South Dakota Department of Social Services said it would pay full benefits Monday.
Later Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the order from the lower court, which the Trump administration had appealed. A decision from the Supreme Court is expected Tuesday. The South Dakota Department of Social Services reacted Saturday by saying it had “paused implementation of its plan to provide full benefits.”
A Saturday memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service said states should fund 65% of benefits. In South Dakota, said the Department of Social Services, paying partial benefits “involves several days of system programming and approval.” 
Meanwhile, the department said, it is “also monitoring the probability that Congress will act to re-open the federal government this week.” On Sunday night, the U.S. Senate advanced a bill that could end the shutdown, but the legislation still needs final Senate approval and also needs approval from the House of Representatives and President Donald Trump.
“DSS will issue November benefits — either partial or full, depending on the timing of Congress’s actions — later this week,” said a message on the state department’s website as of Monday morning.
Crow Creek eying backstops
Crow Creek Tribal Chairman Peter Lengkeek took to his tribe’s Facebook communications page to warn members that no SNAP checks would come Monday, but that state officials “assured me they are working diligently on the issue.”
“The tribe is also working to fill that gap by partnering with private entities, local churches and tribal programs to provide the necessary food items as needed,” Lengkeek wrote. “I will pass along information as I receive it.”
In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight, Lengkeek said Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff took his call Monday and told him the agency intends to get SNAP benefits of 65% out to South Dakotans by Wednesday. 
About 40% of people in Buffalo County, where the tribe’s headquarters are located, receive SNAP benefits.
The Crow Creek tribe has worked on building a food sovereignty program since 2020, Lengkeek said, in response to near-shortfalls in food availability during the COVID-19 pandemic. The tribe purchased a herd of elk, as well as buffalo and cattle, and built up a processing plant. 
Typically, the livestock operation functions as a money-maker for the tribe, Lengkeek said, but the animals can also serve as a backstop in situations where food may run out. The tribe is prepared to slaughter some of its buffalo and cattle if necessary, Lengkeek said. 
The tribe also recently set up a soup kitchen in Fort Thompson that opens three times a week, serving as many as 300 each time. That happened before the government shutdown, the chairman said.
“Wages are stagnant, benefits have been stagnant, so we’ve had to do that to fill the gap,” he said.
Grocer uses nonprofit to distribute food vouchers
RF Buche is president of Buche Foods, a grocer that serves many tribal communities, including on the Crow Creek reservation. Like Lengkeek, he said SNAP payments aren’t high enough at current prices.
The payments are nonetheless critical for many South Dakota families, Buche said.
Three of the nation’s most SNAP-dependent counties are centered on tribal land in South Dakota, and benefit recipients in those low-population counties represent an outsized share of the $15 million in monthly SNAP benefits paid throughout the state. Those counties include Todd County, home of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, and Oglala Lakota County, home of the Pine Ridge Reservation.
“In Todd and Oglala Lakota alone, you’re looking at $2.5 million in benefits,” Buche told South Dakota Searchlight, estimating that another $5 million in benefits flow to families who live in the other tribal communities served by his stores.
Three of the nation’s most SNAP-dependent counties are in South Dakota

There have been some inventory and ordering headaches for Buche’s store managers over the past few weeks and into the weekend, but those issues, he said, “are minute in comparison to what families are going through when they don’t know where their next meal is coming from.”
Team Buche Cares, the grocer’s nonprofit arm, distributed about $300,000 in food vouchers to SNAP-eligible families over the weekend. That was facilitated in part by donations that came after the SNAP concerns bubbled over with the government shutdown. 
A Wagner business owner donated enough to feed 50 families “without being asked,” Buche said, and a Pine Ridge store’s appearance in a CNN article spurred additional donations.
“People from all over the country have been sending anything from $10 on up,” Buche said. “It’s been very humbling.”
In his interview with Searchlight, Lengkeek said he’s been grateful to Buche for the assistance on the Crow Creek Reservation. Anna Halverson, an Oglala Sioux Tribal Council representative, expressed a similar sentiment. It’s “nothing new” for Buche’s charitable arm to offer aid to Pine Ridge, she said, but it’s also not especially uncommon for tribes to find themselves in the position of needing help.
It’s not supposed to be like that, Halverson said. Treaties inked between the U.S. government and tribal leaders in 1851 and 1868 were meant to guarantee food security for Native Americans in exchange for land. Halverson said cuts or proposed cuts to SNAP, as well as the threat of benefit losses in a shutdown, open old wounds from broken treaty promises.
“As leaders, it feels like our people’s basic human needs are being used as bargaining chips,” Halverson said. “Food should never be a weapon.”
Feeding South Dakota: More people using food network
Stacey Andernacht, a spokeswoman for Feeding South Dakota, said her organization’s statewide food distribution network has also seen a boost in support over the past month. 
Shortly after the shutdown began, the group put up a banner on its website asking for support to provide 500,000 more meals in response to both a pre-shutdown spike in need and the anticipated need that would appear with a loss or cut in SNAP benefits.
The help has been welcome and necessary, but Andernacht said it’s unrealistic to expect donations to cover the loss of SNAP. The program provides nine meals for every one that Feeding South Dakota does, she said.
States told by Trump administration to ‘undo’ full SNAP benefits paid for November

“You’d be talking about trying to grow our inventory ten times,” she said.
Feeding South Dakota does about 100 mobile food distribution events each month. Last week saw 25 such distributions. Not all of them saw an increase in visitors, but the average increase for those that did was 21%. 
In July, the organization asked for $3 million from state government in the state’s upcoming budget to continue to help the same number of families it historically has. Earlier this month, Feeding South Dakota said its need has grown beyond that amount; meanwhile, South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden told South Dakota Searchlight he was unaware of the funding request.
On Monday, Andernacht said the organization has been “hyperfocused on the response” to the SNAP situation and hasn’t re-engaged with lawmakers on funding. She expects the topic to come up when the Legislature convenes for the 2026 session in January, though.
“The community is engaging and we’re getting great support, but it’s hard when you start from behind,” she said.

Special Superior Court Judge Clayton D. Somers granted a preliminary injunction to children who had sued through their parents over the rate cuts. 
Somer’s ruling means payment rates to providers of Applied Behavioral Analysis cannot be cut before a trial. ABA aims to improve social skills and communication, increase positive behavior and reduce negative behavior, according to the Cleveland Clinic. 
Starting Oct. 1, NC DHHS cut rates to Medicaid providers anywhere from 3% to 10%, claiming the legislature did not appropriate enough money to the insurance program to see it through the budget year. 
Attempts by the legislature to approve increased Medicaid funding became tangled in disagreements between House and Senate Republicans. Republicans have criticized the Medicaid cuts as unnecessary. 
Last week, Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, called the General Assembly back for a special legislative session on Nov. 17 to approve more Medicaid money. The legislature is not required to approve additional funding at the special session. 
The lawsuit against NC DHHS was brought by 21 children through their parents or guardians, who say the 10% cut to ABA is discriminatory because it targets children with a disability.  
All the children who sued are on Medicaid and rely on behavioral healthcare treatment for autism or are on waiting lists for that care, said Michael Easley Jr., one of their lawyers. 
Easley described his clients as “unfairly caught in the middle of a political budget impasse” that could lead to the denial of Medicaid services they rely on, placing them at increased risk of institutionalization or segregation. 
But an attorney for DHHS said the agency’s cuts to ABA therapy are not discriminatory. Adrian W. Dellinger, a lawyer with the state Department of Justice representing the agency, said it also made 10% rate cuts to other services, including to surgical centers, anesthesiology providers and free-standing birth centers.
“These cuts were made with deliberation, not malice,” Dellinger said. 
ABA providers received a 15% rate increase on Jan. 1, 2024, Dellinger told the court. After that increase, spending on ABA increased sharply, with five providers accounting for 41% of the increased spending. 
In 2023, before the rate increase, Medicaid spent $199 million on ABA. Costs were projected to increase 425% by 2026. 
Even with the reduction, Dellinger said, NC Medicaid will pay more for ABA than it did in 2023, and at rates higher than in 42 other states. 
Somers, who served as chief of staff to former Republican House Speaker Tim Moore, pressed Dellinger on whether the legislature could be trusted to come up with the additional money.  Moore appointed Somers to the bench in 2023. 
Somers also repeatedly asked Dellinger if DHHS Secretary Dev Sangvai could be trusted to reverse the rate cuts if the legislature appropriated more money. 
“At the end of the day, this is about trust,” Somers said. Medicaid won’t run out of money until May, he said, while the children could suffer irreparable harm. 
Somers said Sangvai “used a scalpel” to make the cuts. “One might say he made these cuts with surgical precision,” Somers said, echoing a 2016 federal appeals court ruling that struck down a Republican election law the court found targeted Black voters. 
Rhonda Huey of Charlotte smiled with relief after Somers blocked the ABA Medicaid rate cut. 
Huey, who attended the hearing with other parents, said she has two sons with autism, an 8-year-old and an 11-year-old. 
She attended school every day with her eldest son for six years, but no longer has to because of the improvements brought about by ABA. He has now moved out of classes for exceptional children and into a regular classroom, she said. 
ABA “just turned it around,” Huey said. 
She was worried because her son’s provider had said they may no longer accept Medicaid if rates are cut. 
“You could see the difference and impact,” she said. “My baby had missed a lot of birthday parties. We couldn’t go to church. We couldn’t do a lot of things.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NCPW-CC-2014-09-30-judicial-finance-gavel.jpg,,,2025-11-10 17:02:06.496350

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Gov. Dan McKee made clear the Trump administration was to blame for the “chaos and hardship” created by the series of conflicting directives over federal food assistance for low-income families.
But McKee’s Sunday afternoon statement was fuzzy on whether Rhode Island will comply with an eleventh-hour U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) memo, demanding states undo the payments that in some cases had just been distributed to recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) hours earlier. 
“We have reached out directly to Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) within the USDA related to the latest federal communication,” McKee said. “At this time, recipients’ [electronic benefit transfer] cards remain active, and we are seeing Rhode Islanders successfully using those cards.”
He also alluded to in-progress “contingency strategies,” promising, “we will continue to keep Rhode Islanders updated.”
McKee’s office did not respond to multiple requests for clarification and more information on Monday.
The routine transfer of funds to debit cards for SNAP recipients at the beginning of each month has been anything but ordinary during the government shutdown. Funding ran dry ahead of Nov. 1, stoking fears among the 42 million SNAP beneficiaries across the country, along with community nonprofits and grocery stores who depend on the business. 
Just in time, on Oct. 31, a pair of federal court rulings in Rhode Island and Massachusetts presented what looked like relief by ordering the Trump administration to tap emergency federal funding to revive the program — first with partial payments, and then, the full amount ordinarily given per recipient per month. By Friday, the money started flowing to recipients; 79,000 Rhode Islanders had received the full monthly payments as of 4:30 p.m. Saturday — a little over half of the 140,000 total beneficiaries in the state — according to McKee’s office. 
A few hours later, the infamous USDA memo ordered states to “undo” payments, warning that the move was “unauthorized.”
Other Democratic governors stated outright they would not comply with the USDA order. Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin summed up his response in a single word, “no,” while Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey challenged President Donald Trump to a legal fight, declaring “we will see him in court.” 
Even Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, who like McKee has attempted to walk the line between condemnation and conversation with the federal administration, said he would not pull back the SNAP payments already distributed to Connecticut residents, according to news reports.
McKee’s moderated response mirrors his administration’s messaging toward Trump through most of the year — critical, but not bombastic.
“I think it’s in keeping with his relative unwillingness to sort of play the fighter against the Trump administration for lack of a better word,” Adam Myers, an associate professor at Providence College, said in an interview Monday. “Some governors really thrive on that and are trying to make a national name for themselves. That hasn’t really been [McKee’s] approach.”
Myers also sought to distinguish the SNAP funding fight from other battles states have led against the Trump administration for overstepping federal authority on immigration policies, public health, and education, among others. By contrast, federal food assistance has historically been propped up entirely by federal dollars, with states acting as program administrators.
“Intergovernmental programs like food stamps make it difficult for voters to hold government accountable because they don’t know which level of government is at fault,” Myers said.
McKee, who is already facing a stiff reelection battle next year, made clear the blame lies with Trump and the USDA’s “whipsaw memo.”
Helena Buonanno Foulkes, the former CVS executive who is challenging McKee in the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary, criticized the governor in a statement Monday afternoon.
“As Governor, I would refuse to take back SNAP benefits from families who are counting on them to feed their children,” Foulkes said. “This is a president who was trying to make people go hungry as a bargaining chip and I will use every legal tool available to protect Rhode Islanders from President Trump’s harmful attacks.”
But finger-pointing offers little assurance for the low-income Rhode Islanders who depend on the federal food assistance program to afford groceries each month.
The back-and-forth continues to play out in court — both the U.S. Supreme Court and a separate case being heard in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts. Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate advanced a short-term funding bill Sunday night that includes full funding for SNAP.
As of Monday, full payments appear to still be available for Rhode Island SNAP beneficiaries, said Kate MacDonald, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Food Bank. The Rhode Island Department of Human Services, which administers the program on behalf of the state, did not respond to requests for comment Monday.
La Familia Meat Market in Providence’s Silver Lake neighborhood, which accepts EBT cards,  saw fewer shoppers last week and over the weekend, cashier Maria Hernandez told Rhode Island Current on Monday afternoon. The bodega was quiet except for the hum of fluorescent lights and refrigerators.
“They already don’t have that much money, now they can’t even put anything on their (EBT) cards,” she said in Spanish. 
But 500 feet down Pocasset Avenue at Chapines Market, shoppers were seen ordering cuts of meat and picking up plantains from one of the fruit crates near the entrance.
“It’s more or less the same here,” said cashier Evelyn Quiroa.
Local food pantries and soup kitchens reported surges in clients in late October, suspecting the increase was because people were trying to stock up ahead of the loss in monthly federal food assistance.
Meanwhile, questions and concerns about food assistance flooded the phone lines for United Way of Rhode Island’s 211, a 24/7 service provider line. The nonprofit reported 970 calls in total within the first week of November — 30% higher than the typical volume, Michael Cerio, a spokesperson for United Way, said in an interview Monday. Questions specific to food pantries were up 250%, while calls seeking information about the latest guidance on SNAP rose 157%, Cerio said.
Call data does not reflect in-person interactions through United Way’s outreach services. The nonprofit regularly sends employees to community service locations, including food pantries, to educate, answer questions and help people apply for federal food assistance.

California adopted criminal penalties for filing false claims against police officers 30 years ago. The state Supreme Court held that the LAPD went too far in advising people about those penalties when they file citizen complaints.


A warning that people see before filing complaints against Los Angeles police officers creates a barrier to free speech, the California Supreme Court ruled today in a long-running lawsuit over the language.  
The high court ruled 6-1 in favor of the city of Los Angeles and against the union that represents its police officers in finding that the admonishment describing penalties for filing false has the potential to deter “citizens from filing truthful (or at least not knowingly false) complaints of police misconduct”.
The warning exhibits “numerous characteristics that, considered together, sufficiently burden a protected form of speech — namely, truthful (or at least well-intentioned) complaints of police misconduct — so as to warrant heightened constitutional scrutiny,” Associate Justice Joshua Groban wrote in the majority opinion. 
The ruling turned on a 1995 law that sought to create consequences for false claims against police officers: Anyone filing a complaint against an officer could face criminal charges if they knowingly sign a false report.
At the LAPD, officials went further, demanding that complainants affirm, in bold font and all capital letters, that they understand the potential penalties. 
“IT IS AGAINST THE LAW TO MAKE A COMPLAINT THAT YOU KNOW TO BE FALSE,” the LAPD form reads. “IF YOU MAKE A COMPLAINT AGAINST AN OFFICER KNOWING THAT IT IS FALSE, YOU CAN BE PROSECUTED ON A MISDEMEANOR CHARGE.”
The court found that the warning is biased in favor of the police because witnesses who make false statements in defense of an accused officer would face no charges for lying. 
“While the Legislature had a legitimate and significant interest in remedying the harmful effects of abusive false claims of police misconduct, (the law) is not narrowly tailored to meet those objectives,” Groban wrote. “Instead, the statute establishes an ill-defined, asymmetrical criminal provision that is accompanied by an unusual admonition requirement.”
The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing LAPD officers, argued that the form is constitutional and necessary to prevent false complaints that would tie up an officer’s career.
The decision reversed a California appellate court ruling in this case and a 2002 California Supreme Court decision in a related case, both of which agreed with the police union that the warning passed constitutional muster.
California law is now in line with multiple federal court rulings, which found that the warning violates the First Amendment.  
In a dissent, Associate Justice Goodwin Liu said the law and the warning are “no more unconstitutional than laws that make it a crime to commit perjury, file a false police report, submit a false document to a public agency, or lie to a government official concerning an official matter.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/020725_NUHW-Kaiser-Permanente_JWH_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-10 17:02:06.496350

It’s the least Miller could do for two guys who wore, and wear, their love of Waterloo as proudly as the stars on their shoulders.
As a result of donations of cash, labor and materials, two permanent tribute monuments to U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Evan “Curly” Hultman and Brig. Gen. David Cole will grace veterans’ memorials on either side of the Cedar River downtown.
The monuments are to be simultaneously dedicated and unveiled at 10 a.m. Tuesday, Nov. 11, Veterans Day, in a ceremony utilizing both sites and the adjoining Fourth Street Bridge.
Miller headed up the effort as a member of the Veterans Memorial Hall Commission. He estimated the total value of donations in cash, labor and materials at between $20,000 to $30,000.
But the exact dollar amount doesn’t matter to him.
“It’s worth a million bucks to me,” Miller said. “It’s just amazing for me to think that it’s all happened and put together and to think that their legacies are there forever.” He hopes the monuments generate visitors locally and beyond and draw even more attention to the other adjacent veteran memorials.
Hultman, a World War II veteran who worked his way up from the enlisted ranks to head U.S. and NATO reserve officer associations, will have his monument at Soldiers and Sailors Park outside Veterans Memorial Hall. He passed away in February at age 99. He would have turned 100 this past July 15.

Cole is a 1963 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., and served two tours in Vietnam. He turns 85 this month. His tribute marker will be at the Black Hawk County Vietnam Veterans Memorial at Paramount Park, just across the river from Memorial Hall.
Each will have a stone pedestal with their likenesses and accomplishments cast on brass plaques. The project, approved by Waterloo Leisure Services Commission which oversees city parks, as well as the Memorial Hall Commission, was first announced in August, as detailed in a previous “View from the Cedar Valley” column.

The completed monuments will be dedicated and unveiled at a ceremony at 10 a.m. Tuesday, beginning at Veterans Memorial Hall. Cole is returning from Virginia for the event and also will speak at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Grout Museum District’s Sullivan Brothers Iowa Veterans Museum.
Following the ceremonies at Memorial Hall, attendees may gather at either of the memorials to Cole or Hultman. An honor guard will fire a rifle salute and play “Taps” from the Fourth Street Bridge, spanning the river between the two parks, after which the monuments will be simultaneously unveiled.
Promoters of the event, including Hultman’s daughter, retired U.S. Army Col. Heidi Warrington, say the bridge ceremony also will be a symbol of community unity, since Hultman and Cole were from rival high schools from opposite sides of the river — Hultman from Waterloo East High, Cole from Waterloo West High. And ironically, each of their memorials are on the opposite sides of town from where they grew up.
In addition to cash donations for the brass castings and other expenses, labor and materials were donated by Wayne Magee Construction of Cedar Falls, Midland Concrete Products of Waterloo and self-employed father and son masonry contractors Chris and Jaeger Borcherding.
“I’m overwhelmed,” Miller said. “Without the volunteers to guide this, people that stepped up to do this, going above the call of duty to do this … you can’t thank them enough.”
Miller has noted that Hultman and Cole distinguished themselves in civilian and military life as is denoted on their monuments.
Hultman served as Iowa attorney general, U.S. district attorney and headed U.S. and NATO-affiliated reserve officers organizations. He played a key role in working with officers of former Warsaw Pact nations in the 1990s and bringing those nations into NATO following the fall of the Soviet Union under the “Partnership for Peace” program. Cole had a long successful post-military career in the communications industry with America Online and Sprint. He also taught at West Point during his military career.
Hultman, a 1943 graduate of Waterloo East High School, who received his law degree from the University of Iowa, was very involved in the relocation and construction of the present Becker-Chapman Waterloo American Legion Post 138. He also was honorary fund drive chair for the consolidated Waverly Area Veterans Post in nearby Waverly, when the veterans posts there put up a combined rebuilt post after the 2008 flood. He has also co-sponsored many exhibits and events at the Grout Museum District’s Sullivan Brothers Iowa Veterans Museum and supported and performed at fundraisers for Cedar Valley Honor Flight.
Cole, a 1959 graduate of Waterloo West High School, was a featured speaker at the Waterloo Exchange Club’s “Healing Field” observance in 2007, honoring those fallen since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. He has personally greeted, in full dress uniform, every Honor Flight of Waterloo veterans visiting Washington, D.C., near his Virginia home since those flights began in 2011.
Cole has noted that, like so many local Vietnam veterans of his generation, it is especially poignant that his tribute marker and the county Vietnam memorial is at Paramount Park, the site of the old Paramount Theater, of which they have many fond memories from their youth. All Black Hawk County residents killed or missing in action in Vietnam are listed on the marker, including one posthumous Medal of Honor recipient, Robert J. Hibbs of Cedar Falls.

GUESTS: Massachusetts Municipal Association Executive Director Adam Chapdelaine, Amesbury Mayor Kassandra Gove, Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance Executive Director Paul Craney







THE INDUSTRY GROUP group representing all 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts fired a warning flare up to Beacon Hill last month when it published a detailed report likening the budget woes municipalities face to a “perfect storm.”  
But how did communities get to this point? What kind of solutions do they want to see, and what would that mean for taxpayers?  
This week, The Codcast hosts a panel discussion unpacking municipal finance issues with a trio of guests: Massachusetts Municipal Association Executive Director Adam Chapdelaine, Amesbury Mayor Kassandra Gove, and Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance Executive Director Paul Craney.  
The report from the Massachusetts Municipal Association found that unrestricted general government aid to cities and towns has dropped over the past two decades once adjusted for inflation, forcing communities to foot the rising bill for services with budgets that are constrained by a cap on property tax increases.  
In Chapdelaine’s view, the current crisis is a mix of longer-term factors that have been building for decades and the “incendiary pressure of significant inflation” in recent years.  
“It is a little bit of a mix of things that have been in place for a long time but have likely intensified, and some other things that have had more ebbs and flows that are now just ebbs in the wrong direction,” he said.  
That has big implications for constituents. Municipalities are responsible for K-12 schools, local police and fire departments, public works, libraries, and other important services.  
“There’s this friction for the taxpayer that their taxes are going up and they’re paying a lot here, but they are getting less for that dollar,” Gove said.  
In Amesbury, officials pursued a $6 million Proposition 2½ override, asking voters to hike property taxes in exchange for restoring cut educator positions, preventing public safety cuts, and stabilizing budgets for upcoming years.  
The measure failed, with about 58 percent of votes in opposition. (This episode of The Codcast was recorded before the election.)  
Prop 2½, a law voters approved in 1980, limits the amount that cities and towns can increase property taxes each year. It’s landed back in the spotlight in recent weeks, especially after Boston Mayor Michelle Wu called for repealing the measure.  
The law still has some vocal supporters, though, including Craney.  
“Prop 2½ is the reason why people can afford to stay in Massachusetts,” he said. “It’s one of the hallmark pro-taxpayer laws in the entire country. It’s so well-regarded and esteemed that other states are told to go do Prop 2½ as a model.”  
On this episode, guests debate how much of the strain is a result of recent developments and how much stems instead from structural factors (6:35), assess the history and future of Proposition 2½ (13:30), and consider who has the power to solve the problem (26:40).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;quality=80&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-10 17:02:06.496350

Phil Murphy granted 48 people pardons or shortened sentences, bringing his clemency total to 217 since June 2024.","Jamal Muhammad thanks Gov. Phil Murphy for commuting his prison sentence at a Princeton University ceremony on Nov. 10, 2025. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)PRINCETON — Gov. Phil Murphy pardoned 29 people and commuted the prison or parole sentences of 19 others in his fourth round of clemencies Monday, promising he’ll do more before he leaves office in January.
With Monday’s clemencies, Murphy, a Democrat, has now granted 217 pardons and commutations since his clemency initiative launched in June 2024. That’s more than New Jersey’s previous governors have done in the past 30 years combined.
“We can, and we must always, stand as the state for second chances, a state that serves as a model for restorative justice across our entire nation,” Murphy said to a packed room of smiling supporters at Princeton University.
Those in attendance included Jamal Muhammad, who had been sentenced to life in prison with 30 years of parole ineligibility for a 1996 robbery in Atlantic City that turned deadly when his co-defendant shot the victim. Murphy commuted his sentence in April, after he’d been behind bars for 28 years. Since he left prison, he has gotten married, started a business, and started teaching at his mosque.
Monday, Muhammad hugged Murphy and thanked him “a million times” for his freedom.
“Life and freedom have been full of blessings,” he said. “Just to be in a mall, at Great Adventure, at the movies, at a bodega, just to take a walk to Wawa is a miracle. I appreciate each heartbeat, each footstep, every breath.”
Thousands of people have applied for the governor’s mercy through a state board that advises Murphy on executive clemency actions. Some applicants get expedited consideration, including non-violent offenders with long post-conviction periods of good conduct, domestic violence victims whose crimes were related to their victimization, or people convicted at trial whose sentences grossly exceeded pre-trial plea bargains.
Bishop Joshua Rodriguez, the advisory board’s chair, conceded the work is “never simple.”
“Our responsibility is to look beyond an individual’s past mistakes, and consider their entire life, their past actions, their present character, and their future potential to contribute positively to society,” Rodriguez said.
Clemency is essential to ensure true justice, he added.
“Mercy is too often mistaken for weakness, but today, we see it for what it truly is, moral strength in action,” he said.
Muhammad echoed that sentiment, saying he left behind many people in prison who have reformed since their convictions.
“Commutations are very important and very essential. Because we’re human beings and we’re not God, we make errors. We miss the mark at times. It happens,” Muhammad said. “Even the judicial system sometimes, periodically, sporadically, respectfully, has missed the mark. Maybe some people didn’t get their fair result through the court.”
Murphy pardoned Brenda Thompson’s convictions for drug and property crimes dating back to 2000 that she said she committed to support her addiction. She now works as a peer recovery specialist for a Camden-based nonprofit.
“This clemency represents more than a pardon. It represents restoration, redemption, and renewed purpose. I am committed to using this second chance to serve others,” Thompson said.

About 50 Princeton University students have helped Murphy’s effort by volunteering over the past year to research case documents, interview applicants, prepare legal memos, and file petitions under a clemency project sponsored by the university’s School of Public and International Affairs. Some of them were on hand Monday to cheer the latest round. Of 32 applications they have filed, Murphy granted clemency to two of them Monday.

– Jamal Muhammad, clemency recipient



People pardoned in this latest round had been convicted of everything from shoplifting to arson, while those commuted included 14 people convicted of murder or manslaughter and five sentenced to non-homicide felonies, including robbery and kidnapping.
Clemency recipients included:

Laciana Sears, who was sentenced to 22 years for killing her abusive husband. Her sentence was commuted to 10 years.
Calvin Bass, who was 14 when he went to prison for murder. He was released from prison in 2021 after serving 38 years behind bars, and he has testified in Trenton to urge legislators to set a minimum age for juvenile delinquency. His parole supervision was commuted and will end in June 2026.
Timothy Harris, who was 18 in 1992 when he shot a woman during a robbery in Newark and got sentenced to prison for life with 30 years of parole ineligibility. He had unsuccessfully pressed the courts to show the same mercy to young adult offenders that they have ordered for minors convicted of crimes. He will be released from prison and be placed under parole supervision for five years.
Rasool McCrimmon, who refused a seven-year plea bargain stemming from a 2004 murder in Newark and was then sentenced to 50 years in prison, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, whose attorneys represented him. He will be released on parole.

Western states in the Colorado River basin are racing a federal deadline to hash out the beginnings of an agreement governing the overtapped river. As the clock ticks down, two questions loom large: Just how real is this deadline, and what does it mean for California?


The clock is ticking down to a federal deadline Tuesday for California and six other Western states to reach the broad strokes of a deal portioning out supplies from the parched Colorado River. 
Officials at the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the federal stewards for the river under the Department of the Interior, have threatened to impose their own plan if the states can’t agree how to manage the river after 2026, when the river’s current rulebook expires. 
Dire projections that another dry year could send the basin’s major reservoirs plummeting to alarmingly low levels have ramped up the urgency, and the tensions. 
But, after two years of fraught negotiations, the states remain at an impasse. Those in the river’s lower basin — California, Arizona, and Nevada — are clashing with Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico upstream. A key point of contention is how much each basin must scale back their use of the overtapped river as climate change further squeezes supplies. 
“We’ve been in a holding pattern, and we need to land this plane by Tuesday,” J.B. Hamby, California’s chief negotiator as chairman of the Colorado River Board of California, told CalMatters. 
California’s dependence on the Colorado River raises the stakes. The state takes more than half of the power generated at Lake Mead’s Hoover Dam, and more water from the main stem than any other in the basin. Half a million acres of alfalfa, winter vegetables and other crops in the Imperial Valley all rely on the Colorado River, which also supplies urban Southern California via the Metropolitan Water District. 
But California has also been relatively impervious to shortages on the river, with senior water rights long seen as bulletproof. Now, the questions hanging over the last days of negotiations are — how real is the threat of missing the deadline? And what exactly would the consequences be for California?
Blown deadlines on the Colorado River
For decades, federal officials have threatened to intervene if states in the Colorado River basin fail to reach agreement. The threat — and the inevitable lawsuits water suppliers fear would follow — have motivated major deals that now govern the river’s operations. 
Actual federal intervention is far rarer — though the U.S. government has stepped in in the past, on a smaller scale. 
In the early 2000s, Southern California was forced to stop using surplus Colorado River water when other states began clamoring for their fair share. The Interior Department set a deadline of December 31st, 2002 for California’s water agencies to cut a deal weaning themselves off the surplus water, or face immediate cutbacks.  
The Imperial Irrigation District — by far the biggest user of Colorado River water in California — balked. So the Interior Secretary cut California’s supplies, leading to court battles and, ten months later, a deal. 
But deadlines and threats seem to have lost their teeth in recent years, when states in the Colorado River basin have blown deadline after deadline, with little federal response. 
Last week, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs urged the Trump administration to be more assertive. “As we approach critical deadlines, we need the Trump administration to step in, exert leadership and broker a deal,” she said in remarks prepared for a water conference. 
Elizabeth Koebele, a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, said negotiations may have become too contentious for deadlines to matter. She attributed it to fracturing relationships between the basin states as devastatingly dry conditions on the river ratchet up the stakes. 
“We have less water, and it’s caused more rippling problems,” Koebele said. “You’re cutting a smaller pie, for more people.” 
A strike against storage
The Veteran’s Day deadline isn’t the final deadline; it’s an interim milestone as federal officials race to lock in a plan before the current rulebook expires.
Scott Cameron, now acting head of the Bureau of Reclamation, said at a conference in June that in the absence of a deal, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum was prepared to take charge as water master. The position gives him the power to declare the river in shortage and call for cutbacks in the lower basin. 
But the Trump administration declined to specify what exactly it might do. “At this stage, all parties should remain focused on the difficult but necessary work required to reach a seven-state agreement,” an unidentified Interior Department spokesperson said, in an emailed statement.
If there is still no plan by late 2026, the rulebook could revert to one from the 1970s, according to an analysis by Arizona State University’s Kyl Center for Water Policy.  
That worries Metropolitan Water District’s Bill Hasencamp, because it would upend Metropolitan’s ability to continue banking water in the Colorado River basin’s Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the country, for dry spells. 
The water giant imports water from Northern California and from the Colorado River to supply 19 million people in six Southern California counties. 
Right now, Hasencamp, manager of Colorado River resources at Metropolitan, says that the district has socked away about 1.5 million acre-feet of water in the reservoir over the last 20 years. It’s enough to supply 4.5 million households for a year. 
Metropolitan saves Colorado River water in Lake Mead when water from Northern California reservoirs is abundant, and draws on these stores when state supplies dry up. But, under the 1970s-era rules, suppliers would no longer be able to add water to this savings account. Metropolitan would need to use its banked stores over the next ten years, or risk losing the water. 
Hasencamp estimates that banked water could disappear more quickly if California faces greater cuts.
“Under a new regime, the feds — if things get dry enough — could cut us back,” Hasencamp said. “We could access that storage, but we might need it to offset cuts on the river that could come to us. So it’s a very undesirable situation.” 
Ultimately, experts agree that the most undesirable situations, and the greatest risks to the basin states, will likely come from nature itself. 
The Colorado River is in the grips of a megadrought; Brad Udall, a senior water and climate research scientist at Colorado State University’s Colorado Water Institute, called August’s projections for reservoirs Lake Powell and Mead “beyond awful.”
Udall said the latest projections for the reservoirs remain dire. One scenario shows “both Powell and Mead entering uncharted territory by (the) end of Water Year 2026,” Udall said in an email. 
“That’s the new reality,” Cameron, the acting head of Reclamation, said at a meeting in Arizona over the summer. “There are real risks to both the lower basin states and the upper basin states if we don’t collectively do something differently than we’ve done in the past.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/120522_Colorado-River-Canal_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-10 17:02:06.496350

(Photo by Getty Images)Low-income Hoosier families are expected to have access Tuesday to partial benefits from the SNAP federal food aid program.
The Indiana governor’s office made the announcement Monday even as the Trump administration was fighting court orders to restore full SNAP funding and Congress worked toward a deal for ending the federal government shutdown, including fully funding the food aid benefits.
Gov. Mike Braun’s office said SNAP benefits for November should be available on EBT, or Electronic Benefits Transfer, cards on Tuesday.
The state will be able to “move quickly to deliver full benefits to qualifying households across Indiana as soon as possible” once a new federal spending deal is approved, the governor’s office said.
“After weeks of gridlock, it’s good to see some folks in D.C. finally come to their senses,” Braun said in a statement.
The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration said last week that it was recalculating benefit allotments to 274,000 SNAP households in the state. Benefit changes made by federal officials for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP, will reduce the maximum amount to a household by at least 50%.
The calculation of a household’s partial SNAP benefit for November involved subtracting 30% of a household’s monthly net income (after allowable deductions) from the maximum allotment, according to the FSSA. That process could lead to some households not receiving any November benefits.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ebt-1024x650.gif,,,2025-11-10 17:02:06.496350

But it remained unclear how far Connecticut will spread the money.,"Gov. Ned Lamont outlined plans Monday to reserve $500 million in state funds for imperiled federal human service programs while reaffirming his pledge to preserve November SNAP benefits.
But it remained unclear how far Connecticut will spread that fund, equal to one-fifth of last fiscal year’s historic $2.5 billion surplus.
Will it only safeguard services jeopardized by the federal government shutdown, which could be ending soon? Or will it also offset permanent cuts imposed last July by Congress and President Donald Trump? 
Among those cuts are new SNAP working requirements that could leave about 36,000 Connecticut residents without aid between Dec. 1 and March 31.
“We’re here to announce a Federal Emergency Relief Fund,” Lamont said during a late morning press conference, noting the $500 million would be used to bolster the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, other food aid, heating and energy assistance grants and other human service initiatives. “I’m really pleased that we’re able to come to this position and give citizens of Connecticut some confidence and comfort. We’re there. We’ve got your back.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, one of several legislative leaders who joined Lamont at the announcement, predicted the fund would enjoy strong bipartisan support when the state legislature comes into special session on Wednesday and Thursday. He particularly praised House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, for publicly urging the use of state funds to roughly 360,000 Connecticut residents who would continue to receive SNAP benefits.
“In Connecticut,” Ritter added, “you have a culture where people of all parties said, ‘Enough is enough.’”
Legislators are expected to vote Wednesday and Thursday to create a short list of federally funded social programs — involving nutrition, health care, energy assistance and more — that Lamont could add to, drawing from this $500 million response fund. 
Most of the rest of that $2.5 billion surplus will be used to pay down state pension debt, though portions already have been assigned to increase the rainy day fund and to boost a long-term effort to increase child care statewide.
Under the legislation expected to be adopted in the special session, only the governor could recommend specific appropriations from that response fund, legislative leaders said, but a panel of the six highest-ranking state lawmakers — including four Democrats and two Republicans — could block any expenditure with a simple majority vote. 
The fund would expire when the regular 2026 General Assembly session starts Feb. 4, and any unused dollars would also be used to pay down pension debt.
CT officials hopeful that shutdown ends soon, but nothing’s certain
State officials said they assume the federal government shutdown that began Oct. 1 will be over well before early February but conceded little about that saga is easy to predict.
An end appeared in sight around 1 p.m. Friday, when the Trump administration announced federal funding for food assistance would resume immediately — even though the president still was fighting states’ efforts in federal court to secure funding.
But later that day, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the federal government to pause any further payments. In addition, the Trump administration ordered states on Saturday not to provide full SNAP benefits for November.
Connecticut did not follow the directive, and Lamont said the state will cover the entire cost of SNAP benefits for November, about $72 million, if necessary, using this new fund lawmakers will create this week.
Meanwhile, the shutdown appeared to be nearing an end Sunday when eight Democratic U.S. senators broke ranks and agreed to support a temporary federal funding resolution. Congressional leaders said votes could happen early this week, The New York Times reported.
Democrats, who are in the minority on Capitol Hill, had been united against adopting a new federal budget unless Republicans restore health insurance subsidies set to vanish Jan. 1.
That subsidy cutback represents an estimated $340 million annual hit to Connecticut residents who buy insurance on the state’s health exchange.
“I’m very hopeful that the feds are going to come up with a solution that doesn’t penalize our people,” Lamont said. But he added, “I can’t make any predictions about the federal government.”
Will Lamont use CT dollars only to temper pain of fall shutdown?
If the shutdown ends soon, the lion’s share of the $500 million emergency reserve fund would still be intact.
Even if the Trump administration is allowed to penalize Connecticut for using state funds to support SNAP, the $72 million in monthly program costs represents just one-seventh of the fund.
The state is advancing smaller sums of money to replace stalled federal funds in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children — commonly known as WIC — and in a key winter energy assistance program. But Washington already has indicated it will reimburse states for any funds they advance to keep both initiatives afloat during the shutdown.
But the General Assembly, where Lamont’s fellow Democrats are in the majority, began planning a state emergency response fund to offset federal cutbacks last June — almost four months before the federal shutdown.
State legislators had anticipated problems not only from a federal budget standoff but from a major package of federal program cuts that were debated by the GOP-led Congress in early June and passed on July 1.
Those cuts directly affect about 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness who no longer meet new, stricter work requirements for SNAP benefits. They are expected to lose coverage between Dec. 1 and March 31.
And that won’t be changed by the federal shutdown ending.
“As of right now, Connecticut is well-positioned to make sure that these hardships are just going to be dealt with,” said Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven.
Lamont, who committed state funds Friday to restore SNAP benefits that Washington had stalled seven days earlier, drew criticism from legislative leaders from both parties who wanted him to act sooner.
Would the governor use the state response fund to help groups harmed by last July’s federal program cuts, such as this portion of the SNAP population?
“I think it’s something we’re looking at,” he said, adding that he also would explore options to work with federally qualified health centers to assist households losing health insurance premium subsidies.
GOP leader cautions Lamont not to exceed his authority
But even if he appeases his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly and does more to backfill vanishing federal funds for human service programs with state dollars, he could annoy Connecticut Republicans in the process.
GOP leaders here support using the state surplus to ease temporary pain caused by the federal government shutdown. But when Washington cuts social programs permanently, the Connecticut GOP says, state government should be wary about stepping in.
And if Connecticut wants to spend more to pick up services Washington is dropping, Lamont and the General Assembly should find offsetting spending cuts elsewhere in the state budget, they say.
“Obviously there’s a leap of faith here,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, who also attended Monday’s press conference. “We are putting $500 million into the hands of the governor to mitigate this crisis, and we need to make sure that he is doing just that.”
Candelora already was rankled Friday when the governor committed state funds to support SNAP after legislative leaders from both parties had spoken in favor of the concept but before lawmakers formally had voted to create the response fund.
“Unless the governor thinks he’s filed paperwork to run for king of Connecticut, that’s not possible,” Candelora said Friday.
Lamont countered Monday that “timing is important,” and action was needed Friday.
“Look at how desperate people were last week,” he said. “Look at the lines. They’re like bread lines from the Great Depression. People were scared. I wanted to do everything I can to give them confidence.”
Candelora added he remains supportive of a response fund to address human service programs harmed by the shutdown but warned that if Washington resolves that issue before Wednesday’s special General Assembly session begins, more Republicans may vote against it.
“I helped craft this plan, and so I support it,” he said. “But I will just say, if the federal government reopens, I certainly can understand why Republicans will say this fund is no longer necessary.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2324-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-10 17:02:06.496350

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Department of Corrections has not received a request from the federal Bureau of Prisons to move Tina Peters from state prison into a federal facility, despite reported calls from advocates and government officials to do so.
Peters, the former Republican clerk for Mesa County, was found guilty last year on state charges for orchestrating a plan to breach her office’s secure election systems in order to find evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. She was sentenced to nine years in prison and is incarcerated in a state facility in Pueblo.
Since then, right-wing political figures have repeatedly called for her release. Most recently, that included Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who appealed to President Donald Trump on X to “free Tina Peters” following the president’s pardons over the weekend to dozens of people connected to the effort to overturn the 2020 election. Ed Martin, the U.S. pardon attorney, replied “We are working on it!” to a Sunday night post on X about Peters and her potential release.

The president can only issue pardons, however, to people with federal convictions.
Others, including longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon, have floated the idea of transferring Peters from a state prison to a federal facility. A conservative website, Just the News, reported last week that the Office of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche sent an email to the head of the Bureau of Prisons to research how Peters could be transferred to a federal prison and send a request to Colorado for a transfer into federal custody.
A partially redacted copy of the email shared by Just the News showed an unidentified DOJ official ordering the BOP to “explore any and all avenues within BOP’s authority to seek and request” Peters’ transfer to a federal facility.
Colorado Newsline was unable to independently verify the existence of that email.
But CDOC has not received any written request from the BOP about the issue, according to department spokesperson Alondra Gonzalez.
Here’s the list of newly pardoned Trump fake electors, other allies

Any transfer of someone incarcerated in a state prison to another jurisdiction, Gonzalez said, is initiated by the state, not an outside entity.
“This process is typically reserved for complex cases involving significant, long-term safety and security needs,” she wrote in an email. “This protocol requires a formal assessment by a multidisciplinary team and a multi-step internal review. Any such transfer must be reviewed and formally approved before any incarcerated individual can be referred to another jurisdiction.”
In an interview with Bannon on Monday, Martin said the Trump administration had been “fighting for two months to figure out a path on Tina Peters.”
“We did it in a way that puts the right kind of pressure on them,” Martin said. “If you’re Colorado … if the feds say you want something, you change your tune.”
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat, said in a statement that he would oppose any effort to transfer Peters.
“Tina Peters is in state prison because she committed crimes that put the safety of our elections at risk. She was prosecuted and convicted by a jury of her peers for illegally tampering with our election system and violating her duty,” he said. “There is no basis for the Bureau of Prisons to request a transfer of her custody. Any scheme to prevent her from being held accountable under Colorado law is outrageous.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-10 21:10:00+00:00,CT Mirror,State seeks to dismiss medical malpractice case of man who died in DOC custody,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/10/state-seeks-to-dismiss-medical-malpractice-case-of-man-who-died-in-doc-custody/,"The man, Alan Alterisi, died in May 2018 at age 58 after emergency surgery at UConn Health’s John Dempsey Hospital.","The state attorney general’s office is arguing to dismiss a lawsuit alleging medical malpractice after an incarcerated man died from peptic ulcer disease that went undiagnosed and untreated. 
The man, Alan Alterisi, died in May 2018 at age 58 after undergoing surgery at UConn Health’s John Dempsey Hospital. He had been incarcerated since 1997. 
The complaint, filed by Alterisi’s sister Sally Walsh earlier this year in Hartford Superior Court, alleged that four doctors working in the Department of Correction had failed to adequately provide medical care for Alterisi over the course of several years, by not recommending further testing despite his ongoing symptoms. 
In an internal investigation completed after his death, a nurse consultant for the state, Marci Ouellette, said there were “missed opportunities” to identify Alterisi’s internal bleeding and treat it before it got to the point where it was unmanageable. Ouellette said that if Alterisi had received the necessary treatment from the DOC staff, “he likely would not have died on May 25, 2018.” 
A 2023 memo from DOC Director of Security Antonio Santiago also noted that a third-party review of Alterisi’s case had found “deviations from the professional standard of care, policies, and accepted medical standards.”   
In August 2017, Alterisi was found to have a spleen so enlarged that it was considered “high risk for rupture.” In February 2018, he reported having “black tarry stools.” But the nurse consultant’s report noted that he was never given the standard test used to detect blood in stools, and he was not referred to a specialist in gastroenterology. 
The report shows that Alterisi had complained of nausea, vomiting and frequent abdominal pain. He was anemic. Although he was scheduled to attend two medical appointments in late March and early April of 2018 at John Dempsey Hospital, he refused both times, saying he wasn’t able to “sit on a bus or sit at UConn all day.” At the time, he was in custody at Osborn Correctional Institution in Somers.
On May 4 of that year, he went to UConn’s John Dempsey Hospital in severe pain and vomiting blood, with dark stools. It was discovered that he was bleeding internally in his gastrointestinal system. Although he underwent surgery, he died on May 25. 
Ouellette wrote in an email in October 2021 that she believed a doctor who saw Alterisi in February of 2018 had “dropped the ball,” and that “he should have done something.” 
In a court hearing this week, Assistant Attorney General Kelly Deann Neyra argued that the case should be dismissed because a medical doctor who wrote a letter testifying to the DOC medical staff’s failures to properly care for Alterisi practiced in a different specialty than the doctors who treated Alterisi. Medical malpractices cases like this one require that plaintiffs submit testimony from outside medical professionals.
Neyra said this particular testimony didn’t satisfy the requirements for a medical malpractice suit. 
In the unnamed doctor’s letter, dated Jan. 31 of this year, the author said he was board certified in preventative medicine and that he worked as a primary care doctor and medical director in “correctional settings” in Vermont, Washington, Maine, Florida and Ohio. Neyra argued that because the doctor was not a specialist who practiced in internal medicine, he did not have experience treating peptic ulcer disease.
She also said the state’s claims commissioner was incorrect to have allowed the case to proceed against the state. The state has sovereign immunity from medical malpractice lawsuits unless the claims commissioner authorizes the lawsuit.

Ken Krayeske, the attorney representing Sally Walsh, argued on Monday that peptic ulcer disease could be treated by general practice doctors in a correctional setting, and said the physician who wrote the letter did the same job that the four doctors implicated in the lawsuit had done. 
Beyond specific medical malpractice claims, the lawsuit also alleged “institutional malpractice” against the Department of Correction as a whole, claiming that the department, which at the time was working in a partnership with UConn Health, suffered from budget shortfalls, inadequate staffing, delays in care and a lack of oversight.
The Department of Correction terminated its partnership with UConn Health in 2018. 
Walsh told the Connecticut Mirror on Monday that the Department of Correction needed to admit wrongdoing in her brother’s case. She said it felt as though she was fighting a battle. 
“ These people here and the DOC, they need to all admit they screwed up,” she said. “My brother suffered. He suffered.”  
DOC Spokesperson Andrius Banevicius said in a statement that the department does not comment on ongoing litigation.
Krayeske said during the hearing that he was appalled that the state of Connecticut had not offered an apology for its role in Alterisi’s death. “I want a government that takes responsibility when it kills people,” he said.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Calls to retain South Dakota’s current math standards continued at the state Board of Education Standards meeting Monday, as opponents flagged a proposed rewrite of the standards as overly simplistic.
The state Department of Education received 44 comments on the new standards as of Friday, most of which were critical of some or all of the rewritten standards. Department officials presented the board with a revised proposal during the Monday meeting at the Sioux Falls Ramkota hotel, addressing some concerns in the submitted feedback.
The proposed standards were reviewed by a 20-person revision committee earlier this year after being developed by a statewide advisory group. South Dakota Secretary of Education Joe Graves said the proposal leaves core concepts largely unchanged but describes them more clearly and concisely.
Graves told board members that the current standards are “incomprehensible” to some — especially parents and elementary school teachers. It’s important for parents and primary educators to understand the standards so they can help support students and build a foundation in mathematics, he added.

All of the opponents who spoke against the standards on Monday were higher level math educators with specializations in the field.
Sharon Vestal, a math professor at South Dakota State University and president of the South Dakota Council of Teachers of Mathematics, said she was concerned the simplification removes clear language from the current standards, which could lead to new educators not teaching material students should know because it’s not explicitly laid out.
Stephanie Higdon is with the Center for the Advancement of Math and Science Education at Black Hills State University. She worked with the state Department of Education when it surveyed school districts with higher math test scores prior to Graves’ appointment as department secretary. Those “bright spot schools,” she said, taught more closely to the current math standards.
“The current math standards are not broken when teachers believe in their students, believe that they can meet these standards and receive the support to do so,” Higdon said.
Gail Jacobsma, a math teacher at Arlington, said the current standards aren’t perfect, but “are quite good.”
SD Education Department encounters criticism of proposed math standards

“For schools like mine, which have enviable math scores, they are vital,” Jacobsma said. “They provide a detailed, coherent map for us to follow and help ensure that the instructional materials we purchase are well aligned.”
The proposal pulls from other states’ standards across the nation, and from the Archimedes standards, which the conservative-leaning National Association of Scholars says are “depoliticized”: “No ideologies permeate the problems and tasks, no ethnomathematics guides the pedagogies, and no tangential applications have been inserted that politicize math.” The Archimedes standards were written by an assistant professor at Hillsdale College in Michigan, which was also involved in South Dakota’s revised social studies standards, accepted in 2023 after a lengthy and controversial process and implemented this school year.
Graves added that South Dakota students “lack significant progress” on math testing since the COVID-19 pandemic, which he attributed to the current standards. About 44% of students were proficient or above on the state test annually over the last five years, he said. 
Department officials presented South Dakota’s latest report card to the board at the Monday meeting, showing that math proficiency remained at 44%. English and reading increased by one percentage point to 52% proficiency.
Health standards also discussed; next meeting is in February
The board is also considering an update to South Dakota’s health education standards.
Two South Dakota advocacy groups requested board members amend the standards: the South Dakota Chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association wants to include caregiver education for students as Alzheimer’s diagnoses increase in the state, and Call to Freedom wants to include abuse and human trafficking education for students.
Graves cautioned board members against adding more topics to the standards and encouraged organizations to work with local school districts to arrange instruction.
Some board members disagreed with Graves, suggesting the state should recommend additional health-related topics for schools.
The board will meet again on Feb. 23 in Pierre to take more public comment on the proposed math and health standards.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Though the U.S. Senate has taken steps toward resolving what has become the longest federal government shutdown in history, some current and former Democratic leaders in Maine are calling on members of their party to hold the line. 
Since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, Maine’s congressional delegation has been divided in its approach to the short term spending deal, with U.S. Reps. Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden splitting over the initial bill in the U.S. House of Representatives. In the Senate, independent U.S. Sen. Angus King has consistently voted with U.S. Sen. Susan Collins and other Republicans for the stopgap plan, which did not include an extension of health care subsidies that Democrats have been pushing for.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said late Sunday that he would hold a separate vote on the credits no later than the second week of December. But such a deal would also require a vote in the U.S. House, and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has made no such commitment.
On Monday, Pingree, who represents the 1st Congressional District, said she will keep fighting to secure “a real solution” before the U.S. House takes up the Senate proposal in a vote slated for later this week.
“A ‘deal’ that lets enhanced Affordable Care Act credits expire, which will drive premiums higher for families already stretched thin, fails the millions of families counting on us to keep their health care affordable,” she said. “That is not a compromise. It is capitulation.”
After the vote Sunday, Gov. Janet Mills wrote on social media that tens of thousands of Mainers are facing rising health care costs because of President Donald Trump and Collins, who helped lead negotiations as head of the Senate Appropriations Committee and who Mills is challenging in the November 2026 election after she terms out as governor.
“Maine people deserve affordable health care — not just the promise of a vote that won’t go anywhere,” she wrote on X. “Fight back.” 
Collins, on the Senate floor, encouraged her colleagues to back the legislation and end “the unnecessary harm to the security of our families and our nation.” She said, “We must not delay any longer.”
Another Democratic Senate candidate, Graham Platner, similarly said that increasing health care premiums can “destroy families” in eastern Maine. 
Putting blame squarely on the U.S. Senate minority leader, Platner said, “This happened because Chuck Schumer failed in his job yet again because they do not understand that when we fight, we win. When we hold the line for working families, for working people, we win.”
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who is vying to fill Mills’ open seat in the Blaine House, called it a “terrible deal.” 
“If they can’t stand up now when the Constitution is in tatters, seniors and kids are hungry and industries are on the brink of disaster, when will they? Where’s the fight?” she wrote in a social media post. 
Former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson, who is also in the running for governor, said the Democratic and independent senators who voted with Republicans Sunday are “making a huge gamble.”
“But they aren’t gambling with their own health, they are gambling with yours,” Jackson said. “Mainers and Americans deserve better.”
Late Sunday, King joined the handful of Senate Democrats who voted with Republicans to advance the spending bill in a press conference during which he cast doubt on the effectiveness of the shutdown to win support for the tax credits. 
Rather, he said the almost seven weeks of “fruitless attempts” had only caused harm for federal workers and recipients of federal food assistance. 
King said he believes the vote Sunday night moved them closer to a vote on the ACA tax credits, citing Thune’s promise to bring a Democratic health care bill to the floor.
But Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives Ryan Fecteau doubted the reliability of congressional Republicans promising to hold the December vote. 
“I’ll stand corrected if this somehow pans out, but I think Senator King’s deal is as thin as November ice on a Maine lake — it’s gonna fall through,” he wrote on Facebook.
State Auditor Matt Dunlap, who is the only Democrat currently in the running to replace Golden, who announced last week that he won’t seek reelection next year, said “we can do better.” 
“This deal gets us nothing,” Dunlap said, noting that the point of the Democrats’ stand was to preserve the tax credits. “A vague promise of a vote in December on the Affordable Care Act is laughable from a Republican majority that has made repeal of the ACA one of their highest priorities as they protect their rich friends in the insurance industry.”
Golden was the only House Democrat to back the initial proposal in the House. On Monday, a spokesman for the congressman said he looks forward to continuing bipartisan conversations in the coming days about how to build support for extending the tax credits and preventing massive price increases.

(Photo by Peter Hall/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday took up a Republican-backed challenge to counting mail-in ballots received after Election Day.
Depending how the justices rule, the case could be consequential for states that vote by mail.
It stems from a lawsuit against a Mississippi state law allowing mail-in ballots received within five business days after Election Day to still be counted. Roughly 30 states have similar laws, with varying grace periods.
The decision could also have ramifications for next year’s high-stakes midterms, which will decide whether Republicans maintain control of both the U.S. House and Senate. The court will likely hear arguments and rule by mid-2026.
A federal judge in Mississippi upheld the state’s law, ruling the state’s statute isn’t preempted by federal law, which says Election Day is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November.
But a federal appeals panel sided with the law’s challengers, the Republican National Committee and the state’s Republican and Libertarian parties. The appeals judges cited the U.S. Constitution’s clause that gives states the power to regulate elections, but also noted that clause says “Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.”
President Donald Trump, in his first term, appointed the three judges who issued that decision.
The legal question now is whether “election day” is when voters cast their ballots, or also when they must be received. The appeals court decided that ballots aren’t cast until election officials get them.
While the ruling doesn’t apply in Washington, if the Supreme Court upheld it, the ballot-counting system here would also be thrown into question.
Mississippi officials appealed to the Supreme Court to protect their five-day grace period. The state’s attorney general, a Republican, wrote in a brief to the high court that the appeals decision “would require scrapping election laws in most States.”
“The stakes are high: ballots cast by — but received after — election day can swing close races and change the course of the country,” Attorney General Lynn Fitch wrote.
The law’s opponents say these measures “deprive the electorate of a clear nationwide deadline that ‘puts all voters on the same footing.’”
In the 2024 general election, Washington election officials received nearly 120,000 valid ballots after Election Day that were postmarked on time.
Attorneys general  from other states filed a friend-of-the-court brief urging the Supreme Court to side with Mississippi. They note the appeals court decision “jeopardizes the ability of military service members and their families stationed abroad to have their timely cast ballots counted.”
President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked mail-in voting.
In a March executive order, for example, he urged U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to stop states from counting absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day in federal elections.
The Supreme Court is already grappling with other litigation focused on mail-in ballots.
Last month, they heard arguments in the case of an Illinois congressman who sued over a law in his state counting ballots received up to 14 days after Election Day. That case deals with the more procedural issue of the standard plaintiffs must meet to be allowed to sue over an election law.

Both people have sought asylum in the United States, claiming they are fleeing persecution in their home country.
In recent months, hundreds of people alleged to have entered the country illegally have been jailed by Homeland Security. Immigration judges, citing a new Trump administration interpretation of a longstanding federal law, have then denied those detainees hearings at which they could have argued for their release on bond while their deportation case was pending.

That has resulted in dozens of detainees suing the federal government, as well as the county jails where they’re held, in U.S. District Court, arguing their due process rights are being violated.
In the vast majority of those cases, district court judges have sided with the detainees, ordering immigration judges to schedule bond hearings for the detainees.
Two such cases were recently decided by U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Locher of the Southern District of Iowa.
Iowa woman cites Mexican drug cartels
One of the two cases involves Maria Enriquez Reyes, who entered the United States from Mexico near Sasabe, Arizona, on Sept. 23, 2023, with her son, now 10 years old, and her husband. At the time, the family claimed they were fleeing persecution. They were detained briefly by the U.S. Border Patrol before being released on their own recognizance.
Reyes and her family subsequently filed formal applications for asylum to escape what they called persecution by Mexican drug cartels that are now recognized as terrorists by the U.S. government.
On Sept. 2, 2025, with that application still pending, the Reyes family went to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Cedar Rapids for a prescheduled “check in” appointment. According to court records, ICE agents accosted Reyes at the office and then sent her to the Muscatine County Jail to be detained at least until a hearing that is scheduled for Dec. 19, 2025.
An immigration judge then denied her request for a bond hearing, citing the Trump administration’s new interpretation of laws related to the detention of individuals for possible deportation.
Reyes took the matter to U.S. District Court, suing Muscatine County Jail Administrator Matt McCleary, as well as DHS, ICE, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and DHS Director Kristi Noem.
On Nov. 3, 2025, Locher ruled in favor of Reyes, noting that the overwhelming majority of courts around the nation have rejected the Trump administration’s interpretation of the law as somehow requiring mandatory detention without the opportunity to argue for bond.
Locher noted that Reyes has lived in the United States with her family for two years and has no record of any criminal activity or dangerous conduct.
In ordering the immigration court to provide Reyes with a hearing on her request for pretrial release on bond, Locher noted he “would not be ordering any particular outcome on bond or detention. Rather, (Reyes) simply would be entitled to her statutory and due process right to a hearing.
“This means the immigration judge will have the authority — as immigration judges have for years — to evaluate (Reyes’) history and circumstances and make an individualized decision. If public safety or some other appropriate factor warrants detention, she will remain in custody. If not, she will be released on bond. Either way, there is no meaningful harm to the government from having to follow principles of due process.”
Des Moines man ‘fleeing persecution’ in Colombia 
In a separate case, Locher sided with Saider Santiago Helbrum, 26, who came to the United States in May 2024, alleging he was fleeing persecution in Colombia. After entering the country, he was detained briefly by U.S. Border Patrol and then released on his own recognizance, eventually settling in Des Moines.










It has been difficult to stay healthy or hopeful without seeking my family or feeling fresh air. I miss my wife very much.


– Saider Santiago Helbrum


In January 2025, he filed an application for asylum. In July 2025, with that application still pending, he was arrested and jailed on a simple-misdemeanor charge of fifth degree theft after being accused of stealing groceries at a WalMart store. Santiago Helbrum argued his store receipt, as well as bank records tied to the card he claimed was used to pay for the groceries, show the items were paid for.
Within three weeks, the theft charge was dropped, with the Polk County Attorney’s Office stating that “after examining the records, talking to the witnesses, and taking all other factors into consideration,” it was declining to prosecute the case in the interest of justice.
In the meantime, however, Homeland Security had taken custody of Santiago Helbrum and, after the theft charge was dropped, DHS continued to have him held at the Polk County Jail under a detention order. An immigration judge then denied Santiago Helbrum’s request for a bond hearing.
After Santiago Helbrum took DHS and Polk County Jail Administrator Cory Williams to federal court, he explained to a judge the effect that three months of detention had on him.
“My time in jail has been physically and mentally exhausting,” he wrote in an affidavit filed with the court.  “When I first arrived, I felt ill and experienced nosebleeds and a burst blood vessel in my eye. It has been difficult to stay healthy or hopeful without seeking my family or feeling fresh air. I miss my wife very much. It pains me and worries me that I have not been able to support or care for her and our family for the past few months.”
In court filings, lawyers for the DOJ cited a provision of the Laken Riley Act that calls for detention in cases where a person “is charged” with a crime. The DOJ argued that an arrest on a theft charge triggers the requirement for mandatory detention — and that the subsequent dismissal of the charge had no effect on that requirement.
Locher disagreed and ordered the immigration court to provide Santiago Helbrum with a bond hearing, stating in his ruling that “after charges are dismissed it is no longer accurate to say that a person ‘is charged’ with theft.”
Prior to the judge’s ruling in the case, Williams, the Polk County jail administrator, had filed papers with the court indicating his office took no position in the matter.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)State lawmakers convened Monday for a second special legislative session in Santa Fe to approve up to $162 million in state funds aimed at providing food benefits for New Mexicans through mid-January. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the session Thursday amid a federal government shutdown and ongoing legal wrangling between President Donald Trump’s administration and federal judges who ordered him to pay full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Benefits to roughly 42 million Americans, including about 460,000 New Mexicans, for November. 
The chaos continued over the weekend, with the United States Agriculture Department ordering states to award only 65% of the federal benefits for November. If states had already paid out the full amount, the USDA ordered states to “immediately undo” that action.
Then on Sunday evening, seven United States Senate Democrats voted along with Republicans to set in motion the government reopening. 
Even with a potential end in sight, New Mexico Democrats in the legislative majority said Monday they need to fully fund the program on which more than one in five New Mexicans rely. House Democratic leaders stressed in a news conference ahead of the session that if the full federal funding comes in, the legislation allows them to immediately stop spending state funds. 
The bill contains roughly $192 million in appropriations. That includes up to $162 million intended to pay for SNAP benefits until at least Jan. 20, which is when the Legislature meets again for the regular 30-day session. 
The legislation provides for weekly SNAP payments of approximately $20 million a week to pay for SNAP benefits until then. Recipients will get a payment once a week on their Electronic Benefit Transfer cards, according to House Democratic leaders said in a news conference. 
In addition to the $162 million for SNAP, the legislation appropriates $30 million to the state disaster fund, money that the governor already spent to pay for 10 days’ worth of SNAP benefits between Nov. 1 and Nov. 10. 
Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe), addressing colleagues in the Senate chamber, defended the Legislature spending up to $162 million for SNAP even with signs of a breakthrough in Congress. 
“While that certainly is a positive thing, we are here to act and that be sure and to be sure that New Mexicans have access to food,” Wirth said, adding that both chambers and Trump still need to approve a deal to reopen the government. 
Leaders predicted a one-day special session, which will cost taxpayers $75,000, with both chambers voting quickly to approve the legislation. 
As of 1:38 p.m. on Monday, one chamber had already approved the bill. The House voted 52-9 in favor, following minimal debate. The bill the House voted to advance was amended to include a new $50,000 appropriation to study the state’s administration of SNAP. 
Meanwhile, members of the Senate Finance Committee continued debating the bill Monday afternoon. Assuming they pass it, it will head toward the Senate Floor.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3009-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-10 16:05:53.813500

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday took up a Republican-backed challenge to counting mail-in ballots received after Election Day.
Depending how the justices rule, the case could be consequential for Washington and other states that vote by mail.
It stems from a lawsuit against a Mississippi state law allowing mail-in ballots received within five business days after Election Day to still be counted. Roughly 30 states have similar laws, with varying grace periods. 
The decision could also have ramifications for next year’s high-stakes midterms, which will decide whether Republicans maintain control of both the U.S. House and Senate. The court will likely hear arguments and rule by mid-2026.
Washington is one of a handful of states that conduct elections by mail and ballot drop boxes. The state accepts mail-in ballots up until the day before certification, which is 21 days after the election, as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. 
Ballots for this month’s elections in Washington are still being counted, and the results of some close races have flipped and narrowed during the past week.
A federal judge in Mississippi upheld the state’s law, ruling the state’s statute isn’t preempted by federal law, which says Election Day is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. 
But a federal appeals panel sided with the law’s challengers, the Republican National Committee and the state’s Republican and Libertarian parties. The appeals judges cited the U.S. Constitution’s clause that gives states the power to regulate elections, but also noted that clause says “Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.” 
President Donald Trump, in his first term, appointed the three judges who issued that decision.
The legal question now is whether “election day” is when voters cast their ballots, or also when they must be received. The appeals court decided that ballots aren’t cast until election officials get them.
While the ruling doesn’t apply in Washington, if the Supreme Court upheld it, the ballot-counting system here would also be thrown into question.
Mississippi officials appealed to the Supreme Court to protect their five-day grace period. The state’s attorney general, a Republican, wrote in a brief to the high court that the appeals decision “would require scrapping election laws in most States.”
“The stakes are high: ballots cast by — but received after — election day can swing close races and change the course of the country,” Attorney General Lynn Fitch wrote.
The law’s opponents say these measures “deprive the electorate of a clear nationwide deadline that ‘puts all voters on the same footing.’”
In the 2024 general election, Washington election officials received nearly 120,000 valid ballots after Election Day that were postmarked on time. 
Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, along with colleagues in other states, filed a friend-of-the-court brief urging the Supreme Court to side with Mississippi. They note the appeals court decision “jeopardizes the ability of military service members and their families stationed abroad to have their timely cast ballots counted.”
Brown and Secretary of State Steve Hobbs, both Democrats, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked mail-in voting. 
In a March executive order, for example, he urged U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to stop states from counting absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day in federal elections. 

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Brown and Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield sued the Trump administration over the order. That case is pending in federal court in Seattle.
Washington state’s Republican Party also wants to see a return to in-person voting, with same-day vote counts.
The Supreme Court is already grappling with other litigation focused on mail-in ballots. 
Last month, they heard arguments in the case of an Illinois congressman who sued over a law in his state counting ballots received up to 14 days after Election Day. That case deals with the more procedural issue of the standard plaintiffs must meet to be allowed to sue over an election law.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/us-supreme-court-5.jpeg,,,2025-11-10 16:05:53.813500

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Scientists from universities across Iowa urge a shift to more renewable energy sources and updated building standards to cope with insurance premiums that are mounting due to a changing climate.
Nearly 180 researchers and educators signed the 2025 Iowa Climate Statement, released Monday, which points to rising temperatures and “destructive” weather events as key drivers of rising insurance premiums.
Global temperatures in the past decade have been the hottest 10 years of the past 175 years, according to research cited in the statement. These rising temperatures, combined with the expectation that patterns of drought and flooding will persist, will continue to cause growing insurance costs, according to the statement.

Peter Thorne, University of Iowa distinguished chair in the Occupational and Environmental Health department, said insurance providers are using “advanced climate models” to “align their rates and anticipated losses.” 
Thorne said states like Florida, Texas and California that have seen increased instances of hurricanes, flooding and wildfires have caused drastic increases in premiums. According to a study from the National Bureau of Economic Research, some regions of these states had average annual premiums in 2023 of more than $4,000. 
The climate statement said while Iowa’s rates have been driven up due to building, labor and reinsurance costs, climate change has “amplified” these costs. 
Last year, Iowa was rated as one of 15 states with a “mounting insurance crisis.” Events like the 2020 derecho that hit Iowa and parts of the Midwest combined with persistent tornadoes and smaller-scale derechos have all contributed to the increase in premiums. According to a 2024 report, home insurance premiums in Iowa increased 14% from 2023 to 2024.
Insurify predicted home insurance rates would increase 19% in Iowa in 2025.
The Iowa Climate Statement says “we must work quickly to reduce our reliance on coal and oil” and instead shift to more wind and solar energy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and “minimize future climate related property damage.” 
Researchers on a call with members of the media Monday morning said in addition, Iowa lawmakers can strengthen building standards to ensure buildings are built “not just quick and cheap” but with materials that will better stand up to fire, hail and flood damage. 
David Courard-Hauri, a professor of environmental science and sustainability at Drake University, said hailstorms in Iowa have contributed to higher insurance premiums and lower insurer coverage on hail-related claims, which means consumers have to pay more out of pocket on those claims.
“If we can reduce those damages by building for the current world, we can certainly save a lot of money,” Courard-Hauri said. 
The scientists said homeowners can also make some upgrades to their homes, like installing more durable shingles or better insulation, that can lower insurance premiums and prevent serious damage.
Crop insurance 
The changing weather patterns are also hurting farmers, who sometimes have to replant crops in the spring due to flooding, only to lose some of the crops in the summer due to drought. 
Thorne said farmers are “especially vulnerable” to exacerbated climate disasters. The cost of crop damage due to climate disasters, he said, is also passed along to taxpayers because crop insurance is subsidized by the federal government. 
According to USDA data cited in the statement, crop insurance premiums were $15.8 billion in 2024 and $9.8 billion of that was subsidized. 
“Farmers and taxpayers will be required to pay the increased costs of more extreme weather events in the future,” the statement said. 
Thorne said farmers are saddled with additional premiums to protect things like equipment and grain storage, which can also be impacted by climate disasters. 
“This all points to the need to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions that are driving global warming and increasing insurance premiums,” Thorne said.

The late Burlington author Bill Mares had yet to be diagnosed with cancer when, two autumns ago, the 83-year-old received a call from Jeff Danziger, a Dummerston friend and nationally syndicated political cartoonist.
“I remember Bill sitting here by the fire,” Chris Hadsel, Mares’s wife of 53 years, recently recalled, “and, next thing we knew, Danziger was suggesting a book about what Vermont’s going to be like in the future.”
No one foresaw how the resulting essay collection — “2050: Vermonters Take a Swipe at the Future,” set for release this weekend — would arrive with a bittersweet backstory.
In his lifetime, Mares — a beekeeper, brewer, history teacher, journalist, legislator, marathon runner and traveler to more than to 60 countries — could boast to publishing 20 books on everything from a 1,200-mile camel trek across Saudi Arabia to “Real Vermonters Don’t Milk Goats,” a 1983 humor collaboration with University of Vermont professor Frank Bryan that sold 70,000 copies (or one for every 10 residents).
Danziger saw his book suggestion as a follow-up to his 2017 teaming with Mares on “The Full Vermonty: Vermont in the Age of Trump,” which featured 20 collaborators ranging from former Gov. Madeleine Kunin and Vermont Life magazine editor Tom Slayton to Weybridge writer Julia Alvarez and the late Brookfield artist Ed Koren.
But Mares, who had endured open heart surgery just before Donald Trump was first elected president, was reluctant to step back into the pain of politics.
“Bill felt he’d been there and done that,” Hadsel said. “He did not want this book to be consumed by the vicissitudes we thought were coming, the ups and downs, the crisis of just yesterday that now nobody can even remember because there’s a whole new one.”

Instead, Mares wanted to springboard forward a quarter century by inviting friends to share their thoughts about Vermont in the year 2050.
“This is not a book that solves Vermont’s problems,” Hadsel said. “A couple of the essays are fanciful or fun, some are worried, but none of them are gloom and doom. There’s a common theme of hopefulness and faith that Vermonters will stick together and figure out how to work around the change that’s coming.”
In the book, Vermont Gas Systems CEO Neale Lunderville, a gubernatorial appointee under Republican Jim Douglas and Democrat Peter Shumlin, proposes the idea of a state “reboot” through better housing, schools, business opportunities and infrastructure.
“Vermont’s future is in the strength of its communities,” Lunderville writes. “Real prosperity comes when every town, and every person in every town, has the opportunity to grow and thrive.”
Jen Kimmich, co-founder of Stowe’s Alchemist Brewery, expresses hope that all future residents will be embraced, regardless of whether they were born in the state like herself.
“In 2050,” Kimmich writes, “every Vermonter, those of us with families that have been here for generations and those of us just arriving, should be celebrated for our experiences, appreciated for our contributions, and welcomed for being here.”
Mark Breen, senior meteorologist at St. Johnsbury’s Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium, calls for a disclaimer on any long-term forecasts.
“Considering how changeable Vermont weather has always been,” Breen writes, “it should be no surprise that we might see almost any kind of weather, in any season of the year.”
Mares faced his own storm clouds in the spring of 2024 when he was diagnosed with terminal lymphoma. Stuffing his friends’ essays into a shoebox, he focused on finishing a memoir — “Better to Be Lucky than Smart!” — that he published five days before he died July 29, 2024, through use of the state’s medical aid-in-dying law.
“I feel in better shape than most and more grateful than all that I had the chance to drive the bus of my own disappearance,” Mares told VTDigger podcaster David Goodman a week before his death.
Hadsel, inheriting three-dozen forward-looking essays, was left without a book title, introduction or illustrations — just her husband’s wish that she and neighbor Jane Smith, a former Vermont journalist, finish the work. 
They reached out to Rootstock Publishing of Montpelier and frequent Mares collaborator Don Hooper of Brookfield, the latter who had toted his sketchbook to Chicago as a Vermont delegate to the 2024 Democratic National Convention.
“Don sent me a doodle of an old codger who looks like Bill waving a pen that’s spearing a piece of paper,” Hadsel recalled. “I looked at the picture and said, ‘Aha!’”
That scrawl is the book’s cover illustration and inspiration for its “Take a Swipe at the Future” subtitle.
Hadsel is set to debut the 140-page paperback Saturday at the St. Johnsbury Athenaeum before joining essayists for readings Sunday at Stowe’s Alchemist Brewery, Nov. 18 at the Charlotte Public Library, Nov. 20 at Montpelier’s Kellogg-Hubbard Library and Nov. 25 at Burlington’s Phoenix Books.
Former Gov. Howard Dean, quoted on the back cover, hopes the collection “will inspire people to take action.”

Free.,"Here's the list of newly pardoned Trump fake electors, other allies",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/heres-list-newly-pardoned-trump-fake-electors-other-allies,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced on Monday he pardoned his former lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other people allegedly involved in the attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election, but the president's federal pardon does not shield members of the group from state charges.Posting to social media early Monday, U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin released the names of 77 people for whom Trump signed federal pardons in a proclamation dated Nov. 7. Martin is an attorney who represented several people charged in the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection on the U.S. Capitol. After losing the 2020 presidential election, Trump goaded his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol and stop Congress from certifying the election results. He was later impeached by the House for a second time, in connection with the insurrection, but the Senate acquitted him.It’s the latest move from the president, following his return to the White House, to absolve anyone involved in the efforts to overturn or challenge former President Joe Biden’s victory. The proclamation notes that pardons were granted to address “a grave national injustice.”Those on the list include former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Sidney Powell, a lawyer who was indicted along with Trump in a Georgia election case to overturn the state's results in the 2020 presidential election. The proclamation, which is only for federal charges, is symbolic and does not prevent state-level prosecutions. Many of the people named on the list were alleged to have been part of the fake electors' plot to submit fraudulent certificates claiming that Trump won the battleground states of  Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, instead of Biden.The White House did not respond to States Newsroom's request for comment. ‘Pardoning a conspiracy’A coalition of more than 100 pro-democracy groups, Not Above the Law, condemned the move by the president to pardon people involved in trying to subvert the 2020 presidential election.“Trump isn't just pardoning people – he's pardoning a conspiracy and trying to rewrite history,” according to the coalition. “He's creating a two-tier justice system where he and his allies operate above the law.

As New Mexicans, we know what it means to take care of each other. When our neighbors are struggling, we help them. That’s why our state leaders stepped in to make sure families could still get food during the appalling and unprecedented suspension of SNAP food benefits. And that’s why the Trump administration’s choice to block SNAP during a government shutdown, despite having the emergency funds, struck such a deep nerve—it’s not just cruel, it’s unnecessary.
When the shutdown ends, many federal workers and families will finally get some relief. But that relief won’t last long. The truth is: even after the government reopens, the cuts to food and healthcare programs will keep coming, and they are about to get worse.
Buried in the details of H.R. 1 — the federal budget bill pushed by House Republicans — are huge cuts to SNAP, Medicaid, and marketplace health insurance. These cuts will hurt hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans, ripping away support that keeps our families stable and healthy. These are not temporary disruptions caused by a funding gap — these are long-term structural changes designed to take away food and healthcare from our families.
New Mexico’s federal lawmakers aren’t staying quiet. Senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján, along with Representatives Melanie Stansbury, Teresa Leger Fernández, and Gabe Vasquez are fighting to protect food assistance and healthcare, and rural clinics that are lifelines in our communities.
In New Mexico, we’ve seen what works. When families have access to healthy food, healthcare, and stable housing, our whole state is stronger. We’ve made progress in recent years: expanding child hunger programs, improving access to affordable healthcare, and creating state initiatives that keep working parents on their feet. That progress is now under direct threat from Washington DC.
As our lawmakers prepare for the upcoming 30 day legislative session, protecting that progress must come first. Lawmakers must continue the important work that began in October’s special session: building state-level solutions to shield New Mexico families from the harshest effects of H.R. 1’s cuts. That means investing in our state food assistance programs, protecting healthcare coverage, making sure rural hospitals and clinics are funded, and ensuring no child in New Mexico goes hungry.
We don’t have to accept a future where federal politics decide who in our communities eats, who gets medical care, or who is left behind. The values that define New Mexico — community, resilience, and compassion — are stronger than any budget cut.
The shutdown will end. But our responsibility to one another will not.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/snapposter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 16:05:53.813500

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)North Carolina’s Mark Meadows is among 77 people recently pardoned by President Donald Trump, five years after Meadows was involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election that Trump lost.
Meadows, a former congressman, served as Trump’s chief of staff in the aftermath of the 2020 election.
Ed Martin, the U.S. pardon attorney, posted the full list of people pardoned by Trump on social media Sunday night. It does not include Trump himself, but does name Meadows and another North Carolina native — attorney Sidney Powell, who led challenges to election results in key states as part of Trump’s legal team.
Trump’s pardon proclamation says it “ends a grave national injustice perpetrated upon the American people following the 2020 presidential election and continues the process of national reconciliation.”
Meadows and Powell are not accused of any federal crimes, rendering the pardons largely symbolic. They were both indicted as part of the Georgia investigation into the electoral scheme, which is still pending in state court. (Meadows asked to have his case moved to federal court; that request was rejected.)
Prior to his role in the White House, Meadows represented the western 11th district in the U.S. House, chairing the Freedom Caucus and growing to be one of the president’s closest allies during his first term. He has regularly made appearances on Fox News in recent months defending Trump and the administration.
Meadows and his wife were also investigated over allegations that they voted improperly in 2020, using the address of a mobile home in Macon County. They were not charged.
Powell in 2023 pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor counts of election interference, flipping her plea to testify against her co-defendants in the Georgia case.

Javitz Federal Building on July 1, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)A Utah lawmaker wants the state to join California in barring immigration agents and other federal law enforcement officers from covering their faces while they detain people. 
“It seems like good policy that if you’re a government agent, people should know you’re a government agent,” said Sen. Nate Blouin, D-Millcreek. 
Blouin said Friday the measure is needed to make it harder for imposters to pass as agents so they can rob or attack people, like in recent cases in North Carolina and Philadelpia. He believes it would also ensure officers who overstep the bounds of their authority or injure people are held accountable.
He said there would be exceptions for undercover officers and likely for certain times where they might wear masks for medical or tactical reasons. 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not reply to a request for comment Friday, but says on its website that its “officers wear masks to prevent doxing, which can (and has) placed them and their families at risk.”
The site says all ICE officers “carry badges and credentials and will identify themselves when required for public safety or legal necessity.”

Democrats in Congress and in statehouses in New York, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Michigan have proposed similar legislation. 
The ACLU is working with Blouin on the Utah measure. Ellie Menlove, the organization’s legislative and policy council, said the move could strengthen trust between law enforcement and communities.  
Blouin said he’s still in the early stages of crafting the bill and under no illusion it will succeed or even get a public hearing when the Utah Legislature, which has a Republican supermajority, convenes in January.   
“If anything, it’s about sending a signal that we expect better out of federal law enforcement here in Utah,” Blouin said. 
Also at issue is the question of whether the state can enforce a mandate on federal law enforcement agencies. 
Blouin noted his Republican colleagues have asserted states’ rights in the past, pushing back against what they see as federal overreach. In 2024, the Legislature passed a law setting up a process to reject directives from the federal government they see as unconstitutional. 
Sen. Todd Weiler, a Republican who chairs a legislative panel on law enforcement and criminal justice, said he has concerns about harassment and threats to ICE agents whose identity is revealed. Weiler, of Woods Cross, said he believes the measure would not hold up in court. 
“It’s not the role of the state to tell federal agents or federal agencies how to do their jobs,” Weiler said. “That’s just not our role.”
He went on to say, “I think in a perfect world they shouldn’t be wearing masks. But we don’t live in a perfect world.”
Utah immigration attorney Christopher Vizcardo said he hasn’t seen any masked ICE officers when he’s dealt with the agency, and he usually knows who the officers are because Utah has a small number of agents.  
“I think more transparency is not a bad thing,” Vizcardo said of Blouin’s bill. However, he added,  “it’s hard to enforce that against federal officers. Our system doesn’t really allow for that.”

National Domestic Violence Hotline: People who have experienced domestic abuse can get confidential help at thehotline.org or by calling 800-799-7233. 
The immigrant from India believed her husband when he said that if she wasn’t gone by the time he got to their Georgia home in 10 minutes, he would kill her. 
She said her husband and his family, who are also immigrants, abused her throughout their marriage, beating her with a belt, pouring hot water on her, cutting her, and pushing her head through a wall. 
“Several times I tried to escape, but they found me and brought me back home,” said the woman, who is in the country illegally and spoke on the condition of anonymity because she is afraid being identified would harm her chances of gaining legal status.
With no time to run after her husband’s call in July 2020, she dialed 911, even though she knew she could be deported. The police arrived to find the husband threatening her with a knife in front of their young children, she recalled. He was arrested but not prosecuted, she said.
The woman and her children sought services from the Tahirih Justice Center, a national nonprofit organization that serves immigrant survivors of gender-based violence. She is still winding through the immigration process five years later.
Besides immigrants’ increased vulnerability to sexual violence, they face a host of mental health and physical challenges, researchers say. They have high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicide, and anxiety, according to a 2024 study.
“Personally, I know anxiety related to the current political climate is precipitating expensive emergency room visits and negatively impacting people’s ability to get to work and make a living,” said Nicole E. Warren, a nurse midwife and an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing in Baltimore.
Immigrants without legal status also face increased rates of chronic conditions and higher death rates from preventable diseases due to their limited access to health care and their fear of seeking it, advocates say.
“One of our clients was so afraid to leave her home that she avoided seeking medical care during her pregnancy, out of fear of interacting with ICE,” said Miriam Camero, director of client advocacy, social services, at Tahirih. 
Food banks have reported that many immigrants in need of food assistance have stopped coming, for fear of deportation. 
It has always been difficult for people without legal immigration status to get help when they need it. The Trump administration’s crackdown on people in the country illegally has intensified the pressure. The situation has also hampered the advocates and attorneys who defend their rights. 
“We’re working extra hours to do all the work,” said Vanessa Wilkins, executive director of Tahirih’s office in Atlanta. “The safety planning and added protection that clients might need, including documents just to make sure they are safe, can definitely make you feel overwhelmed.” 
U Visas
For domestic abuse survivors without legal status, like the woman from India, going to the authorities seems more fraught amid the immigration crackdown, said Maricarmen Garza, chief counsel of the American Bar Association Commission on Domestic & Sexual Violence.
“There are just no guarantees,” Garza said, “especially with how law enforcement is intertwined in enforcing immigration law.” 
In more than half of states, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can collaborate by formal written agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies to identify and remove people in the country illegally. Advocates say this can interfere with victims’ efforts to get a certificate to file for a “U visa,” which would allow them to live and work in the U.S. with the possibility of lawful permanent residency.
The battered woman from India recalls police telling her that if she did not press charges, she could get a certificate for a U visa. She agreed to their suggestion but recalls the anxiety of filing about five abuse reports over two years to get the certificate. “I got panic attacks just writing them down, because it meant I was reliving the situations again,” she said.
When asked for comment about the difficulties immigrant domestic violence victims face, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson touted President Donald Trump’s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. “The president’s successful effort to deport criminal illegal aliens is making all victims safer and ensuring they will never again be harmed by dangerous criminal illegal aliens,” Jackson said in a statement. She said “allegations without evidence” that immigrants have been told to drop charges “should not be taken seriously.” 
Immigrant women without legal status can be particularly vulnerable to abuse and exploitation because of language barriers, as well as cultural and social isolation, researchers have found. 
According to a 2023 report, lifetime rates of abuse by intimate partners range up to 93% in some immigrant groups, compared with about 41% of U.S.-born women experiencing such abuse in their lifetime.
As the Trump administration reshapes the country’s immigration system, survivors of violence who entered the country illegally have a tough time proving their abuse and trauma to get relief, advocates say.
A refugee health and asylum program at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore provides immigrant victims of abuse with free forensic evaluations to support their claims for humanitarian relief, including applications for U visas.
Warren, the program’s associate director for women’s health, said that in the past, a written affidavit of the clinic’s findings was enough to corroborate an applicant’s legal accounts of past trauma.
“Now, we are getting requests for our in-person testimony,” Warren said.
Application Backlogs
The woman from India applied for a visa after she received a certificate from law enforcement allowing her to do so in 2023. Hers is one of nearly 11.6 million pending visa applications, according to data through June — the highest volume of cases ever recorded by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The number of pending U visa applications is 415,000, according to the agency.
Only about 10,000 U visas are issued per year, and it can take more than seven years to process applications, Garza said.
Adding to the pressure, the Trump administration has reduced the availability of Section 8 housing, which helps low-income individuals and others pay their rent. As of September, people without legal authorization to be in the United States are not eligible to receive rental help over U.S. citizens.
“If Tahirih wasn’t behind me, I could be homeless,” said the woman, who said she can afford only half her rent.
Victims’ advocates say they are working harder than ever to support their clients but are stretched thin as they face federal funding cuts and increased demand. 
The Tahirih center reported a 200% increase in call volume in the four months after Trump took office, compared with the same period last year.
“At the end of the day there are a lot of emails and a lot of people we aren’t able to reach as quickly as in the past,” said Casey Carter Swegman, the center’s director of public policy.
To reach immigrant survivors of abuse who are afraid to come forward, advocates are “getting back to basics,” said Joanna Otero-Cruz, executive director and president of the Philadelphia group Women Against Abuse. 
“We’re doing grassroots outreach to hairdressers and other small-business owners,” she said. “They’re the eyes and ears for us.”
In Riverhead, New York, a 38-year-old woman who emigrated from El Salvador said she has twice been the victim of domestic abuse but was too scared to report it to police. 
She said the second assault was by a man for whom she cooked and cleaned in his home. The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of her sense of shame and her fears of deportation, said he raped her, took pictures of her naked, and threatened to put them on social media if she tried to go to the police. He then stalked her, she said.
Noemi Sanchez, Long Island regional coordinator for the Rural & Migrant Ministry, a nonprofit that supports farm workers, is working closely with the woman to elevate her self-esteem and help her understand that “no woman deserves to have a man mistreat them.”
Meanwhile, the survivor from India received a temporary work permit in 2024 and is employed as a certified nursing assistant, which “helps me survive,” she said.
“I have really come a long way,” she added. “It wasn’t easy. I had great support behind me. They didn’t let me down.”

But consider this: car haulers full of Chinese-brand vehicles might someday roll across the Ambassador Bridge and the soon-to-open Gordie Howe Bridge in Detroit from Canada.
That isn’t likely to happen anytime soon. Former President Joseph Biden slapped a 100% tariff last year on Chinese electric vehicles that President Donald Trump has continued. Canada also has in place a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs.
But Canada is rumored to be considering removing that tariff as part of a broader effort to build trade relationships with China and other Asian countries in response to Trump’s foolish trade war against our formerly friendly northern neighbor.

Both Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney were in Asia at the same time recently seeking investments.
Relations between the two countries, already testy, further deteriorated after Ontario produced a U.S.-aimed television ad featuring former President Ronald Regan extolling the virtues of free trade.
The ad ran briefly during the World Series, in which many Americans were rooting for the Toronto Blue Jays to defeat the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Trump was so incensed by the ad that he called off trade negotiations with Canada and said he was slapping an additional 10% tariff on Canadian-made goods coming into the U.S. Trump attacked the ad as “fake” and said in another one of his down-is-up moments that Reagan “loved tariffs.”
Canada is heavily dependent on trade with the U.S. so it’s not surprising Carney is seeking new partners if America no longer wants to play ball.
But Michigan’s economy could be a big loser if Canada succeeds spurning the state for new trading relationships with Asian countries.
Canada is Michigan’s largest trading partner. The state exports more goods, worth in excess of $23 billion a year, to Canada than any other country.
A recent statewide poll conducted for the Detroit Regional Chamber found that nearly 60% of Michigan voters think putting tariffs on Canadian goods is bad for the state’s economy.
“They believe tariffs are increasing their costs, hurting the state’s auto industry, and that placing tariffs on Canada hurts Michigan,” said pollster Rich Czuba, who conducted the survey.
Already, goods-carrying truck traffic on the Ambassador Bridge, the busiest U.S.-Canada crossing, is down by more than a third so far this year from 2024. Truck traffic on the Bluewater Bridge at Port Huron is off by 6.7%.

Retailers and other businesses in the state’s border communities of Detroit, Port Huron and Sault Ste. Marie say they are seeing fewer Canadian customers, who appear to be boycotting U.S. shopping and entertainment venues.
Trump doesn’t seem to care. He has often said that the U.S. doesn’t “need anything” from Canada, including the 1.8 million cars and trucks Canada annually exports to the U.S. Many of those vehicles are built in plants owned by General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis.
The president wants those Detroit automakers to close their Canadian plants and move production to the U.S., part of his plan to cripple the Canadian economy and make it the 51st U.S. state. Canadian leaders bluntly say that will never happen.
Detroit automakers appear to be responding to political pressure by Trump.
GM and Stellantis recently slashed production of several models in Canada, prompting the Canadian government to limit the number of vehicles the two automakers can ship to our northern neighbor tariff free.
That move adds to worries by Detroit automakers that the USMCA free trade agreement, which Trump negotiated in his first term and has mightily benefitted Detroit, might not survive. The agreement comes up for review next year and prospects for extending it are unclear.
Maintaining the USMCA “can create an even stronger North American trading bloc, ready to compete with China at every turn,” said Glenn Stevens, executive director of MichAuto, which promotes Michigan’s auto industry.
But Canada, facing the potential loss of significant Detroit Three investment, is looking to partner with China to possibly replace it and the more than 100,000 direct auto jobs that investment supports.
Removing the 100% tariff could also allow China, which has massive production overcapacity at home, to export vehicles to Canada before establishing production there.
If Canada drops its tariff on Chinese cars, it could gain a significant advantage over the U.S. and Mexico in giving China an opening to the North American market. Mexico, long seen as the most logical entry point for Chinese cars, is planning to raise its tariffs on Chinese vehicles from 20% to 50%.
Experts and even many auto industry executives say that it’s just a matter of time before American consumers are able to buy Chinese vehicles, particularly EVs where China dominates. And a study released earlier this year by AutoPacific Inc. found that nearly 60% of car-buying Americans under 40 would seriously consider a Chinese vehicle.
Trump’s trade war might result in the unintended consequence of those vehicles entering our market through Canada—an existential threat to tariff-weary Detroit automakers.

“We’ve been doing whatever we can. There is nothing that we would spare to try to save the life of the miner,” Morrisey said during a news conference Monday.
A mining crew hit an unknown pocket of water Saturday about three-quarters of a mile into the mine near Drennen, Nicholas County Commissioner Garrett Cole said in a Facebook post.
All other miners involved were able to safely evacuate except for the one who is still unaccounted for, Cole said.
“May God’s will be done, but it is our sincere prayer that it is to keep this miner safe and returned to his family, friends and coworkers,” he posted.
MetroNews reported that the flood happened after the seal to an old mine works gave way, but it’s unclear if that is where the water was backed up, leading to the flood. 
Morrisey said there have been concerns with removing water at the same time as dive crews were searching in the mine, so the efforts on Monday were more focused on lowering the water levels.  
“This is a very serious situation dealing with not only the water, but what happens with the gas and the lack of oxygen in an area. And, we also want to make sure we’re protecting the safety of the … divers who are going down there,” he said. 
The governor said that he is working with a number of state and federal agencies as well as the National Cave Rescue Commission to access any available resource to help with the complicated rescue. Specially-trained rescuers are needed to perform the difficult search into the dark and flood mine.  
“I’ve personally been in touch with people around West Virginia and across the country in an effort to try to make sure, if there’s anything humanly we can do to save the miner’s life, we want to do it,” Morrisey said.
The United Mine Workers of America issued a statement about the situation in Nicholas County on Monday, saying, “The coal mining family has suffered two incidents in the last week in West Virginia: a fatality in Tucker County and now a missing miner in Nicholas County. I have ordered our safety experts to the Rolling Thunder mine in Nicholas County to provide professional assistance to the teams working to find the missing miner.”
“The hearts and prayers of the entire United Mine Workers of America family go out to these miners and their families. ” the statement continued.

Rep. Forrest Bennett, who represents most of downtown and central Oklahoma City, said in a Facebook post that he was elected Friday by the Oklahoma State AFL-CIO, a group of 230 labor unions representing over 100,000 workers. He was also sworn in Friday.
Bennett wrote on Facebook that he will be resigning in the “coming weeks.” He did not immediately return a message Monday requesting comment on why his resignation wouldn’t be effective immediately or when he planned to step down. 
“This new role requires me to directly lobby lawmakers, and I can’t ethically do both,” he wrote. “It’s been the honor of a lifetime to represent the good people of the 92nd district, and while my title will change, my commitment to my friends and neighbors never will.”
He said he will be working “full-time for Oklahoma’s unions” as president of the Oklahoma State AFL-CIO. 
“I’ll have more to say about all of this in the next few days, but for now, I’m going to celebrate this hard-fought win,” Bennett wrote. 
Gov. Kevin Stitt has 30 days from Bennett’s resignation to set a special election. A spokesperson did not immediately return messages asking about the date of the special election or if the Governor’s Office has received a letter of resignation.

(Photo by Monica Carrillo-Casas/The Spokesman-Review)SUNNYSIDE, Wash. – Evaristo Salas Jr. said there were days he wasn’t sure he would make it out of prison.
But one thing he did know was that, if he ever got the chance, he wanted to help the youths of Sunnyside, Washington.
Now, with a significant lead over his opponent, Laura Galvan, for a seat on the Sunnyside School Board, he says he’s ready to serve his community.
Galvan didn’t respond to requests for comment.
“I’m surprised and happy about it,” said Salas, who won 61.4% of the vote counted as of Friday. “I put in a lot of work.”
Salas is a consultant for the Grandview School District, where he mentors at-risk students, and a full-time student at Columbia Basin College majoring in social work with a minor in criminal justice. He was 16 when he was wrongfully convicted of shooting 24-year-old Jose Arreola twice in the head in November 1995. He spent 27 years in prison before being released two years ago.
With no compensation for his wrongful imprisonment, Salas continues to fight his conviction and has a lawsuit pending against multiple agencies in Sunnyside, including the Sunnyside Police Department and the city of Sunnyside.
Still, he said his focus now is on the community and on making sure people he will represent have someone they can depend on. He noted that, during the months he spent canvassing, many residents told him it was the first time a candidate had come by their home to talk about a campaign.
He recalled one resident who has been living in Sunnyside for 60 years and said they had never had a one-on-one conversation with any local leaders about their campaigns.
“Having that connection with the community is something that I think Sunnyside is really hungry for, because a lot of the houses I went to, they feel like they don’t have a voice,” Salas said.
Perla Clara, a Sunnyside resident, said she was excited to learn he was leading in the vote. Clara said she grew up with a childhood similar to Salas’ and lived in a high gang activity area.
Seeing him persevere has been inspiring for her, she said.
Clara and her husband, Chase Reiff, a local muralist, are working with Salas to restore community murals that have been covered with gang graffiti.
“I really respect what he’s doing,” Clara said.
Salas has a lead of 89 votes. Since there are only about 800 votes to count in all of Yakima County, that lead should be enough to win.
But Salas isn’t declaring victory, though he’s cautiously optimistic. He is using his free time to prepare for the school board and plans to start work on a mural project next week. He said his idea is to tell a story about history through Aztec and Mayan traditional art for one of the murals near Sunnyside High School.
They also plan to redo another mural near Kiwanis Youth Park, an area known for gang activity.
“I’ve always understood that no matter where you come from, whatever struggle you face in life, or even whatever setbacks you have, that if you’re determined, your intentions are in the right place and you really care about the community you come from, you can make a difference,” Salas said.
“That’s something that just got reinforced with this, and I think it’s something that I’m going to carry with me the rest of my life,” he said.

(Photo via Montana Commissioner of Insurance website)Technology may have been partly responsible for the data breach that may have exposed more than 460,000 Montanans financial and health information, and technology may be part of the answer to keeping compromised information safe, according to the Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance.
In response to a massive information breach by Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield, announced publicly last month, Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance James Brown has implemented an artificial intelligence tool to help residents navigate protecting their data.
Brown said its the first-of-its-kind solution implemented in response to a case like this.
Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield announced last month one of its vendors had a data breach that lasted for several months, and could have opened up financial information and medical records for anyone who uses it. Montana BCBS is the largest insurance carrier in the state.
Brown’s office said that with that many people affected, and with a range of concerns, the AI tool on the website can help pare down the options and assist residents. If Montanans still need help, they can contact the office. But, the AI tool can also help direct residents to staff members or service providers who can help with specific problems related to the breach.
A spokesperson for the office told the Daily Montanan the agency took steps to make sure that the AI assistant is designed not to become a technology breach of its own.
“The AI assistant is not connected to any sensitive database or systems that contain personal information. It’s designed strictly to provide guidance and resources, not to store or process private data,” spokesman Tyler Newcombe said. “All interaction are encrypted, monitored for security; and run with state-approved platforms that comply with privacy standards.”
In addition to updating the site with new information as it becomes available — the company informed the Commissioner’s office in October, months after the breach was discovered and closed in February — the AI tool allows customers to get helped at any time of the day, not just when the office is staffed.
Brown’s office said the AI-powered tool helps directly answer questions about the data breach, understanding rights, and steps to take to safeguard data. The office is asking that residents don’t share their personally identifying information.
“The assistant is there to walk people through the next steps — for example, how to freeze credit, monitor for identity theft or file an insurance claim — but it doesn’t require or request personal data,” Newcombe said. “If a case requires that level of detail, the AI will escalate the issue directly to a trained staff member.”
Staff members also said AI can help the small staff recognize unattended issues.
“AI allows us to triage questions, identify patterns and route complete cases to staff freeing our team to focus on those who need one-on-one assistance,” Newcombe said.
“This is about taking swift action and setting a standard,” Brown said. “When Montanans are affected, we move fast. Our mission is to protect them—and this new technology helps us do that in real time.”
In addition to the announcement about the breach, several residents have filed a class-action lawsuit over the breach as well.

On Monday morning, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order declining to take up a case seeking to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 case that granted same-sex couples the right to marry nationwide. 
The case, brought by former Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis, argued that Davis’s First Amendment rights to free exercise of religion had been infringed upon by requiring her to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. One of those couples, David Moore and David Ermold, took Davis to court and were eventually granted $50,000 each, a decision upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit in March. The Supreme Court declined both Davis’s petition to overturn that monetary award, as well as the broader question of same-sex marriage rights.  
In Michigan, Attorney General Dana Nessel expressed relief for the decision, but noted that it would likely not be the last legal threat to same-sex marriage rights or Obergefell. 
“I am relieved for today’s decision reaffirming same-sex couples’ continued right to dignity and protection under the law, but we cannot take those protections for granted,” she said in a press release. “Members of this Supreme Court have already told us they are willing to overturn Obergefell. It’s only a matter of time before they do.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Michigan’s constitution currently has an explicit ban on same-sex marriage, which is not in effect because of the Obergefell decision. If federal courts were to overturn that, the 2022 Respect for Marriage Act would ensure that previous marriages, as well as same-sex marriages in other states, would have to be recognized by the state — but same-sex marriage would become illegal in Michigan. 
Democrats in both the state House and Senate have introduced bills that would put forth ballot proposals to remove that language from the constitution, which if passed would make same-sex marriage legal even if federal courts overturned their decision from a decade ago. 
State Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield Township) introduced a resolution on Thursday to do just that, while state Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor) introduced his version in the House in March, just after the appellate court’s decision in Davis’s case. Both specifically cited concerns about a future Supreme Court decision as influencing their decision to introduce the resolutions. 
“Regardless of the outcome of Court action, it’s well past time to remove the discriminatory and, as of now, unconstitutional marriage ban language in our state’s constitution,” Moss wrote in a press release announcing the introduction of his resolution. 
“Today’s victory allows us a reprieve, an opportunity to bring our state Constitution into alignment with the protections our residents are entitled to and have enjoyed for more than a decade,” Nessel’s press release continued. “Now is the time to act.”

,DC,2025-11-10 19:31:10+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,FDA to remove black box warning from hormone replacement therapy drugs,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fda-remove-black-box-warning-hormone-replacement-therapy-drugs,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Monday it plans to remove warnings from hormone replacement therapy drugs that can be used to address symptoms of menopause, saying the statements are no longer needed. The black box warning, the strongest caution possible from the FDA, was added in the early 2000s after a study from the Women's Health Initiative showed an uptick in rates of blood clots, breast cancer, heart attacks and strokes for women who used certain types of hormone replacement therapy. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said during a press conference the change for estrogen-related products “is based on a robust review of the latest scientific evidence.”Makary rebuked the medical establishment for not putting enough effort into researching women’s health conditions, including menopause. “A male-dominated medical profession, let’s be honest, has minimized the symptoms of menopause, and as a result, women’s health issues have not received the attention that they deserve. More than 80% of women have notable severe symptoms lasting up to eight years. How could the medical establishment get it so wrong for so long?” Makary said. “Women deserve the same rigorous sciences as is used for men.”Study criticizedDepartment of Health and Human Services Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health Director Alicia Jackson said the black box warning on estrogen was based on “the flawed, overgeneralized and misinterpreted WHI study.” Jackson said menopause leads to a series of complicated and often painful experiences for women, including “sleepless nights, derailed careers, painful sex, broken bones and a loss of wellbeing.”Jackson explained that when the level of estrogen drops throughout and after menopause, “a cascade of disease and aging begins.”“A preponderance of data now shows that estrogen, when started early, acts as a protective shield for the brain, lowering risks of memory loss, mental health decline and neurodegenerative disease, even Alzheimer's,” Jackson said.  Makary said women should talk with their doctors and can request their estrogen levels be monitored as they approach the age where menopause typically begins and throughout that years-long process. He said that sometimes doctors can prescribe microdosing for hormone replacement therapy, followed by a half-dose and eventually a full dose as a woman’s estrogen levels decrease over time. Makary didn’t say how many of the companies that produce hormone replacement therapies plan to remove the black box warning but said he expects nearly all will do so. “Companies are, generally speaking, very excited when the FDA tells them they can remove a scary warning on your product,” he said. Review by panelThe FDA’s process for removing the black box warning requirement, Makary said, began with an expert panel earlier this year. The FDA’s subject-matter experts then conducted a “comprehensive review of the literature” and recommended the agency remove the requirement, which Makary accepted. The scientists who were part of the expert panel, he said, have written an article that will be published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.President of the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists Steven J. Fleischman wrote in a statement that he ""commends the HHS leadership for improving the lives of perimenopausal women by making the estrogen products they need more accessible to them.""""The modifications to certain warning labels for estrogen products are years in the making, reflecting the dedicated advocacy of physicians and patients across the country,"" Fleischman wrote. ""The updated labels will better allow patients and clinicians to engage in a shared decision-making process, without an unnecessary barrier, when it comes to treatment of menopausal symptoms. ACOG has long advised clinicians to counsel patients based on an individual’s unique risk factors and treatment goals; this announcement does not change ACOG’s guidance on estrogen therapy.""",,,,2025-11-10 14:57:02.704551

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)New Mexico on Saturday paid 100%  of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to recipients who normally receive them during the first week of the month, the governor’s office said on Monday.
The benefits were paid following a federal court and U.S. Department of Agriculture order to do so, but prior to a U.S. Supreme Court pause on the lower court order and USDA revised memo to “undo” the payment of full benefits.
Approximately 460,000 New Mexico residents receive SNAP benefits.
In response to questions from Source NM on Monday regarding the federal government’s revised guidance to only partially reimburse states, Deputy Communications Director Jodi McGinnis Porter, via email, reconfirmed the state had administered full benefits on Saturday to everyone whose issuance date fell between Nov. 1-8. Recipients with a Nov. 10 issuance date will begin receiving their funds on that date.
“We moved forward with full benefit issuance only after the USDA indicated they would comply with the Nov. 6 District Court of Rhode Island order requiring full November SNAP funding,” McGinnis Porter said via email. “Then, the Trump administration reversed course by telling states that they must try to undo full funding, creating yet another round of whiplash for the nation’s most vulnerable families. This gamesmanship is exactly why Governor Lujan Grisham called a special session today. We will not allow our most vulnerable people to suffer needless uncertainty about whether they will be able to put food on their tables while Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress try and weaponize food assistance for political purposes.”

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A new nonprofit with deep ties to President Donald Trump on Monday launched a six-figure advertising effort to back Indiana congressional redistricting efforts in the upcoming session.
“After California and what is coming in Virginia, we feel it is important that Indiana steps up and gives the party an opportunity to pick up two seats in the House,” said Marty Obst, the chair of Fair Maps Indiana. The 501(c)(4) nonprofit will target Senate districts “to educate voters and urge them to contact their Senator and urge passage of redistricting,” he said.
Gov. Mike Braun called legislators back to the Statehouse Nov. 3, but GOP leaders of the House and Senate delayed the start of redistricting work until Dec. 1.
Lawmakers will consider redrawing the state’s two blue congressional districts red ahead of the 2026 midterm elections — following a months-long pressure campaign by Trump and his administration officials for a mid-cycle flip. Hoosier Republicans currently hold a 7-2 advantage in the U.S. House, but redistricting supporters seek a 9-0 map.
The state Senate has become a potential stumbling block for redistricting proponents. While the Indiana House’s GOP leader has confirmed enough support within his caucus to pass new maps, his counterpart in the Senate has repeatedly said the votes “aren’t there.”
Obst said Fair Maps Indiana’s “grassroots” work will include constituent calls, digital and television advertising, as well as mail in targeted districts — focusing on Senate Republicans who haven’t come out with public support of redistricting.
Obst is founder and president of MO Strategies. He served in senior leadership roles in Trump’s 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, and was a senior political adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence.
Others on the Fair Maps Indiana team include: Chris LaCivita, a national campaign strategist who served as senior adviser for Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign; and political consultants Chip Englander and John Brabender.
Politico first reported the creation of Fair Maps Indiana, saying it is a project of Defending America’s Comeback Inc.
But Obst said funding for the new nonprofit “is not disclosed for reporting purposes. If an affiliated Super PAC is formed for primaries, then contributions will be disclosed.”

Indiana’s roster of more than 250 state boards and commissions could get whacked if some legislators get their wish.

Leaders of the General Assembly’s Government Reform Task Force are planning to sponsor a bill in the upcoming session with the goal of eliminating or consolidating an undetermined number of those entities.
“We don’t have transparency or visibility on how some of these boards and commissions are spending taxpayer dollars,” Senate Majority Floor Leader Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, said during last week’s task force meeting. “This is unacceptable.”
Task force members last week endorsed broad guidelines for deciding whether to take action regarding a specific board — including its direct cost, whether it has a clear purpose and the frequency and substance of board meetings.
Garten, the task force’s chair, said the General Assembly has added an average of three boards and commissions a year over the past 50 years.

Such boards have a wide range of authority and activity.
The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, for instance, meets dozens of times a year as it oversees electric, natural gas and water utilities around the state.
But the Advisory Council to the Office of the Utility Consumer Counselor has not met in the past three years and hasn’t had members appointed by any governor “for some time,” according to a Legislative Services Agency report on board and commission activity.
A top adviser to Gov. Mike Braun told the task force in August that “we have too many” boards,” at least 224 of which include a gubernatorial appointment.
Rep. Steve Bartels, R-Eckerty, introduced a bill during the 2025 session to eliminate or downsize a couple dozen boards, but no action was taken on his proposal.
What’s next
Bartels, vice chair of the task force, is planning to sponsor a bill in the upcoming session for another attempt at shrinking the number of state boards.
Garten and Bartels haven’t publicly named any specific ones they will target for elimination. The task force recommendations also did not propose such a list — and just what entities are in the crosshairs could stir up defenders of some boards.
That was foreshadowed by Jason Shelley, executive director for Indiana Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, raising concerns last week over the suggestion of eliminating the Fire Prevention and Building Safety Commission.
Shelley said he was concerned about building code decisions and changes being made by state agency staffers or lawmakers without the involvement of the commission, whose members include architects, professional engineers and others with construction experience.
“We worry about adding more expensive, bureaucratic hoops to jump through, with the potential of a decision being made regarding building life safety by someone who may, or may not, have the adequate experience to really make that call,” Shelley said.
Bartels, meanwhile, indicated frustration with several boards that haven’t responded to task force requests for information about their activities. That might put those boards on his list for possible elimination.
“From here, I think the right thing to do is just repeal it if they can’t justify their actions or their existence,” Bartels said.

States have led the way in regulating kratom, and now federal officials want to ban 7-OH, a powerful compound found in some kratom products. (Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)The New Mexico Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Bureau on Friday issued a warning to residents about the herbal supplement kratom due to its “reportedly addictive, opioid-like effects,” a news release stated. The agency also asked residents to share information about their experiences with the substance.
Kratom products have received increased scrutiny from both the federal government and states, Stateline reported last summer, and are used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced in July it was seeking to restrict 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a compound found in small amounts in kratom.
Kratom faces increasing scrutiny from states and the feds

In addition, at least seven states have either banned or restricted kratom sales in some way.
In New Mexico, the NMDOJ news release noted, kratom is unregulated and kratom products “can be easily purchased at convenience stores, smoke shops, or online.”
Moreover, the news release continued, kratom “is marketed as a product that boosts productivity, enhances focus, lifts moods and alleviates pain, while critics say it can be “highly addictive in the way it binds with the same brain receptors as opioids while stimulating chemicals like serotonin.”
According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, risks from kratom use include: addiction, anorexia, insomnia, withdrawal symptoms, psychosis, overdose and death.
Stateline’s report noted that officials and addiction medicine specialists have noted that kratom and 7-OH products “often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.”
In a statement, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez called the “the information about kratom’s impact, particularly on young people” extremely concerning. “Consumers should understand that these products can have highly addictive effects similar to opioid narcotics. We also want to hear directly from New Mexicans about their experiences with kratom, including those who have already been harmed or sought rehabilitation. Our goal is to ensure families have the facts they need to protect their loved ones.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/kratom-1.jpg,,,2025-11-10 14:57:02.704551

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury)In a rare public split from his party, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., broke ranks with most Senate Democrats on Sunday to help advance a bipartisan deal to reopen the federal government — a package that restores pay and protections for federal workers but doesn’t deliver on the extension of the health care tax credits Democrats had been holding out for. The latter immediately prompted criticism from some within his party’s progressive wing.
Kaine, one of seven Democrats and one independent to join Republicans in moving the measure forward, framed his decision as a pragmatic step to end the record-long shutdown and secure key concessions for federal employees. 
“After the elections in Virginia last Tuesday, I kind of assessed on Wednesday, ‘Where are we?’ (on the shutdown). And so I decided to then join the discussions to try to find the path out, and brought to the table an issue that wasn’t subject to the negotiation really before I got there … which was how to treat federal workers,” Kaine said Monday in a Zoom call with reporters.
“And I asked my progressive colleagues in the caucus, do you think another week of punishing SNAP recipients is going to make the Republicans cave, and will another month make them cave? I don’t need to court anybody’s approval and I don’t need to fear anybody’s judgment,” Kaine said.
The Democrat isn’t up for reelection until 2030.
 Vote signals a pivot — and a compromise

The procedural vote moving the stop-gap funding measure forward cleared the Senate late Sunday by a 60-40 vote. The legislation aims to reopen the federal government and fund key programs through the next several months, while laying out commitments to debate health-care subsidies and other policy priorities.
For Kaine, the deal included specific safeguards he said he insisted upon. 
The legislation would rehire federal employees who were terminated during the shutdown, provide back pay for all federal employees regardless of status, and include a pledge to prevent future reductions in force for the federal workforce. Those terms, Kaine said, constituted the threshold enabling his support.
He said that after weekend negotiations he locked in the agreement at “4:45 p.m. yesterday afternoon, and I feel very, very good about it.”
Kaine also said his action received support from Virginia Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger — though Spanberger has yet to issue a public statement on the matter.
“Controversial, tough call, some of my colleagues don’t like it,” Kaine said. “But my governor-elect is very happy with it, and I’m hearing from Virginians this morning. … ‘Thank God you did this.’”
Virginia is disproportionately affected by the ongoing federal work stoppage. With more than 850,000 residents relying on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and one of the nation’s largest federal workforces, the ripple effects of the funding freeze have already hit home. 
The shutdown — triggered by a stalemate over annual appropriations bills and a tied debate over extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act — began in early October and has since grown into the longest in modern U.S. history. 
In Virginia, the freeze of SNAP payments spurred state action. In late October, Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency and launched the Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance program to bridge benefit gaps. The crunch on federal workers and beneficiaries of food assistance added urgency to the political and policy equation.
 Implications and dissent

Kaine presented the vote as a tactical win that would help reopen the government, secure worker protections, and then debate the more contentious health-care issues openly rather than under a shadow of shutdown chaos. 
“We don’t have a guarantee, but we have a guarantee of a very high-stakes debate and vote on the Senate floor in the full view of the American public, without the background noise of shutdown consequences drowning out the critical nature of the healthcare debate,” he said.
Still, not everyone agrees with his decision. Some progressive Democrats decried the move as ceding too much to Republicans and weakening leverage in negotiations. 
Political commentator Keith Olbermann, on X, demanded Kaine resign: “Don’t vote and then resign — RESIGN NOW. You are no longer a Democrat.” 
Others, such as retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the brother of U.S. Rep. Eugene Vindman, D-Woodbridge, criticized the broader Senate Democratic caucus for collapsing before the public’s appetite for a fight.
“It’s striking and inexplicable that Senate Dems crumbled following decisive signals from the American electorate,” Vindman said on X. “Americans expect the Democrats to fight Trump and Republicans.”
In Virginia’s congressional delegation, responses further reflected the divide. 
Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, said he would vote “no” on the Senate proposal once it reached the House, faulting it for failing to fully address health-care costs or federal worker firings. 
“A promise not to fire federal workers in the future is no comfort … to federal workers already fired or contractors who lost their job or aren’t receiving back pay,” he said.
In contrast, Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Fairfax, applauded Kaine’s move as protecting federal workers and ending “attack after attack” under the Trump administration.
On the Republican side, Rep. Ben Cline, R-Botetourt, said, “After 40 days of unnecessary hardship, Democrats have finally recognized that their government shutdown strategy was a failure. … Sadly, it came at the expense of our troops, SNAP recipients, and federal employees who bore the brunt of their political brinkmanship.” 
 A calculated risk

Political scientist Stephen J. Farnsworth of the University of Mary Washington said Kaine’s calculation reflects the kind of decision lawmakers make when they’re freed from the immediate pressures of reelection.
“The farther an elected official is from their next election, the more likely they are to make the decision about how to proceed based on sound public policy evaluation,” he said, noting that Kaine’s next reelection campaign is five years off.
“The fact that the Democratic senators who are part of this negotiation are some distance from their next election, or have announced their retirement, suggests that this is more about their evaluation of how the government should proceed rather than reelection considerations,” he said.
On the intra-party split between Kaine and fellow Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, Farnsworth added: 
“It seems to me that reasonable people could disagree on what the party’s best step forward would be. And it’s certainly unusual when there is a difference of opinion between the two Democratic senators, but even people who agree most of the time don’t agree all the time.”
Warner, who voted against the compromise, said in a statement that while he appreciated that the Senate proposal includes “important language preventing further mass layoffs of federal employees,” he could not support an agreement that “still leaves millions of Americans wondering how they are going to pay for their health care or whether they will be able to afford to get sick.”
Whether Kaine’s move proves bold or miscalculated remains to be seen. 
“Only time will tell,” Farnsworth cautioned. “The reality is that an awful lot of people are suffering from the economic consequences of the shutdown. It’s better for the government to be open than not.”

The federal government shutdown continued to have an array of devastating impacts in reent days and, by any fair estimate, one of the most harmful has been the shutoff in SNAP food assistance. While a pair of federal court rulings appear to have forced the Trump administration to restart benefits for the millions of families who rely upon them, at last report, those benefits will be at just half of previous levels – a change that will guarantee a spike in hunger and suffering.
So how is this playing out in North Carolina? How many people are being adversely impacted and what if anything can be done to lessen the impact? Recently, we sat down with a journalist who’s been watching and reporting on this situation – NC Newsline reporter, Galen Bacharier.

The government shutdown and its devastating impact on millions of federal workers and average citizens is not the only dysfunction emanating from Washington these days. Thanks to the refusal of Congress and the Trump administration to extend health insurance tax credits enacted during the Biden years, millions of Americans are facing astronomical price spikes for Affordable Care Act health insurance policies for the New Year.
So, how bad is the situation and what can average North Carolinians do – both to urge Congress to act and to learn about how to fashion solutions to cope with the price hikes? Recently, Newsline sat down with one of our state’s most knowledgeable health care policy experts – Rebecca Cerese of the North Carolina Justice Center – to hear some answers to these and other closely related questions.

The “full, complete, and unconditional” pardons were announced on the personal X account of Trump’s pardon attorney, Ed Martin, at nearly 11 p.m. on Sunday, writing, “Important pardon of Alternate Electors of 2020!!” 
The pardoned alleged false electors include Republican National Committeewoman Kathy Berden and former Michigan Republican Party co-chair Meshawn Maddock, as well as former Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro. Chesebro pleaded guilty in 2023 to a felony charge of conspiracy for his work to overturn election results in a number of swing states, including Michigan. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to testimony from Howard Shock, a special agent investigator with the Michigan Department of Attorney General, Chesebro, at that time a lawyer on Trump’s team, allegedly sent an email on Dec. 10, 2020 to Marian Sheridan, one of the Michigan residents who has been pardoned, with a certificate stating that Trump had won Michigan’s electoral votes in the 2020 election — already listing the vote count of 16 electors, prior to their vote. 
Sheridan, Shock testified, wrote back to Chesebro to say, “I believe I can be more effective in getting the other 15 electors involved in this effort for December 14th,” referring to the alleged attempt to create an “alternate slate” of electors that would cast votes for Trump, despite his losing the state by over 150,000 votes in the general election. 
Howard Shock, an investigator with the Michigan Department of Attorney General, testifies in the exam of six of the so-called “fake electors”. May 28, 2024. Screenshot.
The other alleged false electors from Michigan pardoned were Hank Choate, Amy Facchinello, Clifford Frost, Stanley Grot, John Haggard, Mary-Ann Henry, Timothy King, Michele Lundgren, James Renner, Mayra Rodriguez, Rose Rook, Kenneth Thompson and Kent Vanderwood. That list includes a number of local GOP leaders from around the state.
The pardons are largely symbolic, as they only apply to federal charges, which none of the individuals on the list were facing. 
In Michigan, Lansing 54-A District Court Judge Kristen Simmons dismissed the charges against the alleged false electors in September, arguing that prosecutors had failed to give evidence that those signing the document had criminal intent. Those charges were dismissed against 15 of those pardoned by Trump — all except for Renner, who had previously had his case dropped by Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office after signing a cooperation agreement. 
Renner had argued in court that all 16 of those charged did not believe they were engaging in illegal activity by signing documents saying that they were the state’s electors, and had been made to believe that it was an “appropriate process.”
Another Trump attorney pardoned on Sunday, Sidney Powell, led a number of lawsuits in Michigan seeking to halt the certification of the 2020 election results and overturn them in favor of Trump. She had also pleaded guilty in 2023 to election interference, specifically related to charges in Georgia. 
The pardons also included false electors from Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona among other states where Trump had sought to overturn election results, as well as notable Trump administration figures, like Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis, who both testified in the Michigan House of Representatives in late 2020 in a campaign to unfounded allegations of widespread election fraud.

According to the statement, Parker oversaw the drafting of the state’s ban of cell phones in public schools, reorganization of the Alabama State Board of Veterans Affairs, paid parental leave for public school employees, and Ivey’s Safe Alabama package.

Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12) will retire rather than seek a seventh term in Congress, she announced Monday. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman announced Monday she will exit Congress at the end of her current term rather than seek reelection next year after nearly three decades in various levels of elected office in New Jersey.
Watson Coleman (D-12), the first Black congresswoman elected in New Jersey, said in a statement that she is confident retiring is the right choice for her and her family.
“I made a commitment years ago to always lead the charge on behalf of those I represent, and I believe I have fulfilled that commitment to the very best of my abilities,” she said.
Watson Coleman was first elected to Congress in 2014 to replace then-Rep. Rush Holt.
Rep. Nellie Pou (D-08) called Watson Coleman’s announcement “a big hit for our state.”
“Over the last generation, there are few people from our state who have done more for civil rights, for workers, for ethics, and for kindness than Bonnie Watson Coleman. Bonnie is a leader in our delegation, respected by everyone,” Pou said in a statement.
Before ascending to Congress, Watson Coleman served 17 years in the General Assembly representing New Jersey’s 15th Legislative District, including four years as majority leader.
“It is my fervent hope that whoever is next elected to serve the people of the 12th Congressional District will be a public servant grounded in strong moral principles and an unabashed advocate in the United States Congress on behalf of those they have the privilege to represent,” she said.
Watson Coleman is one of the most progressive members of New Jersey’s congressional delegation. At 80, she is also its oldest member.
Representatives’ ages have increasingly been a focal point for voters. Concerns over lawmakers’ health redoubled after Reps. Bill Pascrell, 87, and Donald Payne Jr., 65, died in office last year.
Watson Coleman underwent treatment for lung cancer in 2018.
“I have never been a prideful person just as I have never taken my many blessings for granted, but I can say today that I believe we were able to make a tremendous positive impact for many people, and for that I am grateful. I am honored to have served my constituents who faithfully trusted me to be their voice,” the congresswoman said.
Watson Coleman’s retirement will spur a primary in the largely Democratic 12th Congressional District next year that could draw a broad field of candidates.

Volunteers at Corinthian Missionary Baptist Church prepared meals to distribute to people in need of food aid. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Care & Share serves as a food resource of last resort in Unicoi County, where many residents remain out of work a year after Hurricane Helene destroyed local factories and businesses.
One in 10 county residents now relies on the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to put food on the table — a marked increase from before the devastating storms.
When November 1 SNAP payments didn’t come, the small Christian ministry, which typically serves just 20 families per week, saw double the demand, handing out shelf-stable food supplies to 38.
“We have a faith that God will provide, that He loves us and supports the work we do, that our work is His work and I’m confident He will provide,” said Ben Booher, executive director.
“But the human side of me looks at our shelves sometimes and the eyes of people we serve and it’s hard. It is scary.”
Food banks across Tennessee are reporting a large uptick in demand this month as the Trump administration continues to return to the courts to enforce a freeze on full SNAP payments while the government shutdown continues. 
Late Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked a lower court’s order requiring the Trump administration to pay for November food benefits, even as some states began distributing SNAP funds. Tennessee had not yet begun distributing the benefits before the Supreme Court order. On Sunday, the Senate took its first steps to reopening the federal government, which would resume SNAP benefits.
A high percentage of rural Tennesseans use SNAP, as funding set to dry up

The Supreme Court order pauses any decision on the benefits until a federal court of appeals hears the case.
When nearly 700,000 Tennesseans who rely on SNAP will be able to access full or partial benefits remains uncertain. 
“At this time, we do not have a confirmed date for when partial benefits will be available,” a spokesperson for the Tennessee Department of Human Services said Friday.
And $5 million in state funding for food pantries, announced last week by Gov. Bill Lee, has yet to reach Second Harvest of Middle Tennessee, designated by the state to distribute funds to food banks across the state to be able to meet the rising demand for food.
In the meantime, Tennessee families are turning to food banks to fill the gap left without a November SNAP payment, which averages about $340 per month for a family of four. 
On Sunday, more than 200 cars lined up for a giveaway at Greater St. John Baptist Church in Nashville. Organizers of the food giveaway planned to open at 8 a.m., but opened early after people lined up as early as 5 a.m., including 50 people on foot.  About half of those served were SNAP recipients. Most tended to be older: half were over 56 years of age. 
In Nashville’s western suburbs, the Bellevue Community Food Bank opens each Tuesday evening to supply families in the western suburbs of Nashville with nonperishable goods and meat and vegetables when they are available. 
Director Robin Dillon said the food bank, which operates on the back side of a Methodist church, had called out for more community donations and called in extra volunteers in anticipation of a bigger than normal crowd lining up. 
The food bank typically sees 70-90 families each week. On Tuesday, they saw an additional 50 people, most of them first-timers, she said. 
“It was 100% SNAP-related. People are scared and don’t know where their next meal is coming from,” she said. 
Ernest Ellison said he has seen a similar increase in needy families accessing the food pantry operated by Helping Hands of Humboldt, a small food ministry in Gibson County
The food pantry has a steady stream of regulars who show up to supplement their SNAP benefits or limited income in the rural community of 7,000.
Last week, the pantry served 22 new families representing about 70 individuals in need of food. The new clients, he said, are largely SNAP recipients.
But food pantry operators are also worried they won’t have the capacity to meet needs if the SNAP payments continue to be withheld.
“We’ve been prepared — it hasn’t happened yet — but we’ve been prepared to say I’m going to give away my last can of beans,” said Booher, the Unicoi County Care & Share director.

(Photo by Vladimir Vladimirov/Getty Images)Florida Republicans are trying for the fourth year in a row to ban political flags atop government buildings, including Pride, MAGA, or Black Lives Matter banners.
Filed by Republicans Rep. David Borrero and Sen. Clay Yarborough, HB 347 and SB 426 would ban flags referencing politics, race, gender, or sexual orientation being flown on government-owned buildings. This is the fourth time Borrero, from Miami, has carried this legislation. It’s died each year before reaching either the House or Senate floor.
Identical in each chamber, the language bans schools, universities, state governments, local governments, or political boards from displaying flags depicting “any word, figure, mark, picture, design, drawing, symbol, or advertisement of any nature which represents political partisanship, political ideology, race, gender, or sexual orientation.”

It would preempt local ordinances allowing these flags. Out-of-compliance entities would be fined $500 per day. The penalties would be collected through the Department of State and deposited into the general revenue fund, the state’s main budgetary account.
Last year, the bill was filed by then-Sen. Randy Fine to specifically target Palestinian flags during the Israel-Hamas war. Fine withdrew his bill to run for Congress in March.  This year’s measure, however, allows these buildings to fly flags from other states or countries or that have “historical significance.”
The 2024 bill was sponsored by Borrero and Sen. Jonathan Martin, and the 2023 bill by Borrero and then-Sen. Jay Collins. Collins resigned his post in August to serve as lieutenant governor. 
If passed, the legislation would take effect on July 1, 2026. The session starts on Jan. 13.

(Photo by Jim Still-Pepper/iStock via Getty mages)A state program designed to alleviate utility costs for low-income Pennsylvanians hasn’t kept up with the need, advocates say, and the ongoing federal shutdown means payments haven’t yet hit the commonwealth’s  coffers.
The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, gets its funding from the federal government, which is now in the seventh week of the longest-ever shutdown. It planned to start accepting applications on Nov. 3, but last month the state Department of Human Services delayed the program’s opening day to Dec. 3 because it hadn’t received its allotted dollars. 
But just one-third of Pennsylvanians who qualified for the program last year applied, and disconnections are up in recent months — signaling that more help is needed.

“We’ve, for several years, had a growing energy affordability crisis, and it gets worse with each passing year because we’re not addressing it in the way that we need to,” said Elizabeth Marx, the executive director of the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project and chair of the LIHEAP Advisory Committee. 
Marx said that, even with LIHEAP and utility-run assistance, the need is still “tremendous,” especially as costs soar with the addition of power-hungry data centers and limited grid capacity.
Lower-income residents have a harder time shouldering such increases. Nearly 338,000 Pennsylvanians had their utilities disconnected in the first nine months of 2025, a 16% increase from the previous year.
Eligibility for LIHEAP tops out at 150% of the federal poverty level, or $48,225 for a household of four. 
Per year, people can expect to receive somewhere between $200 and $1,000 in a one-time payment to offset their utility costs — though the average benefit in 2024 was $336. According to the annual federal report, almost 303,000 households benefited from the $231 million program in 2024.

Last week, the state’s utility providers said they wouldn’t cut off heat or lights for people who can’t pay their bills in November due to the federal shutdown, in an agreement with the Public Utility Commission.
But researchers warn that reopening the federal government won’t immediately release those dollars, since the entire staff was laid off by the Trump administration in April. Congress has already chosen to fund LIHEAP for 2026.
“It is unlikely that other sources of funding can fill in the gaps if states do not receive LIHEAP funds from the federal government,” wrote a group of academics for The Conversation last week. “The program’s funding has never been high enough to meet the need. 
“Our research has found that, in practice, many households rely on a range of local nonprofits, faith-based organizations and informal networks of family and friends to help them pay their bills and keep the heat on in winter,” they added.
 Qualifying for assistance

The state prohibits utility companies from disconnecting heat or electricity between Dec. 1 and March 31 for consumers earning 250% of the federal poverty level or less — $80,375 for a family of four. This moratorium doesn’t let Pennsylvanians off the hook for payments, however, and more than 300,000 people depend on LIHEAP to pay their bills. 
Last week’s announcement effectively moves that moratorium date up one month. 
The moratorium does give people a reprieve, but only Pennsylvanians with certain types of utilities qualify. Households who warm up their homes with deliverable fuels — such as oil, propane, kerosene, wood or coal — aren’t regulated by the state Public Utility Commission that oversees it. 

Each utility also offers assistance programs with varying eligibility requirements.

Rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities also don’t qualify — but those consumers can still access LIHEAP. 
LIHEAP funding also includes crisis assistance and weatherization grants, which cost $77 million and $4 million, respectively. The state spent $105 million on heating assistance alone in 2024. Across all aid groups, 73% of grants went to households with a vulnerable member, defined as homes with an elderly resident, a child or someone with a disability. 
Though the state has supplemented LIHEAP funding in the past — most recently during the COVID-19 pandemic — but a LIHEAP press release from the Governor’s Office said, “Pennsylvania cannot backfill these costs.” Congress determines the money granted to states through a formula, while the submitted state plan outlines the minimum and maximum awards.
“LIHEAP has, for over 40 years, provided safe and warm homes for Pennsylvanians across the state. It’s critically important to the health and safety of Pennsylvanians and the inability to access (assistance through the program) is of great concern,” Marx said. 
Marx listed additional concerns for Pennsylvanians struggling to pay their utility bills, and worried about people trying to balance those costs.
“We are going to have a lot of families who are forgoing food, medicine, medical care, child care and other basic needs in order to keep energy on in their home,” said Marx. “It’s really important that we all work together to solve this crisis.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/heat-pump-2-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-10 13:02:57.001780

The University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens scored nine points in the final two minutes of regulation to beat the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs, 25-24, November 8.
 
NEWARK — Before kicker Nate Reed stepped onto the field in the biggest moment of the game, head coach Ryan Carty stood on the sidelines talking with his graduate kicker. Carty said postgame that he asked his kicker if he wanted a timeout to relax and settle into the moment. Reed declined.
From 51 yards out, Reed made his run up to the ball and swung his right foot sending a spiraling kick through the night sky. The ball wobbled a bit as it made its descent, clearing the crossbar by a good margin and hitting the netting behind the goal post. 
Reed’s career long field goal provided the game winning score in UD’s 25-24 victory over Louisiana Tech, Saturday evening.
“After the onside kick, it was kind of like a moment of, there’s no way this ball’s not going in,” Reed said postgame.
“You don’t ever want to leave it up to, you know, have it to be one guy that has to make the kick and he did. And I just can’t be more proud of him,” said Carty.
The onside kick Reed referenced was another important part of a career day for the kicker. 
Trailing by a point with just over two minutes to play in the fourth quarter, Blue Hens’ quarterback Nick Minicucci threw a pass intended for Jake Thaw on fourth down. Bulldogs’ corner Jacob Fields jumped the route and intercepted the pass. Fields returned the interception 38 yards for a touchdown. The extra point gave the Bulldogs an eight point lead before the two minute timeout.
Minicucci redeemed his prior mistake, marching the Blue Hens offense 75 yards down the field in eight plays on their ensuing possession. The junior quarterback found his senior tight end Elijah Sessoms along the right side of the endzone to cut the lead to two points. The Blue Hens’ two point attempt was unsuccessful leaving it up to an improbable onside kick recovery to give them a shot at a win with 37 seconds left.
Reed started on the right side of the ball, made his run and then switched his positioning to hit the ball left. The misdirection prompted a timeout from the Bulldogs sideline and a clear Louisiana Tech recovery was wiped away. Following the timeout, Reed ran the same action and spiked his kick into the ground generating a bouncy football. The ball bounced around and over the head of a Bulldog player allowing junior Ja’Carree Kelly to recover the ball.
“They did a great job calling the timeout and right on cue we just did it again,” Carty said. “What a great job, what a great hustle play and execution on that.”
Reed finished the game with a career high four made field goals and received the game ball following the victory. His first three field goals of the game came in the first half.    
The Blue Hens moved the ball well early in the game, but once they got into the redzone points became hard to generate against CUSA’s top red zone defense. Entering the game, the Bulldogs allowed eight touchdowns and five made field goals on 21 total red zone trips.  
Delaware worked the ball to the red zone on two of its first half drives and both resulted in field goals. On UD’s third scoring drive, the Blue Hens were stopped at the Louisiana Tech 24 yard line and forced to kick a 41-yard field goal.
The Bulldogs struggled to gain any offensive momentum, scoring once through the first 30 minutes of action. Their lone touchdown drive of the first half was a seven play drive led by starting quarterback Blake Baker in the first quarter. Baker left the game in the second quarter and didn’t return. The Bulldogs’ offense went dormant following his exit. 
The Bulldogs accumulated 122 yards of total offense in the second and third quarters combined. During that stretch, Delaware held Louisiana Tech scoreless and forced a turnover with Nate Evans’ first interception of the season.
“The coaches did a good job giving us a plan that put us in the places to make plays, do the things that we do well,” said defensive lineman Ethan Saunders. “And I think it comes back to a belief that we have in each other.”
Louisiana Tech found its footing in the fourth quarter racking up 112 total yards of offense and scoring ten points on three offensive drives. The touchdown drive in that sequence was capped off by a 13-yard run from sophomore Clay Thevenin — an accomplishment he celebrated by ringing the bell in the back left corner of Delaware Stadium. 
Thevenin’s second touchdown of the game is what provided the Bulldogs’ their one point advantage late in the game. 
The Blue Hens will be on the road for their next two games. The first will be a road matchup against Sam Houston. The Bearkats are winless in CUSA games this season. The second is a non-conference battle against Wake Forest in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on November 22.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4313-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-10 13:02:57.001780

The justices agreed to take up an appeal from Mississippi after a panel of three judges appointed by President Donald Trump on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that the state law allowing ballots that arrive shortly after Election Day to be counted violated federal law.
Mississippi is among 18 states and the District of Columbia that accept mailed ballots received after Election Day as long as the ballots are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
In this case, the Republican National Committee and the Libertarian Party of Mississippi sued Secretary of State Michael Watson, the official who administers elections. They argued that Congress alone can set a date by which voters must make their choice, not individual states.
Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch’s office is defending Watson in court, arguing that the five-day window after Election Day does not provide additional days for voters to cast a ballot. Rather, it’s simply an extra cushion for election workers to count the ballots. 
“Under federal law, election day is the day for voters to conclusively choose federal officers. Voters make that conclusive choice by casting — marking and submitting — their ballots by election day,” Fitch’s office wrote in court papers. 
The litigation created an unusual scenario where Fitch and Watson, both Republicans, had to fight their own political party in court to defend Mississippi’s law. 
U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola Jr., a George W. Bush-appointed judge, initially ruled last year in Gulfport that there was no conflict between the state law and federal laws. But the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit later reversed him. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has not set a date for oral arguments, but it would likely be argued during the spring. The Court would then likely issue a ruling in the summer of 2026.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/04160729/Voting-1.jpg,,,2025-11-10 13:02:57.001780

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)TOPEKA — A formerly Kansas-based trucking company that tried to sue its unionized employees for blocking modernization efforts will return to court to attempt to extract millions, or potentially billions, of dollars in damages from the union.
A federal court in Kansas initially dismissed the case from Yellow Corp., formerly known as Yellow Trucking, which was plagued by extreme debt before declaring bankruptcy and ceasing to exist. But a panel of federal appeals judges found errors in the original decision and remanded the case to district court, allowing new evidence from Yellow to be considered.
The lawsuit came weeks before Yellow’s downfall in August 2023, when it filed for bankruptcy after attempting to shift its operations and change employees’ job descriptions to overcome years of debts and increasing competition from non-union freight carriers. The company, which was one of the largest trucking companies in the country,  was in “dire financial straits,” the appeals court decision said.
Judge Richard Federico of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals wrote in the 28-page Nov. 5 decision that the district judge who dismissed Yellow’s complaint and simultaneously denied it the opportunity to add new evidence was wrong.
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters represented 22,000 of Yellow’s 30,000 employees at the time. It argued that Yellow, which was headquartered in Overland Park before moving its executive offices to Nashville, didn’t exhaust its internal grievance processes, which were required under the collective bargaining agreement between Yellow’s subsidiaries and local Teamsters chapters.
“The Teamsters defeated Yellow’s baseless complaint and look forward to defeating their baseless Amended Complaint,” said Kara Deniz, spokesperson for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, in an emailed statement.
The Teamsters have roughly two weeks to challenge the Tenth Circuit’s decision.
Yellow was pleased with the Tenth Circuit’s decision, said Ron Rossi, a partner at Kasowitz law firm in New York who has been involved with the case, representing Yellow since the beginning.
“Yellow was a great company,” he said in an interview Friday. “Yellow provided good-paying jobs to 30,000 people.”
He said what happened to Yellow “is an absolute American tragedy.”
Yellow’s original complaint was filed in June, just more than a month before filing for Chapter 11 liquidation. If the allegations that the Teamsters “knowingly schemed to destroy Yellow” succeed, Rossi said, “arguably the Teamsters would be responsible for the costs of that bankruptcy.”
That includes the initial claim for $137 million in damages, tens of millions in administrative costs, pension costs triggered by the bankruptcy, and Yellow’s complete loss in enterprise value, Rossi said.
If all of those costs are found in court to be attributable to breach of conduct, the total could well exceed $1 billion, he said.
“Yellow is going to do its level best to hold the Teamsters to account for the consequences of their actions,” Rossi said.
He specifically mentioned Teamsters president Sean O’Brien, who has been a target in the case, and Teamsters leadership.
Yellow’s amended complaint refers to new evidence uncovered after the initial lawsuit was filed. That evidence has never had its day in court.
A record of minutes from a Teamsters board meeting reflected, as Yellow’s attorneys have alleged, “the Teamsters’ refusal to cooperate in any way with the then-ongoing restructuring efforts at Yellow,” Rossi said.
To the Teamsters, the initial $137 million lawsuit was frivolous and undermined the rights of workers. To Yellow, the modernization efforts that prompted the dispute were a matter of survival. In its lawsuit, Yellow alleges “the Teamsters intended to fully walk away from the table and force Yellow out of business.”
Yellow says the Teamsters “intentionally triggered a death spiral for Yellow,” a claim the Teamsters “vigorously dispute,” the appeals court decision said.
Yellow’s debts and financial troubles did not begin in 2023. They had been years in the making. Before its shutdown, the company had only had three profitable quarters since 2009, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1583712244.jpg,,,2025-11-10 13:02:57.001780

NHTI is one of two New Hampshire community colleges that have a national accredited early childhood education program. (Photo by Maya Mitchell/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire has a child care workforce shortage, and it is looking to its community colleges to address one part of that issue: the development pipeline. For Diana Menard, the department chair of education and child and family services at New Hampshire Technical Institute in Concord, the shift in early education happened almost a decade ago. 
“Back in 2014 and 2015, we had really good numbers coming in out of high school students. We had two sections of courses during the day,” Menard said. “Now we have one section of day classes, and maybe it’ll have 10 to 15 students.”
The early childhood education sector often looks to high school and apprenticeship programs, such as Career and Technical Education, to help develop interest in the field. The goal is that after high school graduation, students will pursue accreditation through a higher education institution and begin their careers in early care and education.
CTE aims to prepare students for college and high-demand careers by providing them with “hands-on, career-focused programs” that combine learning and technical skills training, and are a huge contributor to the early childhood education workforce pipeline. 
However, over the past decade, CTE programs have been reducing their early education options, largely because jobs in the industry tend to be low-paying. Today, around a quarter of the state’s CTE programs offer early childhood education training.
Menard said the cuts at the high school level have “depleted” community college programs, as fewer young people are being introduced into the industry.
The impact has been felt across the state. Between 2017 and 2024, the number of licensed providers in the Granite State able to care for children under the age of 5 has declined by nearly 13%, according to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute.
With the state’s aging population, unlivable wages, and the COVID-19 pandemic, which put further strain on the workforce, many providers have retired or left the field entirely. 
New tuition assistance efforts
In an effort to reinvigorate that pipeline, the Community College System of New Hampshire has expanded its tuition assistance program for students pursuing early childhood education. 
The Early Childhood Tuition Assistance program now covers community college tuition, fees, and books for approved courses as students pursue a certificate or associate’s degree in early care and education. In the previous version of the program, ECE students were eligible just for tuition assistance and only for one course per semester. 
The state allocated $2.5 million last budget cycle for the program. Teri LaFlamme, college access program coordinator for CCSNH, said the program has given students the financial freedom to explore the field. 
“[The funding] has opened up the door for a lot of expansion,” LaFlamme said. “Before, the students typically were only able to take one class, and they were living paycheck to paycheck. … I think it’ll be a clearer path for students.” 
According to LaFlamme, the assistance program has covered the cost for 1,200 courses and awards were given to over 643 students. She said most students get coverage for all of their classes. 
To qualify, students must be an ECE degree student, in good academic standing, and have applied to the Federal Assistance Student Financial Program. Students also need to either be a New Hampshire resident or employed by a New Hampshire child care program if they are not. 
LaFlamme said very few students have been turned away from the program. 
Expansive development efforts
High schools across the state have also partnered with community colleges to create an early college system. Students can take college classes at their high schools, online through a college faculty member, or at the community colleges themselves, and earn college credits. These credits are generally transferable to community or four-year colleges in New Hampshire or out-of-state. 
Additionally, while all seven New Hampshire community colleges offer early care and education degrees or certificates, NHTI and Manchester Community College have recently been accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children. 
Menard said the certification is a “quality seal” that proves students in the school’s programs demonstrate certain competencies. Through program accreditation, students will have an easier time transferring credits to a four-year college, specifically if that college is out of state. 
Nashua Community College has also applied for accreditation, although the process has been put on hold due to the federal government shutdown. 
“Better teachers help children be successful,” LaFlamme said. “That rollover effect, I really think that is great.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nhtiece-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-10 13:02:57.001780

The Supreme Court will not hear a case to overturn marriage equality, it announced on Monday. The justices have rejected a petition from Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue licenses in the state a decade ago.
Davis’ petition has been closely watched, but was seen as a long shot.
For the past decade, Davis  has been battling against giving marriage licenses to same-sex couples. She was jailed for six days and fined $100,000 plus attorney’s fees for refusing to do so.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

It is the second time Davis petitioned the court to hear her case. She made similar arguments five years ago, and the court also declined to take up the case then.
“Davis possesses a sincerely held religious belief that marriage is a union between one man and one woman,” her petition to the high court stated.
She was largely viewed as one of few Americans with legal standing to challenge the 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that made marriage equality the law of the land.  But LGBTQ+ legal scholars have stated that her legal standing was still shaky and that the foundation for marriage equality remains strong.
Still, Kevin Jennings, CEO of Lambda Legal, the nation’s largest LGBTQ+ legal organization said in a statement that now is not a time for LGBTQ+ advocates to let their guard down.
“This frivolous case now belongs in the trash bin of history,” Jennings said. “But let’s not be naïve: our opponents are well-resourced and determined.”
A majority of Americans would lose access to marriage equality if Obergefell  was overturned; 35 states have either a constitutional ban on marriage equality or a statute prohibiting LGBTQ+ couples from marrying. Some have both.
However, in 2022, Congress passed the Respect for Marriage Act, a law that forces states to recognize out-of-state marriages and that grandfathers pre-existing same-sex marriages into law. As a result, married LGBTQ+ couples would remain married and couples wanting to get married could do so by traveling to other states that allow marriage equality.

(Getty Images)A new report says 80% of disabled State of New Mexico employees have considered quitting because of difficulties receiving accommodations. The list of grievances including extreme wait times of more than a year, denials without engaging in the process, and inappropriate and discriminatory comments by supervisors.
The union that represents state public workers looked into disability access and Americans with Disability Act, or ADA, compliance issues for about a year. The president of the Communications Workers of America local 7076, Megan Green, said they found many disabled employees are considering leaving the state because they felt, quote, “bullied and dismissed” when seeking ADA accommodations.
Union vice-president, Lindsay Hurst, said employees are often left with nowhere to turn with little to no legal support.
“Most of the employees that we advise to file with human rights choose to leave state service or remain in unhealthy or unsupportive work situations due to fear of retaliation,” she said. “And I’m very serious about this, a lot of people just go quiet, and then they leave.”
Hurst said the union is asking for an external audit, copies of written denials for accommodations with reason for the denial given, a 20-day response time to requests for accommodation, and a clear and accessible appeals process.
“We need support to ensure that state buildings are accessible for everyone,” she said.
Hurst and Green presented the report to lawmakers in the Legislative Health and Human Services Committee Wednesday evening, along with the Chair of the Union’s Disability Justice Committee, Sunny Gonzales.
The committee, established by the union in September 2024, has been evaluating discrimination by training under the Southwest ADA Law Center, and teaming up with civil rights experts at Disability Rights New Mexico, conducting interviews, focus groups and surveys of state workers with disabilities.
Also present at the presentation was Dylan Lange, director of the State Personnel Office. He pointed out that his agency follows federal law when it comes to disabilities, and that each individual state agency is responsible for its own ADA compliance, and must appoint its own ADA coordinator. He said that ties his agency’s hands when providing support to disabled state employees.
“We came here to listen, to acknowledge that those stories that we heard today are hard to hear,” he said, “but we are willing to be part of these groups to have a concerted effort to ensure that we are being inclusive throughout the state.”
Hurst said the union is also calling for legislation to ensure ADA rights last into the future. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham vetoed a bill that would have done just that, saying state agencies are already ADA-compliant.

(Photo courtesy John McCann)North Carolina joined New York and Virginia in making national headlines this month with historic municipal election results that should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who believes in the myth of “off-year” elections. What we witnessed across our state wasn’t just a collection of local races — it was a demonstration of democracy’s vitality at the grassroots level and a potential preview of what’s to come in 2026.
Voters showed up in numbers that shattered expectations for municipal elections, and the message is clear: when people understand the power they hold in local elections, they vote. During this election cycle, we continued to get closer to the people. Our organization reached more than 40,000 voters across the state, talking with them about the power they have in local elections. What we found was a deep hunger for meaningful participation in democracy.
What makes these results truly historic is who won. North Carolina has elected the youngest and most diverse class of municipal officials in our state’s history. From college towns like Greensboro and Durham to smaller communities such as Enfield and Brunswick County, dozens of young candidates earned voters’ respect and trust, defeating traditional incumbents and established challengers.
This wasn’t about name recognition or political machinery. These candidates won because voters were hungry for change, and they could see that change reflected in a new generation of leadership. We’ve seen races decided by fewer than five votes per precinct. Races where decisions will be made about taxes, roads, policing, education and public safety will be made by officials voters will see in their local stores, churches and community events.
Many of the winners succeeded with limited resources, choosing authenticity over expensive campaign advertising. They opted for the streets and social media rather than flashy campaign swag, commercials and television advertisements. They knocked on doors. They had real conversations. They built trust one voter at a time.
This grassroots approach didn’t just work — it outperformed traditional, well-funded campaigns. Voters value genuine connection and commitment to building community over polished messaging and big budgets. When our issues are framed by local people addressing local concerns — not national campaigns and party talking points — we exceed expectations.
According to recent data from the North Carolina State Board of Elections, voter turnout in this year’s municipal election increased over prior municipal elections. There was also a strong showing in early voting and absentee ballots, further supporting people’s desire to be a part of the solutions for our communities. Given the lack of resources and attention on odd-year elections, this year’s turnout is a powerful indicator of opportunity.
For example, in Guilford County — one of our core organizing hubs — voter turnout reached 21.26%, a significant increase from the 2023 municipal election, which saw 17.70% turnout. That’s a 20% jump in turnout, demonstrating that when voters understand what’s at stake in local elections and see candidates who represent real change, they show up.
As we look ahead to the 2026 midterms, this surge in municipal voter turnout could reshape North Carolina’s political landscape.
The voters who turned out for these local races have proven they will show up when they believe their vote matters, that there are no off years, and that change is possible when people organize, engage, and vote.
The question now is whether we can sustain this energy and expand it. Traditional voting patterns may be evolving. As white conservative voters become increasingly dissatisfied with corporate influence in the Republican Party, the use of race as a means to control a largely rural working-class base may be losing its effectiveness.
Real economic concerns — kitchen-table issues that affect most families and communities — are cutting through old political divisions. Decisions about federal funding for nutrition programs, healthcare and agricultural support affect North Carolina families daily, and voters will remember who stood with them when it mattered.
The 2026 midterms will test whether this municipal election surge was a one-time phenomenon or the beginning of lasting political transformation in North Carolina.
I believe it’s the latter. The voters have spoken, and they’ve made it clear: there are no off years anymore.

Date rape drugging, or roofying, is the use of any sedative, usually mixed with alcohol, to incapacitate a victim and facilitate a sexual assault. While anecdotal stories of suspected roofying circulate around Alaska, cases and culprits are difficult to confirm. 
Alaska Chief Medical Officer Dr. Robert Lawrence said that’s partially due to the nature of the crime. 
“Many of these medications actually their mechanism, tragically, is memory loss,” he said. “One of your neighbors will have been assaulted, and know that an assault has occurred, but have no memory of how or when or what led up to it, just because of the way that the substance itself works. So that’s the reality of the situation that we’re in,” he said. 
Substances can vary and are metabolized quickly in the body. GHB or Rhohyprol, most commonly identified as date rape drugs, are tasteless and odorless. They can cause intense inebriation, dizziness, memory lapses and pain, especially when mixed with alcohol, and are used to facilitate sexual assault. 
The state does not track reports of suspected drugging or a drug facilitated sexual assault, according to officials with the Alaska Department of Public Safety and Department of Health. Lawrence explained that’s due to several reasons, but does not reflect the seriousness of the issue. 
“We’re talking about sexual assault in Alaska, which is a very serious problem across the whole state. And then when you add to that the element of people using a sedating or incapacitating drug in order to make it more likely that someone could be assaulted, it becomes even a more serious issue,” he said. 
He said the main reason the state does not track drug facilitated sexual assault is that data collection is variable. He said incidents are both medical and legal, so information can be reported to different agencies. State agencies are limited by whether a victim decides to report to authorities and when, and whether substances are detected in their systems. “Sometimes the medical record will include that, and sometimes not. And so the absence of that data doesn’t mean that there’s not still a problem,” he said.  
Homer Police Department Lieutenant Ryan Browning says the department receives calls from the community periodically to report suspected roofying. 
He said they received several calls in September, and one before Halloween weekend. 
“Nothing concrete…and they were all very well after the fact,” Browning said. “And one of them was almost a week later, the other one was several days (later). People reporting that they suspected they were drugged at a bar, just based on how they woke up the next morning… typically it’s, ‘I don’t remember. I was at a bar. I was drunk, and I woke up feeling like I got hit by a truck.’”
When officers notice an uptick, the department will post an alert on the Homer Police Department’s Facebook page. He urged the public to remain aware, look out for friends, take note of suspicious individuals and any unwanted or inappropriate attention, and make a report if necessary.
“I’m a big proponent of ‘you are your first responder,’ right, and keeping yourself protected and safe as much as you can, and looking for signs and things like that when we’re out doing things and having fun,” he said. 
Browning said none of the recent calls resulted in a reported sexual assault in Homer. 
Criminal penalties can vary, Browning said, from criminal mischief charges of intending injury or tampering with food or beverages in an attempt to injure which are felonies. Misconduct involving a controlled substance like GHB is also a felony. 
Sexual violence widespread in Alaska
Sexual violence is widely prevalent in Alaska. According to the 2020 Alaska Victimization Survey, the most recent data for Alaska, roughly 58% of Alaskan women had experienced intimate partner violence, sexual violence or both in their lifetime. 
Current data is limited, but Alaska Native women experience the highest rates of violence and victimization. According to the Indian Law Resource Center, Alaska Native women have reported rates of domestic violence ten times higher than the rest of the United States. 
In 2024, the rate of rape in Alaska was over three times the national average, according to available data by the FBI. That year, the FBI recorded 908 instances of rape statewide, or 122.5 per 100,000 people, compared to 37.3 per 100,000 people in the United States. 
Only about one third of sexual assaults nationally are reported to law enforcement, according to an analysis by RAINN, the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization. That’s due to a variety of reasons, including a fear of retaliation, belief it was a personal matter, or that police would not or could not do anything to help. 
Women are disproportionately harmed by sexual violence, but men and LGBTQ+ populations are assault survivors as well. Most assaults, an estimated 60%, are perpetrated by someone known to the victim, according to RAINN, and 30% by a stranger. 
Advocates offer resources and support, urge public awareness 
Leslie Scroggin is an advocate and shelter manager at South Peninsula Haven House, a domestic violence shelter in Homer, and a member of the regional Sexual Assault Response Team. 
“People typically, consistently seem to feel a sense of guilt over it,” she said. “I’ve heard people say things like it was careless of them to go out after work and to go drinking, or that they should have known better, or that type of thing. And it’s also a pretty disheartening experience, because it’s something that is just completely beyond their control… they don’t even have any sort of capacity to have any control over it.”
Scroggin said while public awareness is important, the larger issue is interrupting and addressing predatory behavior and the crisis of violence against mostly women.
“It’s the individuals that are causing harm that really need to be addressed, and they’re the ones that should be taking responsibility,” she said. “And obviously, we should always do whatever we can to protect ourselves. But that shouldn’t be something that we’re just constantly doing all the time.” 
Scroggin said she has seen a rise in anecdotal reports of roofying in the summer months with increased tourism, but every situation is unique. She said people should seek medical care if they need it, and can make a report anonymously.
“The forensic nurse can do a sexual assault kit anonymously, and basically that just looks like collecting evidence and then putting it into a kit that is assigned a case number, but no one’s name will be attached to it,” she said. “So then they basically will just have that evidence there, and if the person who it got collected on should decide, you know, in three months, or even a couple of years that they would like to report then, then that will be available to them.”
Scroggin said the sooner a victim completes a sexual assault kit after an incident the better, but they have up to a week.
In Valdez, Tina Russell is a direct services coordinator with Advocates for Victims of Violence, Inc. a non-profit advocacy group and domestic violence shelter serving Valdez and the Copper River Basin region.  She said she also notices an uptick in suspected date rape drugging in the summer months with more tourism and the fishing season, but has not seen any confirmed cases. 
She says alcohol-related cases are more typical. “People under the influence of alcohol in a high amount, and then being taken advantage of to where they felt like they really didn’t give consent. And so they’ll come and talk to us about it, and or the hospital will call,” she said.
Russell said their organization is part of an unofficial sexual assault response team at the hospital in Valdez, and advocates, nurses and the local police department have training to respond and provide support to survivors, whether they choose to make an official report or not. “There’s so many different reasons that people don’t report,” she said. “You know, all of our statistics are so under-reported.”
Lawrence, as the chief medical officer, said Alaskans should know the risk, and look out for each other, both to prevent harm and to support people going through these experiences. 
“All of us can be involved in the lives of people in a way that prevents individuals from being alone,” he said. 
“All of us can be there as a neighbor or for someone who has suffered an assault,” he said. “I think that’s one of the most important things for people to have when they’ve suffered rape or sexual assault, is for there to be a caring adult who is there to walk with them through the process. That’s one of the most protective factors afterwards.”

A team of researchers from the University of Connecticut is working to uncover what happened at the controversial institution that used to house disabled people.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Emilia Otte to discuss her article, “UConn grapples with the legacy of a CT institution for the disabled,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Emilia’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Emilia. A professor and a former UConn student sparked your interest in the story. How did that happen?
EO: I was friends with one of the students who worked with Professor Brueggemann on the project around the Mansfield Training School Archives when she was a senior at UConn, and she had contacted me. She’s also a journalist. And she had contacted me, letting me know that Professor Brueggemann might be interested in talking to me. And I found the story just fascinating.
WSHU: What was so fascinating about the story? Because there was a time when institutions like this were top of the news, but it seems to have faded away. Why is it important to keep that memory?
EO: So I’m not from Connecticut. Originally, I’m from New York, and I knew nothing about the Mansfield Training School. So to me, this kind of history tells us so much about how we think about people who are neurodivergent or have disabilities, and how society evolves over time. It tells us a lot about ourselves as human beings and as people. And the interesting thing about this story was that it’s not just a Connecticut story. It’s paralleled all over the country with these institutions, and there are multiple states across the country that have been trying to revive the history of these institutions to understand better what was going on in the past.
WSHU: Could you give us a brief background of the history of the Mansfield school itself? How did it start, and how did it evolve?
EO: So, Dr. Brueggemann would definitely be a better person to talk to than I would about this, but it began with a doctor named Henry Knight in the 1850s, and he had wanted to run this kind of a hospital for people with special needs. He had asked for state support, and did not initially get it, so he funded it himself, and the hospital evolved from there. It did eventually get state support. It became kind of a labor farm in the 1920s where people were living there, but also doing different things like farm work, sewing work, and different industries, basically to fund the institutions. And it evolved over time to become sort of these dormitories for people, where, you know, giant dormitories where people were living with different disabilities. In the 1960s, it allowed UConn to come in and do some experiments there on people, you know, testing brain function and things like that. And as our understanding of the rights of people with disabilities changed, the school tried to become more of a place where people were given small cottages to live, instead of being placed in these big barracks-type rooms, and trying to incorporate people more into the community. There were all kinds of abuses that were exposed in the 1970s, and there was a large court case that happened, which ultimately led to the closing of the school.
WSHU: Now, something interesting that comes out in your story is that Professor Brueggemann and her crew of researchers found much more interesting information outside of the actual archives of the Mansfield school. Could you just tell us a little bit about that?
EO: So I think you’re probably referring to the family members themselves that they talked to. The archives obviously gave them a background on the history itself. Professor Brueggemann also came into contact with some family members who had siblings who were residents of the training school at one time, and I was also able to talk to a couple of those people and hear their stories. And this is another reason, going back to your question about why this is important. It affected families, and it still affects the history of families today who want to understand what their siblings experienced while they were at the training school. And Professor Brueggemann also talked to former employees at the training school who remembered the different iterations of the school as it progressed from being more barracks-like and institutional to a more community-focused type of place, if you can call it that.
WSHU: Now, one interesting thing that I saw when I was reading your article was the fact that there are concerns that develop on that site, that there might be some people buried there, because similar situations happened in other states where institutions like this were redeveloped.
EO: Yeah. So there have been questions about that. As you said, in other states where these institutions have been researched, they have found bodies buried on the property, and there was some question about whether there might be some human remains on the property. During the 1918 flu epidemic, a lot of people died at the institution. As of now, they have not found any evidence that there are bodies buried on the property. But, you know, they haven’t tested the entire property. So I know one of Professor Brueggemann’s students has been looking into this and seeing if there is a possible way to narrow down where human remains might be found on this property, because it’s quite large.
WSHU: What’s happening to the actual site right now?
EO: Nothing, honestly. The site and the buildings are not usable for the most part. They are old and broken down. The site itself has just sort of languished. There’s a piece of it that is being turned into a new Windham Technical High School, but that’s a small area, and there were conversations about turning part of the site into an autonomous vehicle driving race track to supplement the Transportation Center at UConn. But it looks like that will not be going through. So right now, not much is happening with that property.
WSHU: In the meantime, Professor Brueggemann and her crew of researchers are still deeply involved in trying to piece together what has happened.
EO: Yes, Brueggemann wants to do an oral history of the school, and that’s part of the reason she’s talking to family members. They just created a new website about the school with an excellent timeline that I referenced in my reporting. They’ve done a lot of really great work, and I look forward to seeing what else they do.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1028_SR_MTSUConn_190-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 12:03:21.630256

He faces felony forgery charges for his role in developing the 2020 false elector scheme to overturn the election results for Donald Trump. (Screenshot | WisEye)President Donald Trump has pardoned a group of Wisconsin Republicans who participated in his scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election by casting false Electoral College votes. 
The pardons were issued to a large group of people instrumental to Trump’s 2020 effort, including Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell. Included on the list, posted to X Sunday night by Trump’s pardon attorney Ed Martin, are some of the Wisconsin Republicans who cast the fake votes as well as two attorneys and a former aide who were instrumental in planning the effort. 
The pardons are largely symbolic because the president’s authority only extends to federal, not state, crimes. 
Wisconsinites Carol Brunner, Mary Buestrin, Darryl Carlson, Andrew Hitt, Kelly Ruh, Bob Spindell and Pam Travis received pardons. Attorneys Kenneth Chesebro and Jim Troupis, and former Trump aide Mike Roman were also on the list. 
The 10 people who served as false Trump electors had previously settled a lawsuit against them, which included a formal statement that Joe Biden won the 2020 election and an agreement that they would not serve as electors in any election in which Trump was on the ballot. 
Cheseboro, Troupis and Roman are all facing felony charges in Wisconsin for their role in planning the false elector plot. 
Sen. Ron Johnson, whose office played a part in the scheme by trying to pass the fake Electoral College ballots to then-Vice President Mike Pence, celebrated the pardons. 
“Thank you [Trump] and [Martin] for issuing these well-deserved pardons. It’s well past time for [Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul] to end his corrupt lawfare against a good and honorable man, Judge James Troupis,” Johnson wrote on X. 
While the pardons won’t have any effect on the state prosecutions, critics said the real effect is Trump creating a permission structure for his allies to undermine U.S. election results. Jeff Mandell, general counsel of Law Forward, the progressive voting rights focused firm that filed the lawsuit against Wisconsin’s 10 false electors, called the pardons “offensive” and said they invite attacks on democracy.
“Many are dismissing these pardons as merely symbolic. That misses the point,” Mandell said in a statement. “While the pardon has little immediate effect, its purpose is emblematic: it sends an unmistakable message that this White House disdains democracy and will assist, in word and in deed, any effort, no matter how extreme and outrageous, to cling to power regardless of election results.”

(Getty Images)The United States Supreme Court has declined to revisit the 2015 landmark ruling that gave same-sex couples marriage equality, a failure for former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis. 
Davis made national headlines in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses to several same-sex couples based on her religious beliefs. With the help of conservative legal firm Liberty Counsel, Davis has tried to avoid paying $100,000 as ordered by a federal jury to one of the couples she refused, David Ermold and David Moore. She ultimately tried to use that appeal to challenge Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that required states to license same-sex marriages. 
The nation’s highest court on Monday said it will not hear the challenge.  
Mat Staver, Liberty Counsel’s founder and chairman who represents Davis, said he “will continue to work to overturn Obergefell.” 
“Davis was jailed, hauled before a jury, and now faces crippling monetary damages based on nothing more than purported hurt feelings,” Staver said. “By denying this petition, the High Court has let stand a decision to strip a government defendant of their immunity and any personal First Amendment defense for their religious expression.”

Kevin Jennings, the CEO of Lambda Legal, a pro-LGBTQ+ advocacy law firm, called the case “frivolous” in celebrating its defeat. 
“This is a victory not only for the LGBTQ+ community, but for everyone who believes in our Constitution and the rule of law. The court’s decision reaffirms a simple fact: equal protection of the law applies to all, not just some,” Jennings said in a statement. “This frivolous case now belongs in the trash bin of history.” 
Jenny Pizer, Lambda Legal’s senior director of strategic initiatives said the decision to not hear the case by the Supreme Court “rightly leaves marriage equality crystal clear and undisturbed.”
Pizer said LGBTQ+ people and their families “still need vigilance and protection,” though. 
“We secured the freedom to marry for same-sex couples over a decade ago in our landmark 2015 Supreme Court victory, Obergefell v. Hodges, thanks to the powerful stories of thousands of couples and their families throughout the country, including in our many court cases,” Pizer said. “The fundamental rights of liberty and equal protection that the court affirmed back then remain essential for all American families today.”

Payments for SNAP, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, have been stalled in November as part of the federal government shutdown and ensuing legal action.
More than 77,000 Montanans receive the benefit, according to the state Department of Public Health and Human Services.
Rep. Mary Caferro, D-Helena, said she and Rep. Mary Ann Dunwell, D-East Helena, secured 31 Democratic legislators, one more than needed, to petition for a poll for a special session on Dec. 15.
Caferro said they plan to turn in the petition to the Secretary of State if full funding looks unlikely, although she said the state can’t wait long because the matter is urgent.
Early Monday, a spokesperson for Republican leadership in the House had not yet received copy of the petition, and a spokesperson for GOP leadership in the Senate could not be immediately reached.
Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican, has said he will not support using state funds for a federal program.
Sunday, the U.S. Senate advanced legislation to reopen the government, and the legislation includes funding for SNAP. It requires support from the U.S. House.
Caferro said it’s responsible to see how the legislation proceeds before submitting the petition, but the matter is urgent, and the Trump administration is unpredictable.
“Montanans are struggling to put food on the table, and our state government cannot stand by while families go hungry because of delayed or inadequate SNAP funding,” Caferro said in a statement.”
She said she sat with a single father the other day, and his little boy came to the table and asked for something to eat.
“The dad made him a lettuce sandwich,” Caferro said.
A successful poll would require a majority of the Montana Legislature, or 76, to agree to a special session. The legislature is made up of 60 Democrats and 90 Republicans.
An announcement from Caferro and Dunwell said Montana is among 14 states that have not taken action as a result of stalled SNAP payments.
Montanans have been “left with empty grocery bags and nearly 800 Montana retailers began to feel the pinch as SNAP benefits were discontinued by the federal administration,” the announcement said.
It said 63% of SNAP participants in Montana are families with children, 33% include seniors or people with disabilities, and 43% are working families.
In a statement, Rep. Josh Seckinger, a Bozeman Democrat, also said it’s important for the state to act.
“We all have to ask ourselves: Is this what I voted for?” Seckinger said. “A government that turns its back on hungry families and calls that fiscal responsibility? What happened to compassionate conservatism?”
In response to whether a successful poll is realistic, Caferro said she considers the reality of her constituents. She said the issue is a moral one, not a partisan one.
“I am 100% recognizing that the reality for people who depend on SNAP to eat and feed their children is that they’re letting other bills go,” Caferro said. “That’s what you do. ‘Do I pay this? Do I pay that? What’s most important?’
“You have to feed your kids. And it all is just a downward spiral. This can cause a downward spiral, and they don’t have far to go.”
The session would become void if the federal government fully funds SNAP, according to the language in the petition.
In Montana, DPHHS said last week it was in the midst of calculating benefits based on guidance to issue partial benefits from the federal government.
A federal court subsequently ordered full benefits restored, but the U.S. Supreme Court paused that decision on Friday after President Donald Trump appealed it.
A memo Saturday from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service, which runs SNAP, said states should fund 65% of the benefit.
Monday morning, DPHHS had guidance from Friday on its website, which said the state “may receive additional direction,” but it was working to make benefits available on electronic benefit cards this week.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/produce-usda-image-1024x678-1.jpg,,,2025-11-10 12:03:21.630256

(Photo by Willowpix/iStock Getty Images Plus)Not only are low-income Ohioans facing disruption of federal food help as the Trump administration thus far refused to release it. With nighttime temperatures dipping into the 30s, the future of federal energy assistance is in doubt as well.
Because of the Oct. 1 government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services hasn’t received 2026 funding for the program known as the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. 
Ohio isn’t among the states such as Pennsylvania that have told clients that the start of assistance will be delayed as cold weather sets in. 
The program last year spent $43 million assisting 246,000 clients in Ohio, according to the state Department of Development, which administers it.
The department is using leftover funds to underwrite the program, said Mason Waldvogel, a spokesman.
“Ohio’s HEAP Winter Crisis Program opened as scheduled on November 1, and our local energy assistance providers are currently helping eligible Ohioans statewide,” Waldvogel said in an email Friday. 
“The Department of Development is funding the program with no additional state dollars, using available carry-over funds from the previous program year to ensure services continue without disruption.” 
He added, “We remain committed to ensuring Ohioans have access to the energy assistance they rely on throughout the winter season and will continue to monitor funding availability.”
He didn’t immediately respond, however, when asked how long the department could support the program in the absence of additional federal funds.
Over the weekend, the U.S. Senate advanced a bill to end record-breaking government shutdown, but the shutdown is ongoing until a spending bill is passed by both chambers.
US Senate advances bill to end record-breaking government shutdown

As the thermometer dips and power bills spike, federal funds will become increasingly crucial. 
Molly Bryden, who has studied the energy assistance program for Policy Matters Ohio, said the program is especially important for the most vulnerable.
“Energy assistance can be lifesaving for older Ohioans, families with young children, and Ohioans with a disability, who disproportionately face high energy burdens,” she wrote in an April policy paper. 
“Older populations and children under two are acutely vulnerable to unsafe indoor heating, which accounts for an estimated 45% of heat-related deaths in the U.S. over the past 20 years.“
She added that to maintain utility service, people often turn to dangerous alternatives to heat their homes. 
“During colder months, households may live in uncomfortable, unsafe conditions or use secondary heating equipment – like stoves, ovens, or space heaters – to lower their energy use, increasing exposure to toxic indoor air pollutants,” Bryden wrote. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In an interview last week, she said it’s been hard to figure out what’s next for the program.
“Obviously, LIHEAP funding is wrapped up in that whole appropriations package that is part of the government shutdown, so there’s a lot of uncertainty around what’s going to happen in the next fiscal year,” Bryden said. 
“I’ve been having a hard time finding out what is happening moving forward.”
Even aside from the shutdown, the future of the program seems cloudy.
President Donald Trump thus far has refused to fund nutrition assistance for 42 million Americans — and 1.45 million Ohioans — even though a federal judge has ordered him to. 
On Thursday, the judge accused Trump of playing politics with a program that stands between masses of Americans and hunger.
Trump had already demonstrated hostility toward the anti-hunger program. 
His One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed last summer cut it by $186 billion over the next 10 years. 
So it’s perhaps unsurprising that he’s used the shutdown as a reason for not funding it — even though previous administrations did in all earlier shutdowns.
The nutrition cuts come in addition to a cut of nearly $1 trillion to Medicaid — the health program for the poor — over the same period.  
Trump zeroed out energy-assistance funding in his proposed budget. 
And because he fired all the federal employees in charge of administering it, there are fears that restarting the program will be delayed once the shutdown ends.
Bryden said all these are working against the most vulnerable Ohioans.
“All of the attempts to dismantle the public-assistance landscape at the federal level is really sowing a lot of uncertainties for Ohio families just trying to put food on the table,” she said.

The Senate’s key procedural vote late Sunday capped off a weekend scramble to put a deal in motion and move to the beginning stages of ending the 41-day shutdown. More than a dozen previous votes failed over the past month, but enough Democrats changed their vote after a series of negotiations to break the impasse. 
Eight Democrats joined all Republicans in a 60-40 vote Sunday night to help clear the 60-vote threshold needed to advance bills in the Senate.
But like the majority of their Democratic colleagues, U.S. Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal still rejected the deal because it didn’t go far enough on the Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire at the end of the year. The deal, among other things, ultimately promised a vote in the Senate next month on extending the subsidies, but there is no guarantee it passes, and House GOP leadership hasn’t committed to a vote in the lower chamber.
Democrats, like Murphy and Blumenthal, argued last week’s electoral victories gave them a mandate to keep pushing for the extension of health care subsidies as part of a package to fund the government and to not relent in negotiations. If the enhanced premium subsidies expire at the end of the year with no congressional action, those enrolled in plans through the state’s health care exchange, Access Health CT, are expected to see their premiums for 2026 plans increase.
On the health care front, Democrats weren’t offered anything new. The promise of a vote on the expiring subsidies was offered by Senate GOP leadership weeks earlier as a way out of the shutdown. The deal says Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., will set up a vote by the second week of December. That leaves little time for Congress to address it.
The vast majority of Senate Democrats are disappointed by the outcome. The fate of the enhanced premium subsidies is still up in the air. Plus, their push to ensure that the Trump administration doesn’t keep rescinding federal funding approved by Congress went nowhere and wasn’t included in the final agreement. Because of that, the Democratic base is likely to be frustrated after the party extracted few concessions.
“People know the government shutdown hurts. But people also know that Americans will die when millions cannot afford health insurance next year because of Trump’s massive premium hikes. They wanted us to continue that fight, even knowing that victory was not certain,” Murphy said in a statement. “They did not want this outcome.”
“I understand my colleagues’ desire to fund the government. What Trump has put people through these last few weeks is abhorrent. Of course I want to end the shutdown too. But not at any cost,” Murphy said. “There is no way to sugarcoat this moment. It will have a cost. But it is up to us to keep the fight going.”
“My position has always been: no affordable health care, no deal. I am unwilling to accept a vague promise for a vote at an indefinite time on an indeterminate bill,” Blumenthal said in a statement. “Millions of Americans and tens of thousands in Connecticut are forced to make impossible choices right now about what health insurance they can afford.”
In addition to a vote on ACA subsidies, the Senate deal also included three full-year funding bills plus short-term funding for the rest of the government through Jan. 31. The original date of the short-term bill only funded agencies through Nov. 21. It would also guarantee back pay for furloughed federal workers — a requirement of a 2019 law, though President Donald Trump had suggested they might not get paid. And the bill would also reverse layoffs during the shutdown, which were on hold by federal court.
Pressure was building for a resolution, ultimately leading to the negotiations involving a handful of Senate Democrats. Federal nutrition aid is still in limbo after the Trump administration gave mixed messaging on funding November SNAP benefits and states like Connecticut started to fill in the gaps. On top of that, multiple major airports started to cut the number of flights amid ongoing delays and cancellations. And federal workers — both furloughed and essential — continue to miss more paychecks.
“I’m looking forward to seeing what solutions might be brought forward [on health care]. Regardless, as I have said for weeks to my Democrat friends, I will schedule a vote on their proposal. And I have committee to having that vote no later than the second weekend in December,” Thune, the Senate GOP leader, said minutes before the vote. “I’m optimistic that after six weeks of this shutdown, we’ll be able to end it.
The Connecticut senators’ opposition was consistent to what they’ve been saying throughout the 41-day shutdown: they won’t accept loose promises on health care. And both parties looked like they were digging in further after Tuesday’s elections.
Democrats believed voters were rewarding them for fighting for health care even if that meant the government remained in a shutdown. Trump even said the shutdown was partly to blame for Republicans’ losses.
But it still didn’t look like Trump wanted to enter negotiations with Democrats. He pushed for Republicans to get rid of the filibuster — the 60-vote threshold needed to advance bills in the Senate — but GOP leadership said the votes weren’t there to ax that procedure.
Because of that, some Democrats started to budge, saying that the length of the shutdown ultimately moved the needle for them. And when asked why they backed down on their key demand after weeks of trying, U.S. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, said “because it wasn’t working.”
“It’s been six weeks. Republicans made it clear they weren’t going to discuss the health care issue … until the shutdown was over. We tried to keep working that for six weeks. It didn’t happen,” King said. “There’s a lot better chance now than there was this morning because nothing was happening and there was no evidence that another week or another two weeks or Thanksgiving or Christmas” would have changed Republicans mind on the health care subsidies.
What will happen in the House?
With final passage in the Senate imminent, all eyes move to the House next: will the vote be bipartisan or will Democrats try to force Republicans to come up with most or all of the votes? They only need a simple majority to pass legislation, but a slim majority for Republicans means there’s little room for error and the need for a united front without help from Democrats.
Some moderate Democrats appear open to supporting the Senate shutdown deal, but most so far are publicly opposed to supporting it. Since the key vote on Sunday, most of Connecticut’s House delegation has yet to weigh in on the new legislation and where they stand on it. The five Democrats, like their Senate colleagues, have said they wanted the extension of health care subsidies as part of a funding package.
U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who serves as the ranking member on the House Appropriations Committee, criticized Republicans for releasing the text of one of the full-year bills on Sunday before getting the support of Democrats in the House.
“While the Military Construction bill is better than the full-year CR those programs were funded under for 2025, it is important to place it in the context of the entire legislative package that will be considered,” DeLauro said. “Congress must invest in veterans, address the health care crisis that is raising costs on more than 20 million Americans and prevent President Trump from not spending appropriated dollars in our communities.”
The timeline for ending the shutdown is still up in the air, though it’s possible the lengthy process can wrap up later this week.
The Senate still needs to move to final passage of the bill, which only requires a simple majority. It’s possible senators can finish their part of the process by the end of Monday, but that would require agreements to quickly move things forward.
Then the House would need to come back into session to vote and complete the work of Congress. The lower chamber has been out since late September, but members will get 36 hours’ notice to return to Washington, D.C., when it’s time to vote.
If the bill passes the House, it will then move to Trump for the final step. And if he signs it, the shutdown will come to an end. The federal workforce would return to work and expect to receive back pay.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25309667831751-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 12:03:21.630256

“I will see them again for their subsequent pregnancy, and they still have hepatitis C, and their first baby may be infected with hepatitis C, and their second baby is born with that risk as well,” said Kelly, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology and director of the division of maternal-fetal medicine and ultrasound. “It’s this problem that just keeps propagating.”
A number of legislative solutions, as well as the increased use of telemedicine during the pandemic, paved the way to broader access to medication, but the process of referring pregnant and postpartum patients out to other offices continued to be a “failing strategy,” Kelly said.
That’s where the new “meds to beds” program at Barnes-Jewish Hospital came in, dispensing medication to women before they are discharged after giving birth. 
“There is a cure for hepatitis C that not only would protect the mom and the family and future children from infection,” Kelly said, ”but also prevent more conditions for mom down the road, including things like cancer and liver failure, a really huge big deal, both on the family and on the health care system.”
A study of this new clinical program developed by Washington University researchers found that when an infectious disease specialist visited a patient in labor and delivery, and then sent them home with the prescribed antiviral medication, women were twice as likely to be cured of Hepatitis C than women who were referred to an outpatient appointment to obtain their medication.
“They’ve got a virus. I’ve got antiviral,” said Dr. Laura Marks, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Washington University School of Medicine and an author on the study. “We’re a match made in heaven.”
 What is Hepatitis C?

Hepatitis C is a virus that can cause extensive liver damage, including cancer, if left untreated. It’s transmitted through blood. In rare cases, it can also be transmitted to the baby.
Between 2010 and 2021, the number of Americans of reproductive age infected with Hepatitis C more than tripled, according to one CDC study. As a result, the number of infections discovered during pregnancy increased tenfold from 2000 to 2019. 
About 5% of babies exposed to Hepatitis C during delivery become infected, according to the CDC, which began recommending Hepatitis C screenings for pregnant women beginning in 2020. 
Treatment options are available for both the mother and baby, but getting treatment to postpartum mothers proved difficult despite increased attention on testing and access to medication.
In 2021, Missouri became one of several states to allow Medicaid to cover Hepatitis C treatment without a prior authorization, letting doctors to prescribe patients all of their medication at once so they don’t have to navigate getting a refill halfway through. The medication is usually taken over the course of two to three months.
Until recently, Missouri only required medical providers to test women for Hepatitis C at their first prenatal appointment. Driven in part by rising STD rates in pregnant patients, a bill signed into law earlier this year added testing in the third trimester and immediately after birth.
The new screening recommendations have been helpful in identifying infections earlier, but that alone wasn’t enough, Marks said. 
Unlike other infections, like syphilis, treatment can only begin after the woman has given birth because the antiviral can harm the pregnancy.
Up until recently, once a woman with a known Hepatitis C infection delivered a baby, she would receive a referral to a clinic to see an infectious disease specialist, like Marks, to see soon after being discharged from the hospital. 
“But that usually meant sometime during the postpartum period, or often even further away,” Marks said. “That’s sometimes a really big lift for women to be doing all of these extra appointments during what could be a really chaotic time.” 
Women of childbearing age make up about one-fifth of people with chronic hepatitis C globally. Getting a cure can be even more difficult when the woman is navigating life with a newborn, Kelly said.
In 2021, Marks sent out a survey to obstetricians asking how the infectious diseases department could better help. She received half a dozen responses saying while the increased use of telehealth appointments was great for connecting their patients with specialists, they still needed help getting medication in the hands of their patients.   
“It was that light bulb moment,” Marks said.
Her team began testing out prescribing antivirals to women before they were discharged from labor and delivery.
Marks and Dr. Madeline McCrary, also an assistant professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Washington University School of Medicine, analyzed medical records of 149 mothers who tested positive for Hepatitis C and who delivered babies at Barnes-Jewish Hospital between January 2020 and September 2023. 
Some were discharged with a referral, and others were discharged with medication, depending on whether an infectious disease specialist was available to visit them on the labor and delivery floor at the time. 
They found that two-thirds of patients who received medication at the hospital took their full prescription of antiviral medication and were cured. Only about one-third of those who received referrals finished their medication. 
 ‘Meds to beds’

While the “meds to beds” solution may sound obvious to those not practicing medicine, the reason it took years to reach the solution is complex.
First, there can be a reluctance among non-OBs to treat obstetric patients, Kelly said.
“They’re not used to taking care of pregnant women,” she said. “A lot of other specialists have anxiety about prescribing medications that they’re not sure about the effects during pregnancy.”
And American health care remains very siloed. This is especially pronounced for OB patients faced with navigating several steps to get treatment. And at every additional step, more patients fall off, Kelly said.
It’s why she’s been grateful for the eagerness specialists like Marks have shown to meet pregnant women where they are, especially because for many of her patients, who typically are younger and overall healthy, pregnancy is the first time they’ve seen a doctor in years. 
Losing SNAP could mean more pregnancy complications as food insecurity grows

Kelly said the results have been encouraging and empowering to her patients, many of whom have a history of substance use or sex work, and who often carry some amount of distrust in the medical system.
“It’s a huge strategy to engage with patients who have had horrible experiences with the medical system in the past,” Kelly said. “Multiple patients have told me ‘this is so powerful. I know that I’m not just doing this for myself, but for my family and my future kids as well.’ So it’s been more than just a cure of Hepatitis C. It’s a lifeline for patients to find trust and a relationship with the healthcare system.”
In 2023, because of the project’s success in the obstetrics department, the doctors have since expanded the program to other parts of the hospital. Whether someone comes in for chest pain or because they were in a car crash, for example, they are tested for Hepatitis C and handed the medication on the spot. 
So far they’ve treated 250 more patients through the expanded effort, and they’ve started hearing from other hospitals around the country hoping to implement the same changes.
Every time another one of Kelly’s patients is cured, Marks’ team emails her to tell her the good news. Lately the emails are coming more and more frequently.
“It’s life changing for mom and family right, to have this disease eradicated,” Kelly said. “ … This is why we come to work in the morning, no matter how hard it gets.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pregnant-woman-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-10 12:03:21.630256

A cancer patient might live in a town with four oncology groups, but only one accepts his insurance — the one owned by his insurer. A young couple could see huge bills after their child is born because their insurer agreed to the health system’s rates in exchange for a contract with obstetricians across the country. A woman might have to pay a big sum she can’t afford for basic lab tests at a hospital — inflated rates her insurer accepted so its customers have access to the system’s children’s hospital elsewhere in the state.
And even well-insured patients receive unaffordable bills in this era of high-deductible health plans, narrow insurance networks, and 20% cost sharing.
Health systems, doctor groups and insurers are merging and coalescing into ever-bigger giants. While these mergers are good for business, studies show the escalating consolidation in health care is driving up prices, harming patient outcomes and decreasing choice for people who need care. A recent study found that six years after hospitals acquired other hospitals, they had raised prices by 12.9%, with hospitals that engaged in multiple acquisitions raising their prices by 16.3%.
These new deals are “mutually enforced monopolization,” said Barak Richman, the Alexander Hamilton professor of business law at George Washington University. “It’s not competition. It’s more like collusion. They don’t care about price.”

Those market factors contributed to a landscape where a dose of the antiviral Paxlovid given in a hospital costs $4,500; magnetic resonance imaging costs $15,000; and joint replacements cost $100,000.
President Donald Trump has talked about the burden of health care costs since his first campaign, but he has signaled that his administration’s regulators are less inclined than his predecessor’s to intervene in health mergers.
This summer, he revoked President Joe Biden’s 2021 directive that all federal agencies make sure markets remain competitive, reversing course from Biden’s more expansive interpretation of antitrust law. And in a scathing statement upon taking over the Federal Trade Commission, Trump-appointed chair Andrew Ferguson blasted his predecessor, Lina Khan, implying that she had overstepped the agency’s legal authority, as well as criticizing what he called her “clumsy” and “breathless” rhetoric and her focus on the incursion of private equity into health care.
What this will mean in practice is unclear.
In an interview with KFF Health News, Daniel Guarnera, the director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, said that the leadership at the FTC and the Justice Department has endorsed guidelines issued by the Biden administration, which he characterized as a “framing device” for companies contemplating a merger.
The ‘hard, slow work’ of reducing overdose deaths is having an effect

The expanded merger guidelines, issued in 2023, focused for the first time on a wide variety of new types of anti-competitive practices that had become common in health care, such as hospitals and private equity firms buying doctors’ practices and insurers owning what are known as specialty pharmacies to dispense complicated and often expensive drugs.
Guarnera noted that regulators’ strongest enforcement tool is convincing a judge that mergers violate the Clayton Antitrust Act, a statute that is the foundation of antitrust law. But administrations can interpret this statute differently, and it’s unclear what cases the Trump administration’s FTC will choose to bring.
“The Biden administration tried to be more innovative,” said Erin Fuse Brown, a professor of health services, policy, and practice at Brown University’s School of Public Health. “The Trump administration has signaled a more traditional approach — that it’s unwilling to push the envelope.”
In the battle for profits between insurers and providers, each side insists it needs to grow bigger to hold sway in the negotiations that determine health care prices. But evidence shows the prices that make sense in industry-level dealmaking have little to do with the actual value of the services involved. Instead, they’re merely a data point in large-scale calculations that, at best, reflect the power balance between opposing parties.
Under Trump, the FTC has already sued to block two mergers of medical-device makers and has continued the Biden administration’s challenges of individual drug patents.
“Helping improve the health care system though ensuring that there is more and better competition are very, very high priorities for us at the FTC,” Guarnera said, noting that health care has “enormous effects on both Americans’ pocketbooks as well as well-being.”
But it is far more difficult to take on the more massive entities, and though the number of new mergers dipped early this year as companies navigated the uncertain effects of tariffs and interest rates, consolidation continues.
A recent Becker’s Hospital Review article identified “28 large health systems growing bigger,” noting, “This is not an exhaustive list.”
Dozens of states tackle high prescription drug costs

For example, in May, Northwell Health of New York merged with Connecticut’s Nuvance to become a 28-hospital behemoth with over 1,000 outpatient clinics. That was a more traditional merger, where hospitals in the same region joined to extend their reach and increase their market power.
Meanwhile, companies are creating powerhouses not previously seen in health care, by racking up smaller purchases that aren’t expensive enough to trigger federal review. They include what are known as vertical mergers, which combine companies that provide different functions in the same industry — most commonly, hospital systems or insurers buying doctors’ practices or specialty pharmacies.
For instance, UnitedHealth Group, the world’s largest health care company, now owns health insurance plans; physician practices and other providers; data and analytics services; payment processors; a pharmacy benefits manager; and pharmacies themselves. Jonathan Kanter, the competition czar in Biden’s Justice Department, has likened the UnitedHealth amalgamation to Amazon.
Likewise, hospital systems and private companies — often private equity firms — are increasingly expanding their reach to different regions, gobbling up hospitals, medical practices, and surgery centers. This kind of consolidation, known as a cross-market merger, allows companies to accumulate huge collections of doctors — and significant market power — across the country in particular specialties, such as gastroenterology, ophthalmology, pediatrics, or obstetrics.
Research shows a change in ownership means a change in prices. While pediatrics and obstetrics have traditionally been poorly paid specialties, for instance, they represent a land of opportunity to investors because parents are willing to pay more when it comes to care for their kids.
It used to be relatively simple for regulators to discern when a hospital that merged with its nearby competitor gained monopoly power, rendering it anti-competitive and driving up prices. Health researchers say these new, more complicated types of deals, creating a more complex interplay between insurers and medical providers, have made that tipping point much harder to define.
In health care, even more traditional, vertical consolidation can be problematic, Richman said. “Economic theory says it could be innocuous, like a suit manufacturer opening a store, even though studies show in health care it’s dangerous — higher prices, poorer quality, less choice,” he said.
For example, patients who have Cigna health plans and need an array of more expensive, often injectable prescriptions must use Accredo, the specialty pharmacy the insurer bought in 2018, even though a different pharmacy may have a better price.
Economists have developed computer modeling to predict when patients will experience higher prices and less choice because of these new types of consolidation. But judges who could nix the transactions are so far “not convinced,” said Daniel Arnold, a health economist at Brown’s School of Public Health.
Experts such as Fuse Brown say new laws and enforcement tools are needed.
“The old laws,” she said, “are just not calibrated to the complexity and novel types of mergers.”

(Courtesy photo from Lisa Demuth's campaign for governor)House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, announced Monday that attorney Ryan Wilson will be her running mate in her bid for Minnesota governor next year.
Wilson narrowly lost his campaign for state auditor in 2022 and has long been involved in the conservative legal movement in Minnesota as a constitutional lawyer.
“It’s time for some accountability in the highest level of our government, and Ryan Wilson is the one that will help me deliver that accountability,” Demuth said in a statement.
Wilson is an attorney at the firm CrossCastle, which represented House Republicans earlier this year after House Democrats brought a lawsuit over control of the chamber. House GOP floor leader Harry Niska also works at the firm.
Wilson is the founder and a former CEO of Symbios Clinical, a medical device company based in Blaine. Wilson in 2020 joined Lawyers for Trump as a volunteer poll watcher on Election Day.
Demuth launched her campaign for governor last week, joining a growing field of GOP candidates who are seeking to beat Gov. Tim Walz in next year’s election, including GOP Rep. Kristin Robbins; 2022 GOP nominee for governor Scott Jensen; and Kendall Qualls, an army veteran and health care executive.
“I am honored that speaker Demuth has asked me to serve as her running mate in this pivotal election to send Tim Walz into retirement,” Wilson said in a statement. “Lisa is a proven fighter and leader. She’s the only candidate in this race who has stood up to Walz, stared him down and won.” 
Demuth and lieutenant governor candidate Wilson will begin a statewide campaign tour later this week, and the duo are expected to hold a press conference on Monday.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)In South Carolina, roughly 550,000 people in more than 260,000 households relied on benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Association Program last month to help them put food on the table, according to the state Department of Social Services.
To qualify for SNAP, a household’s monthly income can’t exceed 130% of the federal poverty level.
There are many more folks in our state who may not qualify for SNAP benefits but still need help. Many former federal employees are still looking for work after being terminated. And employees furloughed amid the government shutdown may need assistance for the first time.
Here are a few suggestions about how to keep putting food on the table as uncertainties continue.
The federal Emergency Food Assistance Program allows households with income up to 150% of the federal poverty level to receive groceries through local food banks. You can access assistance in South Carolina by visiting GetCareSC. You can also dial 211 or text “help” to 211-211, which will connect you to local food pantries, meal programs and other food support.
Local farmers’ markets often distribute surplus produce and partner with SNAP outreach programs through the South Carolina Department of Social Services’ Healthy Bucks program.
Suggestions by AARP for reining in grocery costs include buying in bulk and freezing what you won’t use right away and making “soup your secret weapon.” Look for grocery stores that offer senior discounts, like Harris Teeter, which offers 5% off on Thursdays for shoppers 60 and older. Some Publix stores in South Carolina offer a discount for shoppers over 60. Ask about it at your local store. And look for discount coupons for the items on your grocery list.
If you’re fortunate in not being affected by federal cuts or the shutdown, please consider helping your fellow South Carolinians.
Options include donating to the One SC Fund, the state’s emergency relief fund that was activated Oct. 28. Its first distribution to food banks was last week.
The South Carolina Department of Veterans Affairs is again partnering with Harvest Hope Food Bank for the fourth annual Thanksgiving food drive, which continues through Friday, Nov. 21. This year’s drive will provide assistance to veterans as well as other South Carolinians impacted by the record-breaking shutdown. For those who wish to donate, there’s a list of “most needed items” on the agency’s website. There’s also a list of four drop-off locations for non-perishable food items:

Harvest Hope Upstate, 2818 White Horse Road, Greenville
Harvest Hope Midlands, 2220 Shop Road, Columbia
Department of Veterans Affairs, 1800 St. Julian Place, Suite 305, Columbia
Harvest Hope Pee Dee, 2701 Alex Lee Boulevard, Florence

Financial contributions are also being accepted to help purchase food for the drive.
According to Harvest Hope, one in eight South Carolinians were already struggling with hunger before the shutdown.
This upcoming holiday season is the perfect time to help our fellow South Carolinians who are struggling with food insecurity for whatever reason.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_0408-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 11:03:40.957563

Aug. 8, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceMike Rogers, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate who is seeking to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Gary Peters in 2026, brought election denialism in Michigan to new heights last month when he claimed, without evidence, that a van showed up carrying ballots at a Detroit counting location to swing the election against him.
Official election results, and a subsequent standard audit, show Rogers was defeated by now-U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin in 2024, who won by a slim margin but won all the same.
Rogers made the remarks in a speech he delivered last month in Muskegon, The Detroit News reported Sunday after reviewing two videos of the late October speech, and another given earlier in the month at a separate event.
Notably, Rogers’ comments come a full year after the dust settled on the election that took place in November 2024. Rogers made no initial claims of fraud or wrongdoing immediately following that election, in which he quickly conceded his loss. Regardless, Rogers now claims that it was stolen from him much like Republicans claimed, again, without evidence, that the 2020 election was stolen from current President Donald Trump when he lost handily to former President Joe Biden.
By a whisker, Slotkin keeps Michigan’s U.S. Senate seat in Democratic hands

Rogers said in Muskegon on Oct. 17 that a van in Detroit showed up in the very early morning after the election with ballots, and noted the election was lost by some 17,000 votes.
As The Detroit News notes, Rogers conceded his race shortly after results showed that Slotkin would win the day. The reality of that election now runs counter to Rogers’ new claims.
A request for comment to Rogers’ campaign for comment has yet to be returned.

Rogers apparently also made the claim at an event earlier in October, as well, marking two times now that the candidate has told Republican voters and donors in Michigan that he believes, without evidence, that the election should have swung in his favor.
While Slotkin’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, all three Democrats seeking to run for the open seat next year were clear in denouncing Rogers’ claims.
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), one of the three vying to be Rogers’ Democratic opponent in the Senate race next fall, took to X to call him out.
“The 2024 election wasn’t stolen,” Stevens wrote. “Mike, you lost fair and square last year and you’ll lose again next year.”
State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), who is also seeking the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat, wrote on X that, “just like Donald Trump, when Mike Rogers loses, he claims it must be rigged.”
“Michigan deserves better,” McMorrow said.
Abdul E-Sayed, another contender in the Democratic nomination hunt for the seat, also called Rogers onto the carpet over his new claims.
“Or … maybe you just lost because you voted to raise Rx drug costs 60 times when you were in Congress,” El-Sayed wrote on X. “Or because you retired to Florida to be a Pharma lobbyist. Or because you smile like everyone else frowns.”

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — When Sarah Bell became the director of the Kansas Museum of History in 2022 in the midst of a campaign to reimagine the museum’s gallery space, she focused her attention on a singular question.
What is Kansas?
She recalled on the Kansas Reflector podcast the day she sat down and began writing the question and answers, which would shape renovations at the 20,000-square-foot museum on the west edge of Topeka. She thought of sunflowers, tornados, the Dust Bowl, Bleeding Kansas, and the Wild West. She also thought about the stories of everyday people who led societal reforms, often with national implications, from the temperance movement to women’s suffrage to civil rights.
“You can look at any element of Kansas history, and you can see these everyday people fighting for their beliefs, pushing for those changes, making a home, coming up with all of these industries and ideas, and it’s like, that’s what we’re doing, that’s the core of this museum,” Bell said. “And so that was where I started to come up with this idea of, ‘What is Kansas?’ ”


The museum, which has been closed for three years, will reopen Nov. 22 with free admission, food trucks, music and special guests.
The new gallery space asks: What is Kansas? What was Kansas? and Why Kansas?
“We provide some answers, we provide some ideas, but these are reflective questions,” Bell said. “We want people to also be thinking about, what is this to me? What is Kansas to me? And that there’s an answer that they may have when they walk in, and there might be a different answer when they leave, and that’s OK.”
The gallery’s artifacts, including some that were never displayed before, are organized around four themes: bleeding, making, connecting and changing.

The old favorites remain.
“People have asked me, ‘Is the train still there?’ And I say, ‘I don’t know where it would go.’ It is still there,” Bell said.
The “beloved artifact,” she added, is “looking shinier and cleaner than ever.”
A new, large ramp leads visitors to an overlook.
At the top: “You come face to face with what I believe is one of our most significant artifacts that was often lost up in the rafters, this 1914 Longren biplane,” Bell said.
A new overlook platform at the Kansas Museum of History gives visitors an up-close view of the 1914 Longren biplane, which previously “was often lost up in the rafters,” says museum director Sarah Bell. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
“And getting to see such a close look at this really makes you appreciate how far we’ve come with air travel today, and the courage it took those early aviators to go up in that,” Bell added.
The overlook platform also allows visitors to see the second floor of a log cabin, which has been a fixture in the museum since it opened in 1984.

William Allen White’s printing press from the Emporia Gazette now anchors the Changing Kansas section, alongside a floor-to-ceiling screen that displays important newspaper clips from the state’s history.
One of Bell’s favorite exhibits is a 1955 Ford grain truck.
She said it became clear from discussions with staff that the truck represents community. The cycle of harvest and planting “defines Kansas in every part of the state,” she said. Staff members recalled the image of grain trucks at harvest time getting ready to offload grain at silos.
There were “different staff members saying, I remember riding in that truck with my grandpa, getting to ride in and getting lifted up and in,” Bell said.
“All of these stories kept coming up,” she added. “And so we decided that this was one of those emotional connection stories, where people would see this and say, either, one, I have that truck, or either I did, or I remember my grandpa having a truck like that, or, well, this is a Ford, we had a Chevy, or whatever it was, but that those connections would be instant.”
Plus, she added, “it’s also just a really cute red truck.”

Some of the exhibits feature input from contemporary Kansas icons: Photos from Jim Richardson, narration by filmmaker Kevin Willmott and singer Martina McBride, and a new mural from artist Stan Herd.
The museum raised $6 million in private capital to pay for the renovation. Dimensional Innovations, an Overland Park design firm, handled the design and installation. Museum staff handled the work of removing artifacts, tearing down walls and removing carpet when the gallery closed three years ago.
Now, Bell said, people are going to see “a completely new space” when they walk through the doors.
“It’s going to be completely different,” she said. “And I think that’s OK. I think that for a renovation of this size, it should. We’ve been closed a long time, and we feel that.”
Herd is scheduled to be among the guests at the Nov. 22 reopening, along with VIPs, Civil War reenactors and Wizard of Oz characters. Admission is free Nov. 22-23. After opening weekend, admission will be $10 for adults, $8 for seniors, active military members and college students, $5 for those ages 6 through 17, and free for children 5 and younger.

WILMINGTON, Del. — A field of more than 450 American flags along the Christina Riverfront is setting the tone for many Delaware Veterans’ Day Tributes, as communities statewide prepare to honor service members with ceremonies, open houses and quiet moments of remembrance on Tuesday, Nov. 11.
The Wilmington Rotary Club’s annual “Flags for Heroes” display transforms the Riverwalk into a patriotic corridor, with rows of flags flying in honor of veterans, first responders, teachers, health care workers and everyday heroes. Community members can sponsor flags in tribute to the heroes in their lives, with proceeds supporting the Rotary Club’s Service Foundation and charitable partners, including the Food Bank of Delaware, to help provide meals and support for local children and families in need. Volunteers install and maintain the flags, turning the project into a visible act of service that links gratitude with hands-on help.
Delaware Veterans’ Day Tributes:
In New Castle, the Delaware River and Bay Authority will host one of the state’s central Veterans Day observances at Veterans Memorial Park, 163 Cherry Lane, adjacent to the Delaware Memorial Bridge. The day begins with a 10 a.m. dedication of the newly expanded Wall of Remembrance, followed by the official Veterans Day Service from 10:30 a.m. to noon, sponsored by the Delaware Commission of Veterans Affairs and hosted by DRBA. The expanded monument honors thousands of service members from Delaware and New Jersey who gave their lives in service to the nation. President Joe Biden is expected to participate in this event, as he did throughout much of his Presidency.
Kent County will stage another major statewide event at 2 p.m., when Kent County Chapter 850 of the Vietnam Veterans of America hosts its Veterans Day Ceremony inside the Kent County Levy Court building in Dover. Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. William Welser III is scheduled to deliver the keynote address. The indoor venue replaces the traditional outdoor setting due to weather concerns and will focus on reflection, recognition and remarks rather than wreath-laying.
Across Delaware, Veterans Day remains a personal observance for many families, shaped by generations of military service, the presence of Dover Air Force Base and the strong footprint of National Guard and Reserve units. Local events on Tuesday offer residents multiple opportunities to say thank you in person.
At the Wilmington VA Medical Center, 1601 Kirkwood Hwy., commemorative activities are expected to bring together veterans, families and staff while connecting them with health care and support services.
In Lewes, American Legion Post 17, 113 American Legion Rd., plans a Veterans Day gathering and ceremony, followed by fellowship among veterans and supporters.
In Wilmington, Diamond State VFW Post 2863, 8 Ashley Pl., and VFW Post 2907, 313 Brandywine Blvd., will hold observances and open houses, inviting neighbors to honor local veterans and learn more about veterans’ organizations. VFW Post 8801, 4941 Wheatleys Pond Rd. in Smyrna, is also expected to host a commemorative service.
In Seaford, American Legion Nanticoke Post 6 will hold an 11 a.m. ceremony at Kiwanis Park, followed by a 12:30 p.m. open house at 230 N. Front St. VFW Virgil Wilson Post 4961, 9767 Middleford Rd., will host its own Veterans Day program and open house for southern Delaware residents.
Along the coast, VFW Post 7447 will lead an 11 a.m. ceremony at the Rehoboth Beach Bandstand, followed by open houses at area posts.
Millsboro’s Amvets Post 2 on Long Neck Road will host an 11 a.m. ceremony with a guest speaker and lunch, welcoming veterans, families, and community members.
In Wilmington and Hockessin, Goldey-Beacom College will hold a Veterans’ Appreciation Luncheon at 11 a.m., featuring the Delaware Military Academy Color Guard, highlighting connections between students, campus leaders, and those who served.
From the Riverfront flags to Levy Court in Dover, Veterans Memorial Park in New Castle and hometown posts across all three counties, Delaware’s Veterans Day observances underscore a shared message: service and sacrifice are honored not just in history books, but in the lives of neighbors, coworkers, parents, children and friends who answered the call — and in the communities that continue to stand with them.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/240522174_10225628141920250_6921445021049742016_n-1.jpg,,,2025-11-10 09:18:49.666792

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)State elections officials have begun reviewing signatures gathered by people opposed to Alaska’s system of open primary elections and ranked-choice general elections to determine whether a repeal ballot measure will appear before voters in 2026.
Alaskans enacted the state’s existing elections system via a ballot measure in 2020, and a repeal measure last year failed by only 737 votes out of 320,985 cast. 
Proponents of the repeal vowed at that time to renew their effort and began gathering signatures in February to force another vote. 
Based on state law and the number of people who voted in the 2024 statewide election, repeal supporters needed to collect signatures from at least 34,099 registered voters, including a certain minimum number in at least 30 of the 40 state House districts.
This week, supporters of the repeal measure said they were submitting more than 48,000 signatures to the Alaska Division of Elections for review. 
If the repeal petition is deemed to have enough signatures, it would go before voters in either the 2026 primary or the 2026 general election, depending upon the length of next year’s state legislative session.
If voters approve the measure in 2026, all three components of the 2020 ballot measure would be repealed. 
That would have three main results. Financial donors to political campaigns would be able to conceal their identity by contributing to a political nonprofit, which could donate money to causes on their behalf. 
The 2020 law, currently in effect, requires campaigns to disclose the “true source” of their money.
The second effect would be the repeal of the state’s open primary system, in which all candidates, regardless of political party, run in the same race. Under the current law, the top four vote-getters in a given race advance to the general election.
If that is repealed, political parties would be able to determine the rules for deciding which of their candidates advance to the November general election.
The third change is to general election. Instead of voters being allowed to rank all candidates in order of preference, voters would be able to choose only one candidate, and the candidate with the most votes would win.
One other ballot measure, which would reimpose a limit on financial donations to political candidates, has already been certified and is slated for the 2026 ballot.
Two other ballot measures remain in the signature-gathering process. One would decriminalize several psychedelic substances, and the other would reinforce the state’s existing prohibition on noncitizen voting. 
Backers of those measures must gather sufficient signatures before the start of the January legislative session in order to force a vote in 2026.

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is honoring our veterans on Tuesday and will return to your inboxes on Wednesday.
First unveiled in 2017, Google Lens enables users of Google devices and software to look up physical objects, translate text and conduct visual searches within seconds. But with the proliferation of artificial intelligence, its use inside the classroom is posing a challenge among teachers and potentially harming students’ ability to learn effectively.
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, millions of California’s 5.8 million K-12 students use Google laptops known as Chromebooks. AI-powered tools such as Lens have made it easier for students to cheat on digital tests by allowing them to highlight text on their laptops and having Lens spit out near-instant explanations or interpretations.
Dustin Stevenson, a high school English teacher at the Los Angeles Unified School District, said he noticed students in his class, who were previously struggling throughout the semester, were suddenly acing tests following the latest update to Lens. 
For William Heuisler, a high school ethnic studies teacher in L.A., the distractions on learning posed by Chromebooks got to the point where he had to ditch technology altogether in his classroom and return to pencil and paper.

Heuisler: “Can you get by in life not knowing how to write, how to express yourself? I don’t know, but I hope not.”

Research backs Heuisler’s concerns: A recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that students who use AI for help writing essays had 55% less cognitive activity than those who didn’t.
In the meantime, L.A. Unified has decided to keep Lens on its student laptops, according to a district spokesperson. It has placed some guardrails, however, including allowing students access to the tool after they completed a lesson on digital literacy.

Federal judge bars Trump from deploying CA National Guard troops to Portland

An Oregon district court judge sided with California on Friday, issuing a permanent injunction blocking President Donald Trump’s deployment of state National Guard troops to Portland, Ore., including California’s.
The decision wraps up a three-day trial between the Trump administration against California, Oregon and the city of Portland.In a sprawling 106-page ruling, federal judge Karin Immergut, a Trump-appointee, pointed to evidence that the violence by protesters outside a federal immigration detention facility in Portland didn’t rise to a level that threatened the federal government or prevented its operations. She also wrote that local police did their jobs in quelling any unrest and questioned the reliability of the federal government’s claims that protesters severely damaged the federal facility or breached it. 

The ruling: “There is no evidence that the protesters outside the Portland ICE building acted with a purpose to overtake an instrumentality of government by unlawful or antidemocratic means. … Finally, it is telling that all of Defendants’ evidence of danger predates July 5 — more than two months prior to the President’s federalization of the National Guard.”

Immergut’s ruling follows her temporary block that sided with California and Oregon last month. This is the second time a district judge sided with California against Trump’s use of the military after a trial. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court is weighing an emergency appeal by the Trump administration over its sending of National Guard troops in Illinois, which remains temporarily blocked by lower courts. Its ruling may have national implications over how courts consider future disputed troop deployments. 



CA state park reopens following Palisades Fire

Ten months after the Palisades Fire ripped through L.A. County and killed 12 people, Will Rogers State Historic Park finally reopened Saturday, albeit partially, after remaining off-limits since the devastating wildfire broke out.
Members of the public can again access about 4.2 miles of trails and visit the park’s main lawn and picnic area, returning precious parkland to a region with a limited supply of green space. Will Rogers has also opened up its equestrian operations, though on a smaller scale as restorations continue. Its remaining 4.8 miles of trails are still closed for repair.
The Jan. 7 Palisades wildfire burned about 8,000 acres of state parks land, including Will Rogers’ famed ranch house, park facilities and hundreds of historic trees located in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
The park’s reopening is “cathartic for both park staff and visitors,” said Noa Khalili, the acting senior environmental scientist of the state parks’ Angeles district who helped save historic artifacts from the ranch house.

Khalili: “(The fire) is traumatic to those of us who work here in this beautiful place. And so the process of repair and restoration is healing.”




CA officials to attend international climate change conference

From CalMatters’ climate reporter Alejandro Lazo and environmental justice reporter Alejandra Reyes-Velarde:
As the United Nations Climate Change Conference begins, California officials are the highest profile American delegation this week in Bélem, Brazil. Though the Trump administration has abandoned the Paris climate agreement and won’t send officials to the talks, subnational governments like California can’t sit in at the negotiations. But representing the world’s fourth largest economy, Gov. Gavin Newsom will burnish the state’s reputation — and his own — for clean-energy policy and regional agreements. 
Scholars say the state’s presence in Bélem does carry some weight. 

David G. Victor, UC San Diego climate policy professor: “If we weren’t doing things like this, then the rest of the world would be even more puzzled as to what’s going on inside the United States. The symbolic value of showing that the United States has not completely abandoned climate and clean energy … is pretty important for the rest of the world, but there’s not a huge caloric value to it.”




UC strike averted

The University of California dodged what could have been one of the biggest labor strikes in its history, after reaching a tentative agreement on Saturday with the University Professional and Technical Employees labor group. 
The union represents 21,000 health care professionals, technical and research support professionals. After 17 months of negotiations, it threatened a two-day walkout on Nov. 17 that included other allied unions. The statewide strike was expected to total more than 80,000 workers, including health care workers and nurses at five medical centers — crippling the university system’s health and research operations.
The tentative agreement includes wage increases, caps on health care premium increases and “improvements in work-life balance, career progression, and job security,” according to UPTE.

With health care costs vastly outpacing inflation and wage growth, limiting growth in health care costs is both fair and essential, write Amanda McAllister-Wallner and Kiran Savage-Sangwan, executive directors of Health Access California and the California Pan Ethnic Health Network, respectively.

California likes to think of itself as a laboratory for progress. But when it comes to racial equity in higher education, the experiment has failed. 
Two stories broke recently that show just how twisted the state’s idea of “fairness” has become. A scholarship at UC San Diego — created to honor victims of Klan violence and help Black students — was forced open to white applicants after a legal challenge. Think about that. A program meant to repair racial terror now has to include descendants of those who were never targets of it.
Then Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have let public colleges prioritize descendants of enslaved people in admissions — a modest acknowledgment of history. Vetoed.
These aren’t isolated incidents. They’re symptoms of the same disease: California’s anti-discrimination laws are now tools for preserving discrimination. It’s a legal sentiment that has travelled west to east.
California’s Proposition 209 is where it started. Passed in 1996, it bans public institutions from considering race in education, employment, and contracting. The pitch was simple: treat everyone the same. The reality has been anything but.
Black enrollment across the UC system tanked after Prop 209. At UCLA and Berkeley, Black students remain drastically underrepresented even as California grows more diverse. 
But the law didn’t stop at admissions. Its “colorblind” logic metastasized, infecting scholarships, support programs and outreach efforts.
Now we’re living with the consequences. The UCSD scholarship case and Newsom’s veto both spring from the same trap: Prop 209 made it illegal to center race, even when systemic racism is exactly what needs addressing. California painted itself into a corner where a remedy looks like privilege and repair looks like discrimination.
Let’s be clear — programs supporting Black students were never about giving someone an unfair edge. Rather, racial equity initiatives are about course correction. Centuries of exclusion — from schools, from property ownership, from public life — required a legal apparatus, and so does any solution meant to repair the harm and damage.
When a scholarship designed to address racial violence gets forced to “include everyone,” the whole point disappears. When a bill recognizing the descendants of enslaved people gets killed for threatening “neutrality,” the state isn’t neutral. It’s actively maintaining inequality.
Prop 209 promised equal treatment. Instead, it gave legal cover to dismantle every attempt at redress. Equality became a cudgel against equity.
These decisions have consequences beyond symbolism. Black students lose funding. Admissions officers back away from targeted outreach. “Fairness” becomes code for inaction. And when every race-conscious remedy gets stripped away, campuses become less representative, less vibrant and less honest about the ground they stand on.
A new definition for discrimination
The definition of discrimination is flipping before our eyes. It used to mean perpetual exclusion of a group of people; now it means helping the excluded. A scholarship for Black students becomes discrimination. Two centuries of systematic exclusion somehow aren’t.
California has been at a major crossroads, see-sawing between anti-discrimination and anti-Black policies and practices. California doesn’t have to stay stuck here. 
Even under Prop 209, we have options. Intentional partnerships with private funders to support targeted scholarships is one option, alongside expanding outreach to Black communities and schools. Using race-neutral proxies — such as neighborhood data, family wealth, school quality — to shape admissions and aid is another possibility. 
Most importantly, we must tell the truth: You cannot spell equality without equity, which means equality without repair isn’t justice.
California used to lead on innovation and inclusion. If we want to resume or assume that leadership role again, we need to admit what’s obvious: Even in Blue states, a colorblind system still produces color-coded results. Downplaying distinctions only increases and solidifies racial gaps in wealth, health, education, access, safety and happiness.
Real fairness isn’t pretending race doesn’t exist. It’s seeing clearly what race has done — and choosing to repair the damage.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/061321_StandfordCommencement_HM_CM-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-10 08:56:21.708756

Did a Google AI tool go too far?,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/11/ai-cheating/,"Some teachers say that AI tools, particularly Google Lens, have made it impossible to enforce academic integrity in the classroom — with potentially harmful long-term effects on students’ learning.","In summary
Some teachers say that AI tools, particularly Google Lens, have made it impossible to enforce academic integrity in the classroom — with potentially harmful long-term effects on students’ learning.



A few months ago, a high school English teacher in Los Angeles Unified noticed something different about his students’ tests. Students who had struggled all semester were suddenly getting A’s. He suspected some were cheating, but he couldn’t figure out how.
Until a student showed him the latest version of Google Lens.
Google had recently made the visual search tool easier to use on the company’s Chrome browser. When users click on an icon hidden in the tool bar, a moveable bubble pops up. Wherever the bubble is placed, a sidebar appears with an artificial intelligence answer, description, explanation or interpretation of whatever is inside the bubble. For students, it provides an easy way to cheat on digital tests without typing in a prompt, or even leaving the page. All they have to do is click.
“I couldn’t believe it,” said teacher Dustin Stevenson. “It’s hard enough to teach in the age of AI, and now we have to navigate this?”
Keeping up with students’ methods of cheating has always been a cat-and-mouse game for teachers. But some now say that AI tools, particularly Lens, have made it impossible to enforce academic integrity in the classroom — with potentially harmful long-term effects on students’ learning.
‘A terrible idea’
Lens has been around for nearly a decade. It’s the camera technology that scans QR codes or identifies objects in photos. But as AI has evolved, its uses have expanded, and Google has made it more available to users, especially those using Chrome, the Google browser.
During the COVID school closures, most school districts in California gave students Chromebook laptops to do remote work. Thousands of those laptops were actually donated by Google. After schools reopened for in-person learning, schools kept using the Chromebooks, making them an integral part of classroom instruction.
Millions of California’s 5.8 million K-12 students use Chromebooks, making it by far the most popular laptop option in schools. 
For William Heuisler, a high school ethnic studies teacher in Los Angeles, the ubiquity of Chromebooks was the first red flag.
“After COVID-19, it was clear that Chromebooks were a terrible idea in my classroom,” Heuisler said. Students used the laptops to play games during class, watch soccer matches and otherwise focus on anything but the lesson plan. 
Then came AI, with its immense potential to enhance education — and facilitate cheating. That’s when Heuisler decided to ditch technology altogether in his classroom and return to the basics: pencil and paper. Tests, homework and in-class assignments are all on paper. The school already bans cell phones.
It’s more work for him, but worth it, he said. 
“We want teenagers to think independently, voice their opinions, learn to think critically,” Heuisler said. “But if we give them a tool that allows them to not develop those skills, I’m not sure we’re actually helping them. Can you get by in life not knowing how to write, how to express yourself? I don’t know, but I hope not.”
AI and cognitive activity
Heuisler is not alone, according to research from the Center for Democracy and Technology. In a recent nationwide survey, the organization found that more than 70% of teachers say that because of AI, they have concerns about whether students’ work is actually their own. Nearly 75% of teachers say they worry students aren’t learning important skills like writing, research and reading comprehension.
The impact on students’ learning appears to be real, according to a recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The study, “Your Brain on ChatGPT,” found that students who use AI for help writing essays showed significantly less cognitive activity than those who didn’t, and often couldn’t remember details from essays they had just written. The essays themselves were also of poorer quality, with limited ideas, sentence structures and vocabulary compared to the essays written by students who didn’t rely on AI.
Nonetheless, about 85% of teachers and students use AI in the classroom, the Center for Democracy and Technology found. Teachers use it to organize lesson plans and grade papers, and students use it to do things like research and brainstorming. 
Lack of consistent rules
But rules related to its use vary widely. The California Department of Education offers extensive guidance on how teachers can use AI in the classroom, but no strict requirements — even regarding students who use AI to cheat. One video urges teachers not to punish students caught using AI to write an essay. Instead, the video encourages teachers to come up with essay assignments that can’t be easily written by a machine, or require students to provide their notes and cite AI just like they would cite any other source for an essay. 
Even within schools, teachers have different AI rules. Some encourage students to incorporate AI into their work, while others ban it outright. A recent survey by RAND research organization found only 34% of teachers said their school or district had consistent policies related to AI and cheating, and 80% of students said their teachers haven’t provided guidance on how to use AI for schoolwork.
That confusion is the crux of the problem, said Alix Gallagher, a director at Policy Analysis for California Education who has studied AI use in schools. Because there are few clear rules about AI use, students and teachers tend to have “significantly” different views about what constitutes cheating, according to a recent report by the education nonprofit Project Tomorrow.  
“Because adults aren’t clear, it’s actually not surprising that kids aren’t clear,” Gallagher said. “It’s adults’ responsibility to fix that, and if adults don’t get on the same page they will make it harder for kids who actually want to do the ‘right’ thing.”
Districts need to provide high-quality training for teachers and consistent policies for AI use in the classroom, so everyone knows what the rules are and teachers know how to navigate the new technology, she said.
Unsustainable?
In Hillary Freeman’s government class at Piedmont High School near Oakland, AI is all but forbidden. If students use AI to write a paper, they get a zero. She only allows students to use AI to summarize complex concepts, write practice questions for a self-assessment or when Freeman explicitly permits it for a specific task.
She appreciates that AI can sometimes be useful, but she worries that it’s too easy for students to use it as a crutch.
“Reasoning, logic, problem-solving, writing — these are skills that students need,” Freeman said. “I fear that we’re going to have a generation with huge cognitive gaps in critical thinking skills. … It’s really concerning to me. I want their futures to be bright.”
Detecting students’ use of AI is another obstacle, she said. It means spending time digging through version histories of students’ work, or using AI plagiarism screeners, which are sometimes inaccurate and more likely to flag English learners.
“It’s a huge ‘add’ to my job, and it doesn’t seem sustainable,” Freeman said. 
Digital literacy and academic integrity
Google, meanwhile, so far has no plans to remove Lens from its Chrome browsers, even on school-issued laptops, although it is continuing to test various levels of accessibility. It recently paused a “homework help” Lens shortcut button, in response to feedback from users. 
The tech giant encourages students and teachers to learn more about positive and ethical uses of AI and how it can enhance learning. It’s also invested more than $40 million in AI literacy for students and teachers over the past few years.
“Students have told us they value tools that help them learn and understand things visually, so we have been running tests offering an easier way to access Lens while browsing,” said Google spokesman Craig Ewer. “We continue to work closely with educators and partners to improve the helpfulness of our tools that support the learning process.”
School administrators also have the option of disabling Lens on district-issued Chromebooks. 
Los Angeles Unified has decided to keep Lens on its student laptops, at least for now, because the tool has plenty of positive uses that students should have the opportunity to explore the technology, a district spokesperson said.
But the district has instituted some guardrails: the tool is only available to students who have completed a lesson on digital literacy, and students and teachers must comply with the district’s academic integrity and responsible-use-of-technology rules. Those rules include bans on plagiarism and cheating.  
“As new digital tools evolve, we continuously evaluate how they are used within our schools. When certain technologies or features may present concerns, we carefully analyze the risks, benefits, and overall impact on the learning environment,” a district spokesperson said.
This isn’t the district’s first challenge with AI technology. In 2024 Superintendent Alberto Carvalho unveiled a nearly $3 million chatbot called Ed, only to shelve it three months later when the company laid off half its staff.
Meanwhile, Stevenson said Lens vanished from his students’ Chromebooks last week after he alerted the district that some students were using it to cheat.
“It’s encouraging, but it also reveals how haphazard the introduction of AI has been,” Stevenson said. “Teachers and school leaders spend countless hours considering each detail of the learning experience, then Google totally undermines it with the click of a button. This isn’t how education is supposed to work.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/032823_EthnicStudies_CM_11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-10 08:56:21.708756

Amanda McAllister-Wallner
Amanda McAllister-Wallner is executive director of Health Access California, a consumer advocacy coalition.


Kiran Savage-Sangwan
Kiran Savage-Sangwan is executive director of the California Pan Ethnic Health Network, which mobilizes communities of color to advocate for health equity. 


A new poll shows 8 out of 10 Californians are worried about the cost of health care and want the state’s next governor to bring down out-of-pocket costs. 
Without action, the cost burden of health care will worsen next year for 1.5 million Californians, because Congressional Republicans refuse to extend federal subsidies that make health insurance affordable through Covered California.  
Instead of making care more affordable, the California Hospital Association recently sued to block a state initiative designed to slow the stratospheric rise in health care costs and prevent Californians from being priced out of life-saving care.  
This legal action from the hospital group demonstrates that, even as state leaders work to minimize damage from federal health care cuts, they also must continue holding the health care industry accountable for delivering quality care without wasting our precious health care dollars. 
As advocates for health consumers and marginalized communities, we believe limiting growth in health care costs is both fair and essential. Increases in health care costs have vastly outpaced inflation and wage growth. 
Yet research shows more expensive health care has not improved our health outcomes, equity, or access. According to the California Health Care Foundation, “health care costs and medical debt are making Californians sicker.” 
A 2024 survey found more than half of Californians skipped or postponed care due to costs. Among Californians with low incomes, that number rose to 3 out of 4. More than half of those who skipped care said their health was worse as a result.
Consumer advocates backed the creation of California’s Office of Health Care Affordability in 2022 and have worked closely with it developing cost reduction strategies. The board spent years hearing from experts, advocates, and everyday Californians. It considered a variety of cost reduction approaches before setting an annual 3% price growth target, aligned with the typical growth in workers’ wages. 
Raking in profits
Hospitals may not like the outcome since it ends their ability to set whatever prices they want —  no matter how much they harm consumers and our economy. This lawsuit is a blatant attempt to change the rules of the game.
Hospital executives claim that high health care prices reflect hospitals’ focus on equity or superior compensation paid to health care workers. 
Yet California Health Care Foundation data show that about 25 cents of every dollar in the health care system, or up to $73 billion dollars a year, “doesn’t help patients get better care or become healthier.”
Instead, these costs result from such factors as administrative bloat and excess profits the health care industry generates by eliminating competition. 
Hospitals’ claims of financial stress also deserve further scrutiny. As some hospitals struggle, major health care systems are raking in profits, while working families struggle to pay bills. 
Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, the state’s largest hospital chain, had revenue over $32.7 billion, net assets over $46 billion, and a CEO it paid more than $12 million in 2023. 
Other wealthy hospitals, like Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Scripps Memorial Hospital, and Loma Linda University Medical Center benefit from tax breaks that far exceed their charitable and community contributions.
It is particularly galling that the hospital lawsuit invokes “equity” no less than 50 times in an attempt to justify price-gouging. 
In reality, high prices worsen inequality, as they result in people of color being more likely to delay or skip care. If hospital leaders genuinely cared about equity, they’d work to lower costs, not defend pushing care out of reach.
Gov. Gavin Newsom and California’s state leaders have led groundbreaking efforts to tackle health care affordability. Now they’re pushing back against President Donald Trump and Republican leaders’ drive to terminate Medi-Cal coverage for millions and hike costs for Covered California enrollees. 
The hospital industry’s lawsuit underscores that protecting Californians’ health — and our pocketbooks — requires holding the industry accountable at the same time.

The committee approved nearly $22 million in contracts for the Alabama State Department of Education on Thursday.(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Joint Legislative Contract Review Committee approved $21.7 million in contracts for the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE) on Thursday afternoon.
Two of the contracts aim to help ALSDE comply with the 2019 Literacy Act, ALSDE’s Director of Governmental Affairs Tina Hammonds said. A nearly $21 million contract with Lexia Learning Systems, a company based in Texas, will help prepare teachers to teach in the science of reading, including multi-sensory language instruction for K-3 teachers, reading specialists, and higher education faculty. 
“We started with teaching the teachers in college to be able to teach the students that are going to be teachers,” Hammonds said. “Then we have to go into the field to teach the teachers that are already in the field. Then we’ll be able to have a continuum for both sets to be able to have further learnings.”

The contract is 100% state-funded. Sen. Chris Elliott, R-Josephine, said that the contract will prevent more taxpayer dollars from being spent on training.
“I hope that is the result of this, and that is that we don’t have to spend additional state taxpayer dollars to train teachers in state colleges and universities to do what they are there to do and get a degree in,” he said.
Hammonds said that is the goal, but implementation of the Literacy and Numeracy acts will take time.
“This is the new standard we’re working on, the Numeracy Act and Literacy Act to try to make sure that the different forms of higher education and the different ed prep programs and the two and four year college opportunities are all preparing teachers that are going to come back for licenses in our state,” she said. 
The committee also approved a $760,000 contract with American Institutes for Research, based in Virginia, to help teachers teach fourth through eighth graders who are falling behind in reading. The contract is 100% federally funded.
“We want to make sure that those kids don’t continue to be intermediate as they move forward,” Hammonds said. “That’s also part of our COVID issue. We’re going to try to put as much intensive state and federal funding toward those kids over the next few years to see if we can’t make sure to give them the best future they can have.”

Tyler Clancy, R-Provo speaks at a ceremonial bill signing at the Utah State Capitol on April 15, 2025 (Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)Rep. Tyler Clancy, who currently works as a detective with the Provo Police Department, admitted that when he was first approached by the governor’s office about becoming the state’s next leader of Utah’s Office of Homeless Services, he said he turned down the job “a couple of times.” 
He knew the role of state homelessness coordinator is a tough job, tasked with navigating a complex web of state and local systems on controversial issues impacting the lives of the state’s most vulnerable. 
Clancy, R-Provo, said he was mostly reluctant to step down from representing District 60 in the House and leave his job in law enforcement. But the position makes sense for Clancy, who during his time in the Legislature has sponsored several bills focused on homelessness policy. 
Clancy eventually accepted, he said, because he sees Utah — and the federal government — at a crossroads when it comes to changing the way homeless services function. 
“We’re in a unique moment,” Clancy said in an interview last week with Utah News Dispatch. “And this is where I can make an impact and continue to serve my state.” 
Gov. Cox picks lawmaker with police background as new state homeless coordinator

Last month, Gov. Spencer Cox announced Clancy would be taking the place of the state’s current homelessness coordinator, Wayne Niederhauser, after he retires on Dec. 5. Clancy was publicly named Niederhauser’s successor just nine days after Niederhauser’s retirement announcement.
Clancy won’t step into his new job as state homeless coordinator until after the Utah Legislature’s 2026 session, which begins Jan. 20 and ends March 6. But come March 9, he’ll no longer be called Rep. Clancy. 
Call him Coordinator Clancy. 
Niederhauser, Clancy acknowledged, leaves some “big shoes to fill.” A former state Senate president, Niederhauser has long been lauded as a skilled collaborator with strong relationships and trust on Utah’s Capitol Hill, which has been key for significant new investments in the state’s homeless system over the past five years. 
“It’s a daunting task,” Clancy said of replacing Niederhauser. “I don’t know that if there’s a state or a city we can look and say, ‘Well they got (homelessness) right.’ That’s what we’re really trying to do, be a leader in the space to find results-oriented solutions that help people heal and continue on their path to self-sufficiency.”

Niederhauser, in a recent interview with Utah News Dispatch after his retirement announcement, said when he took the job in 2021, he didn’t expect to stay as long as he did — but come December, he said he felt it was time to “pass the baton.” He said it was a “mutual decision” between him and the governor. 
“It’s not an easy space. It’s fraught with controversy and politics and all of that, and you know, some fresh energy, I think, will be really good,” Niederhauser said. He added that the “politics have changed” over time, including on the federal level, “and so we need some fresh energy, some fresh ideas, and we’ll just hand the baton off and go from there.” 
What’s next? 
Niederhauser’s departure announcement comes at a time when a major project is unfinished: a proposed 1,300-bed “homeless campus” that the governor has thrown his full weight behind, recently calling it a “top priority” as he begins to prepare his 2026 budget recommendations for lawmakers. 
Finding funding for the expensive project — estimated to cost at least $75 million to build and more than $34 million a year in ongoing money to operate — will be a major obstacle, but the governor said he hopes some federal dollars could help make it a reality. 
Utah Gov. Cox says homeless campus — envisioned to fulfill Trump’s order — is a ‘top priority’

That “transformative” campus is key for the governor and other state leaders’ vision to not only increase the state’s currently maxed out homeless shelter capacity, but also make homeless services more focused on “healing” and “accountability.” 
Plans for the campus are still taking shape. But the state’s top homelessness leaders have proposed including hundreds of beds for people who are civilly committed — or court ordered into mental health treatment — along with a “secure” facility for substance abuse treatment as an alternative to jail, where people who are “sanctioned” to go there would not be able to leave voluntarily. 
How Trump’s vision fits in
Their vision coincides with President Donald Trump’s executive order issued in July, titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets.” That executive order encourages cities and states to enforce stricter anti-camping laws, expands power to involuntarily treat and civilly commit people experiencing homelessness, and directs federal officials to end support for “Housing First” strategies, an approach to homelessness that prioritizes providing housing while offering — but not requiring — treatment. 
But months before Trump’s executive order, Utah’s Republican state leaders had said they wanted Utah’s homeless system to start moving away from Housing First policies — policies the state once championed — that they now say “lack accountability.” 
Clancy, earlier this year, successfully sponsored a resolution urging the federal government to change federal homelessness regulations to provide more flexibility for federal homelessness funding. “Block grant funding,” the resolution says, “would provide Utah with tools to better leverage” Department of Housing and Urban Development money “by granting the state more discretion over the allocation of funds, enabling local agencies to design more effective programs tailored to the specific needs” of Utah’s homeless population.

That resolution (approved by the Legislature and signed by the governor in February) also included a request to “rescind housing first policy mandates to permit flexibility” for housing options that “meet the diverse needs and preferences of families experiencing homelessness, including sobriety, goal-setting, and accountability.” 
Clancy said that’s context he feels has been looked over as Utah recently gained national attention after The New York Times published an article titled “In Utah, Trump’s Vision for Homelessness Begins to Take Shape.” 
“We were working really hard on this mission of reform before President Trump took office,” he said. “We’ve been working on reforming Housing First, looking at an all-of-the-above model, even when President Biden was in office.”
Clancy said Utah state leaders’ vision aligns with Trump’s — including expanding mental health care “for those who really do need those acute mental health services,” he said. He added that he’s “confident” that Utah leaders will “continue to collaborate” with the Trump administration as they figure out next steps. 
What are those next steps? Clancy said that resolution “puts Utah in the driver’s seat to help lead the way” since “we have already identified that we’re willing to do this.” 
Clancy talks next steps
If not for the ongoing government shutdown, Clancy said “we would be having a lot of those conversations. But the minute it reopens, we’re going to be working very, very closely with the Trump administration to get every dollar and cent that the state of Utah can get.”
“We will work for that and make sure that we’re using that money to help save lives and change lives,” he said. 
Clancy said due to legislation passed over the past several years, Utah’s existing homeless system has already been set up “to be ready” for whenever the federal government changes how funds are distributed through local homeless services networks known as “continuums of care.” 
So whenever the changes are enacted on the federal level, providers who receive the funding will be allowed to enact more “accountability” requirements, he said. Now it’s just a matter of when the federal government will act. 
“So I think what’s next is for the federal government to repeal those very restrictive (Housing First) rules on the existing federal funding,” Clancy said. 
But for now, due to the shutdown, “we’re kind of in that holding pattern,” he said, but “Utah is ready to act on that mission.”

Concerns and criticism
Big changes don’t come without trepidation. In recent months, some homeless providers have been feeling nervous and skeptical about whether the changes will actually help more people — or create more punitive and chilling policies that could leave more people falling through the cracks, deprioritize permanent supportive housing and destabilize people who are currently housed. 
In a July letter urging the state’s Homeless Services Board to “fulfill” Trump’s executive order, the governor, House Speaker Mike Schultz and Senate President Stuart Adams said to, among other things, “ensure any funding requests are accompanied by a clear strategy that aligns with the President’s executive order, with a focus on reprioritizing existing resources.” 
How can the state “reprioritize” existing funding without leaving some housing or homeless service providers unfunded? Clancy said, to him, “reprioritization is more about recognizing what are the unique challenges” facing certain “subpopulations” of homelessness and “making sure we’re matching appropriate funding to those needs.”

“If there’s a program or programs that are not successful, the onus would be on every government official to make sure that we’re being wise stewards of taxpayer dollars,” Clancy said, but he added he doesn’t see it as something that will jeopardize needed housing programs during a time when Utah’s housing affordability issues are worse than ever. 
Instead, he said he sees it as an opportunity to allow — but not require — providers to add “accountability measures” on programs. Under current federal policies, Clancy said “right now, there’s a prohibition,” but reprioritization would mean “removing that restriction and then seeing where the results lay.” 
“When we talk about Housing First, it’s this idea that severe addiction and severe untreated and persistent mental illness will magically melt away if you give someone a key to a single-room occupancy apartment,” he said. “That, I think, you’re going to see a shift away from. Does that mean we still don’t need capacity? No, of course we do. But how is that capacity linked to engagement?” 
Some, including Democrats and homeless service providers, have criticized the “homeless campus” proposal as an expensive project that will need to be fully funded in order to succeed — but meanwhile, the state’s current homeless shelters and other existing resources like deeply affordable housing, substance use treatment, mental health treatment, and jail capacity have long gone underfunded. 
‘Compassion that kills’: Gov. Cox says ‘sea change’ in Utah’s homeless system is coming

Clancy acknowledged those criticisms — and to a certain extent he agrees, “particularly in the mental health space,” he said, especially for people who are facing “serious psycho-effective disorders” to the point they may not realize they’re mentally ill and they’re living on the streets in the middle of winter. 
“That’s where I would probably agree with critics who say, ‘This is heavily driven by funding,’” he said, but he added he would “disagree” when it comes to other people who “cycle through the same programs six, seven, eight times, to no success because it’s not meeting the severity of their needs.” 
Clancy said he believes he’s not criticized for advocating for more funding — but rather for highlighting “the need for higher engagement programming” to add more accountability measures on services for people suffering from drug addiction or other issues. 
“What we’re talking about is not involuntary versus voluntary treatment,” he said. “We’re talking about voluntary treatment or an unchecked spiral into this world of hell.” 
As for mental health capacity, Clancy said he doesn’t see a need to drastically change Utah’s existing laws in order to civilly commit more people than already qualify for that legal status — but rather he said the state needs to focus its efforts on increasing capacity. 
Utah’s new homeless campus should have 300-plus beds for civil commitment, board chair says

In September, Rep. Steve Eliason — a lawmaker who has a long track record of legislation related to homelessness, mental health and civil commitment — estimated that there’s “at least 1,000 people under civil commitment on the streets” with no available inpatient beds for them. 
“So that’s where I think when we talk about working together with the federal government, it’s about making sure our mental health services have the right funding to make sure we can match people up with the needs that they have,” Clancy said. “In Utah in particular, I think we’re in a really good place with civil commitment on the legal level, but our challenge is largely driven by capacity.” 
While critics see Utah’s vision as one focused on treating homeless people like criminals, Clancy said it’s more of a matter of putting “treatment” and “recovery” first. 
“We want that system of care to be recovery focused, for people who have faced serious trauma in their lives,” he said. “It’s not a one-size-fits all issue, we always say that. But now it’s time to put it into action.”

But the victories last week of Democratic candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, a Democratic Socialist mayoral candidate in New York, and a California ballot question with the potential to upend the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives, are prompting introspection on both sides of the aisle. 
Was the Democratic sweep, as some Republicans suggest, nothing more than the expected outcome in traditionally blue states? Or was it a repudiation of President Donald Trump’s failed promises, chief among them to make America more affordable? And how will it play out a year from now during the midterms?  
Inflation in the U.S. stood at 3% in September, up from 2.9% a year ago, when Trump promised “Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again, to bring down the prices of all goods.”
A presidential advisor asserted last week that Trump is now poised to take up affordability. 
Trump’s tariffs amount to an average tax increase of $1,200 in 2025 and $1,600 in 2026 per American household, according to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization. 
The economy was the number one issue in three of the four key races on Tuesday, according to CNN exit polls. 
Will the success of Democratic candidates’ focus on affordability be a jolt to Republicans?
“It better be,” said longtime Southern Nevada Republican campaign consultant Lisa Mayo DeRiso. “If not, Republicans are going to be in deep, deep doo doo.” 
Mayo DeRiso says the election results are a “message to America that people in need want somebody to solve these problems,” and are “a good wake up call for Republicans. But we say that all the time. ‘We’re going to reach out to the Hispanic community. We’re going to  have a broader tent.’ We haven’t done a good job with that.”
Republicans are not alone in losing sight of their aspirations, says progressive campaign consultant Annette Magnus. 
“In Nevada and nationally, Democrats still need to figure out who we are and what we’re fighting for, because I think there is an extreme disconnect between what people actually want and need and what our politicians in the Democratic Party are willing to fight for,” she said, citing the upcoming special session of the Nevada Legislature as an example of Democrats’ often scattered priorities. 
State lawmakers are expected to be summoned this month, perhaps this week, to Carson City by Gov. Joe Lombardo “to finish what the Legislature left unfinished – plain and simple.” 
The unfinished business will likely include a rehash of a previous effort to increase Nevada’s film tax credits, the 2013 legislative answer to kickstarting the post-Great Recession economy, sponsored that year by then-State Sen. Aaron Ford, who is now attorney general and one of two Democrats vying to take on Lombardo, a Republican who is up for reelection next year.   
Lombardo has been widely criticized for capitulating to Trump’s agenda (mobilizing the National Guard to assist with deportations; remaining silent as Nevada’s moneymaker, the tourism industry, is hobbled by a tariff-driven downturn in domestic and international travel), while doing little to address the economic carnage of vanishing federal benefits, such as food stamps and health insurance subsidies. 
“I want Joe Lombardo to be our next governor,” says Mayo DeRiso. But the governor’s trip last week to Washington, D.C. for a fundraiser, as Nevadans stand in line at food banks, “and calling a special session to try to get billions of dollars in tax credits for a bunch of Hollywood movie people, are not good decisions heading into the holidays.” 
Long-time Republican consultant Sig Rogich, departing from Lombardo’s film tax credit script, called the proposal “a boondoggle.  It’s a big mistake for our state, and I wish the governor wouldn’t do it,” he told Sam Shad Thursday on Nevada Newsmakers.
Rogich also took aim at the transferability of the credits, which are generally sold by the recipients to a casino company, which gets a credit on its tax bill. 
“What does that do for the state? It should be using that money for schools,” Rogich said, adding his wife, Sen. Lori Rogich, “has a passion for special needs children. We couldn’t get any money in the Legislature to do anything with it, and yet, they’re going to give the movie industry, Hollywood all these tax benefits, and then they sell them like they did with the Raiders.”
Magnus has similar concerns about the film tax credit, which Democrats have spearheaded in multiple sessions. 
“It’s going to be a real crappy look if we go up to Carson City and the first thing they approve is a film tax credit, and we don’t deal with SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), because people are starving, and that’s what I mean by priorities,” she says.  
Ford is defending his support of the film tax credit.
“At a time when our state is lagging behind the rest of the nation in job growth, unemployment remains amongst the highest of any state in the nation, and costs for working families are at record highs,” Ford said in a statement. “It is critical to make responsible long-term investments that will diversify our state’s economy and create good-paying union jobs in our state.”
Even before Trump halted SNAP during the government shutdown, his One Big Beautiful Bill Act put states on notice they’d be responsible for a portion of the program’s administrative costs, leaving Nevada with a $19 million hole to fill in the current biennium, and after that, upwards of $50 million a biennium. As many as 130,000 Nevadans could lose benefits because of new eligibility requirements in the law. 
“The Democrats are finally coming around to figuring out they need to start talking about the economy and start talking about issues that are impacting people’s pocketbooks and how Americans feed themselves,” says Magnus. 
Both Ford and Washoe County Commission Chairwoman Alexis Hill, a Democrat who announced her candidacy for governor in August, are emphasizing affordability in their campaigns. 
Hill said last week she was “inspired by voters going to the polls and voting against the Trump agenda. I think the elections show that candidates who start at 1% in polls can end up giving victory speeches when they have a powerful economic message, and grassroots support.” 
She’s promised to end “billionaire giveaways” via tax abatements, and has floated the possibility of placing temporary caps on rent. 
Ford has filed multiple lawsuits against Trump, including for suspending SNAP benefits. At his campaign announcement, he spoke of growing up poor. “I’m fighting for the kind of government that sees people like I was and says, ‘you matter.’” 
It’s unknown whether Lombardo, who is riding the wave of his second Trump endorsement, will feel bound to embark on that delicate dance toward the middle, where much of Nevada’s electorate resides. He has yet to draw a formidable challenger.
Ford and Hill, however, are headed for a “spirited primary race,” Magnus predicts. “Democrats are better off when we have primaries.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1431845504-1024x713.jpg,,,2025-11-10 08:21:40.929623

A new strategic partnership has been announced between NorthStar Anesthesia and Bayhealth to enhance anesthesia services for patients and surgical teams across central Delaware. The collaboration officially launched November 10 and is designed to strengthen clinical quality, operational efficiency and provider engagement at Bayhealth facilities.
Under the agreement, NorthStar will apply its clinician-led model and performance-driven approach to support Bayhealth’s surgical and procedural areas. The announcement notes that retention of incumbent physicians and CRNAs has been highly successful ahead of the launch, positioning the system to attract and retain top talent moving forward.
“At NorthStar, our mission has always been to partner with health systems that share our commitment to clinical quality, collaboration, and operational excellence,” said Josh Lumbley, MD, MBOE, FASA, Chief Quality Officer at NorthStar Anesthesia. “Bayhealth’s focus on patient-centered care aligns perfectly with our values, and we’re proud to bring our proven care-team model to support their mission of serving Delaware communities.”
From Bayhealth’s perspective, the partnership is already showing positive early signs. “We’re excited to welcome NorthStar Anesthesia as a trusted partner in elevating anesthesia services across our system,” said John Fink, MD, MSHQS, Interim Chief Medical Officer and Vice President of Quality and Medical Affairs at Bayhealth. “This partnership is already making an impact. We’ve seen strong recruitment results, a smooth transition for our clinical teams, and a shared commitment to improving the patient experience from day one.”
Bayhealth is the region’s largest health-care system for central and southern Delaware, serving Kent and Sussex counties through its Kent Campus, Sussex Campus, a freestanding emergency department in Smyrna, urgent care centers and satellite practices. By bolstering the anesthesia team and streamlining operations, the partnership aims to improve access, continuity and quality of anesthesia care for local residents.
NorthStar, founded by an anesthesiologist and a certified registered nurse anesthetist, partners with more than 280 health-care client sites across over 20 states and has more than 4,000 anesthesiologists and CRNAs under its banner.
The deal reflects an ongoing trend of health systems working with national partners to strengthen service delivery in surgical and procedural settings. Goals include increased operating-room efficiency, stable staffing and aligned patient-care protocols.
While the announcement did not detail specific job numbers or facility expansions tied to the deal, Bayhealth emphasized the transition has gone smoothly and that recruiting has been strong. For clinicians and support staff in the region, this new partnership signals an enhanced focus on the anesthesia care team and patient experience.
For patients preparing for surgery locally, the message is clear: the collaboration should bring a more cohesive team, improved access and a local care model backed by national-scale support.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-10 13:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What’s so special about a special session? Here’s what to know.,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/10/ct-legislature-special-session/,CT's General Assembly convenes a special session in emergency cases — though the legislature has taken a broad view of what constitutes one.,"Connecticut’s General Assembly will convene in special session Wednesday, once again taking a broad view of what constitutes an emergency necessitating action prior to the next regular annual session, which opens Feb. 4.
Based on frequency, there is little special about special sessions. Legislators have returned to Hartford for special sessions at least once in 41 of the 54 years since 1971, when the General Assembly began meeting annually.
The Connecticut Constitution dictates that the legislature, a part-time body whose members typically hold outside jobs, meets in regular session for five months in odd-numbered years and three months in even-numbered years. It imposes no limits on special sessions.
Who decides to call a special session?
The legislature can call itself into session, but typically it is initiated by a governor. He issues “a call,” a proclamation outlining what subjects are to be addressed.
How are the legislators called back?
This used to be cumbersome, requiring a notice delivered to lawmakers by certified mail as much as 15 days in advance, or served in person by a state marshal, police officer or other “indifferent person” at least 24 hours prior to a session convening. Gov. William A. O’Neill once had state troopers hand them a summons to return as they left on the last night of a session without passing a budget.
So there will be cops running around the state over the weekend ordering them back?
Nah, it’s done by email now. The legislature passed a law in 2016 allowing the electronic transmittal of the call. It has to be sent at least 72 hours ahead of the session.
So, the legislators only can act on the subjects outlined by the governor in the call? 
Not exactly. The legislature always has the option of calling its own special session to address other subjects. Legislators literally can be in more than one special session at the same time. 
Sounds confusing. How does that work?
The best way to envision simultaneous special sessions is to picture a computer with several screens open. Just like you toggle back and forth on your computer, the legislature can do that with different special sessions.
How long do special sessions last?
Most are brief, a day or two. There are notable exceptions.
Like when?
The mother of all special sessions was in 1991, the year the income tax was adopted, repealed and took effect after the repeal bill was vetoed, all in a special session that ran through Sept. 19.
And then they went home?
Briefly. Once repeal failed, they moved onto what they called “repair.” They struggled through Thanksgiving, finally calling it quits for the year on Dec. 18.
During a regular session, the legislature takes months to draft bills and submit them to a committee review and public hearing. How do they all that in a special session that lasts a day or two?
They don’t. As we saw Friday, when the governor and lawmakers released a housing bill that will be debated Wednesday in the House, the legislation generally is written before the lawmakers return.
Do they ever do that in special session?
Sometimes. If the House speaker and Senate president pro tem agree, any bill can be “emergency certified” and presented for a floor vote without a hearing or committee review.
Are they barred from holding a public hearing in special session?
No, the legislature writes the rules. 
Aside from the income tax, what are some of the more notable things done in special session?
Connecticut’s groundbreaking system of publicly financing campaigns occurred in a special session called by Gov. M. Jodi Rell in 2005. The bill passed in September after a summer of negotiation.
Recreational cannabis was legalized in a special session in a bill that won final passage in the Senate on June 17, 2021. The regular session had ended June 9 with passage by the Senate, but not action by the House.
The Senate passed the bill again in the special, only to see it revised in the House. The Senate passed the final version.
Do legislators get paid extra for special sessions?
No.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0108_SR_SessionFirstDay_402-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 08:00:54.850821

Kay Ivey applaud during a press conference at the Alabama State Capitol on Feb. 12, 2025 promoting a law enforcement package in the Legislature. Ivey said last week that she would not call a special session of the Alabama Legislature to address the suspension of SNAP benefits, saying state law prevented use of rainy day funds to do so. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The state’s General Fund budget was in trouble in 2012.
Expenses were up, revenues were down and the economy was still trying to shake off the hangover of the Great Recession. A huge hole had opened in the General Fund, which pays for Medicaid, prisons and most non-education services.
The Legislature found a solution: Borrow $437 million from the Alabama Trust Fund, a repository for oil and gas revenues. One problem: that was against the law.
So lawmakers figured a way out. They passed a budget moving the money to the General Fund, then put a constitutional amendment before voters that September — a few weeks before the General Fund took effect — asking them to approve it. Voters did so by a 2-to-1 margin, staving off major cuts.
The Legislature didn’t have to do this. They could have cut funding and let the consequences fall as they pleased. But that would have hurt Alabamians, especially when it came to finding health care. So they kept the budgets whole.
When Alabama leaders see an emergency, even one that exists solely in their heads, they move fast.
That makes the passivity of Republican leaders during the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) crisis even more notable.
The federal government shutdown, which may be headed toward an end, put over 726,000 Alabamians — 15% of the population, nearly half of them children — at risk of hunger after the Trump administration stopped paying SNAP benefits earlier this month. But Alabama leaders have responded with a collective “meh.”
Gov. Kay Ivey, who ricocheted around the state in fury when Mercedes-Benz workers tried to get more regular shift-scheduling, took several days to act. At first, her office read a script that could have been handed to it by the Trump administration. Ivey blamed congressional Democrats, most of whom were trying to prevent people from losing their health insurance. She was silent on the White House refusing to implement a SNAP contingency plan.
She read the condemnation again on Tuesday, when she sent $2 million to eight food banks around the state. That money, if used entirely on food, will pay for 10 million meals.
That’s good. But with 726,000 SNAP recipients, that works out to about 14 meals per person. Roughly four to seven days of help. And that doesn’t include the non-SNAP recipients the food banks continue to serve.
Alabama Democrats proposed using emergency funds and excess money in state agency budgets to fund the approximately $142 million a month it will cost to feed SNAP recipients.  According to the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama, those savings accounts held about $4.8 billion in October 2024.
Two of those accounts — rainy day funds for the Education Trust Fund and General Fund — are set up in constitutional amendment. Ivey said Tuesday that the state could not tap into those accounts, which held roughly $1.1 billion last year, unless the state goes into proration, when state revenues can’t fund state agencies to their budgeted amount.
But the other accounts were set up by statute. By lawmakers. Which means they can be rewritten by lawmakers to address pressing needs.
It’s not like legislators treat the Code of Alabama as holy writ. They have amended the Rolling Reserve Act, controlling most of the other emergency funds, five times over the last 14 years.
You can make arguments against using the money this way. Our public school system relies on income and sales taxes that can vanish during a recession. Back-up funds could be critical in maintaining school operations.
But lawmakers aren’t arguing about stability. They’re pleading helplessness. No matter that Republicans threw $180 million at rich families for private school tuition, which makes zero sense for the long-term health of public education. Subsidizing the state’s top income earners is critical. Preventing starvation is not.
Alabama can’t fund SNAP on its own without some radical overhaul of its tax code. But it could provide sustainable short-term relief for 726,000 men, women and children.
Our leaders choose not to.
I’m sure they don’t want to get crossways with President Donald Trump, their one and only constituent. U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville thinks that only inner-city Democrats use SNAP. This should be news to the rural and heavily Republican Wiregrass, where SNAP uptake is higher than the state average in several counties.
But at the basic level, Republican leaders in this state don’t seem to view hunger as an emergency. They’ve tolerated the state’s high rates of poverty for decades. Ivey has approved Trump’s destruction of the U.S. Department of Education, which feeds many Alabama schoolchildren.
What do they consider emergencies? Large corporations not getting enough of your tax dollars. The existence of transgender people. It took them all of a week this year to force definitions of sex into the state code. They even limited House debate on the measure to speed up its passage.
But when hunger rears its head?
Suddenly, our lawmakers are powerless before the law. Suddenly, a government that knows how to punish can’t figure out how to help.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Garlan-Gudger-Nathaniel-Ledbetter-Kay-Ivey-Feb-12-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 08:00:54.850821

(Photo: Getty Images)In the run-up to the 2020 election, all 20 Democratic presidential candidates promised voters they’d pursue bold changes to health care, such as a government-run insurance plan or expanding Medicare to cover every American.
Fast-forward to the congressional stalemate that has closed the federal government for more than a month. Democrats, entrenched on one side of the legislative battle, staked their political future on merely preserving parts of the Affordable Care Act — a far cry from the systemic health policy changes that party members once described as crucial for tackling the high price of care.
Democrats succeeded in focusing national attention on rising health insurance costs, vowing to hold up funding for the federal government until a deal could be made to extend the more generous tax subsidies that have cut premiums for Obamacare plans. Their doggedness could help them win votes in midterm elections next year.
But health care prices are rocketing, costly high-deductible plans are proliferating, and 4 in 10 adults have some form of health care debt. As health costs reach a crisis point, a yawning gulf exists between voters’ desire for more aggressive action and the political urgency in Washington for sweeping change.
“There isn’t a lot of eagerness among politicians,” said Jonathan Gruber, an economist who played a key role in drafting the ACA. “Why aren’t they being more bold? Probably scars from the ACA fights. But health care is a winning issue. The truth is we need universal coverage and price regulation.”
Voters rank lowering health care costs as a top priority, above housing, jobs, immigration, and crime, according to a September poll by Hart Research Associates for Families USA, a consumer health advocacy group.
And costs are climbing. Premiums for job-based health insurance rose 6% in 2025 to an average of $26,993 a year for family coverage, according to an annual survey of employers released Oct. 22 by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. For all the attention given to grocery, gas, and energy prices, health premiums and deductibles in recent years have risen faster than overall inflation and wages.
Democratic headwinds
The appetite for big, bold ideas to drive down such high costs has waned in part because Democrats lack political leverage, according to economists, political strategists, and health care advocates. They’ve also been burned before for backing significant changes.
After the ACA was enacted in 2010, for example, a backlash over the law — and its mandate that most everyone have insurance — helped Republicans win the House and gain seats in the Senate. In 2016, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton backed the public option, a proposed government-run plan that would compete against commercial insurance. She lost to Donald Trump.
Democrats are also outnumbered in Congress. Sweeping changes to health care, such as the creation of Medicaid and Medicare and passage of the ACA, historically have occurred when one party has controlled both Congress and the presidency. Republicans currently have all that muscle. So for now, Democrats are fighting to preserve the status quo while portraying Republicans as a threat to Americans’ insurance coverage.
If the ACA subsidies aren’t extended, many of the roughly 24 million people who buy coverage on the health law’s marketplaces will see their premiums more than double next year, according to KFF. A KFF Health Tracking Poll released Nov. 6 found that three-quarters of the public supported extending them.
“There’s no doubt people believe the current system needs reform,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist. “Protecting people from premium increases is part of that. You don’t win the future by losing the present.”
Even bipartisan legislative proposals aimed at lowering health costs have fizzled in an environment defined by political threats and partisan social media attacks.
Bills that would have improved health care price transparency and reined in companies that manage prescription drug benefits gained traction in late 2024 as part of a spending package. Then Elon Musk, who was serving as a senior adviser to President-elect Trump, took to his social media platform, X, to rally opposition, deriding the budget bill for what he asserted was excessive government spending.
GOP leaders dropped the health provisions, prompting Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) to say on X that Musk “tweeted to kill” the bipartisan health policies that Congress had hammered out.
But Democrats’ focus on health care has cut both ways. Their messaging amid efforts to save the ACA from repeal and to preserve the law’s protections for those with preexisting conditions helped the party take back the House in the 2018 midterm elections. “I still have PTSD from the experience,” Republican Mike Johnson, now the House speaker, said recently.
And voters want relief. Six in 10 Americans are extremely or very worried about health care costs rising next year, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.
Hagen Wenzek, 56, is among them. The chief executive of GI Digital, a high-tech startup, felt a pain in his calf in late summer and asked OpenAI’s ChatGPT what it might be. It suggested he could have deep-vein thrombosis, or a blood clot. He went to the emergency room and obtained an ultrasound that confirmed the diagnosis, so doctors monitored him and gave him blood thinners.
His insurance was billed $7,422, and Wenzek got a bill for $890. The average cost of an ultrasound is about $400 without insurance, according to GoodRx, a digital health platform.
“The hospital is making thousands for a procedure that costs $500. It’s kind of ridiculous,” said Wenzek, of Sleepy Hollow, New York. “I have a $40 copay just to go see a doctor for anything, and I’m on a startup budget.”
‘Defending the status quo’
The lack of bolder ideas to tackle spiraling costs could also work against Democrats, some critics say. Comedian and political commentator Jon Stewart, in an episode of his podcast in October, accused Democrats of committing “malpractice” by not presenting ideas to fix what people hate about the health care system. Instead, he said, they’re shutting the government down to protect a system that voters already believe is failing them.
“Once again, the Democrats are in a position of defending the status quo of policies that most people in the United States think suck,” he said. “Meanwhile, on the same day, Trump rolls out TrumpRx. Hey, I’ll just threaten Pfizer with 100% tariffs and then just open up a prescription drug outside of the middle managers and sell directly to the public at a discount.”
TrumpRx, which is intended to help patients find lower-priced drugs, and pledges by Big Pharma to lower drug prices could help the GOP with voters, though Democrats are also hammering Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the bill the president signed into law in July that reduces Medicaid spending by about $1 trillion over a decade.
Republicans are promising fixes, using the shutdown to try to leverage voter frustration. Vice President JD Vance said on Newsmax in October that “we do have a plan, actually,” in reference to a question about health care reform. (Trump has promised repeatedly that he would produce a plan to replace the ACA but never has.)
Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on CNBC in October that Trump wants to overhaul the ACA and “give people health insurance that is higher-quality and more affordable.”
The White House did not respond to an email requesting comment from Vance.
“It’s not that Democrats are focusing on tax credits to the exclusion of bigger, bolder reforms,” said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA. “If you can get the conversation on health care, if we can prevent premiums from spiking, then we can focus on why health care costs so darn much to begin with.”
But some Democrats say voters are hurting and want bigger and bolder ideas now. Earlier this year, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said on the podcast “Fast Politics” that the party needs to offer more on health care in the next election.
“I’ll tell you what people are going to expect,” he said. “They’re not going to expect us to tinker around the edge with the ACA. They’re going to expect universal health care.”
For now, at least, there are more innovative ideas in states. Oregon has established a governing board to set up a single-payer health system in which the state would take on health care financing — eliminating private insurance, premiums, and all deductibles for all residents as soon as 2027. The question is whether it will work. Vermont abandoned a similar effort in 2014.
“With the political environment we’re in, there isn’t currently an appetite for big reform, but we know it needs to happen,” said Mona Shah, the senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, a health advocacy group. “Across party lines, people want government intervention in health care and people want universal coverage. The pain point that people are feeling, the public sentiment is where we were at before the ACA.”

For years they coexisted with an oil company — until one day they couldn’t.,"Richard Hodgson rounds up cows on his New Mexico ranch. (Jerry Redfern/Capital and Main)About two months ago, a slow fall hit rock bottom for Richard Hodgson and his son Kaleb Hodgson when a white pickup truck drove through the middle of an elk hunt on their property in far northwest New Mexico. Elk scattered, their hunting clients left, and the Hodgsons realized that the oil companies that had drilled their land for decades might not be their friends after all.
“It just drives me totally insane,” Richard said.
He’s the patriarch of three generations of Hodgsons who live on a spread he started 42 years ago in the high, dry country he loves. Richard was born and grew up in nearby Farmington but always wanted to be a cowboy in the San Juan Basin, among the region’s green and tan mesas under an electric blue sky.
As a young man he bought the ranch’s initial parcel with money made from driving trucks and working as a roustabout for oil and gas companies. In lean ranching years he’d go back to the oil patch for the money, using that to buy more land.
Today the family runs around 200 mother and calf pairs on the 5,600 acres it owns and roughly 32,000 it leases from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. And everywhere you look on that land, there’s an oil or gas well — the family doesn’t know how many. “I don’t know if we really want to know,” said Kaleb, Richard’s eldest son. “It’s kind of overwhelming, honestly.”
Kaleb said a movie crew came to the ranch a few years ago to shoot scenes for a film and loved the place — but won’t be back. Crew members told him it cost too much to digitally remove all the wells that appeared in the background.
Father and son think they have room enough to run another 60 to 100 cow-calf pairs, but recent droughts have shriveled the forage and dried up the natural watering holes. The oil and gas that come out of the ground in the San Juan Basin contribute to the changing climate that’s drying the region. This summer, the dust was so thick on the grass that it wore down the cows’ teeth. “It takes years off their life,” Kaleb said.
“Everything’s an uphill battle out here,” Richard said. “All I ask for is respect.”

Kaleb Hodgson, Luke Whitley and Richard Hodgson stand in a pasture on the Hodgson ranch. Years ago, the well tanks behind them leaked and flooded the pasture with produced water and oil.
And the family feels it isn’t getting any from its biggest neighbor, Hilcorp Energy Co. The Houston-based company is one of the largest privately held oil and gas producers in the country, with operations in nine states. In 2017 the company began a massive acquisition campaign in the San Juan Basin when it bought ConocoPhillips’ assets. In the New Mexico portion of the basin, it now operates 11,400 wells. Roughly 1,600 of them pepper the area on and around the Hodgsons’ lands.
Hilcorp and the Hodgsons are close neighbors because of a legal quirk called a split estate, under which the property rights to the surface land are separate from those of the minerals that lie beneath. The Hodgsons own the surface rights, and the federal government owns the underlying mineral rights, which, in this area, it leases primarily to Hilcorp. By law, landowners must allow subsurface rights owners to have access to those minerals. For the Hodgsons, that access takes shape in a spiderweb of roads and wells stitching their thousands of acres of pine-dotted mesas and valleys.
For years, that arrangement between the Hodgsons and Hilcorp worked —  until very recently, when it didn’t.
Hilcorp did not respond to Capital & Main’s repeated requests for comment.

Over the years, relations with oil companies were manageable, if not always great.
Richard recalled his days as a roustabout and truck driver decades ago and what he called the industry’s almost complete lack of environmental controls at the time.
One example: He said that companies used natural gas to flush out newly drilled wells, then lit the polluted mixture on fire in massive flares. “This whole country at night was orange,” he said. “It was so wasteful.”

Another example: Wastewater from oil production — often called produced water and  laden with hydrogen sulfide — was dumped in ditches and ponds throughout the region. “I done it. I was sent out to do it,” Richard said. He’s sure that all of the ground beneath waste pits near older wells are contaminated from that dumping.
Another example: A few years ago, he watched a neighbor’s cow drink from a puddle of filthy water pooled beneath a pumpjack. The cow stumbled off, bellowing, then fell in a ditch and died.
And another: On a hot summer day, before he could grab its collar, one of Richard’s dogs jumped into an open waste pit to cool off. The dog swam around and came out covered in grease, immediately got sick and went deaf. The dog lived for a couple of years before it was run over by a truck it couldn’t hear.
One more: In November, 2023, there was a spill at a well he could see from his front door. He worked for a whole day alongside a crew hired by Hilcorp to dig out 1,000 yards of petroleum soaked soil. “We got out of the hole, and everybody had a headache [from the fumes]. It was that dirty,” he said.
Richard said he left for a few hours. When he returned, the company had fenced off the pit and said their work was done. In April, 2024, Richard called the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division — the state’s primary oilfield enforcer — to get Hilcorp to remove more contaminated soil. Nothing more was removed, and two weeks later Hilcorp submitted a closure report to the Division, saying the company had finished its cleanup work. The Division closed the case the same day. The Division’s response read, in part, “Since the release occurred within an area reasonably needed for production operations (on-pad), the reclamation report will be due after the gas well has been plugged and abandoned.” That may be a while. Last year the well produced 25,500,000 cubic feet of natural gas, worth roughly $56,000.
When a previous company wanted to put a well atop the untouched mesa behind Richard’s home, he offered a spot at the base of the mesa, 500 feet from his front door. “I’d rather have that than destroy this last piece of land we got,” he said. There are now 30 active gas wells within a mile of Richard’s house.
The family coped with all of it over the years with different companies.
“We did have a good working relationship to them,” Kaleb said.

And the Hodgsons do a lot of work in their three main businesses on the ranch: raising cattle, hosting elk hunts and maintaining the maze of dirt roads connecting all the wells on the property. That maintenance happens — happened — through a long-running series of agreements with oil companies going back years.
Richard and Kaleb said that earlier this year, a new landman — the person companies hire to deal with landowners — began slowly cutting them off. They don’t know why. The landman didn’t take their calls. He said if the Hodgsons had anything to say, they could call Hilcorp’s lawyers.
The Hodgsons said Hilcorp also canceled its agreement with them to maintain the roads on the property. In addition to clearing access to the wells, that work channeled the region’s intermittent — and occasionally torrential — rains off the roads and well pads and onto surrounding grasslands. The work was good for the oil crews, good for the Hodgsons and good for the livestock and wild game. Plus, there was no way the Hodgsons could afford to do the work without the contract.
“They come up fighting like I’ve never seen an oil company do after 40 years,” Richard said. “I’ve never had a company just stomp their feet … and say, ‘We ain’t going to deal with you.’”
In September, after months of deteriorating relations with Hilcorp, a line was crossed.
The Hodgsons nurture the elk population on their land. “We take care of them all year round,” Richard said. “We provide feed, shelter and water. And then we do harvest some.” Hunters pay thousands of dollars for that privilege. But it’s not easy to track wild animals over thousands of acres, and successful hunts aren’t guaranteed. Many factors can spoil a hunt.
To keep some variables in their favor, every year Richard and Kaleb have negotiated with Hilcorp and its predecessor companies to keep trucks off certain roads in the early mornings and early evenings. That allows elk to gather in herds to eat and drink, increasing the chance that hunters can find them amid the mesas. Kaleb said he texted the landman the day before a scheduled bow hunt, asking Hilcorp to keep trucks away from specific areas, and the landman agreed.
It was 6 a.m. the next day, just before dawn. One of Kaleb’s nephews was walking slowly between pine and cedar trees in the faint light atop a mesa, leading a small group of bow hunters. They had spent the night in a camp to be ready at first light. At that point, they could see elk gathering in the valley below.
Then they heard a truck, and the elk scattered.
The nephew texted Kaleb to explain what happened, but the damage was done. The hunters hiked to the next valley over, hoping to find more elk, but didn’t.
“We’ve had these hunters for five years,” Richard said. “They’ve always paid a deposit for next year, and [this time] they didn’t pay no deposits. I don’t think they’re coming back.”
The spoiled hunt was a clarion call for the family. “It showed us that they put a bullseye on us,” Richard said.
Meanwhile, other problems grew. A week and a half after the botched hunt, water from a colossal cloudburst ran off the mesa behind their houses, washed over one of the untended roads and flooded a well pad with two and a half feet of water. The water flushed the sludge from two open-top below-ground storage tanks, creating a pond of black goo. Kaleb kept a mason jar filled with a sample, which had the consistency of old motor oil.

Several days later, while standing next to the muddy well pad, Kaleb explained how much waste Hilcorp told him was flushed from the tanks. “They say it was only 21 barrels, but it covered that whole entire berm,” he said. At two and a half feet deep, the 5,400-square-foot area inside the berm could hold roughly 2,400 barrels of liquid.
Kaleb said that much of the oil and water simply sank into the ground. As he spoke, workers from a cleanup company shoveled contaminated soil into a vacuum truck that could hold 80 barrels, the second that Kaleb had seen at the site.
“Contaminated dirt should have been dug out,” he said.
Kaleb said he sees the resulting problem as twofold. There’s the obvious groundwater contamination from the spilled sludge, and then there’s the wasted rain water. If the roads had been maintained, the runoff would have bypassed the well pad and filled a pasture the Hodgsons have nurtured over the years, turning two hundred acres of scrubby dirt to a grassland that feeds cattle and other animals.
“We wasted all that water,” Kaleb said. And the waste may have polluted the land where the family’s cattle and elk graze.

Though Hilcorp didn’t respond to requests for comment for this story, after Capital & Main visited the ranch, the Hodgsons said company representatives asked them if they had been talking with journalists. “I think we somewhat got their attention,” Richard said.
He said Hilcorp sent a new landman, who allowed the Hodgsons to fix the washed-out road near the flooded well pad so it wouldn’t flood again. Hilcorp also tested the soil there. “They did some core drilling, but I won’t accept that,” Richard said. “We’ll have to dig it out and find out what we got.”
He said Hilcorp also hired a company to take care of another spill he recently came across. After months of problems, Richard and Kaleb are skeptical of the quick about-face.
“They’re getting really worried about these spills because they know that I’m upset, and I’m going to make some noise,” Richard said.
“I’m not saying, ‘Do not drill.’ I’m just saying, ‘Do it reasonably,’” he added. “I mean, hell, the country’s making you just very, very wealthy. Why would you not put a little bit back into what you tear up?” he asked. “That’s all I want these companies to do. Just be reasonable.”
After the Hilcorp truck spoiled the elk hunt, Richard and Kaleb got in touch with their nearest neighbors, Don and Jane Schreiber, who live about 15 miles away. “There are not very many of us that live out here,” Richard said. “So anybody who can live out here and appreciate the land is a friend of mine.”
The Schreibers are known for fighting oil and gas companies that thoughtlessly drill or poorly maintain wells on their land. And like Richard, Don grew up in Farmington and harbored a dream of running a ranch. Also, like the Hodgsons, the Schreibers’ own land is split-estate.

The Schreibers bought their ranch in 1999 and over the years they have slowly sold off their cattle and leased the land to other ranchers. “I turned my back on my dream,” Don said. Instead, they spend much of their time raising awareness about how oil and gas drilling has degraded the landscape in the northwest corner of the state.
“We had two blissful years out here,” Don said of their earliest ranching days. “But then the fights started.”
He said a childhood friend who worked for an oil company explained to him what companies thought of the Schreibers’ ranch and lands like it: “Pard, I don’t want to hurt your feelings, but we’d just as soon have this S.O.B. paved.”
After a half-dozen years of contesting sporadic oil and gas well proposals on their land — which they lost — the Schreibers’ big fights with oil and gas companies began in earnest in late 2007, when a company proposed drilling 44 new wells on their property. The Schreibers thought most of those should be “twinned,” by adding the new wells to existing well sites, which would preserve untouched ranch land from more well pads and connecting roads. After an “intense fight,” the company put in just 22 new wells, all “twinned” on existing pads, Don said.
“So in the end, we did win,” he said. But, he added, “I mean, every time you drill a well, you lose a bit.”
Over the years, Don and Jane recorded each tussle, filling binders with letters, emails and documents recording the slow but relentless fights to protect their land. Don also keeps a small display with photos of nine separate incidents in which he got a company to clean up an unacknowledged mess or unnecessary well. He shows it off at public meetings and to company representatives at their first meetings. He said its message for them is clear: “I don’t know if it’s gonna take four years or 14 years — we’re gonna beat you.” In his experience, constant, determined pressure gets a company to do what you want it to do.
It’s a style of work familiar to the Hodgsons.
In late September on an afternoon spent driving to a far corner of the ranch, a thin column of diesel smoke from a distant fracking site was the only thing that marred a crisply blue sky. The San Juan Mountains in southern Colorado sketched a dark jagged blue line on the horizon. Richard, his grandson Luke Whitley and Kaleb were out to round up some cows that had wandered off a pasture.

Aside from their Ford dually pickup and cellphones peeking from their pockets, the three could have walked off a Western film set a century ago. Each wore a cowboy hat — Kaleb’s in black felt — as well as scuffed boots with worn spurs. Later, they donned scarred chaps to protect their pants from the sage, juniper and piñon trees. Three calm horses and a clutch of excitable ranch dogs rode in the trailer behind. The leather on the horses’ saddles was dull on the sides and polished in the seats from years of use.
As he drove, Kaleb described how he and his family trained horses — an integral part of running the ranch.
“Horses are very smart, complicated animals. But also they’re very simple,” he said. “They react off of your pressure.” Pressure from the reins, pressure through the knees. Pressure and release. Slowly pressure the horse in the direction you want it to go — then release the pressure.
“You do that a few times. And then you ask for half an inch. And then you do that a few times and you work your way up to an inch. Then you’re asking at the end of it for a foot,” he said.
Kaleb said all horses react to pressure and release in some way. “Even bucking horses,” he said. “They’ll react to pressure and release if you’re just consistent with it.”
Eventually, no matter how big or powerful the horse, careful, determined pressure gets it to do what you want it to do.
The same principle appears to be working in their relationship with Hilcorp.
After meeting with the Schreibers and calling Capital & Main, the Hodgsons said Hilcorp honored their recent late-September elk hunt hours and have been working on the spill sites. But Kaleb and Richard remain ready to apply more pressure.
“I don’t know where we’re going to go with all of it,” Richard said. “[We’re] just not letting anything lie.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/featureHodgson_Ranch_14-scaled-1-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-11-10 08:00:54.850821

It also has offered visitors as well as museum staff an opportunity to hear directly from veterans who fought in the war. That’s not a possibility for other exhibits at the museum, which has artifacts from every war South Carolinians have fought in, starting with the American Revolution.
Veterans Day marks three years since the exhibit, titled “A War with No Front Lines: South Carolina and the Vietnam War, 1965-1973,” opened inside the South Carolina Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum.
The exhibit includes the uniform once worn by retired Capt. Linda Sharp in 1967 and 1968, when she was a nurse at the 67th Evacuation Hospital in Qui Nhon. That’s been available for all visitors to see.

But she’s also talked in person about her experiences — not just about the soldiers and South Vietnamese civilians who came to her for treatment or the horrors of war but also day-to-day life for her and her fellow medics.
“She didn’t only talk about how hard it was and what they did, but what it was like: going to the (post exchange) for drinks, playing music, sometimes going out by helicopter to certain sites,” said Allen Roberson, the museum’s director.
Also on display is the pistol C.W. Bowman carried as a “tunnel rat” with the 9th Infantry, climbing into the dark narrow tunnels dug by the Vietcong.
People who heard him speak got a deeper glimpse of what he encountered in those tunnels, including booby traps full of venomous snakes and the time he fell through a trap door not knowing if he would make it back out.
He also talked about the darker mental health troubles he developed and had to overcome when he came home.
And then there’s the unofficial tiger-striped uniform worn by Lt. Andy Rice, who was part of a small unit dropped by helicopter behind enemy lines.

According to Roberson, Rice talked about spending the night neck deep in the swamp to avoid enemy patrols as well as happening across a castle-like building in the middle of the jungle inhabited by French Catholic nuns.
”You meet a fellow of a certain age inColumbia, you absolutely do not know what he might have been doing in the 1960s and what he might have had to endure,” said Joe Long, one of the museum’s tour guides.
Many of the veterans’ stories have been captured on tape by Fritz Hamer, another of the museum’s employees who conducted interviews with some 70 veterans.
Hamer said he heard over and over again from veterans about the stifling humidity and the distinct musty, oily smell that hit them as soon as they stepped off the transport plane. They’d talk about walking through the jungle with 80 pounds of equipment and ammunition on their backs. And they’d share pictures of the rice fields during the rainy season or the South Vietnamese and how they lived.
Hamer said he considers this the golden age of the Vietnam war veteran as many grow older and are more willing to talk about what it was like.

“We’ve really gotten into a part of military history that had largely been ignored until the last decade,” he said.
“It also helps people understand we are a museum that looks at all aspects of South Carolina’s military history,” Hamer added. “I see it as helping to change the minds of people about the direction this place is going.”
Founded in 1896, the Confederate Relic Room — initially housed inside the Statehouse — has been inside the State Museum building, through a separate entrance, since 2002.
The museum faced controversy it never asked for in 2015, when legislators sent the museum the last Confederate flag flown by the state on Statehouse grounds. The flag was removed — pole and all — in the wake of the June 2015 massacre at a historic Black church in Charleston by an avowed white supremacist who gunned down nine people.
Amid the debate, the number of visitors in 2015 dropped below 20,000 for the first time in a decade.
The museum worked to recover but it suffered more issues from a burst pipe in 2019 that flooded the exhibit room. Then in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to close.
But when the Vietnam exhibit finally did open, it was seen as a major success.
Over the exhibit’s first two years, annual attendance at the museum tucked away inside the historic Mills Building, originally a textile mill that opened in 1893, has grown to more than 41,000 annual visits.
That’s a more than 50% increase over the 27,000 visitors the museum saw between July 2022 and June 2023.
And despite being closed for six months for renovations to the building, the Relic Room still logged about 31,000 visitors between July 2024 and June 2025.
“This really brought us out,” Roberson said, reminding people that the Relic Room is not limited to its namesake war.
“All I used to hear is ‘The confederate museum? I’ve never been there. I don’t really care about the Civil War,’” said Roberson.
With the Vietnam exhibit, he added, “All of a sudden, you know us for something else.”
The exhibit was supposed to be temporary, but the end date kept getting pushed back. Now there is no timeline for replacing it.

Which is why the state needs to invest in renewable energy, the authors write. (Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Maryland is making bold moves. With new investments pouring into artificial intelligence and  quantum technology research, our state is positioning itself as a national leader in the industries of  tomorrow. This is an exciting and necessary step — these technologies will shape the next generation  of health care, national security, finance and countless other fields.
But as we chart this path toward a  more innovative future, it’s critical that we don’t leave one essential pillar behind: clean energy and  energy storage. For Maryland to be a hub in AI technology, it must also be a leader in the energy systems that will  power it.
The reason is both practical and moral. AI data centers, high-performance quantum  computers and advanced manufacturing hubs consume staggering amounts of electricity. As AI models grow larger and more powerful, and as quantum computers begin moving from research labs  into operational facilities, their energy needs will only surge. Without a robust, sustainable energy  infrastructure, Maryland risks creating an innovation ecosystem that is ultimately unsustainable.
Clean energy isn’t just about climate commitments —it’s about economic resilience, energy  independence and long-term competitiveness. States that lead in renewable energy and energy storage  technologies will be the states that attract future-focused industries. Already, the Department of  Energy (DOE) has highlighted energy storage as a key enabler of grid reliability and economic growth.

The Energy Storage Grand Challenge (ESGC) focuses resources from across the DOE to create a  comprehensive program to accelerate the development, commercialization and utilization of next-generation energy storage technologies and sustain American global leadership in energy storage.  Therefore, enhanced efforts are required to transition technology from the lab to the marketplace and  to facilitate manufacturing at scale. Similarly, the DOE Long Duration Storage Shot (LDS) aims to  reduce storage costs by 90% for systems that deliver 10+ hours of electricity within the decade.
Maryland has made admirable progress in clean energy, with many projects underway and aggressive  climate targets on the books. But to truly match its ambitions in AI and quantum, the state must equally  prioritize research and development in advanced energy storage, grid modernization, and clean  generation technologies. Public universities, national labs, and private companies need support to  pioneer new battery chemistries, scalable grid storage solutions and AI-driven grid optimization tools.
Imagine a Maryland where AI breakthroughs help predict energy demand spikes, where quantum  computers model new solar cell materials, and where locally developed long-duration energy storage  systems keep our power grid clean, stable, and resilient — even in the face of rising demand. This  isn’t a distant fantasy. It’s a future we can build, but only if we invest wisely today.
Maryland has seen significant successes in clean energy technology, particularly in the battery and  solar sectors. Companies like Saft and Ion Storage Systems are leading innovators in battery technology. Solar power is the state’s largest renewable energy source, with a significant installed  capacity. By the end of 2024, Maryland had installed 1,750 megawatts of solar power, making it the  largest source of renewable energy. Similarly, the POWER Act, set a target for Maryland to generate  8.5 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2031.
To date, the offshore wind supply chain has brought over $815 millionin investments to the state, which  includes millions of dollars to redevelop Baltimore County’s industrial waterfront for offshore-wind steel manufacturing and component staging, a high-voltage cable manufacturing facility in Baltimore  City, an additional $25 million in public funding to strengthen the state’s union workforce, and $11 million toward  environmental research through the University of Maryland.
It would be shortsighted to invest heavily in energy-intensive technologies without ensuring the  sustainability of the energy systems that support them. Maryland has the chance to be a model for how  to do both — to be a state where cutting-edge tech doesn’t just consume resources, but actively drives  cleaner, smarter, and fairer energy solutions.
Even in times of fiscal and budgetary challenges,  the Maryland Energy Innovation Institute (MEI2) and the Maryland Energy Innovation Accelerator  (MEIA) continue to play a key role in supporting new clean energy technologies, fostering an energy  innovation ecosystem that has launched 66 companies.
In the race for the future, it won’t be enough to lead in AI or quantum alone. The true leaders will  understand how deeply technology and energy are intertwined and build their innovation economies  with that in mind. Maryland can — and should — be one of them.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/solarwind2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 08:00:54.850821

There was a time during the early 1990s recession when I lost my job (through no fault of my own) and my family unexpectedly found ourselves needing to apply for assistance.
Our son was less than two years old, and although I was eligible for unemployment benefits, it took months for them to come, in part because we had moved from another state and Vermont unemployment needed wage information from my last job in that state, even though the job I lost was in Vermont.
Because of the delay, we used up any savings we had to pay our rent and bills.  I had some shares in my parents’ company that I sold back to pay off our (only) car, and my parents also helped us a little financially.

I looked for work every day and we reduced our spending as much as possible. My wife, who had not grown up in the same income bracket, taught me about shopping at thrift and consignment shops, the “banged and dented” grocery store, and getting day-old bread from the “bread store” on the Barre-Montpelier Road. Eventually, we moved from our apartment into a more affordable mobile home.
When my unemployment was nearing an end, I started working part-time cleaning doctors’ offices at night and for a while I had three part-time jobs at the same time. My wife tried providing day care for a few neighbors’ kids and then found a job during the day so we could alternate taking care of our son. When our jobs overlapped, my mother-in-law pitched in to help.
Despite all of that, we still found ourselves needing assistance from government programs like food stamps, fuel assistance and commodities, just to make ends meet. It was not for lack of work or unnecessary spending or any of the other reasons I frequently see people using to shame our fellow Vermonters who find themselves in need of assistance to take care of their family.
The hard truth is that too many jobs simply do not pay enough and no doubt since the early 1990s it has only gotten worse.
It was hard for us. I can only imagine how much harder it is for single parents, the elderly and people with disabilities, who are the majority of SNAP recipients. As the saying goes, “there but for the grace of God go I,” and a little compassion and empathy would go a long way.

Attorney General Nick Brown has proposed new advice for locales on how to interpret state public records law, with a focus on providing records faster. The rules Brown is proposing don’t change the state’s Public Records Act. They only serve as a guide for state and local governments on how to comply.
Open government advocates support the changes. Government officials are skeptical.
One of Brown’s bigger recommendations is to triage public disclosure requests so simple asks for one document can be provided faster than complex requests seeking, for example, thousands of pages or hard-to-find records. 
Under the current system, narrower requests can sit for months, even years, while records officers deal with difficult ones first-come-first-serve. The newly proposed rules push agencies to provide records within five business days if the request is for a “single, specific, identifiable record.”
Another notable revision would raise the bar for disclosing requests to third parties named in the records. Letting people know about the requests allows them to seek a court order to prevent the information’s release.
The current criteria for notification are “information that may affect rights of others and may be exempt from disclosure.” 
The new rules would shift that to say that the trigger is disclosure of information that “may substantially and irreparably damage any person or vital governmental function.” They also add “an agency should have a reasonable belief that the records are arguably exempt from disclosure” before giving third-party notice. These notices can slow the fulfillment of requests.
“Third-party notification that a public records request has been made should be the exception of the rule,” Colette Weeks, executive director of the Washington Coalition for Open Government, said in a hearing last Thursday. “It needlessly delays the process.”
Other changes make clear agencies need to deliver records “promptly” and provide clearer guidelines for what is said in letters closing records requests, in line with a 2024 state Supreme Court decision.
Clerks who handle these requests expressed concerns, saying the rules would require more resources than agencies have. They worry the triage proposal, for example, “will create more problems than it will solve,” said Candice Bock, director of government relations at the Association of Washington Cities.
“These provisions rely on subjective, ill-defined standards, but the main problem with them is that they contradict the spirit and letter of the law they are supposed to implement by requiring the government to discriminate between requesters in new ways,” said Paul White, deputy city clerk in Lacey.
Justin Leighton, executive director of the Washington State Transit Association, called the revisions an “overreach of the administrative rulemaking process.” He argued the changes proposed should be made through legislation.
The new rules come after The Seattle Times and other news outlets asked for them to be revised to address delays journalists faced when requesting public records. The media organizations argued the current rules were vague and allowed for logjams that slowed disclosure.
“We routinely request access to government records, and we don’t do it to pester or unduly burden civil servants, but to illuminate issues of great importance,” Seattle Times Executive Editor Michele Matassa Flores said. 
“Washington state has long been cited for its high standard of government transparency, and for the most part, it lives up to that reputation,” she added. “Please help us avoid losing that distinction and approve these updated rules so our public agencies remain as transparent as the law and democracy dictate.”
Written comments will be accepted until Nov. 17, before the changes are finalized.
Rising demand
Most records held by public agencies are available via record requests. This can include not just documents but also video recordings and communications like text messages and emails.
The number of requests governments are dealing with are growing, according to a state report surveying 230 public agencies subject to the Public Records Act. The law covers at least 2,400 government entities.
The surveyed agencies received almost 438,000 requests for public records in 2023, up from 383,000 in 2019, according to the report from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee. More and more are coming from individuals, insurers and law firms. Less than 2% come from self-identified members of the media.
Response times have been rising for years. In 2019, it took 15 days on average for agencies to provide records from the date of the request. In 2023, that was up to nearly 25 days, the audit found. Over half of the requests are closed within five days, the deadline for agencies to provide an initial response to requests.
Government agencies around the state are spending more money on public disclosure requests, with the sum rising from roughly $100 million in 2019 to nearly $137 million in 2023.
Voters approved Washington’s Public Records Act via ballot initiative in 1972. The Legislature has revised it numerous times since, adding many exemptions. 
This revision process began under then-Attorney General Bob Ferguson, now the governor. 
Brown is also creating a new unit within his office focused on public records and open government, set to be led by the agency’s first “chief transparency counsel.” At least 10 existing employees will staff the team.
The announcement of the new unit last week comes as records requests to the attorney general’s office spike, from 528 in 2014 to 1,032 last year.
“Transparency is a key part of the work we do every day to protect and support Washingtonians,” Brown said in a statement. “At a time of widespread mistrust in government, public access is as crucial as ever to let the public see our work for themselves.”
The Washington Coalition for Open Government applauded the move. 
“We look forward to working with this new unit to ensure that the public’s right to know what government is doing is not only protected but advanced,” the organization said in a statement.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/public-records-paper-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 07:17:49.418084

(Screenshot from livestream)Twenty minutes into the live video of the July 16 town council meeting in Lewisville, population 337, the four council members discussed what to do about two neighboring mobile homes where backyard trash is piling up and attracting rats. One of the homeowners, an older woman, also has four disabled cars parked in the driveway, two of which have expired plates, and engine parts blocking the path of meter readers.
After five minutes of discussion, including whether to mail the residents certified legal notices “to scare them a little bit,” council members decided on a kinder approach instead — email warnings with a number to call town council for assistance  —  even though some members said the elderly woman has refused help in the past.
The council moved on to other business when, 30 minutes later, an older woman photobombs the live meeting by entering a back door. She was not happy with what she saw at home on the town’s YouTube channel.
“Number one, I have never refused help,” the woman tells the council members as they turn around in their chairs to face their accuser. “I don’t have anybody’s phone number. I don’t know where anybody lives. I leave the house around 9:30, 10 o’clock in the morning. I don’t get home till midnight, one, two, three o’clock in the morning. Okay, like you said, I’m almost 67. You’re right, I’m old. I’ve got sciatic problems, I’ve got hip problems, I’ve got knee problems … ”
A calmer discussion eventually unfolded and the council agreed to a public call for volunteers to help the woman clean up her property.
Welcome to Indiana’s new livestreaming requirement for local government meetings. With nearly all 567 localities, 88 counties and 354 school districts now in compliance with a law that took effect July 1, keeping tabs on what your local officeholders are up to is as easy as sitting in front of your computer or TV screen.
“So now people are able to log on and see what their tax dollars are going for, what projects are important to their community and how to get involved if they see something that’s really important to them,” said State Rep. Ben Smaltz, R-Auburn, the chief sponsor of the bill. Seven other states have requirements for recording and archiving public meetings but, so far, only Indiana requires live access for nearly all meetings of local public officials.
Behind the benefits
Transparency and greater government accountability aren’t the only benefits of livestreamed meetings. The New York Coalition for Open Government, an upstate grassroots organization pushing their own state to adopt livestreaming requirements, has posted a list of 29, including better access for the elderly, disabled, immunocompromised, military service members abroad, “snowbirds” with more than one home, and people working long hours and evenings like the aggrieved woman in Lewisville.
Smaltz said he was inspired several years ago to initiate the proposal after talking to constituents in his district just north of Ft. Wayne. “What I learned from them was with the busy lifestyle we all seem to be living today — with kids’ activities and work, other volunteer things — that it’s really hard to be involved (in local government) and to know what’s going on.” Social media access, he decided, would certainly help.

Not all areas of Indiana, however, have access to live streaming. While Indiana received $868 million from former President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan a year ago to expand broadband into the state’s underserved areas, 140,000 Hoosier residents — most of them in rural areas — are still waiting for service as the program is rolled out over the next four years, according to the Indiana Broadband Office. For those areas, local governments are required to record their meetings and archive them for the public. 
Local officials say the transition to livestreaming has posed a few technical challenges but, overall, it has been an inexpensive means to increase public engagement. And in cities and towns where the software permits audience interaction, it has increased participation as well. 
Some of it unwanted.
In Greenwood, a suspected local gadfly hacked into the city’s YouTube channel and posted porn videos to liven up several town hall meetings. “So now we’ve got an IT person sitting in the control room monitoring that and they’re able to shut them off real quick,” said Greenwood Mayor Mike Myers.
Myers said the city’s Zoom meetings on YouTube have increased citizen involvement, especially on “hot topics.” Remote audience members can click an icon to “raise their hand” during meetings to ask a question or post a comment.
Consultants and experts outside the city can also participate in meetings while saving on their transportation time and costs, Myers said.
“If they want to testify about or talk about an item on the agenda that they’re a part of. This way they don’t have to fly all the way to Indiana,” he said, and added jokingly, “even if they’re on the North Side (of Indianapolis). We all know how easy it is to get from the North Side to the South Side.”

Rigging up recording equipment and generating the needed numbers of online subscribers have been challenges for smaller localities, said Becca McCuaig, legal counsel for Accelerate Indiana Municipalities. “YouTube requires you to have a certain number of subscribers in order for it to be able to go live. So (town) clerk-treasurers have helped each other get enough subscribers to make sure they’re meeting those requirements.”
Smaltz says livestreaming will help keep local governments accountable and citizens connected at a time when many rural areas are losing their local news coverage. Indiana has nine counties without a local news source and 42 others with only one, according to Local News Initiative, a database kept by Northwestern University. Due to recent state and federal funding cuts, several of Indiana’s 17 public radio stations are in peril as well. The Indiana NPR network recently eliminated its statewide reporting team because of the $3.7 million in cuts.
Besides serving year-round residents, Smaltz said, “it really takes away the geographic barrier of someone who’s interested in (a locality) because maybe they have two homes. They have one home in Indianapolis and one home in southern Indiana, or their family is from southern Indiana. This is going to let them keep that community connection.”
David Bottorff, executive director of the Association of Indiana Counties, says he doesn’t know of any counties that are tracking increases in attendance or viewership since the new law took effect. But he does know one thing – some county officials are now suiting up for meetings. “I’ve had one member say, ‘Yeah, I dress a little bit nicer now that I know it’s going to be broadcast.’”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-05-at-10.01.45 AM-e1762698193555-1024x503.jpeg,,,2025-11-10 07:17:49.418084

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer) Sid Allen did not set out on his 3D printing journey to manufacture firearm accessories in his garage.
Last year, he was printing custom Dungeons and Dragons figurines. For a decade before that, Allen, 28, was printing accessible attachments for his increasingly paralyzed father, who has since died from brain cancer: a gyroscopic mount so his cup wouldn’t fall over; stove knobs you don’t need to press to turn on; key pads for calling — “dozens, even hundreds, of things earlier on when he still had mobility.”
Allen, wearing his signature wizard hat, held his product: an AR-15 magazine speedloader, used to make reloading a firearm faster and easier, which his company, MangaBerry West, sells for $28 apiece. The speedloader is designed partly with accessibility in mind, he said, and can be used with limited hand mobility.
Allen and the other St. Cloud State University students who help with the business identify as leftists. Allen and Tarik Alduri, 23, said so discreetly at a recent St. Cloud gun show for fear of hurting business. But at home, Allen and Alduri, along with Riley Dahlberg, 20, freely discussed food stamps and taxes, President Donald Trump’s immigration policies and their gripes with the Democratic Party. Allen is the president, and Dahlberg vice president, of the St. Cloud College Democrats even though they are left of the party establishment on most issues.
When asked if they identify as Democrats, they took a lesser-of-two-evils stance and enthused about ranked-choice voting, which they said would allow for greater political diversity beyond a two-party system.
“What else are we gonna do? I’m not voting for Trump,” Alduri said.
Still, they decried Democrats’ move to make gun control a purity test, shutting the door on potential Democrats by turning “small gaps into massive issues,” especially given Republicans’ willingness to accept a wider range of views on many issues, Alduri said. “I think it’s sad that we have gotten to this point where the left thinks that they’re not allowed to own guns in order to stay aligned Democratic Party.”
Their disgruntled, arms-length acceptance of the Democrats underscores the party’s problem with young men, who left in droves in 2024.
Although Democrats had a good night during last week’s elections, the 2026 midterm will be a more significant test following 2024’s collapse: Six in 10 white men under 30 voted for Trump, while the president claimed half of young Hispanic men and one-third of under-30 Black men, according to the Associated Press.
Having lost a defining election to Trump, Democrats find themselves forced to ask how to broaden their tent — and whether that means inviting in gun rights advocates the party has largely shunned for more than a decade.

Defending the right to own assault weapons
Gov. Tim Walz embodies the Democrats massive shift on guns: His marksmanship and support for gun rights was a selling point when he ran for Congress in a rural swing district in 2006, and he earned an ‘A’ rating from the NRA. Walz was among the gun-friendly Democrats recruited and elected after the party blamed gun control for Al Gore’s loss in 2000, especially in rural America.
After Sandy Hook and especially the Parkland school shootings, Walz embraced gun control, and now he’s made it a centerpiece of his reelection campaign. He hosted a town hall in October with Gabby Giffords, his former congressional colleague who became a gun control activist after she was shot in a mass shooting; on Thursday night, First Lady Gwen Walz and DFL leaders held another town hall on gun violence.
After the mass shooting at Annunciation Church in August, which left two children dead and 21 others injured, Walz and Democrat lawmakers called for a ban on semi-automatic military-style assault weapons, defined in Minnesota law by a list of 17 firearm models and their offshoots, including AK-47s and AR-15s.
Democrats passed and Walz signed gun control laws in the 2023 legislative session, including universal background checks for all gun purchases and a “red flag” law that allows judges to confiscate guns from people who are deemed a danger to themselves or others. But they stopped short of banning assault weapons, in part from fear of election backlash, and they’re unlikely to garner the bipartisan support needed to ban assault weapons this year or next.

An assault weapons ban would “be a massive hit to our business,” Alduri said.
Allen explained the manufacturing process in the crowded detached garage that doubles as a storage space, surrounded by beakers, leftover plastic and a custom-built UV oven made from two-by-fours. He first prints the parts with a resin 3D printer and then dips those parts into an acetone-based solvent mixture before curing them in the UV oven.
Not apparent in the garage was the painstaking months-long process of perfecting the model, which included experimenting with different mixes of resin and crafting an algorithm to correct the curvature that a line of bullets make when lined up. Not counting different resins, Allen estimated he’s made 300 prototypes before the current speedloader, which allows the user to push 15 dummy rounds into an AR-15 magazine with ease.
Modifying the current model for handguns would be another obstacle.
But their devotion to gun rights — including the right to own so-called assault rifles — goes beyond self-interest, they said.
“I don’t think the issue is guns,” Alduri said, sporting a MangaBerry West cap. “It’s the fact that we just don’t care about each other, and that’s what makes it easier for somebody like Trump to come in and have ICE agents running around straight up kidnapping people.”
Alduri’s mantra, which he said at the gun show and at home, where he and Allen are roommates, is that the two best things you can do as a citizen are to bring your neighbors cookies and buy a gun.
Cookies to build community, and a gun to protect that community.
“What we see right now in the U.S. is that there’s been this destruction of community because we’re all being worked to the bone by some billionaire,” Alduri said.
Alduri studies political science and international relations and wants to go into immigration law or politics. His parents immigrated from Bosnia and Iraq — both war-stricken places.
Alduri said the current political climate gives him reason to consider self-defense.
“Am I expected to trust the American government or American cops to protect me? No, I don’t, quite frankly,” Alduri said.

Many of his fellow Democrats seem to agree; gun ownership is rising among Democrats, the Wall Street Journal reported last year.
Dahlberg’s argument mirrors what Republican gun rights advocates often said during the Obama and Biden presidencies: that guns offer protection against a tyrannical government.
Even though “there’s this idea that the US military would just crush people,” Dahlberg said, the presence of guns “has ensured that tyranny hasn’t spread, because people think it wouldn’t go very well for them as a dictator” in a country with more civilian guns than people.
Improving social services
The focus of a government should be on improving the “material concerns of the citizenry,” said Alduri, instead of banning guns and inhibiting people’s Second Amendment rights — a sentiment that the three shared.
“Democrats love to pat themselves on the back and be like, ‘We did it, guys. We banned AR-15s.’ Never mind the starving kid that’s sitting outside, or the homeless encampment,” said Alduri.
Allen said he believes that focusing on guns is an excuse for Democrats to not tackle “the really tough issues that would need a raise in taxes,” such as expanding food stamps or access to health care. He added that he prioritizes expanding social services like food stamps over gun policy, even if it meant having a gun control policy “that I really strongly disagree with and think is harmful.”
Allen, for his part, said he feels jaded about America’s capitalistic system “because of the way it abused my father.” His father, Allen said, designed inventions as a consultant for tech companies but died “in destitute poverty” after the companies gave him low disability pay and a health insurer denied his care for brain cancer.
Allen is studying patent law and also wants to go into politics in the future.

Yes to some gun restrictions
The group doesn’t take gun ownership lightly, and they do agree with Democrats on certain gun restrictions. Binary triggers, which fire one shot when the trigger is pulled down and another upon release, “are an extremely bad idea and need to be illegal,” Allen said, since it forces the shooter to have to release a second round. “It’s inherently unsafe.”
A judge struck down Minnesota’s binary trigger ban in August, which was part of a 1,400-page 2024 omnibus bill, as a violation of the state constitution’s rule that legislation be about one subject only.
They also said they support laws mandating waiting periods before purchasing a gun and safe storage laws that would require that guns be kept in a gun safe.
“We have a lack of respect for guns,” Alduri said. “Americans love guns but we don’t really respect how dangerous of a weapon that is.”
Despite being in favor of higher taxes for more robust social services, which is at the core of Democratic identity, the MangaBerry West guys said they’ve been told by Democrats that they aren’t real Democrats because of their support for gun rights.
They opt to respond with subtlety rather than rhetorical firepower.
The group hosts backyard bonfires for the St. Cloud State debate team, and the conversation naturally turns to politics — but they avoid debating their friends, some of whom hold more mainstream Democratic views. Instead, in political discussions, they focus on “providing our ideas, and if we plant that seed in them, then maybe they’ll view it with more genuine curiosity,” Dahlberg said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MG_3565-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-10 07:17:49.418084

(Getty Images)In the run-up to the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers and the governor made a clear promise to deliver property tax relief for Hoosiers. Local leaders understand that commitment and are eager to provide efficiencies and relief where it makes sense. At the same time, many cities and towns around the state are now beginning to see the other side of the ledger come into focus.
As local governments move through their first full budget cycles under Senate Enrolled Act 1, a clear trend is emerging: the law significantly restricts long-term revenue growth at the very moment cities and towns are confronting rapidly rising costs. When revenue growth is compressed and fiscal uncertainty increases, the outcome is predictable — major cuts to local services.
Because employees account for the largest share of municipal budgets, hiring freezes and the anticipated elimination of positions have been the most common responses so far. But personnel decisions are only part of the story. New public safety buildings and equipment are being shelved, neighborhood sidewalk programs are being canceled, community amenities that were expected to open in 2026 are now on hold, and some communities can no longer afford to match Community Crossings grants needed to upgrade failing infrastructure.
If SEA 1 is not adjusted, what does the next decade look like on the ground?
It looks like delayed or canceled police and fire stations, and departments that can’t field enough personnel to meet call volumes. It looks like increased response times when seconds matter.
It looks like streets and roads going longer between repaving, and recent projects deteriorating faster because basic maintenance has been pushed off.
It looks like shuttered pools, reduced hours at parks and community centers, fewer programs for kids and seniors, and less support—both financial and in-kind—for the parades, festivals, and local events that define small-town Indiana and city neighborhoods alike.
Impacts coming 
None of this happens all at once. It happens quietly over time: a delayed hire here, a project that gets “pushed to next year,” a park program that doesn’t return. By the time the impact is obvious, turning around will be far more expensive.
These fiscal pressures are not confined to a single city or one part of Indiana. Under SEA 1, local leaders are wrestling with:

A lack of reliable state revenue projections for 2026, 2027, and 2028 income tax revenues, which makes responsible long-range budgeting far more difficult.
A new annual adoption process for the income tax that introduces instability, particularly for communities under 3,500 residents that must petition their counties each year for distributions.
Technical complications with debt coverage and TIF neutralization that put infrastructure and economic development projects at risk.

To be clear, local leaders are not opposed to tax reform. They are asking for balance. Communities across the state are already stretched thin as they work to meet residents’ expectations and maintain the amenities that attract new residents and businesses. Any tax reform must be crafted in a way that supports — rather than undermines — the fiscal health of municipalities. If state and local leaders approach the 2026 session with that shared understanding, it can be productive for everyone.
Modifications, not repeal
That is exactly the spirit in which Aim, Accelerate Indiana Municipalities, is engaging on SEA 1.
We are not asking lawmakers to repeal the law or abandon their policy goals. We are asking for targeted amendments that maintain the promise of tax relief while making SEA 1 workable for the cities and towns that must live under it.
In November, Aim is convening regional roundtables — including in Mishawaka and nine other communities — to hear in detail how SEA 1 is affecting local budgets and services on the ground. Based on what we are already hearing from our members, Aim has prepared a package of technical fixes to SEA 1: improvements to the annual adoption and distribution process; clearer and more dependable revenue projections; adjustments to rate splits so municipalities are not structurally disadvantaged; greater fiscal certainty for small communities; and corrections to debt-coverage and TIF provisions so local infrastructure and economic development tools continue to function as intended.
At the same time, we took seriously the message from lawmakers in 2025 that local government must continue to modernize and pursue efficiencies. Alongside our SEA 1 proposals, Aim is advancing a series of modernization and efficiency ideas to help local governments operate at an even more effective level. A key priority is updating the state’s government modernization statute to make it easier and more flexible for units to restructure, share services, and collaborate where it benefits taxpayers. We are also exploring streamlined service-delivery approaches and better use of technology and data so communities can stretch every dollar as far as possible.
The message is simple: the General Assembly sets the fiscal framework, and local leaders want to be partners in making that framework work. Aim is coming to the table with solutions on both sides of the equation — responsible, targeted fixes to SEA 1 and serious ideas to modernize and improve local government.
If we work together in 2026, Indiana can honor its commitment to taxpayers while still ensuring that cities and towns have the tools they need to provide core services and build the quality places where Hoosiers want to live and raise their families.

So she and her longtime partner, Anthony La Pietra, decided to give up and fund the entire operation themselves, cashing in La Pietra’s retirement to build a greenhouse in Adrian, an hour outside of Kansas City. 
After two years of “blood, sweat and tears,” they finally received the state’s final approval to begin operating on Sept. 3. But just hours after the state’s email arrived, a massive storm crushed one side of the greenhouse.  
“To go from such a high to such an incredibly bottom low…” she said. “It’s been such a roller coaster.”
Despite the setback, her family rallied to fix the wall, and now their business, Bud Wizard, is expected to have its first harvest in the coming weeks.
Blum’s facility is among the 12 microbusinesses the state has approved to begin operating out of 68 total licenses issued. Two are dispensaries. The rest are wholesale licenses like Blum’s that can grow up to 250 plants and manufacture marijuana products. 
The microbusiness program — sometimes called the social-equity cannabis program — was designed to boost opportunities in the industry for people in disadvantaged communities that have been most impacted by the war on drugs. It began in 2023, after passing as part of the constitutional amendment to legalize recreational marijuana in 2022.
Cannabis regulators concerned about predatory practices in Missouri’s social equity program

Up until this summer, the state had approved only a handful licenses to commence operations – which involves meeting rigorous health standards and security protocols. But in the past few months, the microbusiness community has finally started to fill in, with the state greenlighting a surge of cultivation licensees.
Like Blum, many of these owners stopped looking for funding and finally decided to put their life savings into getting the business off the ground. Now they’ve either had their first harvest this month or are expecting one in the next few weeks. 
James Mondl, owner of Klondike Cannabis micro cultivation facility in Farmington, just watched his first harvest ship Tuesday to another licensed facility for the manufacturing phase.
“I haven’t completely exhaled, to be honest,” he said. “We’ve got a lot of time and money in this, and so to see the product leave today was as big a step – maybe a bigger one than when we brought plants in.”
Wholesalers’ products can legally only go to the two operational microbusiness dispensaries at the moment: 816 Dispensary in Platte City and Kush 21 in Poplar Bluff. The Missouri Constitution mandates that micro cultivators only sell to micro dispensaries.
Lesley Turk, chief equity officer with the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation who oversees the program, says the success of the micro community is like a “puzzle” because it depends on enough growers and dispensaries being up and running at the same time. 
And both of them depend on the middleman – the manufacturers – or wholesalers who have gotten approval to make things like edibles and vapes.
“My excitement lies in the next six months,” Turk said.
As anticipation around more micros opening builds, so does the pressure to succeed. 
Some license owners have already hit a number of road blocks and aren’t sure how much more they can invest into getting the business off the ground. Sam Vosburg, whose cultivation facility in Aurora has been operational since March, fears he invested his retirement on a failed business. 
“We’re suffering right now,” Vosburg, owner of Ozark Mountain Gypsy LLC, told The Independent in October. “I don’t know how much longer I keep my lights on. Our electric bills are crazy, and we’re not making any money. So, yeah, it’s not looking good.”
However last week, Vosburg was approved to become one of the first two manufacturers, so he says he sees “a light at the end of the tunnel.”
Blum is the chairwoman of the Missouri Microbusiness Association, and she says her passion for the industry is a major driving force in making it through “one of the hardest things I’ve ever done in my entire life.” 
The other driver is her four daughters. 
“One day they’ll have dreams,” Blum said of her daughters, “and they’ll want to do something big, that’s insurmountable and accomplish it because they watched their mom and their dad accomplish it.”
 Winning the lottery

Jimi Poe is the owner of 816 Dispensary, which was the first micro dispensary to open its doors to the public on Aug. 16. He’s quickly become a pillar for the microbusiness community, as someone to not only buy wholesalers’ products but also offer guidance on getting started. 
“I’m not going to succeed if I can’t get wholesalers to succeed,” he said.
October was his biggest month yet, he said, with 1,500 transactions. He works closely with Blume LLC, one of the first operating wholesalers, because he says they’ve been “killing it” on their craft marijuana buds, or what the industry calls flower.
Up until now, a major challenge for Poe has been that no wholesale facility had the capability to manufacture products, such as edibles or vapes, because it can require expensive equipment. 
With the state approving Vosburg and Kansas-City area microbusiness Urban Farm to manufacture products, Poe only expects his sales to grow. Another one in the Farmington area, Levity Cannabis, has also applied for approval, according to the division. 
Nearly 20 years ago, Poe was sent to prison for 14 months on a non-violent marijuana felony – a charge that made it hard to find work or a place to live. Because the program aims to mend some of the harm marijuana prohibition has caused on people’s lives, his offense made him eligible to apply for the microbusiness program.
“When I was in prison, I was telling myself I was never going to sell cannabis again,” he said. “And now I’m legally able to sell cannabis at my own store. So it’s been a crazy journey, that is for sure.”
In 2023, Mitchell Alexander submitted one microbusiness application with his uncle, Jesse Greco, who qualifies for the program as a disabled veteran, and paid a $1,500 fee. Their application was entered into the lottery with more than 1,600 applications, and they were picked.
“He and I got together and decided to do it because we had nothing to lose,” Alexander said. “Because the lottery was: if you lose, you get your money back. If you win, you get your license.”
Alexander runs ReLeaf Dispensary in Kansas City, and he’s excited to grow in the way that he believes produces the best weed: living soil.
“No chemicals, no pesticides,” he said. “It’s literally, we’re just feeding the soil, and it’s as organic as it gets.”
For Greco, cannabis has always been something he turned to in his life for his PTSD, Alexander said. They’ve invested their own money and resources, and he’s optimistic about their first harvest that’s expected just before Christmas.

“We take so much pride in being completely independent,” he said. “We didn’t have any consulting groups help us out. We really just grassrooted this, and that’s exactly how we’re going to run this company.”
The team at Monsta Farms LLC in Sarcoxie has a similar mantra. It’s a group that includes two couples who’ve all pulled together their own money and time. They all have a “strength in the building,” said co-owner Chris Hampel, and everyone’s doing something they’re passionate about.
“I like watering the plants, for example,” Hampel said. “My wife hates watering the plants. But she’ll sit over there with dirt and pot plants all day long. And she loves that. I hate that.” 
However, they each balance their cannabis work with their fulltime jobs, including two who work as nurses. Their collective dream is to make it their fulltime jobs. 
They just had their first harvest on Monday.
Chad Sommer, an owner of Strainworx LLC in Lebanon, is also expecting his first harvest soon, he said, after two years of trying to keep “everything in check.” 
“I mean, trying to keep family in check, trying to keep my fulltime job in check, and then also wanting to try to build this out,” he said. 
His specialty is industrial automation systems, and it’s taken time to finetune that process, he said. He got into cannabis because he suffered from migraines. He realized a cannabis gummy worked a lot better at controlling them than the expensive shots he was receiving.
“So from that point, it’s held a special position in my heart,” Sommer said.
Now his migraines are gone. His team had to “hit several retirement funds,” to start up the business, but they’re optimistic.
“One thing that is a challenge is for many of the micros…starting resources,” he said. “It is a tough start. Everything is so expensive with the hope that one day you get a return.”
 Financial troubles

When Vosburg’s cultivation facility Ozark Mountain Gypsy LLC got its approval to open in March, he was feeling “very optimistic.” 
“The only thing I didn’t calculate was the delays from the state,” he said.
State marijuana rules mandate that regulators approve labels before products are sent to stores. And it took months for that approval to come back. 
“Now they’re putting all these tutorials on how to do this,” Vosburg said of the labels and packaging. “We were doing this from scratch with no help.” 
Turk said the division has worked to improve tutorials, and now each facility has a designated compliance representative who can help guide the micros through the labeling and packaging approval process. 
Another challenge for his team has been the lack of manufacturing equipment. It’s been hard to compete with the other companies that are selling only flower and pre-rolled joints. 
All together, Vosburg estimates they’ve put $500,000 of their own money into the business. And he fears they could lose it all at any moment. 
But as of last week, Vosburg was approved to manufacture products on a small scale, providing him with a way forward. 
“I could pay my electric bill if I can sell a few dabs by the end of the month,” he said.
Veteran David Huckins owns a dispensary license in Columbia with his wife, and they lead a weekly podcast to help microbusinesses share resources on a variety of topics.
But they aren’t anywhere close to being able to open, he said. 
While the cultivators can often find land to build a facility in rural areas, dispensaries need to be in places with high visibility and traffic. And that’s hard when landlords often don’t want to lease a building to dispensaries, Huckins said, and he can’t get capital to buy a building.
The Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation is not aware of any microbusinesses that have received loans from banks, a spokesperson said.
“It’s so hard for the cannabis businesses,” he said. “I don’t qualify for small business loans. So far, this has not been the blessing that I hoped it was going to be.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Brenton-e1762631157954-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-11-10 07:17:49.418084

Christopher Helali had been fascinated by Epstein and what his story said about global power and politics in today’s world. He took a chance on an eBay listing and picked up the artifact at the post office near his home in Vershire.

How did a Vershire man come to possess the address book of infamous pedophile, international financier and friend to the world’s most powerful people Jeffrey Epstein?
Why, eBay, of course. 
Five years ago, Christopher Helali saw the book for sale online and took a gamble, spending a few hundred bucks on the off chance the artifact was the real thing.
When the “little black book” filled with the contacts of the world’s most notorious sex criminal arrived in Vershire, Helali picked it up at the post office and opened it in gloves and a mask, careful not to leave fingerprints. Though at the time the veracity of the document remained in question, Helali himself was quickly convinced.
“Within a few moments, it was very much apparent that this was a legitimate item,” he recalled. He was in possession of the only known, publicly held object of its kind.
A general manager of an international law firm, a sometimes investigative journalist and the international secretary of the American Communist Party, Helali had long been interested in Epstein and what his story said about global power and politics today.
“I subscribe to the theories that there’s much more to the story than just a depraved and degenerate rapist and sexual predator,” Helali, who also serves as the elected high bailiff of Orange County, said in an interview in August.

In private life, Epstein entertained the rich and famous in his Manhattan townhouse — often called the borough’s largest — and on his private Caribbean island, Little Saint James. 
The first cracks in the billionaire’s mysterious facade appeared when police in Florida began investigating Epstein for sexually abusing underage girls in 2005. He later pleaded guilty to procuring a child for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute.
For more than a decade after, Epstein continued his life of luxury. But in 2019, he was charged federally on allegations he trafficked minors for sex, drawing international attention. He died in a New York jail cell the following month, and his death was ruled a suicide, though conspiracy theories abound about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death. 
The little black book arrived in Vershire the year after, and Helali began contacting Epstein experts, like the Miami Herald journalist Julie K. Brown; Brace Belden, co-host of the popular leftwing podcast TrueAnon; and reporters at Business Insider. 
In 2021, Business Insider produced a documentary short on Helali’s find and their successful effort to confirm its authenticity through forensic analysis. The book was first discovered on a Manhattan street in the 1990s, according to the documentary, and the woman who picked it off the sidewalk eventually put it up for sale online around the time of Epstein’s most recent arrest. 
Another little black book dating to the early-to-mid-2000s has drawn FBI attention and was published in redacted form by Gawker in 2015. But Helali said his version contains more than 200 additional names, expanding the scope of what’s known about Epstein’s network. Among those figures are actress Morgan Fairchild, investor Carl Icahn and former New Republic publisher Martin Peretz.
As a document, the book tells a story. A picture of an inner and outer circle emerges. Some names feature 10 phone numbers, according to Helali, and the book includes codes to buildings and hand-scribbled marginalia. There’s a list within the book of masseuses, but the names are coded, he said. 
“Donald Trump’s entry in this book is enormous, for example, and his name is highlighted,” Helali said. “I think that shows a layer of relations that the current president wants to distance himself from.”

Trump has said publicly his friendship with Epstein ended some 20 years ago, before Epstein’s legal troubles began, and that the two had a falling out.
Helali plans to use the book for his own reporting. Currently, he’s focused on one name he said is within Trump’s sphere, someone whom other journalists indicate was an associate of Epstein.
“There’s some more depth to what we can uncover, and I hope that we can continue to learn more,” he said. 
Epstein has become a fixture of American political discourse and the public imagination since his arrest and death in 2019, but attention has ratcheted up since Trump took office a second time. Since then, Democrats — and even some Republicans — in Washington have pushed for release of the government’s investigatory files on the disgraced billionaire financier, which are expected to contain mention of Trump. 
But Epstein is far from a partisan issue, and his network spanned political parties and even continents — former President Bill Clinton was a known associate. Prior to Trump’s second term, some Republicans similarly called for the release of the so-called Epstein Files, and the financier’s real crimes and dealings play into the popular rightwing conspiracy theory QAnon. 
“This is not only bipartisan,” Helali said. “This is the elite of the world.”
To Helali, the importance of the Epstein case is in understanding how a web of important  political leaders, academics, economists, financiers and intellectuals found themselves in the orbit of a man engaged in such sinister crimes. That is not to say all those who knew Epstein were complicit in his criminality, he emphasized. But current and former U.S. presidents, a former Israeli prime minister, a member of the British royal family and a Saudi Arabian prince have all been connected to the disgraced billionaire. 
“These are ultimately people involved in public life who are engaged in this activity, and they should be held accountable for what’s going on,” Helali said. “We need to understand as the public: What’s going on behind these closed doors? What’s going on on a private island where young girls are being trafficked?”
Having studied and photographed the address book, Helali has tried to sell it to no avail. There’s been no shortage of interest in the artifact, which an auction house valued at $75,000 or more, but interested buyers fear the book could be seized by the government, Helali said, or that they themselves could become subject to public dissection by theorists. 
Besides a dress jacket, few other objects owned by Epstein have ever been auctioned off. 
For now, Helali remains in possession of the book. And he thinks it’s possible that makes him a target. He said he’s regularly stopped at the border while traveling, though that may be because of his political activities.
“I think that certainly it hasn’t helped my situation, and it’s added even more questions,” Helali said of owning the little black book. “But in any case, I mean, I don’t think that there’s anything necessarily wrong with or illegal about, you know, having possession of an item that helps us with our work.”
While the subject of Epstein and his connection to the halls of power has gone quiet in the daily news cycle since this summer’s fever pitch, the saga sustains a perennial appeal for Helali and others like him. They believe there’s more going on behind the scenes than what most people imagine. To them, it’s clear, as long as you pay attention: In Epstein, the most far-fetched of conspiracies crystalize — if not in verifiable fact, then at least in circumstantial evidence. 
“The vast networks of financial interests, intelligence interests, and the military aspects that intersect with the media, with powerful people who can shape narratives and can shape people’s perceptions” all join together in the Epstein tale, Helali said. “What it ultimately raises the specter of is what people sometimes refer to as the deep state.”

This is a problem for Missouri Republicans, who demonstrated last legislative session that their top priority is not the business of the state and attending to Missourians’ needs, but the reinstatement of the abortion ban that voters just rejected. 
Because they know their constituents do not want the ban back in place, they have united on a strategy of deception. They hope to tell voters that the ballot measure would protect abortion rather than recriminalize it.
This is not a new strategy. Missouri Republicans regularly seek to thwart the people’s constitutional right to enact or reject laws via citizen-led ballot measures by mischaracterizing what those measures will do. This leads to extensive and wasteful litigation when advocates are forced to sue to get accurate ballot summaries. 
Though it’s not new, it is a new level of egregiousness — they are using rape victims, incest victims and women in medical distress as bait. If they are not stopped by the court of appeals, the ballot summary will tell voters the measure would protect abortion access for these individuals when it would actually take it away.
The summary, written by lawmakers and tweaked by Secretary of State Denny Hoskins on the order of a circuit court judge, asks voters if they want to “amend the Missouri Constitution to:

         Guarantee women’s medical care for emergencies, ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages;
        Ensure women’s safety during abortions;
        Ensure parental consent for minors;
        Repeal Article I, section 36, approved in 2024; allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest; and
        Prohibit sex-change procedures for children?”

Almost no one knows what Article I, section 36 of the Missouri Constitution is. That term is used rather than the name of the amendment — The Reproductive Freedom Initiative — in order to hide from voters that the measure would repeal what we just approved. It would reinstate the ban, but add extremely limited and unworkable exceptions. 
Under current law, victims of rape and incest already have a right to abortion because everyone does. This measure would limit that right to 12 weeks gestation. Victims of incest are typically children. When children are impregnated by their abusers, they often do not realize they are pregnant until after 12 weeks gestation. The measure would force children to carry to term. Lying to voters about what a law will do to abused children is an unconscionable perversion of democracy.
Exceptions do not work in practice. And Republican legislators do not want them to. That is why the original ban didn’t have any exceptions for rape and incest. The measure leaves the legislature free to enact insurmountable obstacles in order to accomplish what they originally legislated  — rape victims being forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term like everyone else.
The claim to be protecting abortion access in the case of ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages is both an attempt to mislead voters into thinking they are protecting the rights of pregnant women in medical crisis, and an attempt to answer for the harm women miscarrying in Missouri experienced when abortion was banned. 
Missouri’s anti-abortion legislators have consistently denied any responsibility for the documented harm that miscarrying women experienced when the ban was in place. The felony ban that the measure would reinstate imposes criminal liability for doctors should they violate it — and what constitutes a violation is nebulous. Laws like this force doctors to prioritize avoiding legal risk over the health of the patient, predictably leading to doctors and hospital attorneys denying or delaying care to miscarrying patients.  
The carve-out for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies is an acknowledgement that harm did occur, but it does not solve the problem. It would repeal the Reproductive Freedom Initiative’s protection for the “good faith judgment” of doctors. It instead uses a “reasonable medical judgment” standard that courts have acknowledged imperils patients. The “reasonable medical judgment” standard puts doctors at risk of having their emergency medical decisions second-guessed by prosecutors and prosecution witnesses. It is a recipe for hospital attorneys refusing doctors permission to treat patients in medical distress. 
The rest of the summary is equally misleading. “Ensure women’s safety during abortions” misleadingly implies there would be legal abortions to have, as does “ensure parental consent.” What is there to consent to if your daughter cannot have a legal abortion? 
“Prohibit sex-change procedures for children” implies that gender affirming care is currently legal for children, which it is not. And children with gender dysphoria weren’t having “procedures” when it was legal. It’s another use of children as bait.  
The measure is an abortion ban. 
The idea that the summary is a good faith attempt to communicate to voters what the law would do doesn’t pass the laugh test. This sort of gamesmanship is an attack on the democratic process that makes a joke of our court system. 
It is not the job of the legislature or the secretary of state to see how much the courts will let them get away with. Their job is to serve Missourians by carrying out their constitutional duties. 
Missouri voters are not enemies to be tricked and defeated, we are citizens with rights that our elected officials have sworn to uphold.

(Getty Images)A bipartisan bill to legalize online sports betting in Wisconsin is speeding through the state Legislature.
After being introduced in late October, the Assembly and Senate versions of the legislation received public hearings this week, and on Thursday the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Revenue voted 5-3 in favor of advancing the bill to the Senate floor. 
Under the Wisconsin Constitution, any gambling must be managed by the state’s federally recognized Native American tribes. Sports betting was first allowed in the state in 2021, but all of those bets had to be made in person at tribal casinos. The proposed new legislation would allow online sports betting using a “hub and spoke” model in which the servers running the betting websites and apps are housed on tribal land. 
The structure is similar to the state of Florida’s agreement with the Seminole tribe, which owns and operates the Hard Rock Casino brand. 
Proponents of the bill, including a bipartisan mix of legislators, representatives of the tribes and the state’s professional sports teams, say that hundreds of millions of dollars in unregulated online sports bets are already being made in Wisconsin, so legalizing the practice will kill the black market while providing tax revenue and consumer protections. 
But critics say the Legislature is rushing through a bill that could face legal hurdles and ignoring the ways in which online sports betting can be especially harmful for people with gambling addictions. 
Wisconsin’s legalization move comes seven years after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized sports betting in 2018. So far, 39 states have legalized sports betting and 32 of them have allowed online or mobile sports bets. 
Wisconsin would be the first state to legalize online sports gambling since North Carolina and Vermont did so in June 2023. Only now, Wisconsin’s legislators are doing so amid a national reassessment of the country’s relationship with sports gambling. Ads for apps such as FanDuel and DraftKings are ubiquitous. Both the National Basketball Association  and Major League Baseball are dealing with the fallout of player gambling scandals. Questions have arisen about the healthiness of frictionless sports gambling for the predominately young, male users of these apps. 
“American culture, and American sporting culture is trying to adjust to this new widely legalized moment,” Dr. Jason Lopez, a professor at UW-Madison who studies sports media and gambling, told the Wisconsin Examiner. 
If the bill is passed and signed into law, sports betting wouldn’t be immediately legalized. The state and tribes would need to renegotiate their existing gaming compacts and then those new agreements would need approval from the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
But, Rep. Tyler August (R-Walworth), said at Tuesday’s Senate hearing, the state should get moving before the illegal betting market grows too large. 
“I don’t gamble, but I think  it’s the right thing to do, based on some of the data that we’ve seen,” said August, whose district is right on the Illinois border, which residents can easily cross to place online bets. “This is an activity that’s not declining, it’s increasing. And I think that it’s appropriate for us to deal with this now before it gets even bigger.”
Jim Crawford, attorney general of the Potawatomi tribe, said an estimated $1 billion in illegal online sports bets were made by Wisconsinites last year. At the hearing, tribal representatives highlighted the services tribal governments could improve with the increased sports betting revenue. 
“While online gaming is currently the wild west in Wisconsin with no regulations or protections for consumers,” Crawford said. “It does not have to be. This bill is a first step in ensuring that consumers will be able to have a legal, regulated and protected way of participating in this extremely popular technology.”
Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green), one of the bill’s co-authors, said he doesn’t believe the bill will put gambling addicts at further risk. But Sens. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken), Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton) and Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi) voted against moving the bill out of committee. Jacque said at the hearing he was worried about the recent gambling scandals in professional sports and the risk of gambling addiction. 
“This would allow them to place bets by their device anywhere in the state, as opposed to going on site at a casino, at a reservation,” Jacque said. “I would say, from an opportunity standpoint, that potentially could feed more into addictive behavior.” 
Noah Henderson, the director of the sport management program at Loyola University Chicago, said the frictionless nature of online sports betting is one of its challenges. 
“Brick and mortar sports books provide a cooling-off period, when people are trying to chase losses, if they have to get in their car again and go to the sports book, they might realize halfway there that they’re acting impulsively,” Henderson said. “It’s easier for families to see the signs of gambling disorder or problem gambling when individuals have to leave the home, right? It’s a lot easier to hide problem gambling or a gambling disorder when it’s only on a mobile device, where there’s no absences, they’re not leaving the house more than they normally do.” 
Henderson said there’s not much Wisconsin’s Legislature can do about the societal acceptance of legalized sports betting and a culture that has fully absorbed the promotion of gambling. 
“It is incredibly common to see on the pre-game show, the halftime show, the best bets, the best live bets, the best parlay combinations. So I think that there’s only so much Wisconsin can do to stop that, to stop sports gambling from being the culture of young men — predominantly young men — watching sports,” he told the Examiner. 
So, according to Henderson, the state is faced with a choice between legalizing and facing the broader cultural changes head-on while getting the tax revenue or hoping that prohibition disincentivizes sports betting. 
“I think that there might be a bit of harm reduction in this public policy where, if we keep mobile sports wagering outlawed in this state, it’s not going to curtail the sweeping normalization of sports gambling that we’ve seen,” Henderson said. “That’s at a national level. So Wisconsin has two options, which is to not allow it, and hope that the lack of resources for legal sports gambling incentivizes young men and women not to partake in this. But at the end of the day, there’s still a market and a need … they would rather regulate and tax it for consumer protection and to grow a tax base off of it and not have sports gambling happening without being able to derive some tax benefit from it that can go towards gambling education, public schools, or whatever else Wisconsin’s government deems important.” 
One organization that is against the bill is the Sports Betting Alliance, which represents the major online sportsbooks. 
The bill uses the federal Indian Gaming Regulation Act as a mechanism to allow online bets in Wisconsin. That law allows tribes to license their gaming operations out to third parties so long as the tribe gets 60% of the net revenue. 
Damon Stewart, an attorney for the alliance, said at the hearing that the revenue sharing requirement would make it too expensive for the most popular apps to partner with the tribes and provide their already existing apps and infrastructure. He also said he believes the law as currently written runs afoul of federal law. 
“We support the goal of legal online sports betting in Wisconsin. We want to work with the tribes. We want to partner with them,” Stewart said. “But this bill will only result in limited choices for customers. There’s no national brands, no chance for all the tribes to actually participate in the market, no ability to make an effective dent in the illegal market that already exists and years of litigation that will hold up the implementation of the law.” 
Stewart argued in his testimony that without the name recognition of the most popular apps, the legalization effort may not effectively kill the black market. Henderson said it’s possible for the tribes to develop their own infrastructure, but it’s easier to let the bigger companies manage the administration if the revenue sharing deal can be worked out. 
“This is probably a losing endeavor for those big sports books to enter a mid-sized sports gambling market with already pretty challenging margins,” Henderson said. “Especially when sports books enter a new market for sports gambling, there’s a lot of upfront costs that come with advertising that usually these businesses and markets take several years to even become profitable with more favorable regulations in place.” 
“Legislation can be amended. It doesn’t seem like this is the only formulation of it, but I think revenue sharing can definitely happen,” he continued. “I just don’t know if the 60-40 model makes sense for retailers to want to come in. Otherwise it would just be much like Florida, where tribal governments would have to build the infrastructure on their own or purchase white light label sports gambling software and pass it off as their own.”
In his testimony, Stewart called for the Legislature to slow down the process and get it right the first time. 
“I want to be respectful. It’s just my perception that with a bill dropped last week, two hearings this week, it does seem to be, compared to a lot of legislation, a bit of a rush,” Stewart said. “And on the topic of this complexity, a topic of this importance that affects a lot of citizens of the state, I would hope it would be seen as reasonable as asking to let us have the chance to work with the tribes.” 
The tribal representatives testifying said they were prepared to move forward without the big name apps. 
“We certainly appreciate the Sports Betting Alliance’s support of the goal of this legislation,” Crawford said. “But it’s also something that is a little bit concerning to us, that they are sort of implying that we don’t have the capability of operating statewide mobile sports, which, if you’ve ever been to our facility and to our retail sports betting, you know that we do a pretty good job, and the customers are happy. And so we look forward to doing that on a statewide basis, on a regulated basis, where the consumers are protected and they are generating revenues for the state of Wisconsin that stay in the state of Wisconsin.”

Clark recently announced he’s running for Congress to represent Wisconsin’s 7th Congressional District.
Incumbent Tom Tiffany (R-Minocqua) is running for governor and two of the highest profile Republican state senators in the district — Romaine Quinn of Rice Lake and Mary Felzkowski of Tomahawk — both recently announced they will seek reelection to  the state Senate. The other candidates who have announced they are running for Tiffany’s seat,  three Republicans and one Democrat, have little districtwide name recognition. 
Clark sees an opportunity to mount a strong campaign as he tries to flip the large, Republican-leaning district, which covers much of the top half of Wisconsin, from red to blue.
“I think this is the first time in 15 years to have a truly competitive election in the 7th Congressional District,” he said. 
Clark, who is also not widely known in the 7th CD, has his work cut out for him. His background in logging, as the owner of Clark Forestry, Inc., could appeal to voters in the northwestern district, where forestry products are a critical part of the economy. He has also worked as a forestry consultant with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and as a forest ecologist for The Nature Conservancy, and was the executive director and a founding board member of Wisconsin’s Green Fire, a conservation group. 
He also has a history of building relationships with Republicans and independents, which is critical in a  district that has voted by wide margins for Republicans since 2010, starting with former U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Hayward), now Secretary of Transportation. Duffy who won the district before it was redrawn following the last Census, and then increased his winning margins in the redistricted boundaries for four more elections. Tiffany also won by wide margins.
At a meeting of Democrats in Cable on Oct. 22 at The River Eatery, a venue heavily supported by the silent sports community that tends to vote blue, Clark was asked if he would reach out to independents and Republicans in the district. He answered in the affirmative, saying his goal is to convince 40,000 voters who either did not vote or voted Republican in the last congressional election to “reevaluate” their decision.
“I’m asking a lot of people who may have voted Republican in the past to think about who’s going to represent their interest the best and who’s got the ability to work for you and will show up and listen,” he said. “People want to shake your hand and look you in the eye and believe that they share enough with you that they could trust you to represent them, even if you didn’t agree with them on everything.”
At that Oct 22 meeting, Clark criticized policy decisions in Washington he said were “hurtful and damaging and are being felt across rural America right now.”
Clark is critical of the Big Beautiful Bill passed this summer by Republicans, and of their refusal to extend Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies. More than 270,000 Wisconsinites are projected to lose health insurance because of either dropping their coverage when premiums rise or losing Medicaid under the new rules. .
Clark is also concerned there will be fewer federal dollars to support rural hospitals.
“The health care outcomes are going to be worse and the rural health care system that we all rely on is going to continue to get worse because we’re going to lose doctors and we’re going to lose specialists and we’re going to lose clinics,” he said.
Support for wood pulp sustainable fuel initiative
Hayward is in the running, along with two other sites in Michigan and Minnesota, for a large $1.5 billion sustainable aviation fuel plant using pulp wood. The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation is offering $60 million in incentives on top of a  $150 million grant funded through the Department of Natural Resources forestry account. It could be a boon to the wood pulp industry, but there have also been environmental concerns that the operation involving chipping trees in the field would leave less timber debris that adds nutrients to the soil, helping to protect the long-term health of the forest.
As a forester, Clark  believes the project would be good for the economy. The state’s  pulp and paper industries have been in a long  decline.  Clark says chipping  can be done in a manner that doesn’t risk the forest, but he is also critical of the  state’s plan to offer  the $150 million grant.
“We need to find new uses for wood from Wisconsin forests, and it’s really important that we have those markets for wood so that people managing forest land can continue to do that and we have a strong forest-based economy,” he said. “The sustainable aviation fuel truly is an opportunity to add a new product, or forest products mix, that could be good for forest conservation and forest ownership.”
“What I’m concerned about,” he added “and I don’t think it’s a good idea, is to hand out a $150 million cash subsidy to try to get into a bidding war with other states to land this plan.” He says he prefers the idea of offering tax credits as incentives to “writing a big blank check to this company.”
Worries about privatizing forestry
Clark also supports the Good Neighbor Authority program with the U.S. Forest Service, which involves county forestry departments helping to manage federal forest harvests. U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-Madison) was instrumental in establishing the program.  
“What the Good Neighbor Authority has done is just provide some extra flexibility for the Forest Service to get important work done and to meet their timber goals,” he said. “Working through states, it can work well when it’s well managed, but the risk here is that this administration throws open the door to basically privatize most of forest management, and if you let that happen, you’re going to have people and organizations setting up these timber sales that aren’t respecting the wildlife habitat and the soil conservation and the water protection that all needs to be part of any forest management. So the training and the standards and maintaining consistency are some of the most important things that we need to do with Good Neighbor Authority, and it’s got to be well managed or it won’t be successful.”
Help for Wisconsin farmers and small business
The number of small dairy farms in Wisconsin continues to decline as giant operations grow. Clark says the solution to the scourge of farm bankruptcies is to work on returning to supply management, keeping the milk supply at a level that offers attractive prices instead of emphasizing higher production, which suppresses prices and favors larger dairy operations.
“Honestly, as long as the incentives are all toward maximizing production that’s going to continue to keep prices at a place where only the biggest producers are going to survive and we’ll continue to see the erosion of the small farms who simply can’t produce enough milk at a cost above production,” he said. “Other countries that have effective supply management programs are actually able to maintain pricing that allows everybody to stay in business, and I think that’s the conversation among milk producers and folks in Congress that needs to be had.”
Clark is also critical of Trump’s tariffs for undermining efforts in the farming community to establish overseas markets.
“We’re seeing right now the impacts of the tariff war on everything from soybean producers who [lost]  markets in China … to hardwood lumber producers here in Wisconsin, who also have depended on Canadian and other international markets that are losing those markets, to ginseng producers in Marathon County, who have now lost their single biggest customer, China, which purchases the vast majority of American ginseng,” he said.  “All those markets that took years to develop are being essentially kneecapped by this president in this crazy tariff war.”
On his platform for “rebuilding our rural economy” Clark notes the need for “long-overdue tax reform that claws back 40 years of tax giveaways to the wealthiest Americans and our most profitable corporations.”
“We need a much fairer system,” he said. “There are simply way too many gigantic tax benefits that the largest corporations are able to use in order to effectively pay almost no taxes, and in many cases, these are some of the most profitable industries in our nation. You know, the net result of that is that we’ve got a giant amount of national debt. I believe it’s over $37 trillion of national debt. That is not good for America, and we can’t balance that debt on the backs of the people who need the services of the government the most.”
Clark is advocating for targeted subsidies for small- and medium-sized businesses, which he said generate jobs in rural communities. Asked about one notable failure in the district — the millions in federal grant dollars allocated to the Park Falls mill, which failed to keep the plant operational, he said, “When you’re providing incentives to private businesses, there’s always a risk.” 
“So because the business used a subsidy and ended up failing, that doesn’t mean we failed, but it does mean to me, we’ve got to make those investments smartly,” he added. Giving a large grant to a business that might come from outside the state to build a sustainable aviation fuel plant is one plan he says needs more scrutiny.  
“If you’re trying to start a small farm or small forest products business or manufacturing business, and you go to the Small Business Development Corporation, the Small Business Administration for a loan, you’re going to be wading through paperwork tall as your arm on your desk by the time you’re done, hours and hours,” he said.  “I think we can make that easier, and I think we can make those funds more available. And what we know is that even though big employers get a lot of the attention, if you add up the scope of small businesses, that’s actually where most of the jobs are, and those owners are the people who are committed and rooted in those communities.”
One of the things Clark doesn’t directly cover in his platform is the affordable  housing crisis. 
Clark said housing may be more important in tourist areas, like the 7th District, where so many seasonal homes are used as short-term rentals (STRs) instead of long-term family housing.
“We need communities that have the ability to zone and regulate that (STRs) more effectively, and then we need to go back and figure out how to make housing affordable, which is the availability of financing,” he said.
Immigration reform
Clark acknowledges that many voters in the 7th CD supported Trump’s promise to beef up border security and deport immigrants who commit crimes, but he is critical of how the U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) law enforcement agents are operating in communities.
“We need to have a secure border and immigrants who are here illegally, and most especially immigrants associated with criminal activity — we absolutely need enforcement on that,” he said. “And those people should be deported. What we have going on right now, however, is it’s essentially a war of fear in American cities. And ICE is an agency that is really one of the only federal agencies that’s seen its budget dramatically increased. They’re hiring new ICE agents as fast as they can, with a minimal amount of training, and it’s already clear that many of these people simply don’t have the experience and the training to be doing what they’re doing. And I don’t care what party you belong to, seeing people in masks who aren’t even identifying themselves, calling citizens and legal residents out of their homes without judicial warrants, many of whom will never see a court or a judge — it’s wrong and it’s unconstitutional, and it’s not making American communities safer.”
Clark also wants Congress to fully flex its constitutional authority to “curb the abuse of emergency powers” exercised by Trump. Democrats would be able to provide that check if they win the majority of the House in 2026. He also said Democrats should hold town hall meetings, “taking the case to voters.”
“Republicans in Congress have been completely afraid to do that,” he said of in-person town hall meetings. “Congressman Tiffany hasn’t done it. And that’s talking to the people that you represent. You know that’s No. 1.”

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Current and former Oklahoma State Department of Education officials refuse to discuss who has been driving a state-owned vehicle that traveled frequently to country clubs, visited Texas, parked at stores at odd hours and consistently returned to former state Superintendent Ryan Walters’ home address.
The vehicle, a Chevrolet Suburban, was issued to Joseph Porter, an assistant in Walters’ administration who still works at the Education Department, state records show. Despite the vehicle being listed under Porter’s name, Oklahoma Voice’s analysis of state vehicle tracking data shows the SUV returned to Walters’ home in Edmond more times than any other location in 2025, leaving from there most mornings, returning at midday and regularly parking there overnight.
State-owned vehicles track every address where they stop, the length of each drive, and the time of departure and arrival, but the logs don’t contain information about the purpose of each stop — nor who was driving. Oklahoma law requires state employees to use taxpayer-funded vehicles only for their official duties.
Walters, a Republican who resigned on Sept. 30 to lead an anti-teacher-union nonprofit, said in an interview with Oklahoma Voice that multiple people used the Suburban for official agency work, but he said he didn’t want to discuss specifics. He declined to say whether he personally drove the car. 
“It would have depended on what was going on, where things were headed. So, it just depends,” Walters said. “It would depend on what the particular day (was), what the event was, where we were headed.”
Location records show the vehicle’s travel abruptly stopped after he left office.

Porter, whose name was still listed with the vehicle even after Walters’ resignation, declined to speak to Oklahoma Voice and referred all requests for comment to current state Superintendent Lindel Fields’ communications staff. The Education Department’s communications office did not return requests to interview Porter or provide a response for this story. 
Instead, the Education Department referred all questions to the Office of Management and Enterprise Services, a different agency that oversees the state fleet. 
The agency has assigned multiple vehicles to the Education Department, but it has no information about which employees use them, agency spokesperson Christa Helfrey said.
“Agencies monitor vehicle assignments and usage and can speak to their own policies and procedures,” Helfrey wrote in a message to Oklahoma Voice.
During Walters’ final weeks as state superintendent, the Education Department denied that he had a state-owned vehicle, and the agency therefore refused to provide records of his vehicle usage to Oklahoma Voice. 
After Walters left, the agency turned over documents listing all of its state-owned cars. Those records showed Porter was assigned the Chevrolet Suburban. 
Oklahoma law permits certain state employees, including elected officials, to drive taxpayer-funded vehicles while performing their official duties, including to travel between home and work. But, they are barred from using the vehicles for personal transportation, like to stores, shopping centers and golf courses, according to state rules.
Only the governor, his family and the lieutenant governor are allowed to use publicly funded vehicles for personal matters, under Oklahoma law and state Supreme Court precedent. That’s because state law requires the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety to provide them transportation and a security detail.
Location records show the Education Department’s Suburban made three school visits, which coincide with Walters’ public appearances in Tulsa at Carnegie Elementary on Jan. 30 and Unity Learning Academy on April 7 to celebrate reading initiatives, and at Drumright High School on April 11 to recognize a newly built activity center.
The vehicle made about 140 stops at the Education Department building, often leaving after a few hours.
Tracking data also showed four drives to Texas, where Walters’ campaign manager and senior adviser, Matt Langston, is based.

In a statement on Walters’ behalf, Langston said trips to Texas were made in an official capacity to meet with members of the Texas Legislature, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s office, the Texas Education Agency and the Texas State Board of Education. 
The trips also were for meetings with conservative commentator Glenn Beck, high-profile Christian nationalist David Barton, representatives from the right-wing Heritage Foundation, U.S. Department of Education officials and “numerous other key stakeholders involved in Oklahoma education,” Langston said.
The state-owned SUV made a day trip Feb. 25 to the Texas State Capitol in Austin before returning to Walters’ home address late that night, according to its tracking data. It arrived March 7 at the American Journey Experience museum in Irving next door to Beck’s production studio. On July 25, location records show it visited downtown Grapevine in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and a nearby restaurant before returning to Oklahoma. 
The vehicle was parked overnight from Sept. 8-9 in a luxury apartment complex in downtown Austin, according to the logs. Walters called into a late-night FOX News appearance Sept. 8 to discuss prayer in schools with what appeared to be the Texas Capitol behind him.
Tracking data also shows the vehicle made 17 visits to two country clubs, Oak Tree in Edmond and Hidden Trails in south Oklahoma City. Some of these visits took place on the same date as two Oklahoma State Board of Education meetings in May and June.
“Due to harassment from the press and left-wing agitators, several country clubs were used as secure meeting locations with education stakeholders,” Langston said in a statement. 
Oklahoma Voice sought an explanation from Porter for the Texas trips and country club visits, but neither he nor the Education Department returned requests for comment.
An analysis of the vehicle’s tracking records shows it traveled regularly from Walters’ home to Walmart, CVS stores, a hair salon, fast food restaurants and his neighborhood clubhouse, which features a pool, playground and gym. These visits took place at all hours of the day, but the purpose of each visit is not documented. 
Voters expect their government officials to use taxpayer-funded resources for a public benefit, said Abigail Bellows, senior policy director of anti-corruption and accountability at Common Cause, a government watchdog group.
“Whether or not there was a violation in this particular instance, this episode is an opportunity for voters and public officials at every level to affirm what the expectation is for public servants,” Bellows said. “And that voters expect public servants who will truly be acting in the public interest and not seeking to use public resources for their personal benefit.”

,WyoFile,2025-11-10 11:30:00+00:00,WyoFile,"Wyoming to again weigh making landowner tags ‘transferable,’ a step toward pay-for-play hunting",Mike Koshmrl,,,,,https://wyofile.com/wyoming-to-again-weigh-making-landowner-tags-transferable-a-step-toward-pay-for-play-hunting/,"

Legislation that would enable ranchers and large property owners to sell tags to the highest bidder passed through the Agriculture Committee and has a shot at becoming law in 2026. 
The post Wyoming to again weigh making landowner tags ‘transferable,’ a step toward pay-for-play hunting  appeared first on WyoFile .","A controversial proposal that could help Wyoming landowners make money from elk, deer and pronghorn that use their property has passed muster with a legislative committee and will be up for debate when lawmakers convene February in Cheyenne. 
At issue are reforms that would make Wyoming’s landowner licenses “transferable,” or able to be sold. Landowner licenses, which date to 1949 in Wyoming, are special hunting tags awarded for elk, deer and pronghorn if property owners possess at least 160 acres and can demonstrate certain thresholds of animal use. 
Some other western states have already made landowner licenses transferable to varying degrees. The change has led to non-residents paying top dollar for the hunt of their choice, at the expense of diminished opportunities for locals. The website Huntin’ Fool, for example, is currently marketing a $30,000 Nevada elk hunt alongside a $12,000 Colorado mule deer hunt. 
There have been previous efforts to follow suit in Wyoming, including during the last legislative session. Sen. Laura Pearson, a Kemmerer Republican, brought but then withdrew a bill that she hoped would create a new revenue stream for ranchers. Last week, she helped talk the balance of the Joint Agriculture, State and Public Lands & Water Resources Committee into sponsoring a similar proposal, arguing the bill would allow landowners to generate “a small but meaningful income stream to help offset the costs of supporting wildlife.” 
The proposition of making Wyoming landowner licenses sellable has been met with stiff resistance from public hunters each time it’s come up.

In 2022, the Wyoming Wildlife Taskforce took on the issue, aiming to address what one member described as “outright abuses,” including landowners subdividing property to acquire more tags. No changes were agreed to then. Related reforms considered by the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission were also unpopular with landowners and pulled back. Attempts at making some landowner licenses transferable, meanwhile, have met overwhelming public opposition since at least 1998. 
“Those were some of the most contentious meetings that we had in the last 25 years, when we started talking about landowner licenses,” Wyoming Game and Fish Department Chief Warden Dan Smith told members of the Agriculture Committee. “When they presented that idea, they got over 2,100 comments from the public that were adamantly opposed to having transferable licenses.” 
Judging by some recent public comments, sentiments haven’t changed much. 
Sabrina King, a lobbyist for the Wyoming chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, asked members of the committee what public hunters stood to gain from the proposal. In Wyoming’s complicated hunting license lottery system, landowner tags are distributed first, leaving rank-and-file sportspeople vying for a diminished pool of opportunities. 
“There is nothing about creating this kind of a program, the way this bill is written, that generates good feelings between hunters and private landowners,” King told the committee. “This is not a solution. This is going to create a pay-for-play system that is going to hurt the public hunter.”
Game and Fish Director Angi Bruce also expressed concern that creating a private market for Wyoming licenses could diminish opportunities and hurt hunter recruitment. Currently, many landowners don’t hunt, she said, and therefore don’t apply for a landowners license — about 3,600 are issued annually.  
“We anticipate that number going up,” Bruce said. “If they are able to transfer or sell a hunting license, we think that there will be more interest.”

Lawmakers also heard testimony from landowners eager to sell licenses. 
Jason Thornock, who farms in the Cokeville area, complained about elk and deer numbers on his land, which he claimed eat $60,000 in alfalfa each year. He called landowner coupons that yield him cash for hunter-killed animals on his land “an insult” and the state’s damage program “a joke.” 
“If you allow us to transfer these tags and get some compensation for them, yeah, use is going to go up,” Thornock said. “But so what? Let me get something out of that $60,000 that I’m putting into the wildlife.” 
Members of the Agriculture committee voted seven to five to sponsor the bill. 
Ayes included Pearson, Cowley Republican Rep. Dalton Banks, Cheyenne Republican Rep. Steve Johnson, Riverton Republican Rep. Pepper Ottman, Douglas Republican Rep. Tomi Strock, Thermopolis Republican Rep. John Winter and Casper Republican Sen. Bob Ide.

(Getty Images)(This image cannot be republished unless you have a subscription to Getty.)When I moved to Oklahoma over a decade ago, I had no idea that state laws here give the upper hand to bad landlords and give tenants struggling with catastrophic issues — think raccoon infestations, flooding and mold — little recourse if repairs aren’t made.
But then I watched my then-boyfriend wage an unsuccessful campaign against an Oklahoma City metro apartment complex after an odd, smelly black substance began to grow around a ventilation shaft in his bathroom and air conditioning unit. Property management refused to treat it and told him he could fork out hundreds of dollars in his own money to identify whether the substance was indeed mold.
Naively, I encouraged him to call the county health department because I thought this apparent fungal growth was a public health issue. But the health department said it was not within their purview to police apartment mold infestation. I could not find any other governmental entity that might regulate it. Shortly after that, the complex’s management coincidentally had his second vehicle towed without notice while he was away at work. That was despite his lease agreement allowing him to park two vehicles on the premises. He had to pay hundreds of dollars to get it out of impound, and the complex refused to give him a break on his rent to rectify the error.
But the icing on the cake was when he arrived home not long after and found a supply line on his toilet had ruptured, flooding his apartment so much that the carpet was floating inches above the floor. There was so much water, it seeped through the walls into his neighbor’s apartment. His neighbor apparently thought the deluge was from flood waters that frequently seeped into their apartment after heavy rain.
Management refused to replace the ruined carpet and the waterlogged drywall. They told him he had to file a renter’s insurance claim to replace his destroyed furniture. And if he didn’t like it, they told him, he could move out.
So he did. But as a final middle-finger salute, the landlord required a month’s rent as compensation for not giving at least 30 days notice. He had to threaten to take them to court to get the remainder of his security deposit back.
All of that seems unfair and wrong, but that doesn’t mean what the property managers did was illegal.
That’s because state law leaves tenants with little recourse. 
Oklahoma law does not allow tenants to withhold their rent as leverage to get things fixed. If a tenant withholds rent in an attempt to pressure a landlord to fix the premises, they face automatic eviction. And any eviction makes it even harder for renters to get subsequent housing.
Oklahoma is inexplicably only one of six states where tenants don’t have antiretaliation protections, Oklahoma Watch reported last week. That means tenants largely have little recourse if landlords refuse to repair things like standing sewage and holes in a roof. Instead, landlords have all the power. They can retaliate by increasing rent, ending leases, adding new fees or even evicting people for complaining about untenable living conditions, the nonprofit reported.
Legal Aid Services Oklahoma reported that 60% of their clients are struggling with repairs not being made.
State law does allow tenants to pay for the repairs on their landlord’s property. If they keep good records, they can then attempt to deduct those from their rent as long as the repairs don’t exceed a full month’s rent.
But making repairs should be the responsibility of a landlord, not a tenant. And frankly, it’s a really bad idea to allow anybody to make structural repairs to a property they don’t own.
Oklahoma Watch’s reporter spoke with two women facing eviction in Oklahoma County for refusing to pay rent to landlords who wouldn’t repair what appear to be catastrophic issues.
One woman’s apartment routinely floods to the point that she had to buy a shop vac to dry things out. The woman said she told the landlord she wasn’t going to pay rent until they made her apartment liveable, so they evicted her.
The second woman had a raccoon fall through a hole in her daughter’s ceiling at 2 a.m. while the 6-year-old girl slept. The woman had pictures documenting the hole in the ceiling, apparently caused by a water stain, progressively getting larger and larger each week. The raccoon destroyed the room as it tried to escape and terrified the little girl.
The woman had also gone to the landlord in September to complain about possible mold.
Her landlord filed to evict her because she didn’t pay her rent.
Even if a landlord is negligent, Oklahoma Watch reported state law gives court judges little option but to evict.
That’s completely outrageous. 
I don’t blame the judges. I blame our Legislature for inexplicably refusing to properly regulate the rental industry and pass laws that also ensure the safety of tenants.
Pretty much every other state has stronger protections and those have not caused their rental markets to collapse.
But the sad truth is landlords have more financial resources and a stronger lobbying power than their renters. Those with money tend to make the rules.
I have always been lucky enough to have responsive landlords who do the right thing and promptly make fixes. But obviously there are bad  landlords who just want to pocket the rent.
That’s not how this is supposed to work. Those who rent properties should have a legal and moral obligation to adequately maintain them.
It’s time for lawmakers to set up a system that gives tenants some power to force neglectful landlords to make repairs. Tenants should have the power to withhold rent, and judges should have the discretion to not evict someone if a landlord legitimately has refused to make repairs.
And if a landlord doesn’t like it, tough. They probably shouldn’t be in this business.
Because that’s how we wind up with slum lords.

Nonprofit social-service organizations struggle to meet spiking demand amidst federal cuts, the government shutdown and shrinking resources.
The post ‘It sucks so bad’: Social workers scramble to meet surging needs in wake of shutdown appeared first on WyoFile .","A caller who recently reached out to the Wyoming 211 help line had a stark message for the person on the other end of the line: If I pay my utility bill to avoid a disconnect, I’ll have to eat cat food this month.
Others in a desperate situation aren’t hiding their frustration about needing help at all — a cultural shame in Wyoming — or their stress navigating a perplexing, ever-changing and shrinking network of social services.
“Our call center has had — I don’t think I would use the word aggressive, but — more unpleasant interactions in the last month, really since probably July, than we have had in a long time,” Wyoming 211 Executive Director Ann Clement told WyoFile. The desperation, she added, “is palpable. It’s absolutely unbelievable.”
Wyoming’s most vulnerable, along with those who have been teetering on the edge, are feeling a culmination of pressures, from the high cost of living to cuts to the social-service safety net. Some cutbacks, like the suspension of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits and low-income heating assistance due to the government shutdown, are presumably temporary. 
Those pains are exacerbated by federal employee layoffs and furloughs, deep spending cuts, rising electric utility rates and increasingly inaccessible health care and rising health insurance costs, according to several front-line social-service workers who spoke to WyoFile.

The compounding hardships are happening as local nonprofits scramble to do more with less.
“It fucking sucks. It sucks so bad,” Gillette’s Council of Community Services Executive Director Mikel Scott said. The council’s own employees, as they scramble to meet a surge in needs, face skyrocketing health insurance premiums and the prospect of not having health insurance at all, she added. “You don’t know what’s going to happen next. You don’t know what money they’re going to take from you next. And it was never enough to begin with.”
Some federal programs that people have relied on for decades don’t seem to be functioning well, Scott added. The council was in line for a $177,000 Housing and Urban Development grant to provide rental assistance to those seeking refuge from domestic violence, but the agency reneged on the money, Scott said. She alleges the grant was denied based on changes to the council’s application that were edited by HUD itself. 
“We lost $177,000 for our community that would have gone to help victims of domestic violence,” Scott said.
Both Scott and Clement noted that when families are stressed for basic needs, there’s typically an increase in abuse.
“That’s what starts to bubble over into other spaces that people don’t necessarily think about, when there’s a stressor at home,” Clement said.
Scrambling to help
Gov. Mark Gordon recently declared a public welfare emergency that will allow him to spend up to $10 million to help cover suspended SNAP benefits, while lawmakers have applied for $800 million in federal money to stabilize hospitals, bolster preventative health and grow the workforce. 
Churches, neighbors and local businesses are stepping up to help, Clement and Scott say, but those efforts simply can’t match the level of federal government dollars and social service infrastructure necessary to meet even typical needs in rural Wyoming, let alone the surge in hardships Wyomingites are facing today and might face in coming months.

“We’re already pretty used to having to tell people ‘no’ or ‘we ran out’ or ‘we can’t help with that,'” Scott said. “It’s going to be worse when tons of people get kicked off of health insurance. I mean, forget actually lifting anyone out of poverty. At this point, the goal feels like trying to keep someone from becoming homeless, to keep them fed, trying to keep them from freezing to death in their home because they can’t pay their utilities.”
In addition to providing meals, there’s an emphasis among both government and nonprofits to keep people from losing their homes or apartments. Tenants can get evicted for not paying utilities, so help like rental assistance and the Low Income Energy Assistance Program go a long way to prevent homelessness, which is extremely unsafe and one of the most costly public health-and-safety challenges for any community to address, according to Scott.
“They’re either going into shelters or they’re going onto the street,” she said. “Either way, it’s costing a lot more money than if we just helped supplement a utility payment.”
LIEAP also helps qualified applicants weatherize their homes and fix heating units, which not only saves money but avoids dangerous attempts to stay warm.
“Our crews have seen very dangerous situations,” Scott said, “like people heating their home with a barbecue grill or just opening a gas oven.”
Food assistance

SNAP was suspended Nov. 1 due to the federal government shutdown, putting at risk more than 28,000 Wyomingites who rely on the program, according to Food Bank of Wyoming. Of those, 44% are children and 13% are people over age 65.
Food Bank of Wyoming has been working overtime to distribute the governor’s $10 million emergency aid while determining how to get the money to food pantries and those in need without using the federal SNAP infrastructure. The organization is “directing the funding in the form of credits to order food for free from Food Bank of Wyoming and in direct payments to keep money circulating in the local economy by allowing partners to purchase food from grocers in their community,” according to a Friday email update from Executive Director Danica Sveda.
Despite an efficient statewide network to collect and distribute food, there are challenges, including trying to replicate the scale of the federal SNAP program in Wyoming. SNAP, via direct distribution to individual recipients, injects about $5 million into Wyoming’s economy each month, according to Sveda.
“For every meal that a food bank can provide, SNAP provides nine,” Sveda wrote. “Even if SNAP benefits are reinstated this month, there is a chance people will not receive a full back-payment for November. This disruption in SNAP benefits is and will continue to be devastating for our neighbors facing hunger.”
The increase in demand at food centers and mobile food pantries is significant, Sveda told WyoFile in a Friday phone interview.
“What I’m hearing from all of our pantries is that they are seeing a lot of people that they have never seen before,” Sveda said. That’s because SNAP recipients typically take their SNAP debit card to the grocery store, she added. “So now they’re having to go to a food pantry for the first time.”
Sveda suspects that there are also a lot of federal workers who have been laid off and are relying on food pantries for the first time. “So we’ve been increasing the amount of food that we normally send out to our mobile pantries.”
Even when the SNAP program is restored, it’s unclear whether Congress will fully fund the program. Congress, in the Big Beautiful Bill, made several changes to the program, including expanded work-reporting requirements for young adults and requiring states to match a portion of the cost to manage the program.
To find a local food bank near you, go to the Food Bank of Wyoming website. Go to the same website to learn how to help.Because there are so many different social service organizations in each Wyoming town, one of the best ways to find help or to learn how to help is to visit the Wyoming 211 website or dial 2-1-1. The call center can connect you to services and organizations in your community.

The former vice president advocated for a powerful executive branch, then watched as a president he abhorred used it to his advantage, writes former WyoFile board member Geoff O’Gara.
The post The tragic arc of Dick Cheney appeared first on WyoFile .","Ten years ago, I spent some time with Dick Cheney while working on a documentary for Wyoming PBS titled “Dick Cheney: A Heartbeat Away.” I can confirm what many of Cheney’s friends will say — away from the camera, he could be charming, wryly witty and more honest and direct than any politician outside of his sometime friend, the late Al Simpson.

Opinion

Cheney’s vaunted role in American governance for almost half a century, and his tight-lipped public persona, were often mitigated with Wyoming journalists — I got to know him, just a bit, over sandwiches and fly rods. But neither of us would say we were friends — we were rarely in touch after the documentary came out — and I am not betraying a friend’s confidence when I write about him now. 
The former vice president was a man of few words, but skillful with the ones he dispensed. Before cameras were involved he told me a jaw-dropping story over lunch that felt like a national security scoop — but later, knowing better how he operated, seemed more a calculated way of tossing a tasty elk steak in front of a hungry journalist. 
(The story he told — during our first lunch together, in 2013 — was about 9/11. Following the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, then-Vice President Cheney was in a command center in the White House basement, while President George W. Bush remained in the air. Another plane commandeered by terrorists was headed toward Washington, likely targeting the Capitol or the White House. Military brass came to Cheney in the bunker: Should we shoot it down? Unhesitatingly, he said yes. But when the military planes went up to intercept the incoming threat, they discovered while in the air that their armaments were not engaged — they could not fire. As we all know, courageous passengers on that plane fought the terrorists, leading to a crash in a Pennsylvania cornfield.)
In hours of interviews, Cheney was an able story-teller, frank and often funny about his Ivy League failure, his beer-soaked years as a roughneck and his relationship with Lynne Vincent, which many credit with righting his wayward ship. In 2014, as a former vice president with no security detail, he obligingly jumped alone behind the wheel of a Ford Mustang I’d borrowed in Casper so we could recreate his campaign drives on Wyoming’s lonely backroads in his first run for the House of Representatives. He allowed us to talk to the doctors at George Washington University who had performed his heart transplant. And if he didn’t like a question — like when I asked how he answered critics who faulted him as secretary of defense (he served in that role from 1989 to 1993) for not having served in the military — he’d say, “No, Geoff, nobody cares about that.”
When you have the forceful temperament, intellect, persistence and good fortune to land a pivotal role in the modern history of the world’s most powerful country, you must submit, during your life and long after, to the judgment of history. 
I am no historian, but I know as a journalist that these anecdotes and insights will not play large in those judgments. Rather, it will be his role as secretary of defense for the elder George Bush, vice president for George W. Bush, the military interventions in the Middle East that he advocated and led, and the harsh interrogations — some would say torture — of suspected terrorists that he felt were justified and legal.

In these controversial events, Cheney trusted his close circle of aides and felt little need to seek approval outside the White House. From his earliest years in government — starting in the beleaguered administration of Richard Nixon — Cheney advocated for concentrating power in the executive branch, a constitutional theory later dubbed the “unitary executive.” 
Then, after retirement, a heart transplant and the attack on the Capitol in 2021, Dick Cheney became a forceful critic of Donald Trump, calling him “a threat to our republic (who) tried to steal the last election using lies and violence.” He even voted for the Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. But I cannot find, reading news reports of that time, that he made any connection between Trump’s authoritarian, if erratic, behavior, and his own earlier assertion of broad executive authority.
Which brings me back to the personal. Cheney was intensely loyal. He found people of quality to work with, and he stuck by them. His attacks against Trump focus on the president’s undermining of democratic processes, rather than Trump’s attempt to concentrate power in a White House without guardrails.
The powerful executive branch that Cheney pushed for depends on leaders of high character, because it diminishes checks and balances. Even many of those who felt Cheney over-reached (remembering the “weapons of mass destruction” justification for the Iraq War) would grudgingly acknowledge his patriotism and character. But there is an element of tragedy in the way Cheney’s overweaning assertion of executive power  now emboldens a president he opposed so forcefully. And for all the vehemence of Cheney’s opposition to Trump, it had little impact on the outcomes of the 2024 election. 
I’m pretty sure, though, that if I’d suggested to Cheney that his life had the arc of tragedy, he would have looked at me with something between a smile and a snarl, and said, “No, Geoff, nobody cares about that.”

Nov. 7, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Members of the Ukrainian community in Nebraska honored dozens of neighbors at an appreciation event Friday that spotlighted support for Ukraine during the nearly four years since Russia invaded.
House of Prayer lead pastor Oleg Stepanyuk, who is from Lviv in western Ukraine, near the Polish border, estimated that about 90% of displaced Ukrainians in Nebraska passed through the church. 
He said the house of worship in north Lincoln “lived up to the challenge of embracing and helping and making the community stronger.”
“But it would have been impossible without you, without your kind hearts, without your support, prayers and everything,” Stepanyuk told about 100 people attending the three-hour event.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Among those honored were Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly, former State Sen. Tom Brewer, U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., and University of Nebraska President Jeffrey Gold. 
Many Nebraskans who traveled to Ukraine or Poland or supported displaced Ukrainians relocated to the Cornhusker State since the February 2022 invasion also were honored.
“We noticed every help, every gesture, every public release, and we are very proud to have the leaders that we have in this state,” Stepanyuk said. “This state truly lived up to its name: ‘Good Life State.’”
The event featured photos of the war and life in Ukraine from Howard Buffett, the son of Warren Buffett. Earlier this year, he published a nearly 400-page book, “Courage of a Nation: Three Years of War,” which was gifted to honorees.
Some honorees also received one-of-a-kind gifts — Bacon received an original map of Ukraine that includes Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 but many countries still recognize as Ukrainian. Pillen received a bulava, a ceremonial mace and traditional symbol of Ukrainian authority.
State Sens. Bob Andersen, Rob Clements, Stan Clouse, Barry DeKay, Rob Dover, Rick Holdcroft, Kathleen Kauth, Dave Murman and Merv Riepe attended, too, as did former State Sen. Anna Wishart.
‘We fight for survival’
A Ukrainian brigadier general, speaking virtually from the warfront, at about 3 a.m. where he was fighting, expressed gratitude to join a celebration of a Ukrainian community that, along with Americans, “break bread together during our mutual defense of freedom and liberty.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
He said he had seen up close the heroism and honors that American servicemen brought to the battlefield and said it was a privilege to serve with those who “truly make the world proud in the fight against the Kremlin evil.”
“War is not something any of us ask for or want, and every day we fight for survival and eventual victory,” the Ukrainian brigadier general said.
“We fight for freedom,” he said. “We fight for existence of our nation. We fight for future of our children.”
Gold, who worked with Brewer on how the university system could help, said Ukrainians were fighting to protect freedom and democracy locally but also “for the rest of the world.”
“For those that may not think that’s in question, rest assured, that’s exactly what’s in question and why this is so important,” Gold said. “Not just for the people of Ukraine, but for all of us that are here tonight.”
‘You are Nebraskans now’
Bacon, a retired Air Force brigadier general who served during the Cold War, has been among the most vocal members of Congress in defending Ukraine and its right to exist. He said the “bully” Russia can’t be appeased, that victory can’t mean Ukraine loses territory and that Russian leaders want to dominate and enslave those they see as “little Russians.”

He told the crowd he keeps speaking out “because it’s right,” not out of bravery or courage.
“They want their independence. They want free markets. They want to be part of the West,” Bacon said of Ukraine. “And we should embrace that with open arms.”
Stepanyuk said Ukrainians praying in support of their home country have cited Bacon’s congressional speeches and have looked to him as a “hero” and an example of a “true man.”
Pillen said the people of Ukraine touch his heart deeply and that Nebraskans can’t fathom what Ukrainians have been through or the courage many have shown in starting a new life. 
“All of us from Nebraska want to simply say: ‘Welcome,’ because you are Nebraskans now,” Pillen said.

Brewer worked closely with Pillen in 2023 to pass a new law that allowed Ukrainian refugees and other migrants legally in the state to get driver’s licenses. Pillen and Stepanyuk credited and honored Rhonda Lahm, director of the Nebraska Department of Motor Vehicles, for the speedy rollout of that law.
When Brewer reached out to Gold for help, Gold said he responded, “Immediately, yes. Just tell me how.” Gold was the chancellor of the University of Nebraska Medical Center when the war began and became NU president in July 2024. Gold helped coordinate ag sector conversations, secured medical scholarships and opened up work on bioprosthetics in Omaha research labs.
“We are here to reach out our arms and to embrace others who need help and to be sure that we do it right, we do it with humility,” Gold said. “We’re grateful for the opportunity to do so.”
‘Thank you for the sacrifice’
Brewer, a two-time Purple Heart recipient, said that when he first went to Ukraine after the war began, he didn’t know what he was getting into. On one of his first trips, he helped move supplies from secure areas to villages with many elderly Ukrainians between the front lines of an evolving war.

The colonel said he didn’t expect the mission to change how he saw the world after eight combat tours, but now, wherever he goes in Ukraine, no matter the town size, little old ladies come up, hug him and say, “Thank you.”
“As a soldier, that’s really all you want, is just to say, ‘Thank you for the sacrifice,’” Brewer said, choking up.
“The sheer volume of death that was happening over there would break the spirit of most folks, but they figured out how to survive and how to live in this terrible situation that they have.”
Stepanyuk said Brewer, the “lionheart,” is a household name for many Ukrainians and said Brewer became a “brother in arms,” not just a friend, when he joined the war trenches.

Joining the “lionheart” on recent missions to Ukraine has been a farmer, Don Hutchens, the former executive director of the Nebraska Corn Board, who had been to Ukraine before the war, and a storyteller, John Grinvalds, a reporter with KETV. 
Grinvalds documented the most recent mission in a five-part “Wounds of War” series published via KETV earlier this year. Grinvalds said the “wounds of war” can be seen globally and through many Nebraskans, neighbors who will carry the damage of war forever.
“I think for a fairer future, a brighter future, it’s time for us to look at how we can heal the wounds of war in our own backyard,” Grinvalds said.
A story of hope
Brewer recalled one of his early missions moving supplies, during which he was rushed to a potato cellar with about 20 people, mostly soldiers, as artillery shells landed above ground. Dirt fell from the ceiling as everything shook.
Ukrainian soldiers sat around making tea, Brewer said, with “no fear whatsoever. It’s just another day for them.”

He recalled a young soldier asking if Brewer wanted tea, and Brewer responded, “You betcha,” and quipped to the Friday crowd, “Vodka would have been better.”
Brewer didn’t know the group had run out of water. The young soldier opened the cellar door, darted into the courtyard and pumped a bucket of water from a hand-cranked well. He returned as more artillery rounds landed.
“I felt so terrible, because he just risked his life to get me a glass of tea, but that’s what I ran into in the way of love from these people,” Brewer said.
Starting a new life
The Protez Foundation in Minnesota is one U.S.-based nonprofit that has worked to give wounded Ukrainians who have lost limbs, for instance, a new start.

Among the more than 1,000 Ukrainians who have received care or are in steps to receive care are Dmitry, a 31-year-old former member of Ukraine’s 3rd Assault Brigade who lost both of his arms while fighting this year and teenager Alex, a native of Mariupol, which was among the earliest targets in the war. He lost his left leg in the first weeks of the war, at the age of 12.
Yuriy Gula, a representative of the foundation, translated the stories on behalf of Dmitry and Alex and thanked Nebraska and others for supporting Ukraine.
Dmitry did not know if it was a grenade or something else that injured him, but his arms were wrapped in tourniquets for 19 hours. A medical team could not reach him in time. Alex walked out of his house and a rocket fell near him. He lost a lot of blood and medical providers couldn’t save his leg.
‘Stay the course’
Pillen described the war as “totally unjust, should never have taken place.” He said Ukrainians and Nebraskans together are brothers and sisters, joining Brewer and Hutchens in highlighting the similarities Nebraska has with Ukraine, such as both being “bread baskets” of the world. Pillen said he hopes there will soon be peace.

Brewer intends to return to Ukraine with Hutchens and Grinvalds in December for about two weeks. The next mission will focus on uplifting Ukraine’s ag sector and orphanages. Brewer said he and Hutchens will stay closer to the country’s capital of Kyiv, working with country leaders and orphanages, while Grinvalds will be closer to the front.
Stepanyuk said people in his home country need Americans to “have Ukrainians in your heart.”
“There will be a day when this war is over and Ukraine will build back to what it was,” Brewer echoed. “I hope that Europe and the United States stay the course and are there to help them rebuild.”

A steady stream of visitors arrived at the El-Ada Community Action Partnership food pantry in Garden City from when it opened Thursday morning through the afternoon. 
Behind the open garage door where clients receive their food boxes, the stacks of canned food were not as high as they usually are, Pantry Manager James Thompson said.  
Thompson said the food bank location has been so busy, staff hasn’t had a chance to count how many people are visiting, but he estimated it’s up at least 50% with as many brand-new clients showing up as there are returning. 
Food banks and pantries across the state are reporting the same increase in demand since the federal government shut down in October and it was announced that food benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would dry up in November. 
“There’s a lot of people out there that are really, really struggling,” said Steve Small, food bank manager at the Community Action Partnership in Lewiston. “When it became certain that SNAP would be delayed or eliminated for this month, we had at least half a dozen people in here in tears, just in tears, saying, ‘I don’t know how I’m going to feed my family. I don’t know what I’m going to do.’” 
US Supreme Court temporarily blocks November SNAP payments

Through multiple court orders and conflicting information coming from the White House and U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs the food benefit program, the people who rely on the funding for groceries were left confused and concerned about where their next meal will come from. On Friday, the USDA said it would release full funding for November, States Newsroom reported.
However, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked on Friday night a lower court’s order that the Trump administration pay for a full month of food benefits, hours after some states began loading nutrition assistance funds on payment cards held by the 42 million Americans who use the program, States Newsroom reported.
In a two-page filing, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson accepted the government’s request to pause a Thursday order from Rhode Island Chief U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell while a lower appeals court hears the case.
 Local food banks say their supply is down as government shutdown, economic uncertainty continues

More than 130,200 Idahoans use SNAP to purchase food. The amount of money provided each month varies depending on household size, expenses, and income, but the average Idahoan receives $178 per month per household member, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. 
One of the visitors to Garden City food pantry said she only received about $30 a month from SNAP, but with her limited Social Security income of $1,350 a month, that extra money was critical to purchase more expensive grocery items, like meat. 
“You can get a lot of ground beef for $30,” said Maria Frolik, who lives in Boise. 
Food banks also say their supply is down, driven by a combination of canceled orders from the federal government and fewer donations amid economic uncertainty. 
As Thanksgiving approaches — the time of year when food banks see the highest demand — managers say they feel confident that the community will come together to meet the need, but they are increasingly concerned about their ability to feed their communities. 
“We will always find a way to give food to people, but it makes it more and more challenging,” Small said. “We don’t ever intend in the future to send anyone away without food, but it just gets more and more difficult all the time.”

  SNAP uncertainty prompts concern from recipients

After Congress failed to vote to extend federal funding by the end of the fiscal year, the federal government largely shut down starting Oct. 1. By Oct. 22, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced that the state would stop distributing funds.
The announcement left people in a lurch, suddenly without food assistance for November. 
“There wasn’t a lot of time to plan how they were going to kind of navigate through that,” said Ariel Jackson, executive director of the Community Food Basket in Idaho Falls. “… A lot of them that we’re seeing are families that were stable with their SNAP benefits, and when those suddenly disappear, and you weren’t really prepared for it, that becomes a crisis.” 
Jackson said the Idaho Falls food pantry served 100% more families every day in the past two weeks than it has on average. Typically, around 50 to 60 families a day would visit the pantry. Every day the past week, there were 100 to 120 families each day, Jackson said on Thursday.

In Lewiston, the food bank usually provides around 35 to 40 boxes each day, Small said. On Monday, the food bank distributed 75 boxes and more perishable items “rescued” from local grocery stores. 
“Seventy-five food boxes is a lot for our one location here in Lewiston any given day,” Small said. “Those are food boxes that average probably 50 to 55 pounds a piece. So we’re looking at right around 4,000 pounds of food in one day just through our pantry here.” 
Thompson, of the Garden City food pantry, said some of his clients are visiting multiple food banks to try and stock up enough to feed their families. 
Food banks are seeing a lot of new faces, as households who were able to make their finances pencil increasingly struggle to do so. Inflation on groceries and rising housing costs were already making it hard for many families to work, so the SNAP disruption sent some over the edge. 
“Just with EBT you had, people who are just getting by,” Thomson said. “And now you take that away, you’re forcing them to come to food banks.” 
 Federal court orders USDA to provide full benefit 

It’s unclear when SNAP recipients might get their cards used to pay for certain grocery items, called EBT cards, refilled. 
The original guidance in October was that there was no money appropriated for the program. After court challenges, a federal judge had told the USDA it had to use available contingency funds for SNAP. The federal agency responded in court filings that it intended to pay about 50% of the benefit. The USDA later said it miscalculated how to adjust the payment, and the cut would be closer to 35% instead. 
President Donald Trump on Tuesday, after the court order, wrote that no SNAP benefits would be provided until the government was reopened. 
When the USDA failed to release the benefits by the court’s Wednesday deadline, the federal judge ruled Thursday the agency had to pay the full amount recipients usually receive. 
The USDA announced Friday it would comply with the order, and provide the full funding available to the 42 million Americans who use the program, States Newsroom reported. Then later that day, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the November payments.
It’s unclear when households will have access to those funds. Federal officials previously said it may take weeks or months before the money lands in accounts of recipients, NPR reported. 
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Sun Nov. 3 the agency hadn’t received formal guidance from the USDA on how SNAP would be distributed. The agency couldn’t be reached after follow-up requests for comment on Wednesday and Friday.

 Idaho food banks are facing supply challenges amid heightened demand 

The food banks in the Treasure Valley, Lewiston and Idaho Falls said they had scheduled truckloads of food deliveries canceled this year by the federal government. 
The orders from American farmers and producers would have totaled an estimated more than 370,000 pounds for Idaho food banks, the Sun previously reported. 
Through what’s called the “bonus commodities” program within The Emergency Food Assistance Program, food banks can get American-produced products like meat, dairy and produce above and beyond what they typically get for assistance. 
“It was unexpected, and it created a shortage, and we weren’t really happy about it,” Small said. “But we carried on, and did the best we could with the other commodities that were available.” 
The El-Ada Community Action Partnership had six 18-wheeler trucks-worth of food canceled recently, Thompson said. The deliveries would’ve included cheese, pork, chicken and milk. 
Jackson, from the Idaho Falls food bank, said her organization doesn’t rely much on federal funding but had made orders through the bonus food program. The canceled orders included boxed milk, tomato sauce, canned fruit, and other shelf-stable staples. 
“We’ve had to buy more food this year than we have in our 45-year history,” Jackson said. 
Around Thanksgiving, many food banks arrange special food boxes centered around the holiday. In past years, this may have included turkeys, but high expenses and lower donations mean that’s out of reach for some organizations this year.  
Thompson said the Mountain Home food pantry location would host a turkey drive in a partnership with the Mountain Home Air Force Base, but it wouldn’t happen in other locations. 
In Idaho Falls, the Community Food Basket will still provide turkeys in its special holiday boxes, but with limitations, Jackson said. 
“I’m a little worried about having to potentially turn families away, because we do have to have a cap,” she said. 
Losing SNAP could mean more pregnancy complications as food insecurity grows

In the past, the organization has provided 300 households with turkey in Thanksgiving boxes, but she has to cap it at 150 families this year because of lack of supplies and rising costs. 
In Lewiston, the food bank used to distribute between 800 and 900 turkeys to households. Last year, the large donors that had paid for the turkeys stopped doing so. 
“We can’t really justify using our limited food budget to go out and buy 900 turkeys,” Small said. “That’s just a huge expenditure that we could use for other foods.”
“I think turkeys are incredibly important for families at Thanksgiving (for) food insecure families and low-income families. It’s just incredible, because it’s more than a meal. It’s actual participation in our community, in a sense. And so, I would love it if we could give away turkey, but last year, we couldn’t do it, and we’re probably not going to be able to do it this year either.” 
Individual donations have been dipping all year, Small said, while demand has been picking up. 
“Those two lines have converged, and it’s just really, really difficult right now,” Small said. 
The best way for the community to help, the food bank leaders told the Sun, is monetary donations. Food drives can help but many turn up with expired items or less-nutritious canned goods. With financial support, food bank staff can fill gaps and stretch the donation further. 
“We love food drives,” Jackson said. “They might bring in 300 boxes of cereal, but we need 2,000 a month … We have the ability to really stretch those dollars and make more of an impact.”

(Photo: Getty Images)Tennessee’s economic development leaders are nudging their focus toward attracting research and development business as job growth slows in manufacturing, one of the state’s largest industries.
Manufacturing sector employment in the United States has fallen sharply in the last 40 years, dropping from about 21% of total U.S. employment in 1980 to about 8% by the end of 2024, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. While job shrinkage in Tennessee has been less drastic, the trend is similar.
“This industry is growing in terms of production, but it’s shrinking in terms of employment,” Celeste Carruthers, professor of labor economics at the University of Tennessee Haslam College of Business, told The Tennessee Lookout. Those patterns can be chalked up to advancements in technology, automation and robotics, in addition to offshoring manufacturing labor, she said.
Manufacturing had the highest gross domestic product of any industry in Tennessee in 2024, bringing in more than $68 billion. The industry employed 364,400 Tennesseans that year, federal data shows — a modest increase from the state’s pre-pandemic high of 355,600 manufacturing employees in 2019.


An annual state economic outlook report presented to Gov. Bill Lee by the University of Tennessee’s Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research projected that Tennessee manufacturing jobs will “remain flat or see modest increases” in the long term, while nationwide manufacturing jobs continue to shrink.
The rising number of “advanced manufacturing” businesses choosing to locate in Tennessee translates to more capital investments, but not as many jobs, Deputy Governor and Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development Commissioner Stuart McWhorter said at a policy forum hosted by nonprofit think tank ThinkTennessee in October.
“Advanced manufacturing is a lot of things to a lot of people, but for us, it means companies that are investing in their equipment, in their automation, (and) making things using fewer people,” McWhorter said. 
Since 2019, Tennessee recorded a 61% increase in those types of projects and facilities.

“We’ve just seen this sort of decline in the number of jobs at new job projects that we’ve announced, and this (capital expenditure) number that’s just continuing to grow at a pretty exponential rate,” McWhorter said.
McWhorter is now asking companies who express interest in Tennessee to consider the state as a hub for their research and development operations as well. He cites the state’s universities, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Chattanooga’s quantum technology center, Arnold Air Force Base and logistics innovation in Memphis as examples of Tennessee’s research and development assets. 
Gov. Bill Lee spotlighted innovation as an investment priority in his seventh State of the State Address in January, proposing more funding for trade schools and nuclear energy. 
“If you look at 10 states that we typically compare ourselves to, we’re at the bottom, or near the bottom, in terms of R&D spend in our state, and we can do better than that,” McWhorter said. “We’ve just got to make sure that we lean in on that and make sure the industry understands it.”
State emphasizes technical college investments, research and development potential
Tennessee has poured hundreds of millions of grant dollars into attracting and expanding manufacturing businesses over the last decade.
From 2017 to 2024, Tennessee spent nearly $276 million to provide state job creation tax credits to businesses, more than half of which supported the creation of 33,409 manufacturing jobs, according to a report on Tennessee’s economy released in September by ThinkTennessee.
Automotive manufacturing has become one of the state’s highest priority industries for economic development, and its footprint in Tennessee grew from 264 establishments in 2019 to 305 establishments in 2022, according to ThinkTennessee’s report.
State leaders have particularly celebrated manufacturing investments as employment opportunities in rural communities. The announcement of more than 5,800 promised jobs at Ford and SK On’s new BlueOval City electric vehicle manufacturing plant in 2021 was heralded as a game-changer for rural communities in West Tennessee, though Ford has since delayed vehicle production at the plant until 2028.
Matt Kisber served as a Democratic state representative and was commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development under former Gov. Phil Bredesen before moving to his current private sector position as co-founder and CEO of solar energy company Silicon Ranch Corporation.
He and Bredesen took a trip to Wolfsburg, Germany to visit Volkswagen’s global headquarters when the company announced their Chattanooga plant.
“We’re going through this hall, they call it the Ghost Hall, and you don’t see a single person,” Kisber recalled. “It is where the undercarriage and the body of the vehicle are married, and it’s bolted and welded, and it’s all done by robotics.”
Kisber said company leaders told them that technical degrees are required to work in the Ghost Hall. 
Advanced manufacturing jobs that are coming to Tennessee will require that higher skill level — the ability to problem solve, communicate with teams and work with the robotics that are actually doing the work of production, he said.

Tennessee leaders have emphasized efforts to prepare Tennesseans for these opportunities for the last several years, including expanding technical college options.
The Tennessee College of Applied Technology opened an extension campus down the road from the BlueOval City campus in Stanton in 2024, for example.
McWhorter said the state is continuously working to identify and narrow skill gaps in the state’s workforce. The state launched TNWorks, a “central hub” to connect employers to workforce development services and provide data, this year.
Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development Commissioner Deniece Thomas said innovative manufacturing processes will still require a “human in the loop” to oversee automated systems.
Advanced manufacturing skills are useful outside of the manufacturing industry, she added.
“It’ll be disruptive, but some of those disruptions will be healthy,” Thomas said.

Edmund Fitzgerald, the 729-foot freighter that sank on Lake Superior on Nov. 10, 1975 on its way from Wisconsin to Detroit, memorials around Michigan and the Great Lakes paid homage to the 29 lives lost on the ship. 
So why is the ship’s wreck still a piece of Michigan’s identity, half a century later? There are a number of factors — the Edmund Fitzgerald was the last commercial shipwreck on the Great Lakes, and for most of its life, was the largest ship on the Great Lakes. 
But Gordon Lightfoot’s ballad, “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,” released the year after the ship’s sinking, is a key part of why it has remained a part of the state’s culture for so long, according to Victoria Stewart, the assistant director of the Humanities Center at Wayne State University.

From Gordon Lightfoot’s “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald”
“With a load of iron ore, twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early”




“It was the one that stuck because of the song and because it became embedded in memories further than just those in the community,” Stewart said. 
Lightfoot’s song — a six-minute ode to the ship and its crew — brought national attention to the sheer magnitude of the Great Lakes, and the dangers that those who worked on ships on the lakes faced every day, Stewart added. 
“It’s been almost 50 years now, since the song came out, and it was a number two hit on the Billboard charts when it came out, and that’s quite a feat for such a long ballad,” she said. “Across the United States and Canada, there are more people who have an understanding, at least a glimmer of the idea of the dangers that workers on the Great Lakes face every day during the season, when they go up and down the lake to provide the raw materials that we need to live.”



“Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early”

But the song, while a key piece of the sticking power of the shipwreck in the collective memory, as Stewart explains, is not the only way that the anniversary is being remembered. 
The gales of November felt as though they came early again on the day prior to the anniversary of the sinking, as snow fell on Detroit early Sunday — but that did not stop families of the deceased sailors and community members from showing up to remember the lives lost.
In a memorial service hosted at the Mariners’ Church of Detroit, the church’s Octorara and Brotherhood Bells tolled 30 times — 29 for each member of the crew who died, and one final toll for all sailors who have died on the Great Lakes.

Those bells have rung every year since the wreck, and are too immortalized in Lightfoot’s song. 



“In a musty old hall in Detroit, they prayed
In the Maritime Sailors’ Cathedral
The church bell chimed ’til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald”



Many of the bell-ringers were family members of the crew members of the ship, and pastor of the Mariners’ Church Rev. Todd A. Meyer noted that many of the families are passing the practice of ringing the bell onto the next generation — families in attendance ranged from older adults to toddlers.

In his homily, Meyer referenced Lightfoot’s song as well. 
“Does anyone know where the love of God goes, when the waves turn the minutes to hours?” he quoted, calling the ship’s history a story about suffering. 
“Our role today is we want to honor those who died on the Edmund Fitzgerald,. We want to remember their sacrifice, remember that for you, their families,” Meyer said. “You have joined with us in the stewardship of remembering and never forgetting the sacrifice that these 29 men made, but also the sacrifice that the maritime community makes every single day. Many of these men who died, and their families, as I’ve gotten to know them, lean on God.”
“One of the things about people whose lives are lost in disasters like this is that they can be remembered in a heroic way. They were just doing their job,” Stewart noted. “To recognize them is a way of honoring them, and of honoring their labor and all the hard work that they put in to our way of life as Americans.”
And while Lightfoot’s song has certainly contributed to the staying power of the Edmund Fitzgerald in American culture, the story also holds significance to the identity of many in the Great Lakes region, especially those with ties to the shipping industry. 
“They have this pride in the toughness that those folks had, and in the fact that our region has to be so tough in order to contribute to the rest of the world,” Stewart said.

Events to commemorate the anniversary are being held throughout the region, including at the National Museum of the Great Lakes in Toledo, Ohio, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum in Whitefish Point, Mich., and the Split Rock Lighthouse in Two Harbors, Minn. More permanent memorials can be found throughout Detroit, including at the Dossin Great Lakes Museum, where the ship’s anchor lives. 
“As long as we have things like that out in our world that are telling that story, it’s going to force people to think about it,” Stewart said.

[…]","Cattle made their way around the show ring at the Kist Livestock Auction in Mandan on Nov. 5, 2025. (Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota rancher August Heupel has yet to sell any of the beef calves he has raised this year, so far avoiding the recent drop in prices that was fueled in part by comments from President Donald Trump on importing beef. 
Heupel is hopeful that prices will stabilize and the industry can continue to grow.
“Fundamentally, things have not changed one bit,” Heupel said. “There’s still strong demand, and there’s still low cattle numbers.”  
Cattle prices had been at record highs in October when Trump signaled he was in favor of beef imports from Argentina to lower beef prices for consumers.  That sent cattle futures markets tumbling, in turn taking down live cattle prices at sale barns in North Dakota and elsewhere. 
“It feels like the sky is done falling,” said Heupel, who ranches near Medina and is vice president of the Independent Beef Association of North Dakota. 
The cattle futures market is set at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Futures prices for next spring are based on what traders think the value of a beef cow will be.

Meanwhile, ranchers are looking to sell calves born earlier in the year. The calves will likely go to another cattle feeding operation until they are up to market weight — when they are ready to be processed into cuts of beef for consumers. 
The expected price on the futures market is one of many factors that goes into determining what a buyer will offer for a crop of calves, said Tim Petry, an associate professor and livestock economist at North Dakota State University. 
“The futures market always overreacts to everything,” Petry said, whether that news is good or bad for the market. “So a lot of volatility there, and probably that is going to continue until all these tariff issues and stuff get out of the way.” 
Trump’s proposal would loosen tariffs on Argentinian beef, allowing more to come into the country. 
U.S. Department of Agriculture weekly reports on sales at North Dakota’s three largest livestock auction barns in Dickinson, Mandan and Napoleon show the effect of Trump’s comments.  
The first week after Trump spoke, prices for calves were down $20 to $30 per 100 pounds. The next week’s prices were down another $15 to $30 pounds per hundredweight. A 500-pound steer calf might have sold for an extra $300 before prices started to fall. 
Sellers often bring in several hundred cattle at a time known as the fall run. 
As pastures dry up in the fall, ranchers may have little choice but to sell.
A long fall has extended the grazing season for some ranchers. But Petry noted that grazing leases on federal land usually require grazing to end by mid-October. 
“It’s difficult for producers to really change their marketing pattern,” Petry said
While Heupel said the talk of imports threw the market “out of whack,” he expects it to calm down. 
“There’s going to be some level-headedness from every side and both sides of the aisle, including producers and politicians,” he said.

North Dakota U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak was among a group of House members asking the Trump administration for more information on the Trump administration import policy. 
Fedorchak, a Republican, followed up with a meeting of people involved in the North Dakota beef industry, including Heupel and Petry. 
After the meeting Fedorchak said ranchers “just need consistent, commonsense policies that let them do what they do best.” 
Heupel said the meeting included a good discussion of multiple issues affecting the beef industry. 
For example, Heupel said he would like to see tighter limits on how much the cattle futures market can rise or fall in a single day. The market fell the allowable limit on multiple days after Trump’s import comments. 
Chad Berger, a fifth-generation cattle rancher in Mandan, said people want to blame Trump for the prices fluctuating recently, but he credits Trump’s tariffs with helping drive up prices.

“If we can hold these prices where they are today, the rancher, the feeder, and everybody can make a little money and keep this thing going,” Berger said at Kist Livestock Auction in Mandan on Wednesday. 
Despite the recent volatility, Petry noted that live cattle prices are still well above what they were a year ago. 
Heupel agreed that it is still a good time for beef producers. 
“The cash market is still exceptionally good for the cattle producers right now,” Heupel said. “I think we’re going to be OK.”

They also hung in the windows of residential homes, outside of garages and off the side of the road on the main street between the two tourist-heavy towns. Parked outside the businesses in both towns, multiple cars were embellished with yellow, rectangular bumper stickers reading “I [heart] TUCKER COUNTY MORE THAN CHATGPT.”

“I think it’s safe to say we’re in a bit of a battle right now,” said Angie Downs, who owns the Adventure Guild Game Shop in downtown Thomas with her husband, Jason Downs. “We all want to know more about what’s coming into our backyard. We want to know how it will affect us. We want to know what’s going to change.”
All the signage around the towns is targeted toward Fundamental Data, a Virginia-based company planning to construct an off-the-grid natural gas power plant between Thomas and Davis to, eventually, power an enormous data center.
The state Department of Environmental Protection granted Fundamental Data an air permit earlier this year for the project. 
Now, residents — represented by the law firm Appalachian Mountain Advocates — are attempting to appeal the permit and stop the construction as soon as possible.
At the root of their resistance to the proposed development is fear over the unknowns, anger over the lack of respect and involvement, and concern over what unintended consequences such a facility could bring to the region.
“I think a lot of people feel this whole thing was done without our involvement on purpose. It was shady,” said Frank Gebhard, a biologist and photographer who lives in Thomas. “The fact that they [Fundamental Data] aren’t even willing to answer any of our questions about the pollution or water usage or anything else — well why would I want someone like that as my neighbor?”

‘We live out here for a reason’: Residents concerned over potential harms to tourism
In a heavily redacted permit application, Fundamental Data says the proposed power plant would use gas-fueled turbines with heat recovery steam generators. Diesel would be kept on site in three 10 million gallon storage tanks as a backup power source in case of gas line interruptions. Those tanks would be 66 feet tall and 180 feet in diameter. Leaks from pumps and valves, among other pieces of equipment, are to be expected per the application. Operations for the facility should begin by 2028.
Annually, the facility would have the potential to annually emit 99 tons of nitrogen oxides, 56 tons of carbon monoxide and 44 tons of volatile organic compounds.
And aside from the emissions, the complex — once completed — could take up more than 10,000 acres between the rural, mountain communities that depend on outdoors tourism to support their economy.
Polly Deely moved to the Canaan Valley earlier this year for the area’s skiing. She works at BLOOM, an arthouse and gallery in downtown Thomas.
“This decision to put a [natural gas] power plant in the middle of a tourism hotspot — it’s so tone deaf, it makes no sense to me,” Deely said. “I’m very concerned about how this will change the climate around the Canaan Valley, if we’ll see as many people coming here for the wilderness, if it will affect the air quality and make people not want to ski or hike when they can probably go somewhere else with cleaner air.”
Gebhard, who works at a boutique in Thomas in addition to his work as a biologist and photographer, said he believes a power plant and data center will ruin the area for dark skies photography.
Many people come out to the valley for night time shots. It’s the perfect place due to the lack of light pollution. Light from a data center and emissions from the power plant, he said, could change all of that.
“This just kind of really sucks. A lot of us, we live out here for a reason. We depend on other people coming out here for similar reasons — the clean air, the wilderness, the dark skies,” Gebhard said. “All that light, that noise, it’s going to ruin something really special.”
Not everyone in downtown Thomas and Davis spoken to for this story was against the development. Four individuals said they support the power plant and data center due to the need for Tucker County to increase its revenues, however they would not agree to be quoted or have their names used for this article.
Downs said she understands that need for more income, as well, and wants to see it herself. This past year, the Tucker County Commission enacted a 2% Special Emergency Ambulance Service Fee for recreational purchases and rentals to help support the cash-strapped EMS services, demonstrating the need for more funds.
Downs is unsure, however, that the current proposal is the kind of industry or income the region should rely on. And if it doesn’t go as planned and does negatively affect tourism, she and other business owners stand to lose. She said between 70-80% of her monthly sales — of graphic novels, board games, novelty dice and more — come from individuals visiting the town.
“We are reliant on people coming here to be in nature,” Downs said. “I don’t know if that same volume will exist when that nature is overtaken by diesel drums and smoke. How will they protect us?”
On that first Saturday of November, there were nearly two dozen cars parked outside businesses in both Thomas and Davis with license plates from several different places — some as far away as Arizona, Canada and Vermont, and others from neighboring states, like Ohio, Kentucky and Pennsylvania.
For decades, tourism has been central to life in Thomas and Davis. In 2023, according to the state Department of Tourism, more than $85 million was spent in Tucker County by tourists who come to hike, ski, snowshoe and more.
If the power plant and data center is built, it’s likely that all but 70% of the property taxes paid on the complex would be sent to the state. That’s due to the passage of House Bill 2014, which was meant to incentivize data centers to locate in the state by stripping localities of their right to pass or enforce any zoning ordinances to regulate their placement or activity. The legislation also set up a special tax structure that has half of all property taxes paid going to the state’s personal income tax reduction fund.

“So we don’t even get really all the money we should be owed and we have no say, no control, over how [this facility] would operate?” Deely questioned. “That’s not right and it’s not fair.”
Last week, according to Country Roads News, state Senate President Randy Smith, R-Preston, told some Tucker County residents that there will be “a lot of changes” to HB 2014 over coming years. He specifically referenced the local control portion of the code being revisited.
But Deely said she already felt disrespected by members of the Legislature who she said “sold out” her and her neighbor’s rights to protect themselves against the development. Across the country, local governments have had success stopping data centers from being constructed due to their local zoning ordinances. 
“I want to live in a place that’s healthy — the air, the land, the people — and where I feel respected,” Deely said. “This certainly has changed the way I feel about being here. I understand why people love this place so much, I love it too. Loving it makes it harder to accept this very bad thing happening. It makes it harder to look forward to the future here.”
‘So many of us are angry’: Residents lament their lack of power, consent
Downs and her husband are in the process of moving. The home they’ve lived in since locating here in 2022 sits just half a mile from the proposed site for the power plant.
“So yeah, we’re packing it all up and we’re relocating outside of Thomas, farther away from the development,” Downs said. “It’s unfortunate that it came to that, and I wonder if more people are going to sell their homes because of this.”
Already, housing costs in Tucker County — specifically in Thomas and Davis — are some of the highest in the state. That’s in part due to AirBNBs pricing out people who live in the region full-time.
“Pretty soon, I worry that this is going to be nothing but an Airbnb community,” Downs said. “I think [the power plant] could accelerate that if more people sell, and I wonder what it will look like on the other side, if it is built.”

In nearby Davis, Sarah Stonesifer bought her home not long after Angie and Jason Downs moved to the area.
Stonesifer has lived in the region full time for nearly two decades. Growing up, she would visit regularly with her family. She remembers falling in love with the place and being excited to move there for good in 2009, when she was pregnant with her son, now-15-year-old Orion.
“This is the only place that has ever felt like home to me. This is the only place that has ever really spoken to me in a way that I listened, and I feel grateful that I was able to raise my kids here,” Stonesifer said. “This land is special. This community, these people are special. I am worried and afraid for what could come next.”
Stonesifer has worked in the area for two decades — in restaurants, art galleries, rental properties and more — to become a homeowner. When it came time two years ago to decide where she wanted to own, she was intentional about her choice.
She wanted her family to be in nature. Both her kids — Orion and 12-year-old Mena — love the outdoors. Her husband has been in the area for about nine years himself, she said. They both ended up there because of a love of nature.
“We love to be outdoors as much as we possibly can. Our whole family does,” Stonesifer said. “It adds so much to all of our lives.”
But there’s another reason a mountainside home among the trees appealed so deeply to her: Mena lives with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that affects mucus membranes, often clogging the lungs and impacting the digestive system along with other organs. 
Almost a teenager, Mena is thriving despite her cystic fibrosis. She’s been able to put on and keep weight — a struggle for many children with the disease — and is growing at a rate comparable to her peers.
Her lung function, Stonesifer said, is exceeding 100%. Her doctors are amazed by her progress.
“She’s basically functioning like any other kid her age,” Stonesifer said. “That’s all we’ve ever wanted for her, and I am so grateful everyday to see how healthy she is living.”
Mena’s success comes in large part to a strict and robust medical routine, Stonesifer said. There are numerous medications and therapies practiced morning and night to ensure Mena’s lungs and other organs are functioning correctly. 
Though it’s impossible to prove, Stonesifer also credits her daughter’s health to the fresh air and nature that surrounds them. 
People who have cystic fibrosis can be more vulnerable to complications caused by air pollutants, like nitrogen oxide and particulate matter that can irritate even healthy lungs. If a power plant were to open down the way and emit the exact pollutants known to affect kids like Mena, Stonesifer worries that her daughter’s health could suffer.
“If they’re burning diesel up there — that’s the dirtiest fuel there is. That’s going to change everything. No one, not even those of us [without cystic fibrosis] are used to that kind of pollution in the air up here,” Stonesifer said. “It scares me of what that will do to Mena, to anyone else who is at-risk. What are we supposed to do?”
The answers aren’t easy: they’re buried in a mortgage on a home she’s dreamed of owning. When they purchased it, she said, they never considered a power plant would come so close to home.
“I came here on purpose. I bought this home. I lived in this community. Now, everything around us — all of us — is being threatened without our consent. The only chance we have to pass something or stop this locally was taken away by the Legislature. I’m angry, so many of us are angry,” Stonesifer said. “The reality is this is going to happen all over our state because [Gov. Patrick] Morrisey and our [state Legislature] wants it to. They don’t care about us or what we want and need. This is just the beginning and I hope the rest of West Virginia is watching.

(Photo by Lynne Terry/Oregon Capital Chronicle)A state task force studying the pros and cons of natural psychedelics recommended that state lawmakers take steps toward decriminalizing natural psychedelics for medical and recreational use in the near future.
The Maryland Task Force on Responsible Use of Natural Psychedelic Substances, in a report released last week, says that with interest in the medicinal and therapeutic use of natural psychedelics on the rise, Maryland is “well positioned to be among the first states to expand access to psychedelic substances.”
But even as new research shows promising results for use of natural psychedelics to treat challenging mental health conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder, public health advocates urge caution as state lawmakers consider future decriminalization efforts and health policy.
“It’s a big deal and we need to take it seriously,” said Gene Ransom, CEO for MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society.
“We’re not saying we shouldn’t learn about it and learn new things … But we need to make sure that we first do no harm,” he said. “We need to be very careful and very thoughtful”
The task force was created by 2024 legislation sponsored by Sen. Brian J. Feldman (D-Montgomery) and Del. Pam Lanman Guzzone (D-Howard) to study and make recommendations for “safe, equitable, and evidence-informed statewide approach to natural psychedelic substances such as psilocybin, dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and mescaline excluding peyote” according to the report.
Advocates welcome cannabis pardons, but urge Moore to continue justice reform efforts

“I was really interested in it particularly for the research that’s out there on its effectiveness … for a good number of people, on things like PTSD, traumatic brain injury, treatment-resistance depression,” Guzzone said.
She also noted that nearby areas like Washington, D.C., have a “gray market” on natural psychedelics, meaning Marylanders may still access them even if there are not currently legal avenues to acquire it in the state.
“If we’re going to have this out there, we need to be safe and really understand it,” Guzzone said.
The report released last week recommended that Maryland lawmakers first build regulations focusing on psilocybin, the substance found in “magic mushrooms,” before moving on to other natural psychedelics.
The topic of natural psychedelics is an evolving research and legislative field. Twelve other states have enacted legislation to study psychedelics or create a task force similar to the one in Maryland to recommend policies. A couple of states have already moved to decriminalize the substance for recreational use and therapeutic uses.
And even though the federal Food and Drug Administration currently classifies psilocybin as a Schedule 1 drug, the FDA gave it a “breakthrough therapy designation” in recent years for conditions like treatment-resistant depression and major depressive disorder.
That said, the state task force recognizes potential health and safety challenges in this newer landscape of public health.
“In this rapidly evolving landscape, policy choices carry real consequences: they can open access to potentially life-saving treatments, or inadvertently create public health risks,” the report says. “They can protect Indigenous and religious traditions, or unintentionally erode them. Effective policy requires not only scientific rigor, but cultural humility, ethical foresight, and a commitment to public safety.”
Phased approach
The task force recommends multi-step approach that would start with greater access to psilocybin for medical and therapeutic uses, later expanding to possible recreational use and commercial sales.
The first phase would build a regulatory framework around psilocybin, which would include creating safety protocols, data monitoring, public education campaigns, law enforcement training and “immediate” restorative justice measures.










“There will be a lot of work to do, and I don’t think anyone needs to panic that come the end of session we’re suddenly going to have full-blown psilocybin availability. My guess is that this will take several years.”


– Del. Pam Lanman Guzzone (D-Howard)


The policy recommendation would include “deprioritization with civil penalties with expungement,” meaning that law enforcement would “would treat personal possession and cultivation as lowest priority.” The task force also encourages expungement for those previously convicted for simple possession.
Phase two would launch the introduction of psilocybin with medical oversight in clinical settings. Phase three  would usher in “full operation and expansion” of psilocybin, which would activate commercial sales and evaluate readiness to expand out to other natural psychedelic substances outside of psilocybin.
An independent report conducted by Johns Hopkins University researchers included in the task force’s study noted while research for therapeutic uses have been promising, there are still potential harms that come with use of natural psychedelics if not handled properly.
This is especially the case when natural psychedelics are used without professional guidance, which can result in adverse psychological reactions, dangerous substance interactions, or acute toxicity, according to the Hopkins report.
“Even though serotonergic psychedelics appear to have low abuse potential, their risks outside carefully controlled trials are not well understood,” it says. “As recreational use has increased, adult emergency department visits related to psychedelic use and poison control centers related to psychedelic use by both adolescents and adults have also increased.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The state task force also acknowledges those challenges, but called research on natural psychedelics “one of the most rapidly evolving areas of modern medicine.”
“Results are highly promising, but still preliminary, with a strong focus on addressing conditions that are resistant to conventional treatments,” it says.
But even supporters like Guzzone believe that recreational use of psilocybin and other natural psychedelics is a long ways off. Even creating policy around medical and therapeutic use will take time and it’s important to “not jump the gun.”
The state must “Make sure everybody is on board in a bunch of different ways, including with regard to education, of the public establishment of procedures and guidelines on the sort of more standard medical side,” she said. “But also be respectful of traditional uses of this, because from a Native American point, these substances have been used for hundreds of years.
“There will be a lot of work to do, and I don’t think anyone needs to panic that come the end of session we’re suddenly going to have full blown psilocybin availability,” she said. “My guess is that this will take several years.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) As an off-cycle special election, turnout in the special election primary for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District race was down significantly compared to the 2024 General Election. 
Across both parties’ primaries, around 67,000 votes were cast last month compared to almost 330,000 in 2024, when now-retired U.S. Rep. Mark Green, a Clarksville Republican, beat Democrat Megan Barry by a nearly 20-percentage point margin. 
But in a glimmer of hope for Democrats, their primary turnout of 31,000 nearly matched that of Republicans with 36,000. The Democratic Party hasn’t won Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District in over 40 years, and in 2022 the district was redrawn as part of a Republican gerrymander.

Republican former General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps will face Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn in the general election to replace Green on Dec. 2. The Cook Political Report classifies the district 7 seat as a “Solid Republican,” but internal polling by Behn’s campaign shows she trails 52% to 44%. 
Republican turnout in the primary was down by more than 80% in many Nashville precincts but also in much of Clarksville and its surrounding rural areas, according to precinct data analyzed by the Lookout. In terms of raw votes, Republicans saw turnout drop by almost 2,000 voters in some precincts in Cheatham and Williamson counties. 
For several election cycles, Democrats in the 7th district have received a large share of their support from the two urban centers of Clarksville and Nashville. During the 2025 special election, almost no voters in rural counties like Hickman and Wayne voted for Democrats, and in Nashville, the drop-off in voter turnout wasn’t nearly as steep for the party as it was for Republicans in their strongholds.
What’s the focus of the race
In acknowledgement that he can’t cruise to victory, Van Epps’ campaign has attacked Behn over her support for abortion rights and the protests she participated in during Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Nashville in May.

Republicans hold a 4-seat majority in the U.S. House, meaning the 7th district can’t change the party in power, but after a strong 2025 election showing in the governor’s races for Virginia and New Jersey, national Democrats turned to the Tennessee race as they are looking for another avenue to prove that they’re beating or closing the margins in areas where Republicans typically dominate. 
Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin was in Middle Tennessee on Saturday to canvass with Behn, the first public sign of support from the national party.
During the primary, Van Epps raised significantly more money than hismoney his Republican opponents and benefited from nearly $2 million in outside political action committee (PAC) spending. These independent groups touted Van Epps’s military career, labeling him a “MAGA Warrior,” while a pro-school voucher group attacked his top opponent for not supporting Trump enough in 2016. 
Behn raised around $150,000, narrowly winning her primary through a voter-turnout strategy. Her message to Democrats was that she had the best shot at winning the special election because of her progressive messaging on campaign finance reform, and taxing the wealthy could boost turnout. 
Early voting for the general election starts on Nov. 12.

William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery) on the floor of the Senate on April 5.

Ford/Maryland Matters)A Maryland commission is recommending that the state do away with its practice of automatically charging youth as adults for certain crimes, saying it doesn’t improve public safety and can harm the youth.
The nine-page, heavily footnoted report from a workgroup of the Commission on Juvenile Justice Reform and Emerging and Best Practices is the first recommendation, since the commission was overhauled last year.
“This practice fails to protect communities. Instead, it disproportionately impacts children of color, diverts resources away from critical services for children and families, places children in dangerous environments that more often result in subsequent violent or general criminal behavior,” says the report, which was approved by the commission Oct. 23. “The problem is not one of minor procedural adjustments; it is structural.”
The report, prepared by the commission’s Processes and System Coordination Workgroup, says the state needs to replace the “automatic charging with a system where all cases begin in juvenile court, with judicial discretion to waive youth into adult court when warranted. This reform reflects national best practice and aligns Maryland with federal law.”
Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), one of four state lawmakers on the 26-member commission, said he plans to reintroduce a bill dealing with the issue.
Lawmakers vow to reclaim, redeem forgotten cemetery for Black youth

The bill he proposed during the 2025 General Assembly session would have raised the age at which a youth would be tried as an adult, from 14 to 16. It also would have made those 16 and younger eligible to go to juvenile court if they were charged with crimes, such as first-degree assault, third-degree sex offense and certain offenses involving machine guns.
The commission report found that the state is “significantly” out of compliance with guidelines from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. That office provides states and local jurisdictions with money to fund reentry initiatives for youth who have been incarcerated, treatment for those who may have been abused and other community service programs.
One of the four core requirements to receive funding is “removal of juveniles from adult jails and lockups.”
In fiscal 2024, Maryland youth spent 90 to 180 days in adult jails before being transferred to juvenile court, the report said. OJJDP guidelines say youth must not be held in adult facilities for more than six hours “unless a court finds it is in the interest of justice based on a seven-factor test.” Those factors are age, mental state, charge severity, delinquency history, facility capacity, public safety and any other relevant factors.
In fiscal 2023, the state’s detention rate at adult facilities was 93.2 per 100,000 children, more than six times the federal standard of about 14.7 per 100,000. The following fiscal year, the state’s detention rate rose to 119.5, a 28% increase.
“With the state’s 2024 rate of children detained in adult facilities going far beyond the federal threshold, Maryland stands to lose $350,000 in federal formula grant funding over the next two years due to these violations,” the report said.
‘Kids should be treated like kids’
Meanwhile, the Governor’s Office of Crime Prevention and Policy separately submitted a 39-page report to the governor and presiding legislative officers last month. Besides the commission’s process work group, it has four other groups – public education and narrative change; fatality review; prevention; and youth rehabilitation services.
Some of the work conducted by the commission included panel discussions with law enforcement officials and public defenders, research on rehabilitation and mental health services and the lack of dedicated funding for various initiatives and programs.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“As we continue forward, we must never lose sight of the foundational truth I shared in those opening remarks: justice-involved children need what all children need, only more of it, more consistently, and with more compassion,” wrote Andre Davis, chair of the commission and a retired judge of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. “They need healing, not handcuffing. Support, not surveillance. Opportunity, not obstacles. And they need us to lead with both urgency and care.”
As for Smith, he’s scheduled to participate in a juvenile justice discussion Thursday at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. The event is entitled “National Roundtable on Prosecuting Youth As Adults: Policy, Research & Practice.”
Also on the panel will be Marc Schindler, former assistant secretary and chief of staff with the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services. Although the discussion is open to the public, people are asked to register here.
“Young people are experiencing tremendous challenges and accessing opportunity, services and supports,” said Liz Ryan, a former administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention during the Biden administration and co-host of the roundtable, during an interview Friday.
“We need to make sure that young people are getting what they need to grow and thrive,” she said. “Kids should be treated like kids.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sen.-William-C.-Smith-Jr.-4-5-2025-newsletter-1024x770.jpg,,,2025-11-10 06:17:34.345272

HALIFAX COUNTY, N.C. — When Ivy McFarland first traveled from her native Honduras to teach elementary Spanish in North Carolina, she spent a week in Chapel Hill for orientation. By the end of that week, McFarland realized the college town on the outskirts of Raleigh was nowhere near where she’d actually be teaching.
On the car ride to her school district, the city faded into the suburbs. Those suburbs turned into farmland. The farmland stretched into more farmland, until, two hours later, she made it to her new home in rural Halifax County.
“I was like, ‘Oh my God, this is far,’” McFarland said. “It was shocking when I got here, and then I felt like I wanted to go back home.”
Nine years later, she’s come to think of Halifax County as home.
In this stretch of rural North Carolina, teachers hail from around the globe: Jamaica, the Philippines, Honduras, Guyana. Of the 17 teachers who work at Everetts Elementary School in the Halifax County school district, two are from the United States.
In this rural school district surrounded by rural school districts, recruiting teachers has become a nearly impossible task. With few educators applying for jobs, schools like Everetts Elementary have relied on international teachers to fill the void. Districtwide, 101 of 156 educators are international.

“We’ve tried recruiting locally, and it just has not worked for us,” said Carolyn Mitchell, executive director of human resources in the eastern North Carolina district of about 2,100 students. “Halifax is a rural area, and a lot of people just don’t want to work in rural areas. If they’re not people who are from here and want to return, it’s challenging.”
Around the country, many rural schools are contending with a shortage of teacher applicants that has ballooned into a crisis in recent years. Fewer students are enrolling in teacher training programs, leading to a shrinking pipeline that’s made filling vacancies one of the most challenging problems for school leaders to solve in districts with smaller tax bases and fewer resources than their suburban and urban peers. In certain grade levels and subject areas — like math and special education positions — the challenge is particularly acute. Now, some of the levers rural schools have used to boost their teacher recruitment efforts are also disappearing.
This spring, the federal Department of Education eliminated teacher residency and training grants for rural schools. In September, President Donald Trump announced a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications — visas hundreds of schools like Everetts Elementary use to hire international teachers for hard-to-staff positions — saying industries were using the visas to replace American workers with “lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.” A lawsuit filed by a coalition of education, union, nonprofit and other groups is challenging the fee, citing teacher shortages. Rural schools are also bracing for more cuts to federal funding next year.
“We’re not only talking about a recruitment and retention problem. We’re talking about the collapse of the rural teacher workforce,” said Melissa Sadorf, executive director of the National Rural Education Association.

Most of Halifax’s international teachers arrive on H-1B visas, which allow them to work in the U.S. for about five years with the possibility of a green card at the end of that period. About one-third of the district’s international teachers have J-1 visas, which let them work in the country for three years with the possibility of renewing it for two more. At the end of those five years, educators on J-1 visas are required to return to their home countries.
A few years ago, Halifax County Schools decided to shift from hiring teachers on J-1 visas in favor of H-1B, hoping it would reduce teacher turnover and keep educators in their classrooms for longer. The results have been mixed, Mitchell said, because within a few years, some of their teachers ended up transferring to bigger, higher-paying districts anyway.
There are trade-offs for the teachers, too. Mishcah Knight came to the U.S. from Jamaica both to expand her skills and increase her pay as an educator. In the rural North Carolina county, finding transportation has been the biggest challenge for Knight, who teaches second grade.
She lacks a credit history needed to buy a car, leaving her reliant on carpooling to work. A single taxi driver serves the area, which doesn’t have public transit, Uber or Lyft. “Sometimes, he’s in Virginia,” Knight said. “It’s lucky when we actually get him to take us somewhere.”
Being away from family also takes its toll on teachers. Nar Bell Dizon, who has taught music at Everetts Elementary since 2023, had to leave his wife and son back home in the Philippines. He visits in the summer, but during the school year, he sees them only through video calls.
“This is what life is — not everything is smooth,” Dizon said. “There will always be struggles and sacrifices.”
Dizon’s first year in Everetts Elementary School was hard — it took time adapting to a different teaching style and classroom management. Now that he’s in his third year, he feels like he’s gotten his feet beneath him.
“When you can build a rapport with your students, things become easier,” Dizon said.
When her international teachers are able to stay for longer, the students perform better, said Chastity Kinsey, principal of Everetts Elementary. “I know the benefit the teachers bring to the classroom,” Kinsey said. “After the first year or two, they normally take off like rock stars.”

Related: Trump’s cuts to teacher training leave rural school districts, aspiring educators in the lurch 
Trump’s new fee does not address any of the challenges the Halifax district had with the H-1B visa, and it effectively slams the door on future hires. Now, the district will have to rely on J-1 visas to recruit new international teachers, meaning the educators will have to leave just as they’ve acclimated to their classrooms.
“We just can’t afford to,” Mitchell said of paying the $100,000 fee. Other districts, she said, might turn to waivers allowing them to increase class sizes and hire fewer teachers, among other strategies.
Since the applicant pool began drying up about a decade ago, the make-up of the district’s teaching staff has slowly shifted to international teachers.
At the heart of the problem is that when a position opens up, few, if any, citizens apply, said Katina Lynch, principal of Aurelian Springs Institute of Global Learning, an elementary school in Halifax County.
When Lynch had to hire a new fourth grade teacher this summer, she received three applications: Only one was a licensed teacher from the U.S.
Nationally, about 1 in 8 teaching positions are either vacant or filled by teachers who are not certified for the position, according to data from the nonprofit Learning Policy Institute, published in July. In addition to fewer college students graduating with degrees in education, diminished public perception of the teaching profession and political polarization of schools are to blame, school leaders said. In some states, the growth of charter and private school options has made competing for teachers even harder. On top of a widening pay gap between rural and urban districts, it’s a perfect storm for schools in more remote parts of the country, said Sadorf.

Districts are experimenting with different strategies to help, she said, including introducing students to teacher training pathways starting in high school, building “grow-your-own” programs to train local people for teaching jobs, and offering loan forgiveness and housing support.
Sadorf’s organization is in favor of creating an educator-specific visa track that would allow international teachers to be in communities for longer. The group is also in favor of exempting schools from the $100,000 H-1B fee. “Stabilizing federal support is something that really needs to be focused on at the federal level,” Sadorf said.
At Everetts Elementary in Halifax County, McFarland, the educator from Honduras, is among the most senior teachers in the school. She has adapted to the rural community, where she met and fell in love with her now-husband. She gets asked sometimes why she hasn’t moved to a bigger city.
“Education has taken me places I’ve never expected,” McFarland said. “For me, being here, there’s a reason for it. I see the difference I can make.”

More than 60,000 West Virginians received notices that their health insurance premiums will be skyrocketing on January 1, 2026, given ongoing uncertainty around whether Congress will extend tax subsidies that make ACA Marketplace plans affordable for people who do not receive health coverage through their jobs. And the only hospital in Greenbrier County just announced it will no longer provide labor and delivery services.
What do these concerning developments have in common? They are all part of the fallout from the passage of Congress’ “Big Beautiful Bill” enacted earlier this summer, which all four of West Virginia’s members of Congress voted for.
That legislation contained the largest cuts to SNAP and Medicaid in the nation’s history, which will result in tens of thousands fewer West Virginians having access to these programs. It includes the new restrictions that will take food assistance away from parents and veterans in the coming months. For the households impacted, health care and groceries will become even more difficult to afford, as they already grapple with rising costs and a slowing economy.
But that’s not all. The bill also slashed Medicaid and SNAP by shifting federal program costs onto state budgets, and lawmakers will now have to come up with tens of millions of state dollars in upcoming years to plug holes in Medicaid and SNAP.  
Other components of the legislation impact reimbursements and funding streams for health care providers, which is why some hospitals and clinics across the country are trimming services and even consolidating or closing their doors in anticipation of lower reimbursements and a higher volume of uncompensated care when more patients are uninsured. 
While officials at the Greenbrier Valley Medical Center didn’t explicitly blame the federal legislation, they noted the reorganization would give them access to a higher level of reimbursement in order to make the hospital more sustainable. Our elected leaders should be working to expand health care access in rural parts of the state, not rubber-stamping policies that result in less accessible care. Now families in Greenbrier County and surrounding towns will have to travel farther for treatment and staff may lose their jobs or be forced to transfer farther away for work.
What the legislation shockingly did not contain, despite the prioritization of windfall tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy (80% of the tax benefits go to the top 10% richest households), was an extension of the tax credits that help hardworking West Virginians — mainly self-employed, small business owners and their employees, and retirees — afford health coverage on the marketplace. That explains the sticker shock many are experiencing now while shopping for health coverage for January.
These are all the very real results of the Big Beautiful Bill, despite assertions from the legislation’s supporters that the impacts are delayed or that band-aid provisions like the Rural Health Transformation Program will dampen the harms.
While some of the effects are already here, there is much more pain to come in the form of deep cuts to Medicaid both via eligibility restrictions and more federal cost shifts onto states, higher costs for West Virginians with student loan debt, and higher energy prices due to the repeal of affordable, clean energy programs. These changes don’t only hurt the West Virginians who directly utilize these programs, but also the rest of us when our community hospitals reduce services, job losses in the health care and energy industries weaken our economy, and more of our community members experience hunger and suffering.
It’s not too late for West Virginia’s members of Congress to say enough is enough and address the affordability and economic crises created as a result of the Big Beautiful Bill. They can still roll back these harmful changes — but they must acknowledge that the harm is here. For many of us, it’s already undeniable.

(Getty Images)If you smoke and want to quit, call the national quit line at 1-800-784-8669 to speak with a confidential coach. 
Despite a robust screening system, Kentucky is the worst state in the nation for new lung cancer cases, a report shows. 
The American Lung Association’s State of Lung Cancer report, released Wednesday, shows lung cancer is the commonwealth’s leading cause of death. Kentucky has the second-highest rate of smoking in the nation — behind only West Virginia. 
Shannon Baker, the advocacy director for the Lung Association in Kentucky, said the state’s return to second-worst smoking rates (a decline from the previous ranking of fourth in the nation) is “a threat to the progress that we’ve made” to combat lung cancer.

Kentucky is screening lung cancer at higher rates than the national average, and has a law on the books requiring insurance to cover biomarker testing. Biomarker testing “is a way to look for genes, proteins and other substances (called biomarkers or tumor markers) that can provide information about cancer,” according to the National Cancer Institute. 
Despite this work, cancer cases remain high. 
Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, and Kentucky “has a long history with tobacco and tobacco use being generational,” Baker said. 
“We know nicotine is incredibly addictive, and so even those who want to quit have a tough road ahead of them,” she said. 
Other factors making Kentucky a high-risk state for lung cancer include its high rates of radon, an odorless gas that can cause lung cancer, and the prevalence of vaping. 
“While the science continues to collect around (vaping), we can all say, from just a common sense perspective, that inhaling aerosol and carcinogens and chemicals and fine particles deep into our lungs isn’t likely to be good in the long run, is it?” Baker said. 
Barriers to convincing youth not to vape persist, she said. Even the name implies that “it’s a harmless water vapor — and that is a misnomer, but it’s not an accidental one.” 
“Think of the tutti frutti flavors, and think of the social media advertising and the influencers and the ‘super cool’ — tongue firmly in cheek — devices,” Baker said. “Our youth have been targeted. They have been lured with flavors, targeted with media … and addicted to incredibly and increasingly high levels of nicotine.” 
During the 2025 session, the Kentucky General Assembly passed a law to license all retailers who sell tobacco and vape products, giving the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) inspection and enforcement powers over them, similar to those it exercises over alcohol retailers. 
This move, Baker said, is “helping to better protect our kids” but “we have ground to gain.” 
By the numbers 
Kentucky is not doing enough to prevent smoking and vaping, says annual report

Other findings from the 2025 report show:

The 2022 smoking rate in Kentucky was 17.4%, higher than the 2023 national rate of 11.4%.
The rate of new lung cancer cases in Kentucky is 84.1, significantly higher than the national rate of 52.8.
Over the last five years, the rate of new cases in Kentucky improved by 9%.
The percent of people alive five years after being diagnosed with lung cancer in Kentucky is 25.5%, lower than the national rate of 29.7%.
Over the last five years, the survival rate in Kentucky improved by 32%.
In Kentucky, 27.3% of cases are caught at an early stage, lower than the national rate of 28.1%.
Over the last five years, the early diagnosis rate in Kentucky improved by 12%.
Over the last five years, the percent of cases receiving no treatment in Kentucky increased by 36%.
In Kentucky, 36.9% of radon tests results were at or above the action level recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

Radon testing — either professional or through a do-it-yourself kit — shows radon levels in the home, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People should test their home if it’s never been tested, before buying or selling and before and after renovations, according to the CDC. 
Looking to 2026 
During the 2026 legislative session — during which lawmakers will pass a two-year state budget — Baker said the Lung Association will ask for an additional $2 million for the Tobacco Prevention and Cessation program, which works to end youth smoking, among other work. If granted, the money would double the program’s budget. 
The Lung Association will also continue pushing for JUUL settlement dollars to be moved from the state’s general fund into the Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Program. Juul, an e-cigarette company, has to pay Kentucky more than $14 million dollars following a lawsuit over marketing practices aimed at youth. JUUL’s next payment to Kentucky is around $2 million and due in December 2025. 
Advocates pushed for this in 2024, but “this is a budget session,” Baker said, “and so it’s more appropriately timed this year.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)After receiving a record number of applications, the University of Rhode Island exceeded its enrollment target for the incoming freshman class this fall.
The academic caliber of students on the Kingston campus is also on the rise with new students having arrived with strong grade point averages coming out of high school and some college credits already earned, Dean Libutti, the school’s associate vice president for enrollment management and student success said.
A total of 28,036 first-year applications were received in 2025, Libutti told the university’s Board of Trustees during a presentation Friday.
Ultimately, 3,431 of those students enrolled — a number above both the school’s original and revised goals for the size of its incoming freshman class, Libutti said. Last year, URI received 26,800  applications.
“That happens at a time when we are seeing declining high school demographics, so [it’s] really exciting to see,” Libutti said. “Our superpower is that our recruitment is actually a team sport by all divisions and people on campus.”
Overall, URI had 17,471 students this fall semester, made up of 15,045 undergrads and 2,426 grad students. 
But a lack of housing on campus may cap further growth, Libutti warned. “We are at capacity at the undergraduate traditional level,” Libutti said.
The university announced Thursday that it had finalized a partnership with construction firm Gilbane to begin building three new residence halls which will increase the number of on-campus beds by more than 2,000. Construction is set to begin later in November, and the first residence hall could open in fall 2027.
In the meantime, however, graduate students living in the Graduate Village Apartments will need to be relocated, as the building is being torn down before its eventual replacement can be built, the Good Five Cent Cigar reported recently.
“Housing is so critical, as we obviously are planning for when we grow capacity, but we have to grow it in a responsible way,” said the board’s Chair Margo Cook during Friday’s meeting.

Ahead of the fall semester’s conclusion next month, Libutti gave his routine update on how the school’s admissions department is doing. URI had upped its undergraduate admissions target from 3,275 to 3,385 because of two factors — all in all, “a terrific year recruiting new undergraduate students,” Libutti said.
First, Libutti said, the university did not have to contend with the disastrous rollout of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) like it did in 2024. The standardized, federal financial form was plagued with technical errors in 2024, and wrought chaos in admissions departments nationwide as schools and families alike depend on concrete financial aid offers to make enrollment decisions.
The second reason URI could exceed its initial hopes was because this year’s pool of applicants was particularly strong, Libutti said. He noted that the average GPA of the incoming freshman — which URI recalculates to account for differences among high schools — was 3.69 this year.
“When I started presenting this many years ago, that was actually a 3.08,” Libutti said. “Over one in two of our students starting this fall are bringing in earned college credit from high school. It shows their quality. It shows their commitment.” 
Over 12% of students are graduating in less than four years, Libutti said, and 52% of students arrived on campus with existing college credit this year. The trend has been seen in other states like Connecticut and Georgia. 
The school managed to reduce “summer melt” this year, a trend where students decide not to attend a school in the fall after initially signing on. 
“Years ago, people would say they were coming to URI, but the number who would then no longer come used to be 12 and 13%,” Libutti said. “Our summer melt, thanks to a great team effort with academic affairs, student affairs and so many, was actually sitting just under 8%.” 
Traditional applicant pool shrinking in Northeast
URI’s gains come amid an ongoing dearth of local high school graduates, Libutti said. 
According to a 2024 report from the state’s Office of the Postsecondary Commissioner, Rhode Island is expected to see a 12% drop in public high school graduates between academic years 2018–19 and 2031–32. That statistic is matched by an 18.9% increase since 2017 in residents aged 60 to 74, and the report notes that the “population appears to be shifting toward older adults.”
Birth rates have also fallen in Rhode Island in recent decades, by about 18% between 2002 and 2022, according to the 2024 Rhode Island KIDS COUNT Factbook.
Another 2024 projection from the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education predicts an average 17% decline in high school graduates for northeastern states, including New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire. “Only New Jersey will remain largely unaffected,” the report reads.
“We have just under 10,000 high school graduates,” Libutti said, citing the average number of Rhode Islanders who graduate high school in recent years. “Not all go on to college. We also know New England is a challenge based on the number of high school graduates and demographics.” 
URI continues to attract more out-of-staters than Rhode Islanders, a trend that reliably held and rose across the 2010s. In 2009, only 38% of undergrad students were from out of state. While the balance seemed to tip ever so slightly this year, with Rhode Islanders comprising 50.1% of the entire student body, Libutti said over 60% of first-year students come from out-of-state. Midyear transfer students, mostly coming from within Rhode Island, skew the numbers in the opposite direction.   
This year, Libutti’s presentation noted growth above 20% in applications from students in Maryland, Georgia, Tennessee, Illinois, Ohio, Colorado and Washington, D.C. 
Still, the Ocean State’s flagship university is missing a few states from its nationwide portfolio of applicants. Last year, Libutti told the trustees that applications came from students from 47 states. Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota were the only states missing from the pool. 
This year, Libutti told the trustees he’s still in search of a complete set. “I have to keep saying my joke, because someone has to help me with it: Anyone here with North or South Dakota connections, please see me afterwards. I’d love to hit the 50 next year,” he said.

Phil Murphy's plan to keep technical parole violators out of prison has yet to advance, but he remains hopeful it can become law.","Gov. Phil Murphy, talking with his successor, Mikie Sherrill, in the Statehouse on Nov. 5, 2025, has just eight weeks to see some of his unfinished policy priorities through before the current legislative session ends in January. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Almost a year ago, Gov. Phil Murphy announced a plan to stop reincarcerating thousands of people for violating the conditions of their parole, a change meant to help them better reenter society and enable the state to close an entire prison.
But a bill was never introduced and the proposal lost momentum, with critics predicting it would endanger public safety and legislators loath to push any controversial measures forward when all 80 Assembly seats were on the ballot.
As his second term winds down, Murphy, a Democrat, says the proposal to avoid reincarcerating technical parole violators remains a priority for him. These are parolees who miss curfew, fail a drug test, move without permission, or otherwise defy their parole conditions.
“That’s something that we’ve wanted to do,” he said. “We want to get it right.”
There are only about 10 weeks left in the current legislative session, though, a tight timeline for turning the proposal into law.
Assemblywoman Shanique Speight (D-Essex), the plan’s biggest legislative champion, declined to comment. Shadaya Bennett, her chief of staff, told the New Jersey Monitor that Speight will introduce legislation within the coming weeks and is working to tweak the text to satisfy critics’ concerns.
About 10% of people in New Jersey’s prisons on any given day are there for technical parole violations, costing the state about $90 million a year.
When Murphy pitched his plan during his annual address to the Legislature in January, he framed it as both a budget issue and a matter of mercy.
Keeping technical parole violators in the community would allow the state to close East Jersey State Prison, he said, with budget documents projecting $30 million in savings this fiscal year and annualized savings totaling $50 million by fiscal year 2027. Returning technical parole violators to prison, Murphy added, does nothing to address the root causes that can land these parolees back behind bars, like addiction, unemployment, poverty, and housing insecurity.
The plan met fierce pushback. Sen. Douglas Steinhardt (R-Warren) grilled parole officials about it during budget hearings in the spring.
Steinhardt told the New Jersey Monitor he fears the plan “rewards repeat offenders” by minimizing the transgressions that result in parole revocation.

“The statutory standard for parole is persistent and serious violations. You can’t revoke a person’s parole unless the violations have been persistent and serious,” Steinhardt said. “By the time somebody’s violated, they’ve been given countless chances to comply along the way.”
New Jersey’s parole revocation rate of about 7% in recent years already falls below the national average of 11%, Steinhardt added. He accused Murphy of being motivated more by money than compassion, pointing to the prison closure savings.
“This isn’t about public safety. This isn’t about prison reform. It’s not about prisoners’ rights. This is a bill about bad government, bad fiscal policy, and at the end of the day, greed,” Steinhardt said. “They take an easy term to hang their hat on — ‘technical violations’ — and tell people that people are being violated for missing appointments or not reporting addresses. But that’s absolutely untrue.”
Steinhardt said he has met with Murphy and his staff to hash out their differences and would support the bill if it resolves his concerns.
“The system can always use tweaks. Society evolves. The criminal justice system evolves,” Steinhardt said. “It’s going to come down to what the text of the bill says, and hopefully the governor’s office really rolled up their sleeves and worked a little harder at coming up with something that is designed to serve its stated purpose, which is to help people on reentry.”
The plan’s supporters said they will continue to advocate for it, in hopes that it will pass before a new legislative session begins in January.
“There is a process for reincarcerating people who commit new crimes if they are truly a public safety threat,” said Amol Sinha, who heads the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. “But simply violating a condition of parole, which may be as simple as missing a day of work or missing a meeting with a probation or parole officer — those are things that are not a threat to public safety, and so people shouldn’t be punished as if they committed new crimes.”
New Jersey Public Defender Jennifer Sellitti said any legislators still leery of acting should consider Democrats’ sweeping successes in Tuesday’s general election, when the party won the governor’s mansion and flipped a handful of Assembly seats now held by Republicans. The outcome was a “resounding mandate for common-sense policy,” Sellitti said.
 “When we reincarcerate someone, we’re spending $75,000 a year to house them, to then send them back out into a community with the same problems that they had when they went in. If we can fix those problems while someone is in community with their family, with the guidance of parole officers who want to help people succeed, that’s how we make community safer,” she said.
It’s unclear if Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D) would champion the cause if legislation doesn’t pass before the current session ends in mid-January. Her spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Goochland County, home to just over 28,000 residents and more than two hours south of Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley,” is the latest locality to face intense community pushback over plans to lure data center development to the area.
“Not planning to grow, planning to preserve,” Board of Supervisors member Neil Spoonhower told a packed Thursday hearing of frustrated residents while defending his support for creating a technology overlay district (TOD).
The TOD stretches from Interstate 64 about five miles down Route 288 to Patterson Ave. It’s designed to attract data centers and other energy-intensive projects by offering incentives that country leaders say will bring new  tax revenue and jobs. 
Most of the area is already zoned industrial, though some agricultural parcels would require additional permitting. Companies using the incentives would be subject to limits on building size, noise ordinances and setbacks from nearby homes.
After a six hour meeting, the board voted 4-1 to approve the district. More than 80 residents from Goochland and surrounding counties spoke in opposition. With data center development expanding beyond Northern Virginia, nearby localities such as Hanover and Henrico are also balancing community concerns with the economic upside. Goochland officials noted the county has spent years recovering from past financial instability. 
“Our county’s financial portfolio needs to be more balanced in order to meet the needs of our community,” said board chair Tim Winfree. 
Many Virginia localities already have similar overlay zones to guide where tech and manufacturing facilities can be located. Supervisor Jonathan Lyle argued Goochland is late to the game.
“If you want economic development, and technology is where development is happening, what can we do to be more prominent and visible for technology companies? So a technology overlay district was seen as a tool, not the tool, but a tool, that would help us attract more industry,” Lyle said.
Several changes were made to the original proposal, and Lyle unsuccessfully pushed for a one-year delay to address community concerns and study potential impacts. His motion failed to receive a second.
Ahead of the vote, community members held their own rally to learn more about data centers and their effects on nearby neighborhoods. The Sierra Club gave a presentation on noise, diesel generator use, and other environmental issues that left many in the audience grumbling and upset.
“They haven’t done any testing, they have absolutely no knowledge… of the results of putting something like that so close to us and so they’re not educated enough to make these kinds of decisions, and it’s really going to be detrimental to all of us. We’re all pretty much retired citizens,” said Karen Fortuna, who lives in a neighborhood bordering the new district. 
Under the final rules, data centers outside the western portion of the TOD would not need additional votes and public hearings. However, energy production facilities — such as gas peaker plants or small modular reactors — would now acquire conditional use permits with full board approval. 
Some residents said they felt blindsided by the proposal. Goochland resident Steve Fram said he heard about it over dinner with a neighbor. Others who recently moved to the county and now find themselves near the district fear they may have to relocate. Fortuna said she isn’t opposed to economic development, but believes the county should protect neighborhoods.
“If they want to do data centers, it’s not that we’re opposed to it, but it needs to be miles away rather than feet,” she said.
Goochland’s fight reflects a growing statewide backlash as data centers move beyond their traditional Northern Virginia cluster. In Louisa County, residents recently halted an Amazon data center proposal. The debate is increasingly tied to a broader question facing Virginia: how to meet soaring energy demand from the data centers – and who bears the cost.

Their concerns come as the State Board of Education prepares to continue its discussions on the proposed accountability changes, a debate that has been underway since the summer.
According to the Virginia Social Studies Leaders Consortium, or VSSLC, about 63 of the state’s 132 school divisions already use locally awarded verified credit through alternative assessments. The consortium is worried revisions could upend that process, which currently includes a portfolio of student work and inquiry-based state tasks.
“What our organization was hoping for was local flexibility,” said Danyael Graham, VSSLC president.
Under the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, or ESEA, any state — including Virginia —must update its Consolidated State Plan and secure approval from the U.S. Department of Education. That process is significantly faster than going through the Virginia Administrative Process Act, which can take months or years.
ESSA only requires ​​states to assess students in reading, math and science. Adding history and social science to the state accountability model is optional, not federally mandated.
The proposed changes stem from Virginia’s recent overhaul of its accountability system and are intended to allow the state to submit data from the first year of that redesign. They also incorporate feedback from stakeholders, including community members and educators such as Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henricod, who urged the board in a June 2 letter to add U.S. History or Civics in the state accountability system.
VanValkenburg signed the letter alongside representatives from the American Historical Association, National Council for the Social Studies, Virginia Social Science Association, Virginia Council for the Social Studies, iCivics, the CivXNow Coalition and Virginia Civics. The letter argued that although Virginia is “stronger than many other states in emphasizing social studies education,” the subject still has been “de-prioritized” in recent years.
The groups asked the board to join other states in adding social studies as “a measure of school quality and incorporating it into Virginia’s accountability structure.” 
They added that such move is critical “not just for the sake of social studies knowledge and skills, but because when students have deeper content knowledge and vocabulary, it bolsters their reading proficiency, their ability to make sense of the world around them, and their confidence in navigating our public democratic institutions.”
The VSSLC declined to sign the letter, citing a lack of guarantees that inquiry-based assessments remain in place. Members also said the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) didn’t consult them before last month’s board discussions.
VanValkenburg said he made the request because he believes “one of the most important parts of public education is to foster civic knowledge and civic understanding so that people can be good citizens.”
Last August, the board approved a split accreditation model — one system to determine whether schools meet legal and regulatory requirements, and another to provide “timely and transparent information on student and school performance.”
The regulations are tied to the board’s stated goals of high expectations and learning recovery following pandemic-era losses. 
 Conflict claims

Social studies leaders argue the proposed revisions create several conflicts including one tied to whether teachers can develop their own instructional resources. They also claim the proposal clashes with legislation that supports “permissive local alternative assessment” — the backbone of the locally awarded verified credit option — instead of Standards of Learning (SOL) multiple choice exams in non-federally mandated subjects. 
That language was included in House Bill 1957, sponsored by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, earlier this year to strengthen how statewide tests are administered and evaluated. VanValkenburg sponsored a similar bill that failed last session.
VanValkenburg said the legislation was intended to place “guardrails” on local assessments to ensure they are “done well” and “meet a certain quality,”noting that some are rigorous while others fall short.
Virginia overhauls SOL testing to boost student achievement

Graham said educators “were excited to move” toward local assessments in social studies because they shifted testing from “quiz bowl style testing” to “document-based questions and inquiry, where students are answering questions using sources.”
Beau Dickenson, a consortium board member recently named the 2025 National Social Studies Leader of the Year by the National Social Studies Leaders Association, said the move toward locally designed assessments was meant to replace older methods focused on rote memorization.
“It’s really innovative, it’s the future of the discipline and I would say it’s more rigorous than discrete facts and can bubble in a scantron sheet,” Dickenson said.
He added that educators aren’t rejecting accountability — they are asking the board to find consistency and balance across the commonwealth, because reverting to content-heavy tests would mean “taking several steps backwards.”
Consortium members also say the revisions contradict prior VDOE assurances that teachers could develop their own instructional and resources.
“It doesn’t seem that this (plan) provides that, (and) it was also something that was promised to us in our standards,” Graham said.
Social studies leaders say they are unsure whether locally developed assessments will count toward accountability and whether changes would be implemented mid-school year or in 2026-2027.
A VDOE presentation published last month shows the board will review numerous elements of the Consolidated State Plan on Thursday, including how the state measures success, which courses qualify as “advanced,” and how struggling schools receive support.
A final review is scheduled for Dec. 11 before the plan is submitted to the U.S. Department of Education.
Kenita Williams, a VDOE spokeswoman, said no final decisions have been made about history and social science because the agency is still gathering stakeholder input.
“We look forward to continued collaboration with our educators and families to prepare students to be civically engaged citizens and ready for success in college, career, and military pathways,” Williams said. “Their input is essential as we work to increase expectations and continue aligning with research-based practices.”

(Photo by Karolina Wojtasik/HBO)We’ve all heard the word “resilient” tossed around when talking about strong economies. But in Rhode Island, it’s not just a buzzword, it’s a reality. Our tourism economy has bounced back from the COVID pandemic with impressive strength, and that’s great news for local businesses, workers and taxpayers.
A new economic impact study by Tourism Economics reveals that a record 29.4 million visitors came to the Ocean State in 2024, a 3.5% increase over the previous year. These visitors spent a whopping $6 billion, generating a total economic impact of $8.8 billion and supporting 88,509 jobs. That’s not just resilience. It’s Rhode Island showing off.
This kind of economic activity ripples through every corner of our state. It supports restaurants, hotels, B&Bs, boutiques, hair salons, retail shops, tour operators and kayak rentals down by the cove. It’s a rising tide that truly lifts all boats.
And let’s not forget the hotel and meal taxes paid by these visitors. They help fund state and local budgets, giving Rhode Island taxpayers a bit of breathing room. That’s a win-win if ever there was one.
Despite challenges — like the loss of Canadian group tours to Newport this year — the tourism sector continues to thrive. At The Preservation Society of Newport County, we’ve seen this firsthand. In 2024, the Newport Mansions welcomed 871,683 visitors, up from 797,750 in 2023. And the first nine months of 2025? Even stronger than the same period in the previous two years.
Our niche, heritage tourism, is booming across the state. Travelers today aren’t just looking for beaches, stuffies and lobster rolls (though we have plenty of them). They want to connect with history, culture and stories that endure. A 2018  economic impact report put the value of heritage tourism in Rhode Island at nearly $1.4 billion. That’s proof: Preservation is good business, and good for Rhode Island.
Preservation, it turns out, isn’t just about saving old buildings. It’s about investing in our economy, our identity and our future. Add in Rhode Island’s compact size, natural beauty, endless charm and countless recreational opportunities on and off the water, and you’ve got a destination that’s hard to beat.
But let’s not get too comfortable. The success of our tourism industry didn’t happen overnight. The Preservation Society was founded 80 years ago by a visionary group of women and men who saw the potential of heritage tourism and rolled up their sleeves to make it happen. It took decades of collaboration across the state to build tourism into the powerhouse it is today. And it will take continued effort to keep it thriving.










In 2024, the Newport Mansions welcomed 871,683 visitors, up from 797,750 in 2023. And the first nine months of 2025? Even stronger than the same period in the previous two years.


Recent policies like the film and television tax credits have helped showcase our state’s beauty to the world. Just look at HBO’s “The Gilded Age.” When fans discover that some of their favorite scenes were filmed at the Newport Mansions, they pack their bags and head our way. Strengthening these credits is one way the General Assembly has supported this vital sector and will, we believe, continue to do so.
Another thing we can do is reform the Historic Tax Credit program, as advocated by Preserve Rhode Island, Grow Smart Rhode Island and the Preservation Society. This program doesn’t just preserve buildings, it creates housing. In fact, about 20% of all new housing in Rhode Island comes through this program, including 20% of affordable housing. That’s preservation with purpose.
It’s also time to ask voters to approve a new historic preservation bond to fund grants through the Rhode Island Historical Preservation & Heritage Commission. The last bond, in 2021, supported 18 projects in 12 towns and cities, including several at the Preservation Society.
Of course, tourism brings challenges. No place feels that more acutely than Newport, where traffic congestion, strained infrastructure and the soaring cost of housing are daily realities. But these aren’t unsolvable problems, they are calls to action.
We need smart investment in public transit and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure to ease congestion and reduce environmental impact. We need housing policies that prioritize affordability for the workers who make our tourism economy thrive. And we need state and local governments to reinvest a larger portion of tourism-generated revenue directly into the communities that host these millions of visitors.
Let’s treat tourism not just as an economic engine, but as an investment in our future by preserving our past. Because resilience isn’t just about bouncing back, it’s about building forward, together.

(Photo by Gerville/Getty Images)The data center boom has catapulted Virginia into a serious energy crunch. We have more data centers here than in any other state, by far, and four times as many more are expected in the next few years. Virginia utilities don’t generate enough electricity to serve them all; fully half of our power is imported from the regional grid. But now the regional grid is also running low on reserve power thanks to all the data center growth, according to grid operator PJM. 
Most proposed solutions focus on the supply side: generating more power by building new solar, wind, gas and battery storage; keeping aging power plants running that were previously scheduled for closure; and even reopening Three Mile Island, shuttered three and a half decades ago following the worst nuclear accident in US history. 
More nuanced solutions involve managing the existing generation better. Research shows that the grid could handle more data centers right now if operators ratcheted back consumption at peak times, either through installing batteries or through shifting some operations to non-peak times.
All of these approaches involve generating more power for the grid, or shifting use around to relieve grid stress at peak demand times. But there is another way to make room for new data centers: remove some existing loads. 
A national advocacy organization, Rewiring America, recently released an intriguing proposal to free up grid capacity by retrofitting homes with high-efficiency heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, solar panels and energy storage. The cumulative effect would be to reduce total demand in the residential sector, making capacity available to data centers sooner, while also saving the participating residential consumers thousands of dollars on their electricity bills.  
Oh, and the tech companies are going to pay for it. 
I am reminded of a delightful sign I once saw announcing the coming of the best dog park ever, to be paid for by cats, itself a satire of a certain president’s pledge to build a border wall paid for by Mexico. But, I notice, neither the cats nor Mexico have sent checks yet. Will Big Tech?
Rewiring America thinks so, if the policies are in place to aggregate and verify the household energy savings into a marketable package, and if buying the package means a data center can come online faster and more cheaply. Upgraded appliances and rooftop solar can be installed in a matter of weeks, compared to the many years that may be required to permit and build new generation and transmission. 
Note that the proposed program would not include households that replace gas, propane or oil furnaces with heat pumps. That kind of upgrade results in greater, not less, residential electricity demand, making it counterproductive when the point is to shrink residential electricity usage. 
Replacing electric furnaces with heat pumps would also mainly address the grid’s winter peak, not its summer peak, though the Department of Energy maintains that heat pumps use less energy for cooling than stand-alone air conditioners.
Researchers focused on replacing electric resistance heat with heat pumps because that one swap produces the biggest efficiency bang for the buck. An electric furnace is cheap to install but expensive to use; the reverse is true of a high-efficiency heat pump. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimates that the conversion would save the average family $1,170 per year on its electricity bill. NREL calculates that heat pumps are cost-effective enough to pay for themselves in under 5 years.
According to Rewiring America, “If hyperscalers paid for 50 percent of the upfront cost of installing heat pumps in homes with electric resistance heating, they could get capacity on the grid at a price of about $344/kW-year — a similar cost to building and operating a new gas power plant, which currently costs about $315/kW-year.” (By my math, it’s an extra 10%, which might be acceptable to a power-hungry tech customer as a sort of rush fee.)
The report repeats the calculations for other technologies. Ductless heat pumps would replace baseboard electric heat. Heat pump water heaters would replace conventional electric water heaters. Solar panels paired with battery storage could displace electricity the home would otherwise draw from the grid.
Further capacity could come from home batteries. The report posits, “If every single-family household in the U.S. installed a home battery, and those with a suitable roof installed a 5 kW solar system (about 11 solar panels), they could collectively generate 109 GW of increased capacity on the grid. We assume that households charge the battery off-peak, either from the grid or from rooftop solar, and they discharge the battery during peak periods to reduce the household’s contribution to peak demand.” 
The researchers estimate that a mass purchasing program could squeeze costs of solar and storage down by 40%, primarily through reduced customer acquisition costs and cheaper permitting. Then the data center operators would pay 30% of this lower cost. By buying solar and storage at this now much-reduced price, households would get electricity at about a 30% discount off utility rates, while the tech companies would be able to buy capacity at a cost comparable to that of building a new gas plant. 
You’ll notice the proposal assumes tech companies pay only a portion of the costs for the residential upgrades, so residents still face upfront costs – 50% of the cost of heat pumps, 70% of a hopefully-lowered price for solar and batteries. Rewiring America calculates that residents will come out ahead under all scenarios, while the data centers will pay only a little more than they would otherwise have to pay, buying capacity they might not otherwise be able to get. 
Because Virginia has so many more data centers than anywhere else on earth, Rewiring America calculates that all of these investments would meet only 25% of our projected new data center demand. Other states could do much better, fully meeting projected new demand across most of the country and even exceeding it in about half the states. Virginia would presumably stand to benefit from surplus capacity in other PJM states. 
Obviously, these calculations describe a best-case scenario, and I have my doubts about whether the uptake would be anywhere near what they believe is possible. Still, even capturing just a portion of the efficiency potential Rewiring America believes is there would relieve some of the pressure on the grid. 
But is there really that much low-hanging efficiency fruit in Virginia? If the NREL data that the researchers use is correct, more than 300,000 single family homes in Virginia have electric furnaces. Yet electric furnaces are notoriously inefficient and expensive to operate, and heat pumps have been around for decades. Our utilities have been running energy efficiency programs for years that are supposed to help residents save energy. Can there really be that many single-family homes that have not converted to heat pumps yet?
I consulted Andrew Grigsby, a home energy efficiency expert who is currently the energy services director at Viridiant, a nonprofit focused on sustainable buildings. Grigsby shared my doubts about the accuracy of NREL’s estimate of the number of homes with electric resistance heat, saying it was at odds with his experience. He also felt that an efficiency program would save more energy at less cost by targeting improvements to the needs of each home, instead of supplying a blanket solution.
But he also refuted my assumption that most of the low-hanging fruit should have been picked by now. “Virginia has 100,000 homes (at least) where three hours work and $50 in materials would reduce heating/cooling costs by 25%  — via fixing the obvious, massive duct leakage,” he said in an email.
This doesn’t mean Rewiring America’s approach wouldn’t save energy; rather, it supports the conclusion that there is a massive opportunity for energy efficiency savings that Virginia hasn’t fully tapped into. 
Legislators have tried. The VCEA set efficiency targets for Dominion and APCo, and the SCC followed up with further targets. APCo has consistently met its goals, Dominion has not. A review of Dominion’s sad little list of programs available to homeowners suggests that the problem is a lack of ambition, not a lack of opportunity.
An aggressive, third-party operated efficiency program would complement the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) pilot program that Dominion is developing in accordance with legislation passed in the 2025 session. The VPP’s goal is to shift some consumption to off-peak times, while the Rewiring America proposal would reduce overall consumption. 
Both seek to achieve time-shifting through incentivizing residents to invest in home batteries, their only area of overlap. But whereas the VPP legislation set only 15 MW as its baseline target for home batteries, the Rewiring America proposal could incentivize much more, along with the solar systems to charge them.
The problem remains how to get tech companies to pay for it. My contact at Rewiring America, senior director of communications Alex Amend, pointed me to approaches being undertaken in other states. Minnesota legislation requires data centers to contribute between $2 million and $5 million annually toward energy conservation programs that benefit low-income households. Georgia Power is expected to file a large load tariff that, says Amend, includes pathways for off-site, behind-the-meter solutions.
Here in Virginia, though, both APCo and Dominion, as well as some co-ops, have already submitted large-load tariff proposals to the SCC as part of their rate cases. None of the proposals include incentives for demand reductions anywhere, much less the residential sector. Indeed, given Dominion’s track record on efficiency, the SCC would have to take the initiative to meld a large load tariff for data centers with the VPP program and aggressive home efficiency investments. 
The SCC has announced plans to hold a technical conference on Dec. 12 to examine data center load flexibility. Rewiring America hopes to participate to lay out its proposal in more detail. 
Then maybe we’ll see if the cats will pay for the dog park.

(Photo: Mark Harmon for Tennessee Lookout)Readers may have heard of William T. “Bill” Snyder. He served as Chancellor of the Knoxville campus of the University of Tennessee from 1992 to 1999. In fact, he was chancellor when I was hired there, but became a friend because he lived in my neighborhood, and even served as treasurer for my successful 2006 campaign to become a Knox County commissioner.
I am, however, but a bit player in this story of a great man whose life influenced many Tennesseans through education and music, and whose life story may have some lessons worth highlighting. I recently attended a celebration of Snyder’s life, following his death at age 93 on Sept. 23, held at the Tennessee Theater, a beautifully restored performance hall in downtown Knoxville.
Bill Snyder was a Knoxville native and 1954 UT engineering graduate. Returning to UT, he steadily rose from engineering professor to department head to college dean and eventually to chancellor, where he became known as “the students’ chancellor,” for his willingness to talk to students at all hours. He and wife, Margaret (he called her Margi), raised three daughters and later delighted in the arrival of seven grandchildren. Snyder had a quick and impish smile, loved dogs and the occasional stiff drink and cigar, and during one unusual period could be seen tooling about our neighborhood on a Segway. His intellectual curiosity and humility mixed with a strong sense of kindness.

Snyder didn’t so much retire when he left UT as shift his attention to another great love of his life, the Tennessee Theater, where he had been the volunteer organist since 1979. One could see the intense look on Snyder’s face as the 1928 Mighty Wurlitzer returned from major repairs in 2001-2002. A restoration of the entire theatre in the mid-2000s led to a grand reopening in January 2005, and Snyder’s devotion to the Tennessee Theatre and that organ was total. 
He gave tours, raised money and established free mid-day concerts on Mondays. R. Jelani Eddington, an acclaimed theater organ performer who played at Snyder’s memorial, declared, “As long as this Wurlitzer plays here, there’s a way that a piece of Bill plays here.”
When it came time for a Rocky Horror Picture Show warm up, Bill Snyder and the organ rose from the orchestra pit with Bill as his drag persona, Wilhelmina, complete with fishnet stockings. Listening to Eddington play a Gershwin medley, “Over the Rainbow,” and other songs at Snyder’s memorial, made me remember all the joy that Bill Snyder exuded, never more so than when he was at those pedals, buttons and keys.
When  campaign finance reports were due, Snyder and I had a routine. We’d meet in the theatre office, have lunch somewhere, go over the numbers and sign the documents —usually with a waiter or waitress serving as the required signature witness. The more important part of the lunch, however, was to swap stories of everything from national politics, to my incredible adventure in local politics, to the latest changes at  UT. I’m sure many a patron would wonder what we both were chuckling about. 
He and Margi had been married 69 years when Snyder died surrounded by love and family and listening to music. Snyder himself planned the celebration of life. It had opening and closing remarks from his pastor, including a note from Snyder in which he consoled us, “I had a good and meaningful life.”  Snyder’s successor on the organ, Freddie Brabson, played “Tennessee Waltz” as the service ended. It was during Eddington’s performance, however, that I looked around to see the hundreds of people bathed in the red, green, blue, and purple colors in the otherwise darkened hall, colors that seemed to dance as the sounds ricocheted off the rafters and corners of the theater. What a perfect way to be remembered, and for a community to say thank you.
We can be fooled into looking for greatness only in distant places and power centers. I found greatness just blocks away in my own neighborhood in the form of a good man who consistently lived a life of grace, dedication, intelligence, family and good humor. Perhaps there is someone in your neighborhood like that. If so, tell that person, smile, and share a funny story.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)When Missouri Republican lawmakers approved a new district map in September to help their party in Congress, progressive activist Richard von Glahn was ready. Hours after the state legislature passed the gerrymandered map, von Glahn had submitted a proposed ballot petition to put it to the voters.
It would be more than a month before the Republican-controlled secretary of state’s office approved the petition, squeezing the number of days in which Glahn’s group, People Not Politicians, has to gather signatures.
Missouri Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins argued the group couldn’t begin collecting signatures until the governor signed the map into law, two weeks after its legislative passage.
People Not Politicians is now suing Hoskins over the fate of some 90,000 signatures collected after lawmakers approved the map on Sept. 12 and before the secretary of state approved the petition on Oct. 14. The group faces a mid-December deadline to gather roughly 106,000 signatures.
A year out from the 2026 midterm elections, such legal fights and procedural maneuvering over ballot measures and referendums are already well underway in states across the country. The disputes will go a long way in determining not only what ballot measures and referendums are put before voters, but also how those questions are summarized on ballots and other official documents.
Some ballot measure campaigns argue that partisan state officials, such as secretaries of state and attorneys general, have put their thumb on the scale with misleading or inflammatory official summaries and have used arcane procedures to slow them down. More and more, campaigners say, their planning anticipates extensive litigation.
Legal challenges have also been launched against new state laws regulating citizen-led ballot measures. Critics of the regulations argue that in many cases they’re effectively restrictions, while proponents claim the rules are necessary for election integrity and to combat abuses of the ballot measure process.


Between 2018 and 2024, more than 200 lawsuits involving ballot measures were filed in state and federal courts


“Missourians have had this constitutional right for 150 years, and if the [secretary of state’s] logic holds Missourians of today and tomorrow will not have the same rights as their parents did to petition their neighbors for redress of government overreach,” von Glahn, speaking about the referendum process, told Stateline in a statement.
While many states have allowed voters to place issues on the ballot for decades, those elections have attracted significant attention in the past few years as states vote on abortion rights and other divisive issues. Between 2018 and 2024, more than 200 lawsuits involving ballot measures were filed in state and federal courts, according to data gathered by the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.
Even in states without a citizen-led process, state legislatures have often referred controversial measures to voters. Mid-decade congressional redistricting is emerging as the latest flash point, with California voters last week approving a ballot measure referred by state lawmakers that allows a Democratic gerrymander of the state to take effect.
Twenty-four states — including every Western state except New Mexico and Hawaii — have a citizen-led ballot measure process, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, with 17 fairly described as Republican-leaning or swing states. Several are currently the site of pitched legal and political battles over the ballot measure process.
In Montana, the state attorney general has rewritten summaries — the language voters see on ballot measures — for proposals aimed at ensuring nonpartisan courts, prompting a lawsuit that’s pending before the state Supreme Court. Arkansas civic and campaign groups have sued to block a series of new ballot measure rules, including a requirement that canvassers ask potential petition signers for a photo ID.
Florida lawmakers passed a bill requiring ballot measure campaigns to turn in petition signatures more quickly. Oklahoma lawmakers imposed new geographic distribution requirements for signature collections. And in Utah, lawmakers voted to require campaigns to provide detailed information on how a proposal would be funded and whether it would require a new tax.
Democrats and other progressives expect upcoming state legislative sessions, many of which begin in January, to bring more measures aimed at the ballot measure process.
“Missouri is a good indicator of what we’re going to face in 2026,” said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, which aids progressive ballot measure efforts across the country.
“And this has been true for the last several years,” she said. “One of the major tactics that those who are opposed to direct democracy — they go after the signature-gathering process to invalidate legitimate signatures, to prevent issues that voters want from getting onto the ballot.”
How do officials view their role?
Many Republicans defend their approach to ballot measures as necessary to ensure fairness in the process and prevent fraudulent signature collection. Some also voice concerns that state constitutions have become too easy to amend, as Democrats and progressives turn to ballot measures to enact policies such as minimum wage increases and abortion access that are often blocked in GOP-controlled statehouses.
Missouri’s secretary of state, Hoskins, has cast his approach to the People Not Politicians referendum petition as defending the state constitution from out-of-state actors.
While People Not Politicians is suing the secretary of state in Missouri court, Hoskins is suing the group in federal court. In a lawsuit brought jointly by Hoskins and Missouri Republican Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, Hoskins argues that under the U.S. Constitution, the power to draw congressional maps rests with the state legislature.
“Missouri’s Constitution belongs to Missourians, not to dark-money groups trying to rewrite it for their own gain,” Hoskins said in an October news release when the federal lawsuit was filed.
“It has become far too easy to mislead voters and undermine the sacred document that protects our way of life. Our job is to defend the rule of law, safeguard Missouri values, and make sure our Constitution cannot be bought or manipulated from the outside.”
One urban crossroad, 3 new districts: Kansas City braces for Missouri gerrymander

Chuck Hatfield, a Missouri attorney who has long worked on litigation related to ballot measures in the state, said secretaries of state have historically viewed their role as ministerial.
“You’re supposed to move paperwork from the left side of the desk to the right side of the desk,” he said.
“I don’t think this secretary of state sees his role that way,” said Hatfield, who is one of the lawyers representing People Not Politicians in its lawsuit against Hoskins. “I think he sees himself as more of an advocate.”
Hoskins’ more aggressive stance toward ballot measures echoes the posture of Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, a Republican who this year has rewritten the ballot language of proposals concerning state courts despite finding the measures met legal requirements.
Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges and Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts are both proposing similar measures to require nonpartisan judicial elections. Judicial elections have been nonpartisan in Montana since the 1930s, but the groups want to codify the practice in the state constitution.
Knudsen rewrote the ballot language of the measures to emphasize that nonpartisan elections also prohibit political party labels “including labels like independent.” The two groups say the phrase suggests independent candidates can’t run in judicial elections and have filed lawsuits challenging the rewrites.
Knudsen’s office didn’t respond to an interview request. But Amanda Braynack, Knudsen’s communications director, has previously called the lawsuits frivolous. “Liberal activists appear to be worried that Montanans will see the facts of what makes an election nonpartisan rather than their own opinion on the ballot,” Braynack told the Flathead Beacon in October.
Caitie Butler, a spokesperson for Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, said state law does give the attorney general leeway to rewrite ballot language if it’s clearly biased or argumentative, but she emphasized that the group believes its language was neither. She called ballot language rewrites a “growing challenge” in Montana over the past couple of election cycles.
Election Reformers Network, a nonpartisan group that advocates for the impartial administration of U.S. elections, in a January 2025 report said that in 85% of states with a citizen-led ballot measure process, a single party controlled the governorship and both chambers of the state legislature — with 13 Republican trifectas and nine Democratic trifectas in those states.
In recent years, voters in both Republican- and Democratic-leaning states had approved ballot measures with policies opposed by lawmakers, the report found. Examples included a 2020 Colorado vote that lowered tax rates, a 2024 California vote increasing certain criminal penalties, a 2020 Oklahoma vote to expand Medicaid, and a 2020 Florida vote to raise the minimum wage, among others.
The report highlighted the role of partisan state officials in the ballot measure process. In every state with citizen-led ballot measures, partisan officials play a role in reviewing and drafting ballot language. In nearly 60% of states, they also play a role in signature verification.
Some Republican states resist DOJ demand for private voter data

“There are definitely elements of our system that allow for partisan manipulation of elections in very different domains than in the polling station or around mail ballots, but instead in the domains that control options voters have,” Kevin Johnson, co-founder and executive director of Election Reformers Network, said in an interview.
Tighter rules
State legislatures can also exercise significant influence over the ballot measure process by setting rules that make qualifying proposals for the ballot either more or less difficult.
Arkansas lawmakers earlier this year approved a series of measures tightening requirements surrounding ballot measure proposals and gathering signatures. Under the new laws, canvassers must inform potential signers that petition fraud is a criminal offense and request photo ID from potential signers.
Potential signers must also now read a petition’s ballot title or have it read to them. And ballot titles must not be written above an eighth grade reading level.
“These bills are not restrictive. What these bills are is they provide safeguards or guardrails, and the reason you need guardrails is because there have been plenty of accidents along the way,” Arkansas state Sen. Kim Hammer, a Republican, said during floor debate in February.
Hammer, a candidate for Arkansas secretary of state and the lead sponsor of some of the bills, didn’t respond to a request for comment. He said on the Senate floor that he rejected the idea that the measures were taking away the rights of the people, but that they are intended to address increasing “outside interference” in the ballot measure process.
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas and several ballot measure campaign groups have sued in federal court to block the new laws. A judge held a hearing in late September but hasn’t yet ruled on whether to grant a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the requirements as the lawsuit plays out.
In Missouri, a state court trial in People Not Politicians’ lawsuit against Hoskins over its referendum petition signatures was abruptly postponed last week because the judge was ill. A new hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, though it’s not clear when the judge will rule.
People Not Politicians can almost certainly block the gerrymander for the 2026 election if the group collects enough valid signatures by a Dec. 11 deadline outlined in state law. A successful referendum petition will place the map before voters in November 2026, and Missouri would be prohibited from using the redrawn lines in the meantime.
On Nov. 5, People Not Politicians announced it had collected more than 200,000 signatures — or roughly double the minimum number it needs.

Part II will be published on Wednesday, Nov. 12, followed by Part III on Nov. 14.

A VIDEO RECORDED at a Dunbarton care home for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in February 2019 captured caretakers pinning Lucas Houle to the ground and slapping him repeatedly. Amid his pain and fear, Houle made a tearful plea: “I want to go home.”
Four months later, Christine Marie Bill was found dead after several hours in a hot, sealed car in Andover, according to the lawsuit filed in the wake of her death and a State Police incident report. Bill, due to her cognitive disabilities, had a history of leaving the house, and it was her caretaker’s job to check on her every 15 to 30 minutes.
In March 2023, a woman named Laurie Raymond, who has cerebral palsy and is nonverbal, was living at a residential facility in Lyme when she suffered second-degree burns to her abdomen, legs, and genital area. A registered nurse caring for Raymond placed her under scalding water and then scrubbed the burns, resulting in a $45,000 medical bill, according to a malpractice lawsuit filed by the family.

DO YOU HAVE information or experience with New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability system you’d like to share?
The Bulletin would like to speak with you. Please email wskipworth@newhampshirebulletin.com or send an encrypted message via Signal to WillSkipworth.80.

While every story of abuse and neglect within New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability care network is unique in the harm caused, collectively they point to the state’s systemic failures in oversight and accountability. Over the past several months, the Bulletin has learned about people like Houle, Bill, Raymond, and others through court filings, law enforcement documents, state records, and conversations with lawyers, advocates, and family members. Their stories are being reported for the first time here. Each individual tragedy is illustrative of the consequences of repeated breakdowns in care — care that is paid for and overseen by the state.
According to state records obtained by the Bulletin, New Hampshire investigated 1,405 complaints of abuse, neglect, and exploitation committed against people with intellectual and developmental disabilities receiving state services from January 2023 through the first six months of 2025. Of those, 467 were deemed credible after a state investigation, according to the records. Some of those complaints include physical and sexual abuse. Eighteen of the complaints were withdrawn before the investigations were complete, and 28 complaints were ongoing investigations when the records were produced.
Additionally, state records show 119 people died in New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability system from January 2023 through the first six months of 2025. Of those deaths, 79 were deemed “anticipated” by the state — state officials wouldn’t answer the Bulletin’s questions about how they defined anticipated — and at least 22 were categorized under “unknown” cause of death.

Holly Haines
Holly Haines, a Manchester attorney who represented the Bill family, said that case taught her a lot about New Hampshire’s disability care system.
“The state is hiring vendor private agencies,” she said. “The private agencies are hiring private people, and not training them or educating them adequately, and it’s ultimately the disabled individuals who are harmed.”
There is more “fingerpointing,” she said, than taking responsibility.
“I don’t think the state knows what’s actually going on in the households,” Haines said. “I’m not sure the vendor agencies even are aware.”
In a written statement issued in response to the Bulletin’s requests for an interview with Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Weaver, among other state officials, for this investigation, DHHS spokesman Jake Leon said that the department can’t comment on individual cases but “has a process in place to review and investigate complaints made against providers and vendors licensed or certified through the Department.”
The office of Gov. Kelly Ayotte shared a similar statement: “DHHS has a process in place to review and investigate complaints, and the Governor will be monitoring this issue closely.”
Daily beatings
When Lucas Houle, who has intellectual and developmental disabilities, was pinned to the ground and slapped by his caretakers, he screamed, “Please stop, please stop, don’t beat me up.”
Bikash Shrestha
The incident was captured in a video taken surreptitiously in February 2019 by an employee of Houle’s care agency and described in detail in a Dunbarton Police Department report obtained by the Bulletin. The video, according to the report, shows an obscured view of Houle’s live-in caretakers, Bikash Shrestha and Dilux Timsina, pinning Houle to the floor of their Dunbarton home while he cries. As the caretakers straddled Houle and repeatedly slapped him across the face, they advised each other on where and how to strike him in a way that wouldn’t leave bruising.
The video, as described in the police report by an officer, shows a caretaker bending Houle’s finger backward as punishment for brandishing his middle finger, ostensibly what sparked the incident. Houle cries out, “Please don’t break my finger” in response. 
Houle can be heard crying and screaming: “I won’t do it again, I won’t do it again”; “I’ll be good! I’ll be good! I promise!”; and “No, no, no, please stop.”
Dilux Timsina
At the end of the video, Shrestha tells Houle he isn’t allowed to use a toilet and that he must urinate in the living room. Timsina tells Houle he must remain on the ground. Pitambar Thapa, who recorded the video, told police the two made Houle lie in his own urine for half an hour after the video ends.
Pitambar Thapa told police the physical, verbal, and psychological abuse continued on a daily basis for at least 10 months. He told police he was initially afraid to report the abuse and provide the video to authorities out of fear of retribution.
Houle, in his 40s when the abuse happened, has the mental capacity of a child. He’s been diagnosed with intellectual disability, ADHD, mood disorder, schizophrenia, intermittent explosive disorder, and other disabilities. He has behavioral issues as a result.
He was living in and receiving care at a home operated by the care agency Summit New Hampshire at the time of the abuse. In New Hampshire, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are entitled to receive services through the Department of Health and Human Services’ Bureau of Developmental Services, which has contracts with 10 private area agencies, each responsible for a region of the state, to coordinate care. Those area agencies sometimes subcontract with other vendor agencies to provide that care. In Houle’s case, the area agency Community Bridges hired Summit to provide care and a Vermont-based organization called Aspire Living and Learning to provide behavioral support. The care is paid for through Medicaid and other state and federal dollars.
Uttam Thapa
Pitambar Thapa told police Houle’s two caretakers — along with a third named Uttam Thapa — would regularly hit Houle with an open hand, step on his calves, and strike him in the arch of his foot. He said the three would lie about their whereabouts, pretending to be in the community when they weren’t, police records indicate.
Houle’s family sued Summit, Community Bridges, Aspire, and several officials at those organizations. The parties settled the case in July. In separate criminal cases, Shrestha and Timsina pleaded guilty to simple assault in 2020 and Uttam Thapa entered a special plea in which he accepted conviction for simple assault but didn’t admit guilt. Shrestha and Timsina were sentenced to nine months in jail while Uttam Thapa was fined $500, according to court records. Pitambar Thapa was not charged.
Houle is now living with his mother.
Kristin Ross
Kristin Ross, an attorney representing (along with her law partner Cristina Rousseau) Houle’s family and speaking on their behalf, told the Bulletin when she first heard what happened to Houle, “I was physically sick to my stomach.”
“It was incredibly difficult to listen to the video and audio and hear Lucas begging for them to stop,” she said.
There were plenty of red flags regarding Houle’s care that the state missed.
Community Bridges’ relationship with Summit was new when it hired the agency to care for Houle in 2018. Internal documents from Community Bridges made public during litigation show the formal vetting process for Summit wasn’t completed until May 2019, months after Houle was placed in its care.
Also, the caretakers were required by state regulations and the service agreement to submit reports each month detailing their activities with Houle, what progress was being made on his behavioral and developmental goals, and any incidents that occurred. Many of those reports, which were also made public as part of the litigation, are verbatim, or near verbatim, copies of one another. The language appears to be copy and pasted (with the same typos) and small, very specific details repeated. The caretakers’ supervisors and Houle’s behavioral team were required to review those reports, but no one appears to have questioned why they never changed.
Progress Notes
 
Additionally, Matthew Green, an Aspire employee, was assigned to be Houle’s behavior analyst and was responsible for his care plan. Green told police he saw the video of Houle being abused, according to the police report. While he reported it to the Bureau of Adult and Aging Services, Green and his colleagues didn’t remove Houle from his abusers until almost a month after he was made aware of the footage. Green, who was a defendant in the lawsuit but never criminally charged, didn’t respond to the Bulletin’s requests for an interview or comment, though the July settlement barred him from speaking about the case.
Under the terms of the care plan, Green was required to spend an average of six hours each month observing Houle’s care team. But billing records revealed during litigation show he spent just 2.5 hours with Houle and his team in total over the roughly eight months between the day of the video and Houle’s removal from the home. The defendants argued during litigation more time spent with Houle wouldn’t necessarily have increased the likelihood that someone would’ve discovered he was being abused and that Aspire may have failed to log all of Green’s time spent observing. They also noted he could spend less time one month and more another if it all averaged out to six hours, but no evidence brought in court shows Green provided enough hours the other months to bring the average up.
When the parties in the lawsuit settled under undisclosed terms, they were barred from speaking about the case. The Bulletin reached out before and after the settlement, but Community Bridges and Aspire didn’t respond to requests for comment, while Summit declined to comment. The Houle family’s lawyers, Ross and Rousseau, spoke to the Bulletin before the settlement, but stopped commenting on the case afterward.
Overheating in a hot car
It was a July evening when Christine Marie Bill, 46, was found unresponsive in a hot car, the doors and windows closed, in the driveway of the Andover home where she lived, according to both the lawsuit and police records. She’d been there for roughly six hours and was pronounced dead at approximately 7:10 p.m. after EMS, State Police, and a medical examiner responded.

Ten years earlier, an insulin overdose left Bill with a number of disabilities, including cognitive/memory deficit, brain dysfunction, and a seizure disorder; as a result, she had a history of leaving the house for unexplained reasons, according to the suit. Security footage from the home showed Bill leaving the house and walking toward the car that day herself unbeknownst to the caretakers, according to the police report. It was the caretakers’ job, as outlined in the care agreement, to check on Bill frequently. A wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family alleges they weren’t properly trained on what those check-ins entailed. 
For Bill’s care, Community Bridges contracted with Independent Services Network, which hired the caregivers. The care plan, created by the two organizations in collaboration with the Bill family, explicitly said, “She cannot be left alone and requires 24/7 supervision in the home with eyes-on in the community as her safety skills are minimal,” according to the suit.
The case was settled in 2023, with the defendants maintaining they weren’t negligent. The terms of the settlement are confidential and, according to Haines, the plaintiffs’ attorney, barred the parties from speaking about it. Neither Community Bridges nor Independent Services Network responded to the Bulletin’s requests for comment or an interview.
“What was very clear,” Haines, who couldn’t comment on Bill’s case but did discuss the system at large, said, “is just the complete lack of oversight that there is in the system itself. Just a complete systemic breakdown. Everyone is checking boxes to try to comply with administrative regulations, but no one is doing anything substantive.”
The biggest part of this breakdown, she said, is the lack of change after tragedies to prevent future tragedies.
“Incidents are reported because they have to be reported,” she said. “But nothing is done to do any sort of root cause analysis or investigation and change to the system. … It really doesn’t matter how many incident reports you file if no one’s doing anything in response to them.”
Burned by scalding water
Malpractice reports from January 2023 to March 2025, obtained by the Bulletin through records requests, reveal that claims of abuse, neglect, and exploitation are common. While state officials said they couldn’t say which reports were substantiated upon further investigation, citing state statues, many involve reports of physical, verbal, sexual, psychological, and emotional abuse.
One complainant reported that a resident was “kicked in the ribs” and had her “wrist broken by her aide.” Another said the caretaker “punched (the resident) in the eye and the jaw.” Another said the caretaker “grabbed her by the shirt pushed her and kicked her.” In another, “staff hit him in the face.” 
Staff were having sexual relations with those in their care, others reported. Multiple others described staff sexually assaulting residents or not preventing residents from sexually assaulting one another.
Several claimed people who require 24-hour care and supervision for their disabilities were left unattended. There were reports of staff sleeping on the job, intoxication, and drug use. Some cited concerns about unsafe living quarters, including mold in the shower, exposed live wiring, lack of running water, roaches and rodents, and feces or urine on beds and furniture.
Raymond was the subject of one of the reports. Her family ultimately filed a lawsuit. In March 2023, Raymond’s caretaker — a registered nurse from Mississippi hired by travel nursing agency TLC Nursing — allegedly put her under scalding water in the shower at her Lyme care facility, resulting in second-degree burns, according to a malpractice lawsuit filed by the family. 
The caregiver, seemingly oblivious to the damage Raymond suffered to her abdomen, legs, and genital area, saw redness on Raymond and allegedly proceeded to scrub the burned areas clean. The caretaker reportedly noted that skin peeled off during the scrubbing, but still didn’t realize she was scrubbing burn wounds, according to the lawsuit. 
Three round burns, the size and shape of the showerhead, were discovered on Raymond by another caregiver, according to the suit. Raymond was subsequently taken to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, where she was reportedly treated in the burn unit, and incurred $45,000 in medical costs, per the lawsuit.
The facility where Raymond lived was operated by the area agency PathWays of the River Valley. Like that of Houle and Bill, Raymond’s care was overseen by the state’s Bureau of Developmental Services and paid for through state and federal dollars.
The family’s lawsuit, filed in October 2024, named PathWays, TLC Nursing, and the nurse who reportedly burned her as defendants. A settlement reached in March bars the family from speaking about the case. PathWays didn’t respond to the Bulletin’s request for an interview or comment, though they were similarly barred from speaking after the settlement.

State officials applied Oct. 31 for nearly $1 billion of the $50 billion in the Rural Health Transformation Fund, which was set aside in the federal budget reconciliation law passed in July. The state asked for $200 million per year over five years, and many of the applicants that sent their proposals to the state in October provided five-year plans for their funding requests.
All 50 states have applied for a share of the federal fund. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it will notify states by Dec. 31 if their applications are approved.
Arkansas requested $996.8 million to support four initiatives:

$150.5 million for Healthy Eating, Active Recreation and Transformation (HEART)
$393 million for Promoting Access, Coordination and Transformation (PACT)
$161.55 million for Recruitment, Innovation, Skills and Education for Arkansas (RISE AR)
$266.75 million for Telehealth, Health-monitoring and Response Innovation for Vital Expansion (THRIVE)

The remaining $25 million would cover administrative costs, according to the state’s application.

Arkansas-Rural-Health-Transformation-Program-Application 
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a Wednesday news release that the federal aid would “allow us to build on all we have done so far, like investing in maternal health, combatting food insecurity, and promoting better health and nutrition statewide.”
On Thursday, Republican state Sen. Missy Irvin of Mountain View praised the “robust response” to the state’s call for applications and the “excellent ideas” proposed. Irvin chairs the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee and represents a largely rural North Arkansas constituency.
The Advocate obtained the individual funding requests from the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration via a public records request. Many of the proposals pertained to at least one of the four initiatives.
For example, the Arkansas Health Care Association School of Nursing asked for more than $9.25 million to train and retain licensed nurses in rural areas. The proposal would likely fit in the RISE AR category.
“This is not simply a training program — it is a transformative career pathway model that builds capacity, strengthens communities, and ensures that every Arkansan, regardless of ZIP code, can receive quality care from a skilled and compassionate nurse,” the application states.
The AHCA represents 90% of the state’s long-term care providers, according to its website, and its nursing school offers training leading to licensure for practical nurses and certification for medication assistants. 
 Hospital systems’ applications

If Arkansas receives all the funding it requested from the Rural Health Transformation Fund, not all the applicants would get all the money they requested. Mercy Health, based in Missouri with several hospitals in Arkansas, asked for $200 million in capital funds for equipment and infrastructure upgrades. Multiple Mercy hospitals made their own funding requests, such as the Waldron location’s $794,300 request for facility renovations and the Ozark location’s $9,950 request to improve its telehealth services.
The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Arkansas Children’s Hospital also submitted rural health funding proposals.
UAMS’ proposal included forming a “clinically integrated network” of at least 30 rural hospitals and clinics “that shares data, care teams and purchasing power” so rural health care providers “can get paid for delivering better health.” The plan would require between $100 million and $153 million “depending on Medicaid population inclusion.”

2025.10.7 FINAL RTF with Cover 
Arkansas Children’s requested $34.2 million over five years to bring specialized pediatric care to rural areas and treat chronic conditions in children.
“Effectively deploying care and resources to areas with the fewest and sickest kids proves to be a significant challenge due to current funding and workforce frameworks,” the hospital’s proposal states. “…America’s healthcare system is not built with the rural child in mind.”
Some hospitals’ funding requests sought to address specific areas of medical care. Washington Regional Hospital in Fayetteville asked for $12 million to improve its diagnostic imaging capabilities for neurological care, and Johnson Regional Medical Center in Clarksville asked for between $500,000 and $700,000 for mammography services to improve its breast cancer detection capacity.
 Other funding requests

Other applicants included small local health care providers and initiatives, such as Coleman Pharmacy of Alma. State Sen. Justin Boyd, the location’s pharmacist and a Republican from Fort Smith, submitted the pharmacy’s proposal.
“Expanding pharmacists’ prescriptive authority for hypertension and cardiovascular care would improve access, reduce hospitalizations, and save an estimated $11 billion over 30 years,” Boyd wrote.
An addiction treatment center in Berryville called 29:11 Healing and Recovery Center estimated a need for $200 million to broaden its reach via telehealth, behavioral health services, mobile health units and recruitment and retention of health care professionals in five Northwest Arkansas counties.

Rural Arkansans face long ambulance wait times, nationwide study says


In Northeast Arkansas, the Arkansas Methodist Medical Center requested $175,321.37 for a new ambulance. The Paragould hospital was among 17 rural hospitals to receive federal COVID-19 relief funds from the state between 2022 and 2024.
The Arkansas Ambulance Association also requested funding for several initiatives, including replacing outdated vehicles, training more paramedics and expanding telehealth capacity. The organization requested $88.4 million over five years.
A 2023 study found that all 75 counties in Arkansas have at least one ambulance desert, meaning it takes paramedics longer than 25 minutes to drive to some residents’ homes. Hundreds of thousands of Arkansans rely on Medicaid, particularly in rural areas, and emergency medical services professionals said this causes financial strain for rural ambulance services.
The new budget reconciliation law cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for low-income Americans, over the next decade to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy. Those cuts include $155 billion less in rural Medicaid spending over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers from both political parties fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see larger proportions of patients insured through Medicaid. This raises concerns that $50 billion for rural health aid might not be enough.

The analysis of credit card data was performed by WalletHub. 
It found that while 19.66% of Ohio credit card payments were overdue in the second quarter of last year, 28.65% were in 2025. 
Only Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas and South Dakota saw bigger increases.
“While some level of delinquency is unavoidable, rising delinquency rates often signal broader economic strain,” the analysis said.
On the positive side, the sustainability of Ohioans’ overall debt is much better than most states.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A WalletHub analysis in July found that median credit card debt here was $2,476 and the median monthly payment was $263. 
At that rate, it would take 11 months and 14 days for median cardholders to pay off their balances. 
That was the 10th fastest in the United States, the analysis found.
But the rapid rise in Ohioans’ credit-card debt coincides with several other foreboding economic indicators. 
Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index was 3% in September, and the Federal Bank of Cleveland reported that President Donald Trump’s tariffs were forcing up businesses’ expenses and prices for consumers.
Meanwhile, Ohioans’ utility bills are skyrocketing as the state provides incentives to power-intensive data centers to locate here. 
The centers don’t employ many people, and one estimate said the incentives are costing Ohioans $1 million tax dollars for each job created.
Ohio again had the nation’s fifth-highest unemployment in August, despite years of spending billions on taxpayer-financed incentives to attract jobs.
The Trump administration started the year by allowing the world’s richest man to lead a group that slashed more than 250,000 federal workers, and many more have been idled as a partial government shutdown approaches its sixth week.
The news organization Reuters last Thursday reported that U.S.-based employers in October cut 150,000 jobs — the largest number in 20 years. 
Total job cuts for the year are just over 1 million, the most since the start of the pandemic in 2020. 
With lots of student loan debt and faced with a weak employment picture, credit card struggles are particularly besetting Ohio’s young people.
An analysis of Federal Reserve Data by Austin-based Upgraded Points last month found that a higher-than-average portion of Ohioans between 18 and 34 had credit cards that were more than 90 days delinquent. 
The Buckeye State ranked 16th for severe delinquency, with 17.1% of young people having that status in the first quarter of 2025.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderSix candidates have stepped forward to fill a Cherokee County legislative seat that was left empty after the death of the district’s state representative last month.
Rep. Mandi Ballinger, a Canton Republican, died in October after a long battle with cancer. Five Republicans and one Democrat  have qualified to replace her in the state House.
House District 23 was drawn to favor a Republican. The last time Ballinger had a Democratic opponent was in 2018, and she won with nearly three quarters of the vote, though the district’s borders have shifted since then.
The election is scheduled for Dec. 9 with early voting set to begin Monday, Nov. 17.
With six candidates splitting the vote, it’s likely that none of them will exceed the required 50% of the vote. In that case, a runoff is scheduled to be held Jan. 6. The House is set to gavel in for the start of the 2026 legislative session on Jan. 12.
The short timeframe to campaign combined with the Thanksgiving travel season and voter fatigue from other recent elections could all portend low turnout.
Here’s who has thrown their hat in the ring to represent part of Cherokee County including Canton, part of northern Holly Springs and the surrounding unincorporated regions, according to documents filed with the secretary of state’s office:
Bill Fincher
Fincher, a Republican former assistant district attorney, now owns an RV park. In a phone call, Fincher said his experience negotiating and trying cases is part of what makes him the best candidate for the job.
“I’m strong for law enforcement. I’m strong for election integrity, and I believe in capping the ad valorem tax to protect people so they can stay in their homes. I’m a friend of taxpayers, having paid a lot of taxes over my life, I’m pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, I’m a Christian conservative.”
Fincher said his top priorities if elected will be ensuring election integrity, capping ad valorem taxes and reducing the price of groce

“As a lifelong resident of Cherokee County, I share the values and vision that make this community special,” the 33-year-old said in an email. “At my age, I have the energy and drive to fight for those values every day. I have been fortunate to live the ‘Cherokee Dream,’ to live, work, and raise a family right here at home. I am committed to keeping government in check so others can do the same, and to using those roots to continue moving our community forward.”
Sagoo said his top priorities will be reducing the state income tax, lowering property taxes and cutting regulations on small businesses.

The sole Democrat in the race, Sanders acknowledged that winning a conservative district like HD23 will be an uphill climb, but he’s hopeful that a campaign based on what he calls common sense and compromise may find favor with Canton voters.
Sanders, a business executive who comes from a family of educators, said his top priority if elected will be making Georgia teachers’ lives easier. He said he also hopes to focus on fully funding public services and reducing overdevelopment in rural areas.
“I’m not really thrilled with the extremes on either side,” he said in a phone call. “And, you know, this is me trying to bring normalcy and sanity and — I keep using the phrase ‘common sense –’ back to things. That’s all it really is, you know? Voters don’t have to believe in everything I believe in, I wouldn’t expect them to. But if we can agree on some of the bigger stuff, maybe there’s room to figure out smaller stuff or at least take care of the important items and make the world a better place a little bit.”

Ware, a retired microbiologist, said he decided to run in part to help children in state custody, which was also a passion of Ballinger’s.
Ware said the issue is personal for him after members of his family had children taken away in another state.
“At least I can try to do something,” he said. “And at the same time, I understand the complexities that child protective services have, and I want to work with them, not to abolish or get rid of them or anything, but to support them so that we don’t have the problems that we’ve got right now.”
Ware said he’ll be running on a tight budget and acknowledged he is at a disadvantage, but he pledged to serve with integrity and keep an eye on spending if he is elected.
“The term limits are gonna be short for me – I am 78 years old,” he said. “But I have a lot of experience in negotiating. I feel like I can represent the people here. I’m open, transparent, honest. Hopefully, I have some integrity, and I think we lack that in a lot of our politicians. And that’s what I bring to the table”

(Photo by SDI Productions via Getty Images)With child care access already considered a crisis in Ohio, the state’s Head Start locations are facing their own challenges, including closure, as the federal government shutdown continues.
Head Start is an income-based federal program with preschool programs and Early Head Start, which targets infants, toddlers, and pregnant individuals.
The program funding is delivered through local agencies who “tailor the federal program to the local needs of families in their service area, according to a federal website on the program.
In fiscal year 2024, 62 grants were distributed to Ohio, for a total of more than $440 million in funding, data from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services showed.
But that money is quickly fading away because of the stalemate in the U.S. Congress over reopening the federal government.
Funding lapses began Oct. 1 when no agreement came from Capitol Hill, with Democrats standing their ground on demands to renew Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, and Republicans digging their heels in, with leaders saying they won’t negotiate until the government is reopened.
Without action, Head Start programs across the country saw Nov. 1 go by without grant funding, affecting more than 65,000 children in 140 programs across 41 states and Puerto Rico.
Other funding aimed at community programs may also be impacted, including about 1,600 across the country.
As of 2024, the seven Head Start programs in Ohio had more than 33,000 children enrolled, with 1,741 children in foster care being served, along with 1,660 children experiencing homelessness.
The biggest age group enrolled in state Head Start is 4-year-olds, with more than 12,000 enrolled, according to federal data.

Head Start closures “represent a significant loss for Ohio’s children and workforce, and highlighting the profound impact of these shutdowns on the community,” said Jodi Norton Trimble, spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Children & Youth.
The program employs 1,335 preschool classroom teachers in Ohio at a salary of $40,013 per year, and nearly 1,000 infant and toddler classroom teachers.
Early Head Start teachers in the state are paid $36,152, the HHS data stated.
Without the return of federal funding sources, all of Ohio’s Head Start providers face the potential for closure, according to the Ohio Head Start Association, Inc.
Two Ohio programs have already closed classrooms due to the shutdown, in Scioto County and Highland County.
Allen County and Coshocton County are scheduled to close in less than two weeks, according to the association.
Highland County Community Action Organization, Inc., announced its Nov. 1 closures at the end of October, saying staff will be furloughed and classrooms would be closed until the government reopens.
Coshocton County Head Start, Inc., has been active since 1972, and has 140 children enrolled, with 57 employees.
In October, the program said with the shutdown still in place, the organization would need $220,000 to get through the month of November.
Coshocton County Head Start’s executive director, Susan Craddock, said in a statement they were “doing everything we can to keep our classrooms open because our families depend on us.”
“Parents need to work and go to school knowing their children are safe, learning and cared for,” Craddock said in October. “But we can’t sustain this without federal and local support.”
Then, in a Nov. 6 letter to families, Craddock said the community and “many individuals have rallied around us to keep our program open these last two weeks.”
“Unfortunately, due to the continued government shutdown and pause in federal funding, our program will have to temporarily close starting Nov. 14,” Craddock wrote.
The program plans to reopen after the shutdown has ended and grant funding has been received.
The state’s Head Start Association said providers “have exhausted their federal funds,” and the five remaining locations “are operating on borrowed time — cobbling together donations, community support and organizational reserves.”
“This shutdown is pulling the rug out from under working families,” said Julie Stone, executive director of the Ohio Head Start Association.
“Parents are losing child care, teachers are losing paychecks and children are losing the stable, nurturing environments that help them thrive. These are real people with real consequences — and Ohio’s youngest citizens deserve better.”
Stone told the Capital Journal that the total potential impact from the Scioto and Highland closures, along with the planned Allen and Coshocton closures impact 1,042 children, 55 classrooms and 286 staff members.
“We are hopeful the government shutdown will end soon, but not sure what a reopening will look like with reduced federal staff to support the review and awarding of grants,” Stone said.

Of the 38 school ballot issues, 23 passed and 15 failed. But there was a clear difference in the type of levy that was passed.
Renewal levies, which do not raise your taxes, passed 18 out of 20 times. While additional fund levies, which will increase your bills, failed 7 out of 10 times. This was the case for Elyria City Schools.
“It breaks my heart because I know what we do for our students and families. And any time you have to look at making cuts, no matter where the cuts are, it’s going to affect something,” Ann Schloss, the superintendent for Elyria City Schools, said.


But one of the three that succeeded was Shaker Heights City School District
“I just wanna acknowledge and commend our community for their overwhelming support of the Shaker School District, particularly in today’s day and age,” David Glasner, Shaker superintendent, said.
A day and age where Glasner and all other public school leaders are facing cuts in state funding.
Nonpartisan research group Policy Matters Ohio found that the state slashed the expected public education spending by nearly $3 billion over the next two years.
“We’re already under strain, so it would cause additional strain,” Parma Schools Superintendent Dr. Scott Hunt said about what would happen if his levy failed.
Four bond issues also failed, as well as half of the four substitute levies.
On Wednesday, OhioHouse Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) was asked what he says to the schools that are asking for the state to step in and provide more financial support.
“It’s kind of this, I guess, two-sided coin when folks say ‘We want local control of our schools, but our local folks won’t approve levies. We, therefore, want the state to give us the money, even though our local folks won’t support that,'” Huffman responded.
The state is trying to deal with lowering property taxes, but Huffman added that schools need to be more fiscally responsible if their levies fail.
“An understanding that schools have to be more precise in their spending,” Huffman said. “They’re not going to be able to hire, especially on the administrative side, the people they’ve hired before.”
Districts facing failed levies argue that they have been responsible, while voters told us that the cost of living is too high to pay more.
“Why do you think Shaker was able to beat those odds?” Glasner was asked.
“I think Shaker was able to beat those odds because we have an incredible community that has historically and continues to support our public schools, and that really understands how valuable public schools are, not just to the students and families who are in them, but to the broader community as a whole and really, I would say, kind of an even bigger picture to our country and the health of our democracy,” he responded.
The City of Shaker Heights has been a district at the forefront of both state and federal political discussions.
The community not only shows up to vote, but had a turnout rate of nearly 70% during the 2024 presidential election, according to data from the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections. The city of about 30,000 voted for former VP Kamala Harris by nearly 90%.
The district being so engaged in how school funding works is a factor, Glasner added.
“The levy will play a critical role in advancing the district’s equity goals – racial, economic, ability-based, and beyond,” the Stand Up for Shaker Schools levy campaign page wrote.
“Funds will help every student access high-quality educational opportunities.”
The superintendent also acknowledged that socioeconomic factors played into the passage.
Census data shows the average Shaker Heights home is valued at around $300,000. Passing the levy will make tax bills go up more than $1,000 per year.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins failed his big test for President Donald Trump on Tuesday. He couldn’t persuade two-thirds of his fellow Republicans to call a special session to gerrymander Kansas congressional seats. I suspect Hawkins knew how ineffectual he looked (I poked some fun along those lines), and he sure didn’t seem amused by his colleagues’ intransigence.
So the time has come for payback.
The hammer fell Friday. Hawkins purged holdouts from committee leadership roles. As Kansas Reflector reported, he removed “as chairmen GOP Reps. Steven Howe of Salina, Nathan Butler of Junction City and Jesse Borjon of Topeka. Hawkins also removed Rep. Clarke Sanders of Salina and Rep. Leah Howell of Derby from vice chair positions.” Further action appears likely, as these changes affect only half of the GOP representatives who refused to support the special session.
Hawkins likely felt he didn’t have any choice. After Senate President Ty Masterson easily reached the two-thirds mark in his chamber, Hawkins had to play the disciplinarian in the House.
But I can’t imagine the move helps him politically, or makes redistricting any more likely in the 2026 session.
Think about it. Hawkins will leave the House after next session. He’s running for state insurance commissioner and has a strong shot at the office. He’s therefore heading into January as a lame duck. Those he strips of chairmanships or committee seats just need to wait until Hawkins leaves the chamber. What do they have to fear from him?
In the meantime, why would any Republican publicly humiliated in such a way decide to support gerrymandering now? Surely the smarter move, if Hawkins believed the votes were there in his conference, would be to wait until the regular session and use his power then. Either the speaker allowed his temper to get the better of him or — as I suspect — he knows the votes aren’t there to split Johnson County into multiple districts.
Let me also suggest this: Among the 87 other Kansas House Republicans, at least one or two have wondered if they might make a better speaker than Hawkins.
We’ve seen what happens when Hawkins faces challenges before. He pitched a fit when Lawrence Democrat Dennis “Boog” Highberger contemplated a symbolic run for speaker. But with Hawkins on the way out, perhaps an ambitious Republican member sees a chance for advancement.
I’m just asking questions here!
Finally, the entire situation highlights a Hawkins’ tendency to mislead the public.
On Tuesday, when he gave up efforts to call the special session, the House speaker stated the following via news release: “Planning a Special Session is always going to be an uphill battle with multiple agendas, scheduling conflicts, and many other unseen factors at play.”
Three days later, in his “Majority Record” newsletter, Hawkins was singing a different tune. There, he wrote: “Unfortunately, only 78 of 88 Republican House members signed the petition calling for a November 7th special session. Once we reached the November 7th deadline, the petitions are void and the process would need to start again.”
Anyone with with a functioning brain can see what happened here.
Hawkins got the bad news out of the way with a short, obfuscatory statement. His vanilla-flavored comments about scheduling filled the first round of news stories. But when it came time to communicate at length with constituents, Hawkins described a less-flattering scenario. He didn’t just face an “uphill battle.” No, 10 of his Republican colleagues didn’t agree with the cockamamie scheme to hand another GOP seat to Trump.
I might just be old fashioned, but I prefer political leaders who tell the truth up front and don’t require an extra three days to ponder their words.
Before signing off today, let’s also note that I could be wrong. The Legislature could reconvene in January and whisk through a new congressional map, booting Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids out of Congress. Hawkins could revel in the accolades of fellow Republicans. I don’t claim to understand the ways of politicians from either party. They can be strange creatures, and please don’t feed them after midnight.
But for now, all Hawkins appears to have is a recalcitrant caucus and appetite for vengeance. What could go wrong?

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)In part of its tug-of-war game with Congress, the Trump Administration announced this week they would be cutting payments to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as “food stamp”) families as a way to pressure Congress to end the federal government shutdown.
This means 1.4 million Ohioans will have benefits reduced this month. Since the average per-person benefit is $186, that means Ohio will lose about $130 million in food support in November if the administration goes through with this threat.
While the SNAP program is ostensibly about food assistance, the program has a range of impacts.
According to at least some research, SNAP is an effective food insecurity program. Urban Institute researchers estimate SNAP recipiency reduces the chance of being food insecure by 30%. 
Researchers at the Center for Science in the Public Interest followed families that newly received SNAP, finding their food insecurity rates dropped by 11% six months into the program.
SNAP is also an income support and antipoverty program. Since families still usually spend more of their income on food than their SNAP benefits cover (try feeding even your most peckish family member for a month on $186), SNAP benefits effectively free up resources for households to make other purchases. 
Urban Institute researchers found that the 2021 update to the Thrift Food Plan used to set SNAP benefits kept 2.9 million Americans out of poverty.

On top of being a food insecurity and antipoverty program, SNAP is also an economic stimulus program. 
When low-income people receive payments, they tend to spend them, which then puts money in the pockets of workers at grocery stores, who use it to pay rent, buy their own groceries, and purchase other necessities. 
The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that every $1 spent on SNAP leads to $1.54 in increased Gross Domestic Product. 
This can be especially important during economic downturns, when SNAP acts countercyclically to pump more money into the economy when the country needs spending the most.
So if Ohio’s federal support for fighting food insecurity, poverty, and stimulating the economy is going away, are there things the state can do to pick up the slack?
One option the state of Ohio has is funding nutrition education. 
Initiatives like the SNAP-Ed program are effective tools for helping families meal plan and spend money strategically, showing in randomized controlled trials in other states to reduce food insecurity by as much as a third. 
This can be a strategy the state can use to reduce food insecurity even in the face of SNAP cuts.
To fight poverty, Ohio lawmakers can use tax credits like the earned income tax credit or the child tax credit. 
These sorts of programs put cash in the pockets of low-income workers while helping children get off on the right foot, supporting their health and income in the long-run.
To stimulate the state economy, one of the most powerful tools lawmakers have is state education spending, particularly early education spending.
Expanded access to high-quality prekindergarten education is a tool that can be as effective as well-designed economic development incentives at increasing local incomes in the long-run.
Ohio lawmakers can only do so much to control federal politics. 
But if lawmakers want their constituents to be food secure, free from poverty, and to have economic opportunities in a thriving economy, they have options to let them do that.

(Stock image from broadcastertr via Getty Images)Nebraska’s news junkies and even casual information consumers have full plates: the potential resignations of a University of Nebraska regent and a state legislator; a federal immigration detention camp that materialized on an apparent need-to-know basis in an infinitesimally narrow reading of who needs to know; and, with less than a year from 2026’s midterm elections, political campaigns are giving news and information patrons thousands of opportunities to wonder what is the truth. 
Each news cycle adds to the list, too.
Imagine a Nebraska television station’s local news broadcast — or a network’s nightly news — devoting 5-7 minutes most evenings to getting the actual truth, not simply a repackaging by one or more of the principals involved or a retelling of something gleaned from our newest “news” universe: social media. 
That’s right, what if tucked among the weather, doorbell videos funny or frightening or local officials making non-comment comments was a segment designed to sift fact from fiction among stories that affect viewers lives? 
What if the reporting — after ferreting out the fibs and fakes — also took a clear-eyed look at the reasons behind such fictions.
I found such a station, not in the Cornhusker State but in Paris. It’s called France 24. I stumbled across it while searching for something on PBS World. France 24 covers events from around the globe. Its “World Roundup” broadcast this night fell on the eve of some U.S. elections, so France 24 devoted its “Truth or Fake” segment to a number of lies and distortions regarding the New York City mayoral race.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
After the “Truth or Fake” reporter debunked a number of wild claims about the young man who would be the eventual winner, the news anchor asked her to surmise from her research and evidence what was the primary reason for all the misrepresentations. “Hypocrisy and racism,” she said. 
This was neither a YouTube video, a TikTok, an expanded Snapchat nor an Instagram post. This was a professional journalist verifying crucial details using solid evidence to refute widely viewed, wildly inaccurate social media posts, some of which legacy media had used in news broadcasts.
I was simultaneously flabbergasted and refreshed, the idea that a major news outlet would present such fact-checking as part of its evening broadcast. (France 24 is a state-owned public station in competition with French private networks such as TF1 and BFM TV.) 
Still, I was curious if “Truth or Fake” was a one off given the timing of the NYC election. Sure enough, the next night “Truth or Fake” spent another 5-7 minutes taking issue with Elon Musk’s claim that the ballot for NYC mayor was part of a scam, a hot air balloon of baloney that the reporter punctured. After some research, I found that “Truth or Fake” is a regular part of France 24’s “World Roundup” Monday through Thursday.
You’re right. Why trust “something like Truth or Fake” more than a friend on Facebook or a podcast we heard on the way to work or the dish or dirt we overheard at the coffee shop or even our local news stations or newspapers? 
The answer has a little to do with my own trusted sources of information and even less than the information itself. It has plenty to do with whether the information agrees with what I already think and, most important, my ability to believe it when it doesn’t.
The real takeaway here is that at least France 24 is trying, attempting to ascertain the truth and report it. Others are trying, too. Some … not so much. In the post-truth age, when facts carry less influence than emotions and beliefs, the news industry — and its social media competitors — must remain a force for a well-informed democracy, without fear or favor when the government or the powerful traffic in or repeat lies and other assorted disinformation. 
This force is the hope for Nebraskans when they pick up their morning papers, turn on their evening news or go online to get the latest.
Aside from nerds like me, who really pays attention to something like “Truth or Fake?” The point is that France 24 and anyone else who is pushing back on the constant lying, who is unwilling to accept evidence-free pronouncements from the government, online influencers or friends, or who is fact-checking and calling out the false is acting as if our aggregate future depends on it.
Pro tip: It does.

The chair of the Florida State University’s Board of Trustees says he’s looking forward to extending President Richard McCullough’s contract.
With his initial 2021 contract expiring Aug. 31, 2026, Chair Peter Collins told the Phoenix that McCullough, 66, is the “perfect person” for the job.

“He’s doing a great job, there’s no plans on changing that,” Collins said late last month.
Collins said he plans to take McCullough’s contract extension to the Board of Governors to approve next year.
“I don’t anticipate any problem with that,” Collins said.
BOG regulations limit university presidents to one-year contract extensions once their original terms expire.
FSU ranked #21 among public universities nationwide by U.S. News & World Report in 2025, keeping close to the top 20, when in 2021 it landed at #19.
FSU was the third-highest scoring public institution in the 2025 performance-based funding metrics.

Eight of the 12 state universities have concluded or have started a presidential search since June 2024. That figure includes the University of North Florida, which is anticipated to start a presidential search if the BOG votes, to make current UNF President Moez Limayem head of the University of South Florida. Incoming BOG chair Alan Levine said he intends to support Limayem.
Collins, who was unanimously elected chair of the FSU Board of Trustees in August for a two-year term, said he doesn’t anticipate FSU becoming the ninth university with a new president.
“There’s going to be no change in leadership prior to the end of his next year. We would extend him now as a board if we could,” Collins said.


When do presidential contacts expire?
FGCU: 2026 (June 30)
FSU: 2026 (Aug. 31)
Florida Polytechnic: 2027
New College of Florida: 2028
FAMU: 2030
FAU: 2030
FIU: 2030
UCF: 2026 (Dec. 31) Initial term completed, now on one-year extensions. 
UF: Donald Landry is interim president and contractually incentivized to get permanent job. 
USF: Pending BOG confirmation of UNF President Moez Limayem.
UNF: Search will commence if Limayem departs.
UWF: Former Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. is interim president and has expressed interest in permanent job. 


Recently-departed presidents
Some of those recently-departed SUS presidents, Kenneth Jessell at Florida International University, Ben Sasse at University of Florida, and Martha Saunders at University of West Florida, left their posts before their contracts expired and following outside pressures. 
All the while Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has been instrumental in re-engineering leadership at universities, has been hovering in the background.
DeSantis’ office guided Sasse to Gainesville, Politico reported, before he left in a shroud of spending controversy. The governor reached out to place Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez at FIU, a trustee said.
DeSantis in the spring told UWF to “buckle up” and promised changes were on the way. Those comments and DeSantis’ overhaul of the UWF Board of Trustees caused a stir among UWF stakeholders who expressed fear about gubernatorial interference.
Saunders left after DeSantis’ comments. After that, Manny Diaz, DeSantis’ top education official, eventually took the reigns of UWF as an interim president and now is interested in the permanent job.
Other recent presidential searches, shrouded in secrecy, have stirred up some alumni at Florida A&M University, UWF, New College of Florida, and FIU, who’ve cried about politically-connected people being named president.
FAMU stakeholders protested Marva Johnson being named its next president. She is a political appointee of former Gov. Rick Scott and DeSantis. New College of Florida was the first university made-over with DeSantis’ brush, when former House Speaker Richard Corcoran was put at the helm in 2023.
But Collins says he has no worries there will be any external interference with the future of FSU’s leadership.
“I have no concern on that at all for Florida State or President McCullough. He’s done a fantastic job, everybody in state government, I think, recognizes that. Certainly the BOG recognizes that. It’s a big job, right?” Collins said. “And he’s the perfect person for it right now. So I don’t anticipate any outside factors or outside influences affecting certainly our decision over the next year and certainly our decision to take him to the BOG for his one-year extension.”
McCullough, through a university spokesperson, declined to discuss his future at FSU.
The deets
McCullough in August was awarded a pay raise, now putting his salary at $1.25 million. He also was given a positive performance review  that included a $567,000 one-time bonus. His initial 2021 contract provided him a $700,000 base salary.
The president laid out his goals for the year at the Oct. 31 FSU Board of Trustees meeting, which included a focus on national rankings, research and entrepreneurial excellence, as well as athletics and community engagement.
McCullough isn’t the only university president whose contract is set to expire in 2026. Florida Gulf Coast University’s President Aysegul Timur’s contract expires June, 30 2026. That university has been among the lowest scoring SUS institution in performance based metrics in recent years.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-10 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Our grandchildren will pay for our energy mistakes today,Shannon Laun,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/10/our-grandchildren-will-pay-for-our-energy-mistakes-today/,Gas companies want Connecticut to make a huge financial commitment that will end with higher bills and a more polluted state.,"It is hard to overstate the importance of the energy turning point that Connecticut faces right now – and the ramifications to our pocketbooks and our health if we make the wrong choice.
Soaring electricity costs have put enormous pressure on political leaders to cut costs and help justifiably angry customers. New England states routinely finish behind only Hawaii and California when it comes to the cost of electricity.
The reasons for our soaring costs are complicated. We’re not going to solve them with simplistic solutions – no matter how tempting it may be to opt for what is sold as a quick fix.
And that’s what fossil fuel advocates are doing right now – telling us all our problems will go away with one short-term fix: burning more gas. In questionable surveys, hardball Hartford lobbying, and a barrage of media stories, these advocates are pushing Connecticut leaders to build gas pipelines and use more fossil fuels.
We have to pause when paid advocates for fossil fuels call for more oil, coal, or gas. We must question the long-term overall cost and damage of what they are pushing.
Former Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio is working in Connecticut on behalf of fossil fuel companies that want expanded gas pipelines and more fossil fuels as a solution to high energy costs. The problem? There’s a lot of evidence that Connecticut’s electricity rates are high because the region is heavily dependent on natural gas. The price of gas fluctuates with supply and demand, with war and global turmoil. It is delivered in pipelines that leak and require repair and replacement and burned in power plants that pollute our air. Those charges are all passed on to consumers.
The former Ohio congressman also cites a study paid for by fossil fuel advocates Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future (NACEF), a group funded in part by companies that build gas pipelines. The study claims popular support for more gas and pipelines. According to that survey, 80 percent of Connecticut residents want the state to burn more gas.
According to a survey not funded by the gas industry, 88 percent of Connecticut residents believe climate change is a real problem, 87 percent want more solar power, and 74 percent want more offshore wind.
To their credit, Ryan and NACEF do call on Connecticut to get more clean energy – they just want us to build more pipelines and burn more gas while that happens. Unfortunately, that risks locking us into years of higher electric bills.
A thoughtful look at the pitfalls of Connecticut increasing gas use by Kat Burnham of Advanced Energy United highlights why gas is a bad deal for our region. Connecticut ranks fourth in America for miles of old pipe needing attention. Massachusetts has had to spend $6 million a mile to replace or fix their old pipes, and the price of gas overall has doubled in the last year. New pipelines take years or even decades to pay off, and customers will have them on their bills for years. Once we have invested that much to repair, replace, expand and build gas pipelines, the industry will have a hold on us: You are paying for our pipes anyway, you should use them to burn more gas.
The worst part? That path will certainly slow down and maybe stop the near-term solution to our electricity problems – more solar, wind, and battery storage. Land-based wind and utility-scale solar are the most economical near-term options and should be prioritized.Calls to build pipelines and burn more gas are part and parcel of an agenda being driven by the Trump administration to gut renewable energy projects, kill local jobs, and slow our buildout of clean sources of power.
So why are Democrats like Tim Ryan parroting Trump’s fossil fuel propaganda? Connecticut doesn’t need more of the same tired talking points from oil-funded campaigns. We need leaders who listen to us: the people who live here, who pay the bills here, who want to power our future with energy that’s affordable and clean.
If we allow gas interests to sell us miles of new or expanded pipes, it will commit us to a future of uncertainties and soaring costs, rob us of local jobs and local energy, and pump out more pollution. There is no question that we’ll continue using gas for some time as we transition to cleaner sources of energy, but simply buying more and increasing our reliance is a false solution —today and for our future.

This is not a time for celebration but a time for a solid grounding on what must be done to make the lives of the people of our nation and in our state better.
Connecticut Democrats, with their majority, could take to truly “make peoples lives better,” guided by the identified issues like affordability (housing, healthcare, childcare), economic opportunity, and equity.

Keith Denning
As often attributed to Einstein: “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.” The goal is not to simply resist or to revert to a pre-Trump status quo, it’s to innovate a better Connecticut. A majority that fails to make lives measurably better is a majority that has failed the people.
The real crisis: affordability and opportunity. These are the things that Democrats must address solidly with their majority.
Housing is the top concern. While we are in need of almost a hundred thousand affordable housing units, the crisis isn’t just about finding a home; it’s about housing costs eating up money for groceries and medicine.
Healthcare: Democrats must hold the line to maintain and expand affordable healthcare subsidies (like the ACA enhancements), and the high number of residents still worried about medical debt. The move to a single-payer system is gaining support across the country and Connecticut should be a leader in the movement.
Childcare: Quality childcare costs is an economic blocker for both families and the state. Expensive childcare prevents skilled workers (especially women) from returning to the workforce, hurting both families and the economy.
The irony of wealth: Acknowledge Connecticut’s wealth, but point out the glaring income and wealth disparities. The status quo is only working for the privileged few. The richest 5% of households have incomes 14.1 times higher than the bottom 20% of households. Fairfield County exhibits some of the worst income inequality in the country, with average incomes in the top 1% of the country being 73.7 times higher that the bottom 99%. Increasing taxes on incomes over a million dollars would supply the financial means to address many of the concerns of our affordability crisis.
Reimagine housing and zoning. Move beyond vetoes.
The problem: Local zoning restrictions drive up costs and concentrate opportunity. The new thinking: The vetoed housing bill (HB 5002) had strong public support. The new majority must re-engage with courage. Pass state-level zoning reform that mandates a minimum density or affordable unit allocation in all towns, leveraging state resources for sewers and water and other infrastructure and provide funding for compliance rather than just punishment. Focus on allowing more housing types (like multi-family and accessory dwelling units) near transit and job centers.
Guaranteeing affordable health coverage (Expanding the safety net.)
The problem: Even with subsidies, costs for many middle-class families are crushing. The new thinking: Don’t just fight to preserve expiring federal benefits; build a sustainable state model. Aggressively pursue policies to lower prescription drug costs by pooling state agency purchasing power or creating a state-based bulk purchasing program (like the ArrayRx model). Expand the definition of emergency Medicaid coverage to bridge gaps for vulnerable populations. 
Catalytic investment in the workforce (beyond minimum wage.)
The problem: Businesses cite a lack of skilled workers, and families are squeezed by childcare costs. 
The new thinking: Connect the workforce pipeline directly to family stability. Don’t just raise the minimum wage; make a massive investment in childcare subsidies and educator wages to lower costs for parents and stabilize the childcare workforce. Simultaneously, create new incentives for trade/technical schools to train residents for Connecticut’s high-demand, high-benefit jobs, creating a clear path to the middle class.
The Democratic majority has and for many yeas has had the power it needs to make changes that matter however the leadership of the legislature and the governor has preferred to go slow and with measure. There is no longer time to make small changes. The Democrats are no longer an underdog or a reactionary force. They must be an innovative force. Failure is not just political —it means Connecticut continues to be a great state to leave for young families and a hard state to retire in.
When I ran for office and won the 42nd State House district in 2022, I was alarmed and saddened by how poorly the party used their majority to make significant changes due to concerns that they would overreach to make significant changes that would make peoples lives better in the state. They could have used the rule of ‘call the question’ (also called the nuclear option) to end debate that stymied time constraints the Republican use to stop legislation passing but never chose to. I think they forgot that the nuclear power doesn’t always blow things up but also creates energy. 
I challenge Democrats both in the legislature and in our towns and cities to use their majority to prove that the thinking that got them elected (running against chaos) is not the thinking that will define their governance but bold, tangible improvement.
They must prove a majority means actual change that puts money back in people’s pockets and makes Connecticut a genuinely affordable, opportunity-rich state for all its residents.

Our geographical borders tell a stark story of inequitable access to learning, despite our ongoing efforts to build a more just learning landscape. For example, in Bridgeport, where 27% of students are Black and 61% are Hispanic, only 16% of students are on track according to the statewide assessment in Math. Right next door, in Fairfield, which is primarily white, 72% of students meet that benchmark. That’s just one of myriad examples of educational inequity. As our map makes clear: we have unfinished business in public education.
This week, legislators reconvene for a special session which should include several bills and promises made to students last year. These items built broad consensus, promised real impact and nearly crossed the finish line earlier in the year.
Of those items left behind, legislators should pass measures to increase language access for families navigating their children’s academic journeys. They should also open pathways for prospective educators in Connecticut, so all kids can have a qualified teacher to meet their needs. 
In 2023, advocates helped pass a Multilingual Learner Bill of Rights in Connecticut, ensuring that the rights of students and parents are protected and are shared in a families’ dominant language. Two bills that would have increased access and transparency for the families of multilingual learners stalled this year.H.B. 6477 would have required the state to make plans to translate government forms and applications into common non-English languages in Connecticut. Relatedly, H.B. 7009 would have expanded Connecticut’s public school information system to include data on the academic progress of students in bilingual education programs.
Connecticut prides itself on welcoming linguistic and cultural diversity, so families shouldn’t have to wait for these expanded protections and opportunities. Advancing these proactive measures in a special session would acknowledge the strengths that multilingual residents bring to Connecticut.
We all feel the impact of teacher shortages. S.B. 1513 would have addressed them by creating incentives for aspiring educators, making them eligible for existing teacher recruitment scholarship funds, teacher residency programs, recruitment grants, and loan reimbursements. It would have specifically expanded incentives for teacher candidates in shortage areas, or candidates who fall into underrepresented populations. Our failure to broaden eligibility keeps too many prospective Connecticut educators without a clear path to the classroom. We can fix this in a special session.
These aren’t abstract ideas. Language access helps families understand available services and opportunities, and to advocate effectively for their children. Stronger pipelines mean qualified teachers in front of students who need them most. Together with the state’s investments in high-dosage tutoring and literacy professional learning, they form a coherent approach: identify needs early, communicate clearly, support teachers, and deliver effective interventions.
While we understand that a special session is a limited opportunity to find consensus and pass legislation, we know that Connecticut students, families, and educators should not be moved off the agenda once again. Let’s use this special session to finish what we started: pass language-access and transparency for multilingual families; strengthen the teacher pipeline; and keep building a public-education system in which every student, no matter their address, has a fair shot at success.

Candidates and Democratic officials spoke Sunday about the importance of the 2026 elections at the Iowa Democratic Party’s Liberty and Justice Dinner in Des Moines. They also talked about the problems caused by the current government shutdown, which reached day 40 on Sunday.
The shutdown has largely centered on the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits. Democrats and health care advocates have said the scheduled end of these tax credits would lead to premiums doubling for people who receive health insurance through Affordable Care Act Marketplaces.

However, some Democrats at the Iowa event criticized U.S. Senate Democrats for potentially ending their effort to extend these tax credits and pass a continuing resolution to fund the government. Nathan Sage, a Democratic U.S. Senate candidate who is a military veteran and former Knoxville chamber of commerce executive director, told the crowd he was “flustered” while giving his address because he was “just hearing that we might end this shutdown and not have a deal for those ACA tax credits.”
“Millions of Americans are going to lose their health care,” Sage said. “Millions of Americans are not going to know what to do. ”
He attributed economic concerns to Democratic wins in the Nov. 4 elections across the country. “And if anything, we learned anything from Tuesday night, it’s that people need affordability. People need a life where they can actually make it in this world. People need a life where they can actually afford the food and afford the health care they need. And it seems like we don’t have leadership that’s willing to fight for that.”
Senate Majority Leader John Thune promised Senate Democrats a vote in December on the ACA subsidies in order to end the shutdown.
Deal to end shutdown gains traction in US Senate as vote nears

Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said she thought it was “difficult” to trust Republicans in promising to hold a vote on the issue.
“I have a hard time trusting that, you know, I think that they’re going to have to have some kind of guarantees that there’s actually going to be some kind of a vote, some kind of a movement,” Hart said. “Because they’ve had a long, long time … So for them to promise things without a real, concrete way to cash in on that, I think that’s really difficult.”
State Sen. Zach Wahls, who is also running for U.S. Senate, released a statement Sunday, saying “Senate Democrats shouldn’t cave — when working families’ health care is on the line, you fight.” Wahls also brought up Senate Democratic leadership in his remarks. While he did not directly address the shutdown agreement, he said he would push back against Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats’ views on states like Iowa.
“Some of the toughest fights are about the future of our own party,” Wahls said during his speech Sunday. “I will never hesitate to challenge Democratic leaders like Chuck Schumer, who said that we should write off blue-collar voters in rural America. He was wrong, but we are the ones paying the price. And that is exactly why Iowa needs a senator who doesn’t work for Chuck Schumer, or for Donald Trump or the billionaires. We need a senator who works for us.”
State Rep. Josh Turek, also a U.S. Senate candidate, released a statement Sunday, saying “health care is worth fighting for.”
“As the cost of everything goes up, Washington Republicans have proven time and time again that they’d rather cut taxes for billionaires,” Turek said. “Without ACA subsidies, 125,000 Iowans will see their premiums double or triple. No one in the richest country on Earth should have to choose between health care and putting food on the table. No protection for health care, no deal.”
Turek said at the event that as a person born with spina bifida who uses a wheelchair, he understands the fight for health care in a “very deep and personal way.” He said he believes “health care is a human right,” and pointed to former U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, who was in attendance at the Sunday event, as a key inspiration for his work on the Americans with Disabilities Act.
“I will tell you, it is going to be something that’s going to be beautifully poetic, that the man that is going to get Sen. Harkin’s seat back is only there because of his work on the American with Disabilities Act, and once again be a champion for the people,” Turek said.
The three Democratic candidates are competing for the seat currently held by U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, who announced in September she will not run for reelection. U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson has launched a campaign to become the Republican candidate for the seat and gained endorsements from President Donald Trump and several GOP congressional leaders.
U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat who took office in 2020, was scheduled to speak at the event, but was not able to attend. The U.S. Senate was in session Sunday, ending the day with a tentative deal to pass appropriations bills and end the government shutdown.
Kelly said in video remarks played at the event that he remained in Washington, D.C. this weekend “trying to find solutions, but it’s not easy when one chamber of Congress isn’t even here,” including Iowa’s all-Republican House delegation.
“That’s not what our leaders should be doing when millions of Americans are being hit with unaffordable increases to their health care premiums,” Kelly said. “I’m frustrated too, but that’s something we can change. We saw it start to change this week in Virginia, in New Jersey and in California, by people speaking up, not checking out, by getting loud, not giving up.”
Hart said she was sad Kelly was not able to come to Iowa, but said she was happy he was “working hard in D.C. to put an end to this shutdown.”
“As you know, Sen. Kelly’s leadership is quite different from what we’ve been seeing from Iowa’s Republican representatives, who have been on an eight-week vacation while children and families are struggling to put food on their tables,” Hart said.
The shutdown will not end with the Senate vote, as the U.S. House must still return to approve the measure. One of the largest impacts of the continued shutdown is the disruption of food benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
While the court battle continues on whether the Trump administration must pay November SNAP benefits, U.S. Department of Agriculture officials wrote in a Saturday memo states should only fund 65% of food stamps. States that have already authorized full payments should “immediately undo” this action, the memo stated.
In addition to speaking on the impacts of cutting SNAP benefits, Democrats solicited donations for the Food Bank of Iowa at the event, raising more than $2,700. Hart also called for attendees to participate in the state Democratic Party’s day of action to support the Food Bank of Iowa later in November and thanked county Democratic parties for their advocacy and work to address food insecurity in their communities during the shutdown.
The state party was also soliciting support and funds for Democratic candidates running in 2026 Sunday. Hart joked there was not enough time to hear from all the Democratic candidates running for Iowa statewide and federal offices at the event, saying “isn’t that a great problem to have?” Videos were shown from congressional candidates, while Democratic gubernatorial candidates Rob Sand and Julie Stauch, alongside the U.S. Senate hopefuls, spoke to the crowd in person Sunday night.
Former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, another Arizona Democrat, also spoke at the event. Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt in 2011, spoke about her recovery journey and struggles with paralysis and aphasia. She said where “words, today I struggled to speak, but I’ve not lost my voice.”
“America needs all of us to speak out, even when you have to fight to find the words,” she said.

The bill would also reinstate all federal employees who were fired after the shutdown began, restoring their jobs with back pay, and prohibit any further layoffs until the temporary funding expires.As part of the agreement, three fiscal year 2026 funding bills will ride along with the package, including the appropriations bills for agriculture programs, veterans benefits, military construction and Congress.Divided DemocratsSeveral Senate Democrats left a lengthy closed-door meeting Sunday night upset that the deal does not include anything to address rising health care premiums, on which the party has staked the 40-day shutdown. Subsidies for those who buy insurance on the Affordable Care Act insurance marketplace expire at the end of this year.""So far as I'm concerned, health care isn't included, so I'll be a no,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.Sens. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Wisconsin’s Tammy Baldwin also issued statements following the caucus meeting declaring they would vote no. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also told reporters on his way out of the meeting that he’s opposed to the deal.Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey said on social media he would oppose it. ”I’ve been clear that we need real action to stop the devastating health care cost increases that are hurting millions of families,” he said.The Senate was expected to take a procedural vote to advance the deal Sunday night.Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., issued a statement expressing support for the agreement, highlighting that Senate Republicans have promised a vote on extending the health care subsidies.“This deal guarantees a vote to extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, which Republicans weren’t willing to do.

The bill would replenish the contingency money.The bill also fully funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and children’s nutrition programs, including subsidized school breakfast and lunch, and the availability of food during summer school breaks.Democrats on the Senate Committee on Appropriations say it included “key funding for SNAP and other critical nutrition programs as President Trump fights in court during the government shutdown to cut off benefits for 42 million Americans who rely on SNAP to feed their families,” according to a bill summary. The USDA directed states to begin releasing the November SNAP benefits onto recipients’ benefits debit cards after a Rhode Island federal district judge and circuit court ordered the Trump administration to do so last week. Trump appealed the order to the Supreme Court, which stayed the decision.

Free.,US Senate advances bill to end record-breaking government shutdown,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-advances-bill-end-record-breaking-government-shutdown,,"This report has been updated.WASHINGTON — Seven U.S. Senate Democrats and one independent joined Republicans on Sunday night in advancing legislation to reopen the government and temporarily keep it afloat until the end of January, after a record-breaking shutdown that began Oct. 1.Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Tim Kaine of Virginia, and Catherine Cortez Masto and Jackie Rosen of Nevada voted with most of the GOP to advance the stopgap measure through a 60-40 procedural vote. Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, also voted in support.  Fetterman, King and Cortez Masto had already voted with Republicans on the previous 14 votes to reopen the government. Until Sunday, Republicans who control the chamber did not have the 60 votes needed to clear the filibuster threshold.GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has consistently voted against the temporary funding measure, again cast a “no” vote.The deal would also unlock full-year funding for a vital food aid program that serves 42 million Americans and bring back federal workers fired by President Donald Trump when the government was closed.It does not include language addressing skyrocketing premiums for those enrolled in individual health insurance plans in the Affordable Care Act marketplace, a major sticking point for Democrats. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said late Sunday on the Senate floor that he commits to holding a separate vote on health insurance subsidies no later than the second week of December.

In a press conference following the vote, Rosen said Democrats have “an opportunity also to put Republicans on the record on the ACA.”“Are they committed to doing this? Are they committed leaders who said, ‘You can come to the table on health care once the government was open’? And now he must follow through. If Republicans want to join us in lowering costs for working families, they have the perfect opportunity to show the American public,” Rosen said.New text of a temporary stopgap funding deal released Sunday night proposes to keep the government open until Jan. 30.

It’s that simple.
Every investigation, every daily story, every reporter’s salary is made possible by supporters like you.

We don’t have corporate owners and we refuse to put our journalism behind a paywall because all Vermonters deserve access to the facts. That commitment only works if those who can give, do so generously.

Outside the regional Arapahoe County airport where Key Lime Air is headquartered, a few dozen picketers who began gathering just after noon held signs, chanted anti-ICE slogans and heard music from “protest marching band” Notes of Dissent. The demonstration drew shouts and honks of support from passing cars.
“This is my community, and we don’t condone what’s happening, the cruelty that’s taking place,” Alejandra Correa-Weir, a Centennial resident and protest organizer, said in an interview. “Key Lime is taking a profit out of the cruelty and harm that is being done to the immigrant community.”

Since mid-September, two of the airline’s planes have frequently flown routes to and from ICE detention hubs in Texas, Louisiana and elsewhere, according to a Newsline analysis of publicly available flight tracking data. That included at least nine flights in and out of Lake City, Florida — a 15-minute drive from the Everglades detention center that Republicans have branded “Alligator Alcatraz.”
Key Lime’s ICE flights involve the transportation of dozens of detainees who are loaded on and off planes in shackles, with their personal belongings apparently collected in white trash bags, according to scenes witnessed by Newsline reporters. Advocates say ICE’s pattern of moving people across the country in these “shuffle flights” can harm detainees’ mental health, family connections and access to legal services.

“Key Lime Air respects the right of all individuals to peacefully protest and share their opinions,” Cliff Honeycutt, the company’s CEO, wrote in a text message. “As a matter of policy, we are unable to discuss our charter operations. Our focus remains on conducting ALL Key Lime Air flights in accordance with the highest federally mandated safety standards.”
Key Lime, which also operates passenger flights through its subsidiary Denver Air Connection, is part of a growing network of operators participating in immigration enforcement, especially flights between ICE detention centers throughout the country.
The 83 ICE flights operated by Key Lime in September, as counted by the nonprofit Human Rights First, were among the record-high 969 domestic immigration enforcement flights compiled in its monthly ICE Flight Monitor report.
“The increase in domestic shuffle flights under the second Trump administration raises serious concerns as individuals are frequently moved far from their families and legal representation, often isolated in facilities with harsh conditions,” the report’s authors wrote.
In his second term, President Donald Trump has pledged to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” aiming to remove all of the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country without permanent legal status, regardless of how long they have been in the country, the legal status of their family members or whether they have criminal records.
Polls have shown that the number of Americans who approve of Trump’s handling of immigration issues has declined in 2025, amid an aggressive expansion of ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection operations in cities including Los Angeles and Chicago. Correa-Weir said the supportive shouts and honks from cars passing Sunday’s protest were a sign that growing numbers of people in communities like Centennial are “willing to stand up to what’s happening.”
“It speaks to the amount of people that are not okay with what’s happening to our immigrant community,” said Correa-Weir. “The majority of people … are with us, and they don’t want this happening at all.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Maine is going to press ahead this week with its plan to deliver full food assistance benefits for November, despite the Trump administration’s changing guidance on the program that helps feed 170,000 low income people in the state.
Late Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court paused a lower court order for the U.S. Department of Agriculture to release full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
Before the high court weighed in, Gov. Janet Mills had already announced that the Maine Department of Health and Human Services would issue full November SNAP benefits to eligible households, in accordance with guidance released by the USDA before the pause.
According to the governor, DHHS then directed the state’s SNAP distribution vendor to issue full benefits on Monday, Nov. 10. 
But over the weekend, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service changed course, issuing a memo ordering states that already authorized full SNAP payments to return a portion and fund 65% of the month’s benefits.
“The Trump administration pledged full benefits, and Maine took swift action to deliver them accordingly,” said Mills in a statement Sunday. 
“That the President would then petition the highest court to deny food to hungry families and seniors is beyond belief and is callous and cruel,” she continued. “The President should not be directing states to take food out of the mouths of the hungry. He should be directing Republicans in Congress to end this needless shutdown by extending health care tax credits and reopening the government.”
The statement from the governor’s office said the Mills administration expects full benefits to be issued Monday, despite the latest SNAP guidance from the USDA, which it notes “is the sixth such conflicting change to its guidance over the past month.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders directed a second round of funds to Arkansas food banks on Saturday as drama continued over whether federal food assistance would be distributed.
On Oct. 31, the governor announced she was splitting $500,000 among six food banks and held open the option of distributing more money each week as the federal shutdown drags on.
Federal food assistance benefits have been delayed as the Trump administration fights federal court orders mandating that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program be fully funded.
On Friday, several states began filling SNAP recipients’ electronic accounts with November’s benefits. But the Supreme Court granted a delay in enforcing a lower court order, and Saturday the U.S. Department of Agriculture ordered states that paid full benefits to “undo” the action.
About 42 million Americans receive federal food aid, among them roughly 240,000 Arkansans.
Sanders said in a press release Saturday that the latest $500,000 will be distributed Monday to the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance, which will then distribute the funds to the six Feeding America member food banks around the state, serving the highest SNAP recipient regions first.
The funds come from the state’s Restricted Reserve account, which the chairs of the Arkansas Legislative Council approved on an emergency basis.
The food banks that will receive portions of the the funds are:

Northwest Arkansas Food Bank at Springdale
Food Bank of North Central Arkansas at Norfolk
Food Bank of Northeast Arkansas at Jonesboro
River Valley Regional Food Bank at Fort Smith
Arkansas Foodbank at Little Rock

Please advise the appropriate FNS Regional Office representative of steps taken to correct any actions taken that do not comply with this memorandum.”President Donald Trump and top administration officials have said they cannot pay full SNAP benefits during the government shutdown that began Oct. 1 and instead, under court orders, are using a contingency fund to make partial payments.Shutdown chaos surrounds SNAPSaturday’s guidance from Patrick A. Penn, the department’s deputy under secretary for food, nutrition and consumer services, marked the latest turnaround in a chaotic few days for the agency, states that administer SNAP and the millions of Americans who depend on it to afford food.Penn wrote that, in light of the Supreme Court’s order pausing lower court rulings that USDA must pay full November benefits, the administration was returning to its position that SNAP benefits should be funded at 65%. States — including Wisconsin and Kansas — that issued full benefits did so under a Friday memo, also signed by Penn, that said states should authorize full payments for SNAP, consistent with a Thursday ruling in federal court.Kansas gov expresses dismayKansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, in a late Friday statement expressed disappointment with the administration’s appeal to the Supreme Court and noted the state had authorized full payments earlier in the day for all eligible Kansans.“These Kansans, most of them children, seniors or people with disabilities, were struggling to put food on their plates,” she said. “Why the President would petition the highest court to deny food to hungry children is beyond me. It does nothing to advance his political agenda. It does not hurt his perceived enemies. It only hurts our most vulnerable and our reputation around the globe.”The earlier order, from U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. in Rhode Island, told the department to use sources outside the contingency fund to make full November payments by Friday. The order was appealed to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.But Justice Kentanji Brown Jackson, acting on behalf of the high court, granted the administration's request for an emergency stay on Friday night, speeding up the process for what Jackson said would then be an “expeditious” decision by the appeals court but also changing things yet again.No longer, for the moment, required by a court order to pay full November benefits, the administration instructed states in the Saturday memo to have the vendors that process payments to the electronic benefit transfer cards withhold part of the month's allotment.“States must not transmit full benefit issuance files to EBT processors,” Penn wrote. “Instead, States must continue to process and load the partial issuance files that reflect the 35 percent reduction of maximum allotments detailed in the November 5 guidance.”Kansas Reflector Editor in Chief Sherman Smith contributed to this report.",,,,2025-11-09 12:56:47.657597

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Five tribes in South Dakota want their congressional delegation to help restore funding for a research project led in part by a South Dakota genetics lab.
The back-and-forth that’s played out over the past few weeks for the Data for Indigenous Implementations, Interventions, and Innovations Tribal Data Repository project is the latest twist in a funding tale that’s stretched across two presidential administrations and speaks to deep-seeded distrust — and attempts to address it — of the scientific community by Native American leaders.
At the center of those conversations is the Native BioData Consortium, a nonprofit science organization and laboratory based in Eagle Butte, on the Cheyenne River Reservation. It’s the data host and one of the lead agencies in the repository project, whose National Institutes of Health funding was cut short in March, alongside a host of other research projects related to COVID-19. 
Leaders from the Oglala, Cheyenne River, Rosebud, Lower Brule and Standing Rock Sioux tribes in South Dakota each sent letters to U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson’s office urging him to help reinstate funding for the repository.
The project was “collateral damage in a blanket cut to all COVID-19 research,” the letters say, but its goals and value were further-reaching.
The Eagle Butte lab got the largest share of the project’s $7 million in research funding, which was split among multiple teams scattered around the U.S. The lab’s team only used about a third of its approximately $3 million share before the funding was revoked this spring.
The repository project, the letters say, “is an innovative and very needed attempt to protect Tribal communities now and in all future pandemics, and also to create a bridge of diplomatic relationships with Tribes over biomedical, public health, environmental research data and beyond.” 
The tribes’ letters were sent in tandem with a similar letter from the project’s leaders.
Tribal data repository concept
One of those leaders, Joseph Yracheta, is a co-founder and executive director of the Native BioData Consortium. His lab performs genetic testing and catalogs genetic data for tribal nations, leads genetics bootcamps for Native American students each year, and hopes to one day open a large-scale genetics facility and data center on Cheyenne River tribal land.
It’s also the data archive for the multi-state, multi-partner tribal data repository project. That project’s goals include the creation of a secure, Indigenous-led and centrally located database of tribal health and genetic information that would afford tribes the ability to control the flow and terms of use for their citizens’ data in scientific research.

Yracheta, who lives in Eagle Butte, is of P’urhépecha and Rarámurì descent, tribes located in areas now part of Mexico. His wife and children are members of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.
In addition to Yracheta, the project’s leadership team comes from the University of California-Santa Cruz, Arizona State University, the University of Wisconsin, the University of Washington and Ohio State University.
The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected tribal communities, but genetic data collection from tribal areas was spotty. 
Yracheta told South Dakota Searchlight that reticence to share information was in part grounded in a wariness by tribal governments to share genetic data without assurances that it wouldn’t be replicated and reused for non-COVID research without their consent.
A dispute between the Havasupai Tribe in Arizona and the Arizona Board of Regents, Yracheta said, is one of the most often-cited reasons for that reticence. In the mid-1990s, the tribe gave DNA samples to Arizona State University researchers for a study on diabetes. In 2003, a member of the tribe attending the school learned the DNA samples had been used to study things like schizophrenia, inbreeding and migration theories, which the tribe hadn’t consented to. The tribe sued, and was eventually awarded $700,000.
The data repository work, Yracheta said, would create a trusted place for tribes to share their data without fear of it being used in ways tribal members wouldn’t want.
“All we want to do is be a safe harbor,” Yracheta said.
Paper outlines strategies for improved relations
According to a recently published research letter in the journal Nature, penned by the tribal data repository project’s leaders, the scientific community has largely embraced a framework for DNA data that expects it to be free, open, harmonized and easily replicable for research purposes. 
Tribes, however, see problems with wholesale, unrestricted availability of DNA data. There are privacy concerns about mandated open data policies and concerns over the unrestricted use of data, the paper says. It cites the practice of private companies giving estimates of a person’s Native American ancestry that “undermine Tribal determinations of citizenship and override legally assured self-governance.”
“Decades of extractive and unethical practices have left Indigenous Peoples (distinct societies of Indigenous people) hesitant to engage with biomedical researchers despite remaining interested in biomedical advances,” the paper says.
There are also concerns that tribal genetic data would be used in the development of treatments that benefit primarily non-Native populations or generate profit the tribes wouldn’t see. 
The solution, the paper posits, is a framework for data sharing that creates a common access point for data, but treats tribal nations as sovereign entities and requires consultation and consent for data use.
The database framework would be useful for COVID-19 research, the paper says, but could serve as a basis for a wide range of genetic data research projects.
Battle for funds
The repository’s federal funding didn’t come easy, Yracheta said, and was threatened before President Donald Trump’s administration deprioritized COVID-related research.
The money came through a competitive bidding process in a National Institutes of Health initiative meant to build a database of basic genetic information from Native Americans for use in COVID-19 research.
‘They saw the potential’: SDSU program boosts Native American success

The long application process included sparring with the NIH over the data ownership and access policies that would be attached to the finished product. The researchers were ultimately awarded $9 million in December of 2023 to create the repository and its associated protocols, including $2 million that went to Stanford University to serve as an administrator.
The repository work itself began in January of 2024, but Yracheta said the disputes with NIH leadership continued, in part over who would own the data and dictate its use. Within a few months of the funding announcement, the NIH shortened the project’s research timeline by a year and asked the team to wrap up by December 2025. 
Since then, the tribal data repository team has set up the storage and access system into which biological information would flow. Among the work products are 82 contract templates and related documents tribes can use when approached for genetic data, and educational materials on their data sharing options through the secure repository system. 
The team built model servers in Eagle Butte and Wisconsin and connected them to make sure there’s enough physical storage space to keep data safely out of the cloud, and developed a user interface to connect researchers with the contracts they’d need to sign with tribes to secure access to that data.
The next steps, Yracheta said, are to present the repository concept to tribes, convince leaders it’s a trustworthy place to share their information for the good of their own people and science as a whole, and to begin to fill it with data.
“We took the money and built the box, but we didn’t get to the important part, which was building those relationships,” Yracheta said. 
In June, the group presented its materials to the NIH, but was told no further funding would be available, Yracheta said, as COVID-19 related research had largely ceased.
Plea for help to Rep. Johnson, response from Sen. Rounds
The letters to Rep. Johnson, sent a little over a week ago, asked his office to work for the funding’s reinstatement. They suggested that funding a database project would serve South Dakotans as the federal government works to encourage the expansion of data centers and its residents’ expertise in database design and management. 
A spokeswoman for Johnson’s office, Kristen Blakely, told South Dakota Searchlight via email that the office is “looking into it and in contact with NIH to see why the grant was canceled.”
This week, Yracheta said, the team got some encouraging communication from the office of Sen. Mike Rounds, whose staff sent emails seeking more information about the history of the project’s funding.
Yracheta said the team hadn’t garnered any encouragement in its communications with South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune. Neither senator got the letter sent to Johnson’s office. When asked about the letter by South Dakota Searchlight, Rounds spokeswoman Arden Koenecke said the senator had spoken about the repository in general terms with leaders of the Great Plains Tribal Leaders’ Health Board, but “didn’t get into specifics on cuts or locations.”
Rounds would be open to discussions on the issue, Koenecke said. Yracheta said the Rounds team contacted him this week.
Thune’s office did not respond to questions about the letter.

After a quarter century on the bench, Washington Supreme Court Justice Mary Yu is ready to slow down — to “sip coffee rather than gulp it,” as she puts it. The longtime jurist will retire at the end of this year, closing a trailblazing career.
From the King County Superior Court to the state’s highest bench, Yu said she found that justice often emerges from respectful clashes of perspective. “This is an adversarial process — you have to fight for how you think the law ought to be,” she told host Austin Jenkins in an “Inside Olympia“ interview on TVW. “When we differ, we are at our best.”
After 14 years on the King County Superior Court, Yu was appointed to the Washington Supreme Court by Gov. Jay Inslee in May 2014, becoming its first Asian American, Latina and openly gay justice. She went on to win elections in November 2014, 2016 and 2022, serving 12 years on the high court and 25 years on the bench overall.
Born on Chicago’s South Side to a Chinese father and a Mexican mother, Yu was the first in her family to attend college. Her path to law began at the Archdiocese of Chicago, where she joined the new Office of Peace and Justice as a secretary and later became its director. The work, focused on systemic social justice, shaped her understanding of inequality and change. “The law can bring about social change,” she said. “It creates, frankly, a cause of action if you’re discriminated against — a way to make justice real.”
Her legal outlook was further shaped by then–King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng, who hired her as his deputy chief of staff and later encouraged her sense of purpose in public service. Yu described Maleng as “the most ethical prosecutor one could ever know,” a mentor who taught her that “justice isn’t about convictions — it’s about doing what’s right.”
Yu carried that conviction from the courtroom to the Supreme Court. She pushes back against claims that the justices share a single ideological view. 
“I think we are very different in our views on a host of issues and how we approach a variety of topics, but we’re not ideologues, and that might be what some people are missing, and that, frankly, is a good thing.” she said. “Regardless of where we might be politically, personally, I can tell you that we are all over the place in that room. Those who think otherwise aren’t reading the opinions.”
Several cases stayed with her. She pointed to the case of Tarra Simmons — in which the court ruled that a past felony shouldn’t automatically bar someone from becoming a lawyer — as her favorite decision. “We said rehabilitation is real and possible,” Yu said. “There is hope for everybody who’s made a mistake.” Simmons is now a state legislator.
She also cited State v. Sum, which held that race must be considered when evaluating police stops, as an example of the court adapting to contemporary realities.
Earlier in her career, Yu became known for performing more than 1,000 same-sex adoptions and officiating one of Washington’s first same-sex marriages at the stroke of midnight when it became legal in 2012. Late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel included Yu in a 2021 segment about what he called “Perfectly Named People,” asking her whether when she officiates weddings, does she say, “I Mary Yu, marry you.” 
As she looks to retirement, Yu said she plans to volunteer, mentor young lawyers and continue “believing in the goodness of others.”
“Maybe my legacy,” she said, “is simply that I believed in the next generation.”

For Michiganders in rural communities, the realities of this disease are even more difficult because of distance, access, and limited resources.
A study from Washington State University found that rural residents often travel as much as 100 miles to see a neurologist qualified to diagnose Alzheimer’s or dementia. For families already balancing work, caregiving, and travel, these miles can mean delayed diagnoses and missed opportunities for care. As the nation faces a growing shortage of neurologists and a growing number of Alzheimer’s cases, these challenges are likely to intensify.
The need is urgent. Today, more than seven million Americans over the age of 65 are living with Alzheimer’s disease, and that number is rising quickly. Each day, an estimated 3,000 people advance beyond the stage when early treatment could help slow progression. For rural families, every mile and every month matter.
Today, care often involves lots of travel for PET scans, even spinal taps, after symptoms present – for too many patients, diagnosis comes too late. Patients too often have progressed past the window of early intervention.
Fortunately, science is opening new doors. Recent breakthroughs have led to FDA-approved therapies and detection tools for early-stages of the disease. This science could one day bring us to a reality where we identify Alzheimer’s via blood test, well before symptoms start, and then utilize a treatment that halts the disease in its tracks. Scientific advances have the potential to reduce disparities between rural and urban patients – if families can access them. And it’s a big “if.”
Right now, federal policies are creating obstacles. Medicare limits access to FDA-approved treatments through outdated “Coverage with Evidence Development” policies requiring participation in a special program called a registry. Absent action from Congress, Medicare won’t cover screening tools unless they have been recommended for coverage by the U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force – a review process that can take up to a decade or more. For rural patients, who are less likely to live near major health centers or clinical trials, these delays place needed care even further out of reach.
It doesn’t have to be this way. By modernizing coverage policies, ensuring timely access to diagnostic tests, and expanding availability of new treatments, policymakers can help families in every community benefit from today’s scientific progress.
In Michigan, rural communities form the heart of the state. Rural families deserve the same opportunity for timely diagnosis and treatment as those in urban centers. The National Association of Rural Health Clinics urges Congress and the administration to act now because when it comes to Alzheimer’s, every day of progress brings hope to millions of families, caregivers included.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/caregiver-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-09 11:17:09.813270
