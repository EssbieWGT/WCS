(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Attorneys for Tina Peters this week asked the Colorado Court of Appeals to order that the former Mesa County clerk “must be released from custody forthwith” following the signing of a pardon document by President Donald Trump earlier this month.
Trump does not have the power to pardon Peters, who was convicted in state court and is now serving a nine-year sentence in state prison for her role in a breach of her office’s election systems, part of an attempt to find evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. But her attorneys pursued a presidential pardon anyway, expressing hope that the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court will rewrite the centuries-old legal doctrine of dual sovereignty in criminal proceedings.
Peters’ motion, the latest in a series of attempts by her attorneys and allies in the election conspiracy theory movement to force her release from state custody, was filed on Dec. 23 in her pending case before Colorado’s second-highest court, where she has appealed her August 2024 conviction, arguing that her imprisonment violates her First Amendment right of free speech. Peters has separately petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, while Trump’s Department of Justice has formally requested her transfer to federal custody, a request the state has rejected.

The new filing asks the Colorado Court of Appeals to “enter an order indicating that it lost jurisdiction and finding that … the Pardon which was issued on Dec. 5, 2025, was effective and vitiated the convictions against Tina Peters in the State of Colorado.”
The motion, signed by Peters attorneys Peter Ticktin and John Case, is littered with debunked claims casting doubt on the legitimacy of what it calls the “most controversial Presidential Election in history.” Peters, a prominent election denier, was convicted by a Mesa County jury on multiple felony counts in connection with the breach of her office’s secure elections equipment during a 2021 software update.
Claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent or compromised have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, the courts and Trump’s own campaign and administration officials.
Trump himself has repeatedly called on Gov. Jared Polis to “free” Peters, and has threatened “harsh measures” if she isn’t released. Democrats characterized the Trump administration’s move last week to dismantle Boulder’s National Center for Atmospheric Research as retaliation for Peters’ ongoing incarceration.
A White House official appeared to acknowledge a retaliatory motive for that announcement in comments to The New York Times, which reported that the unnamed official said “Colorado constituents would be better served if Gov. Polis wanted to work with the president.” Days later, the administration denied two disaster declaration requests that would have opened up federal funding to support wildfire and flood recovery in the state.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser has said Trump’s attempt to pardon Peters of state crimes violates “one of the most basic principles of our constitution.” Case said earlier this month that he had visited La Vista Correctional Facility following the pardon to seek Peters’ release, but was told by a Colorado Department of Corrections official that the pardon does not affect her state conviction. The appeals court filing includes a copy of a Dec. 17 email to Case from a state attorney representing the CDOC, who reiterated that stance.
“The President does not have the authority to pardon an individual convicted of state crimes under state law, such as Ms. Peters,” wrote Nicole Gellar of the attorney general’s office. “Accordingly, the CDOC has a duty to continue to incarcerate her for the duration of her state sentence.”

Olson, a Republican, served as the state’s attorney general from 1972 to 1980 before defeating Democratic incumbent Art Link in the 1980 election. 
Olson’s win over Link interrupted a 20-year run of Democratic governors in North Dakota. 
Former North Dakota Gov. Allen Olson
“Governor Olson served North Dakota with dignity and a steady hand as our state’s top law enforcement officer and chief executive,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a news release
As governor, Olson worked against drunken driving, supported the Garrison Diversion program to use Missouri River water for irrigation and other uses and saw the creation of the Department of Human Services. 
Olson’s bid for reelection was hindered by a report from the Grand Forks Herald in the days leading up to the general election that Olson had not filed his taxes for the previous year. 
He was defeated by George “Bud” Sinner, the last Democrat to hold the office.
Mike Jacobs, who had taken over as editor of the Grand Forks Herald a few months before the tip came in about Olson’s taxes, said Olson never held a grudge about the story. 
“We ended up being friends,” Jacobs said Friday, recalling that Olson was a regular visitor back to Grand Forks for homecoming events at the University of North Dakota. 
Jacobs, in a 2018 column, wrote that Olson “took the loss in good grace; in our many encounters since the loss, he’s never asked me about the tip, and I’ve never told.”

Born in Rolla and raised on a farm near Sarles, Olson earned his undergraduate and law degrees from UND. He served in the U.S. Army as a lawyer. He returned to North Dakota in 1967 and served as assistant director of the Legislative Research Committee (now Legislative Council) from 1967 to 1969, directing the state’s first study of strip mining, soil banks and land reclamation, according to the State Historical Society. 
Olson was elected attorney general in 1972 again in 1976. 
Bob Wefald succeeded Olson as attorney general, winning the seat in 1980 when Olson was elected governor. The two campaigned together. 
Wefald said Friday he had known Olson since 1959, when they had participated in Boys State together. 
“He was a great governor, a good man, a decent man, very proud that he was my friend for all these years,” Wefald said. 
Gerald VandeWalle, a former North Dakota Supreme Court chief justice, worked under Olson in the Attorney General’s Office. 
VandeWalle recalled Friday that Olson took on the regulation of gambling in North Dakota, leading to the charitable gambling rules that the state operates under today. 
“He took a lot of heat to begin with,” VandeWalle said, but helped create gambling regulations that were enforceable. 
After serving as governor, Olson returned to private law practice and relocated to Minnesota, where he became co-owner of a die-casting company in New Hope in 1987. Olson also served as president and CEO of the Independent Community Bankers of Minnesota and was appointed by President George W. Bush to the International Joint Commission, which deals with issues related to waterways shared by the United States and Canada. 
Funeral arrangements are pending.

Suing the state over discomfort caused by an administrative requirement signals a troubling disconnect between public employees and the democratic system funded by taxpayers.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Dan Jones: Whatever happened to public service?.","This commentary is by Dan Jones, of Montpelier. He is an activist working for local resilience.  



The Vermont State Employees Association has sued the State of Vermont to overturn the administration’s requirement that employees return to working in state offices, arguing that such a return would cause discomfort to some workers. The state, while acknowledging and accommodating special needs requests, maintains that many state services are best delivered by employees working in person.
I admit that I urged such a decision from the governor months ago. I hoped that bringing workers back into their offices would help restore commercial life to cities like Montpelier, which were hollowed out by the Covid-era work-from-home exodus. But the issue is deeper than downtown foot traffic. At stake is a more fundamental question: what does it mean to work in public service, and what obligations come with that choice?

READ MORE

I have heard of many state employees who, taking advantage of remote work, have moved as far away as North Carolina or Florida. Raising this concern angers friends who work for the state. They argue that if the work is getting done, why should it matter where they live? To question this is often treated as heartless, as an attack on work-life balance or an insistence on unnecessary hardship.
But this reaction reflects a broader loss of a once-common civic understanding. Public service was long understood as a commitment to serve one’s fellow citizens, rooted in shared place and shared fate. Public employees accepted certain sacrifices in pay or comfort in exchange for meaningful work, stability, and the knowledge that they were contributing to the common good. In that sense, public service resembled other civic callings, including public safety work, where sacrifice was part of the job.
Once upon a time, public sector jobs paid less than private sector work but offered dignity, purpose, and security in return. Today, government is increasingly viewed as just another corporate entity, competing for labor and negotiating benefits, while belief in public service itself is dismissed as naïve. Civic obligation is replaced by transactional logic.
When public employees live far from the communities they serve, the people who rely on their work become abstractions. Taxpayers are reduced to “customers.” Neighbors and fellow Vermonters disappear from view. When the people you know, care about, and interact with daily are not the people you serve, commitment inevitably erodes.
Government bureaucracy has always frustrated citizens, but the current shift is more troubling. As government is framed as a service industry, workers are cast primarily as employees to be protected, while citizens are asked to pay ever-higher taxes for services that feel increasingly remote. The result is a growing sense that government no longer exists for the public good but as a costly, impersonal system delivering diminishing returns.
This moment demands something better. As our national politics grow more unstable and economic insecurity deepens for a majority of Americans, we will rely more heavily on state and local governments for essential support. These pressures will require difficult decisions, shared sacrifice, and renewed civic commitment. That burden cannot fall on taxpayers alone.
Public service cannot survive if government is treated either as an abusive employer or as a mere transactional service provider. Democratic strength depends on a shared sense of responsibility, where individual welfare is inseparable from collective welfare. If public employees and the institutions they serve lose that understanding, we risk hollowing out our capacity to respond humanely and effectively to hard times ahead.
Suing the state over discomfort caused by an administrative requirement signals a troubling disconnect between public employees and the democratic system funded by taxpayers. As costs rise and patience wears thin, appreciation for necessary public work will only endure if that work is visibly rooted in service, commitment, and shared community.
Whatever happened to the pride, value, and sense of purpose that were once understood as core benefits of working in service to the public good?

(Photo courtesy of WSDOT)About 20 miles of U.S. 2 are set to reopen Monday on the east side of the Cascades, allowing access to the Stevens Pass ski resort, after devastating flooding and debris slides destroyed parts of the highway this month.
U.S. 2, a major east-west crossing in Washington over the Cascades, has been closed for two weeks along a nearly 50-mile stretch between Skykomish and Leavenworth. Parts of the roadway collapsed entirely.
Fully reopening the highway “is going to take time, a long time, and we’re still evaluating the full extent of the damage,” Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a press conference Friday. 
The partial reopening will be at 6 a.m. Monday between Coles Corner and Stevens Pass, or mileposts 85 and 64, Ferguson said. A pilot car will shepherd drivers for the final stretch to the pass in one lane between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. This system is expected to last at least a month. 
The west side of U.S. 2 remains closed at Skykomish, blocking access to Stevens Pass from that direction. Ferguson plans to be in Skykomish on Tuesday to survey the damage there and give an update on repairs in that area, hopefully with a timeline for reopening.
“We all understand how critical reopening Highway 2 is for residents of our cities and communities, for our economy, for the ski resort, for travel across our state,” Ferguson said. “We’re very, very mindful of that, and the team is working extremely hard to get it opened as quickly as possible.”
At milepost 54 near Skykomish, “many, many feet of debris” have had to be removed from a bridge before it can be inspected, state Transportation Secretary Julie Meredith said.
Ten days ago, Ferguson said parts of U.S. 2 could remain closed for months. On Friday, he said some repairs will have to wait for snow to clear in the Cascades.
“Repairs like this, as you might imagine, are heavily dependent on the weather, and the weather this time of year, obviously, is not ideal,” Ferguson said. 
There’s no estimate for the cost of the damage to the highway.
The ski resort, owned by Vail Resorts, has drawn frustration from skiers and snowboarders over not offering refunds despite the delayed opening. 
Skykomish Mayor Henry Sladek called Friday’s announcement “a great first step.” Leavenworth Mayor Carl Florea said, “We appreciate the potential for this first step toward that restoration.”

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
“We know it’s going to be a long time coming,” Florea added.
Across the state, about eight sections of highway remain closed due to the flooding, Meredith said.
Ferguson last week proposed roughly $2 billion for preserving and maintaining the state’s bridges and roads.

This story by Alex Ebrahimi was first published in the Valley News on Dec. 25, 2025.
WOODSTOCK — The Woodstock Selectboard and Village Board of Trustees voted this week to update the contract of Municipal Manager Eric Duffy, though the details have not been publicly disclosed.
The vote in support of Duffy, who began his tenure in February 2023, came after discussions between the boards “about the significant progress made during his tenure as well as an outpouring of support from staff and the community,” a Woodstock news release stated. “I was very grateful for the boards’ willingness to continue to work with me,” Duffy said. “And there’s strong support behind me.”
The updated terms of Duffy’s contract, which was signed in 2022 for an indefinite period of time with an annual salary of $130,000 per year, have not yet been released. 
Ray Bourgeois, chairperson of the Woodstock Selectboard, and Seton McIlroy, chairperson of the Village Board of Trustees, said they are unable to discuss the details of the updated terms because the contract still is being reviewed by attorneys.“July 1st is when changes (in Duffy’s contract) we discussed go into effect,” Bourgeois said. “I don’t feel comfortable discussing the contract (at this time) until we have it back from the attorneys.” 
According to McIlroy, Duffy had received cost-of-living adjustments every year since starting in his role as municipal manager.  “We have it written in his contract that he can actually receive a higher COLA than everybody else, but he has never taken a higher COLA than the rest of the team,” said McIlroy.  Additionally, in the past two years, Duffy received a $10,000 dollar bonus. 
Both McIlroy and Bourgeois said the updated contract is a reflection of the confidence the elected officials have in Duffy’s leadership. 
During his time as Woodstock Municipal Manager, Duffy has helped lead the recovery from flooding in July 2023, including overseeing the town’s purchase of a private water system that serves much of the town. Duffy, who prior to serving in Woodstock worked as the town accountant in Stoneham, Mass., said there are more initiatives on the horizon. 
“We have a wastewater plant renovation that’s gonna be voted on a town meeting in March,” Duffy said. “So that’s a $30 million-plus project that we’re working on. It’s going to allow us to kind of continue to develop Woodstock a little more.” 
Stability was another consideration in updating Duffy’s contract, McIlroy said. “If we can maintain that stability and that continuity for the community so they know what’s coming in the next couple years, I think that’s really important,” she said. 
The Valley News reported earlier this month that Duffy had been a finalist for both city manager of Montpelier and town manager in Winchester, Mass. Shortly before the update in his contract on Monday, Duffy withdrew from consideration for both positions. 
“He told us he was applying,” Bourgeois said. “There’s nothing in his contract that says he cannot apply for other positions.”
“I was surprised but not surprised,” Bourgeois said of Duffy interviewing for other jobs. “There’s a lot of bad publicity going around about him.”
Duffy is currently being sued by former Woodstock Police Chief Joe Swanson after Duffy and the Village Board of Trustees demoted him. The demotion was overturned by a judge, who said the town failed to follow the proper legal process to remove a police chief from his post.
Swanson was put on leave after the judges ruling and Duffy and officials now must decide how to proceed. Duffy, the Woodstock Selectboard and the Village Trustees all declined this week to discuss the Swanson situation. 
McIlroy said she was “proud” that the boards wanted him to stay. “We certainly did not want him to leave,” she said. Duffy credited the “overwhelming support” from the community and staff for his decision to remain Municipal Manager. 
“I saw someone over the weekend and they said me staying was the best Christmas gift they could get,” Duffy said.

Those struggles can also lead to higher dropout rates and lower grades, said Josh Anderson of FutureEd, an education think tank. It’s like a stone dropping in a pond, with the impact rippling outward. 
But wraparound services, such as washers and dryers and food pantries, can directly counteract these negative effects, research shows. 
About 25 million students, or more than half of public school students in the country, were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch during the 2022-23 school year. Wraparound services are also essential in a district like Jackson Public Schools, where about a third of students live in poverty.
Jackson Public Schools leaders say the district works hard to eliminate barriers to education through wraparound services especially at their four “community schools.”
It’s a long-standing, mutually-beneficial model where communities pour into their schools to create students who will go on to support their communities. Jackson’s community schools aim to support the whole student, inside and out of the classroom.
“We preach it all day long: What’s your plus?” said Stacey Webb, principal of Lanier Junior Senior High School. “It’s a diploma, plus. It’s not just about academics, but also providing things to help scholars be successful.”

But the services don’t just affect the students. Caring for the child includes caring for their families, Webb said. The services impact parents, too, boosting engagement and cementing schools as the anchors of their communities. 
“A helpful way to think about this is the hours we have,” Anderson said. “If you add them up over 18 or 20 years, we’re spending less than 20% of those hours in a school building and a lot more of our hours with our families and in our neighborhoods. 
“Schools are vital, and we need them to be better and better. But if we want kids to be ready to learn in school, supporting the family makes a tremendous difference.”
‘Just showing we care’
Laundry services operate on a need-to-know basis at Lanier. 
Students put their clothes in a laundry bag and hand it to a teacher, and by the end of the day, their clothes are washed, dried, folded and ready to go home with them — no questions asked. 
Parents in need, too, can wash their clothes at the school on weekends. 
“If the only thing keeping you from coming to school, we’re going to take care of that for you,” Webb said. “I tell my scholars all the time, we’re going to break the cycle some of them are in.”
The home appliance company Whirlpool started donating washer and dryers to schools across the country in 2015, making it easier for students to have access to clean clothes. At the end of the 2022-2023 school year, nearly 61% of students at participating schools considered at risk for chronic absenteeism were no longer at risk, according to the company. 

Laundry services are just one of the ways educators at Lanier care for their students. The school also operates a clothes closet — stocked with prom dresses, professional clothes for jobs interviews, school uniforms and casual attire — a food pantry and health clinic.
The clinic, staffed by nurse practitioners and nurses, opened a decade ago through a partnership with University of Mississippi Medical Center. 
Students can receive primary and preventive care of the clinic — services like mental health and physical assessments, prenatal care and asthma management — instead of missing class to go to a doctor’s office. 
Webb said all of these services the school provides signals to the students that their teachers and principals care about them, which she’s seen reflected in student grades and attendance.
“I believe it’s about the relationship, just showing we care about you as a person,” she said. “I tell my staff and students that if you can develop a relationship with someone, you can do anything to help them.”
Serving the whole family
This past school year, more than a quarter of K-12 students were considered chronically absent statewide, according to data from the Mississippi Department of Education. That’s more than double the rate during the 2018-19 school year. 
More than a third of JPS students are chronically absent. 
The more needs students can have addressed at school, the more likely they are to stay in class, Johnson Elementary Principal Guyniesha Johnson said. 
“If they don’t have a way to wash their clothes, let’s provide them with one,” she said. “If they don’t have food, let’s get them food. It’s our goal to meet all of those needs.”

Aside from laundry services and a uniform closet, the school has operated a weekend food service for years through a partnership with the Mississippi Food Network and the Junior League of Jackson: Students can take home a bag of food on Friday that will last their family through the weekend. Last year, Johnson Elementary also started stocking a food pantry, where students can go “shopping” for groceries.
Johnson Elementary is located in the Georgetown neighborhood. Many homes in the community continue to be multi-generational, the principal said, with grandparents and great-grandparents living in the same house as their grandchildren. 
The neighborhood has seen decreasing access to fresh food over the years, Johnson said — today, there’s just one grocery store. 
When food insecurity is an issue for a Johnson Elementary student, their families are struggling, too. Part of the district’s community schools model is to help the whole family, Johnson said. 
“We ask the kids how many people live in their household because we expect and believe that the food is to help everybody, not just our students,” she said. “We want to be able to fill those gaps.”
Reducing barriers to learning
Everything a student might need is located in one room at Walton Elementary School: The aptly-named “community room.”
The room houses nonperishable food items, uniforms, backpacks, coats, personal hygiene products, and on occasion, even bikes.

Principal LaRoy Merrick considers it a personal responsibility to keep the room stocked at all times, making sure the needs of all of his students are met. 
“I can’t control what a child gets when they leave me, but while they’re with me, they’re getting everything they need,” he said. “My responsibility is to make sure they’re educated and nurtured and loved.”
The school relies on community partnerships to serve its students. During the holidays, nearby Cade Chapel Missionary Baptist Church provides Thanksgiving meals to students and their families. The Junior League of Jackson hosts a sort of farmers market once a month at the school, where families can select fresh groceries to take home. 
“We’re a family here,” Merrick said. “In order to educate students’ minds, we have to educate them in all other ways.”
That community collaboration component is integral because schools alone cannot solve the myriad of challenges students face, said Anderson of FutureEd. A web of community partnerships help support the schools’ work. 
“If you provide support to a child and their family, you are doing one of two things, and both are super helpful,” he said. “You’re reducing barriers for them to get to school ready to learn … and you’re making home a more conducive environment for child development. A model that does these things consistently can make a meaningful contribution to a child’s wellbeing.”
It’s work that’s going to impact students far beyond their years at school, he said, “20 years down the road.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/05140308/3X0A2256.jpg,,,2025-12-26 15:58:33.029689

Gardner Policy Institute report on agriculture in Utah.
During a 2022 census of agriculture in the state, the average price of a pound of ground beef was $1.71. That year cattle sales represented about 26% of the state’s livestock and poultry product sales in the state, according to the report, accounting for $427.5 million.
That price soared, reaching “an all-time high” of $6.32 in August 2025.

“Declining cattle inventories, sustained demand, and rising input prices are (driving) the price increase,” the report says. “While producers benefit from higher beef prices in the short term, they are faced with higher costs to rebuild their herds in the long term.”
Hog production is also in sharp decline in Utah. After Smithfield Foods, the largest pork producer in Utah, ended contracts with 26 hog farms in the state in late 2023, the inventory of hogs fell from a high of over 1 million in September of 2020 to 105,000 in September 2024, researchers wrote. 
Smithfield Foods announced its decision to end the contracts “to optimize its supply chain for more efficient operations in the face of an industry oversupply of pork, weaker consumer demand and high feed prices,” the company said in a news release issued in 2023.

While farmers are receiving more money for their products, nationally, their business costs have been more volatile, the Gardner Institute wrote. 
“The prices paid index for crops has been relatively stable since 2022, while the prices received dropped from 2022 through early 2025 before recovering slightly,” the report says. “For livestock, the prices paid index steadily rose from 2020 through 2025, while the prices received index grew more rapidly over this period.”
The 2022 census also measured that farm sales in the state totaled $2.3 billion that year. 
“While the sales of agricultural products represented a small share of the state’s overall economy, agriculture plays an important role in many rural areas and covers nearly one-fifth of all land statewide,” researchers found.

David Rochefort said he and his colleagues are “still working out the finer details” of the bill. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)State Sen. David Rochefort, a Littleton Republican, said he and the state’s legislative staff are in the process of drafting a bill aimed at addressing systemic abuse and neglect issues in New Hampshire intellectual and developmental disability care system.
In November, the Bulletin published a series of articles outlining abuse and neglect — sometimes fatal — committed by caretakers against people with disabilities. The stories also uncovered systemic failures of oversight and prevention that allowed the abuse and neglect to happen. State records obtained by the Bulletin show that from January 2023 through the first six months of 2025, 467 credible reports of abuse, neglect, and exploitation against people in the system were investigated by the state. The records also show 119 deaths occurred across the system during that time.
People with intellectual and developmental disabilities are legally entitled to care funded and overseen by the state. In New Hampshire, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Bureau of Developmental Services contracts with 10 private area agencies, each responsible for a region of the state, to coordinate the care.
While investigating these tragedies, the Bulletin spoke with several family members of people within this system who were abused or neglected, their attorneys, and advocates within the community. Rochefort, who is chairman of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, said the series alarmed him and pushed him to look into the issue.

“I don’t think there’s any opposition to making change here,” Rochefort said. “I think there’s a real desire to do something now from everyone involved, even senators who are not on (the Health and Human Services Committee), who approached me on this.”
He said colleagues from both parties have expressed support for the effort.
“I think that you’re going to see action happen sooner rather than later,” Rochefort said. “Nobody wants to kick the can here.”
Rochefort said he and his colleagues are “still working out the finer details” of the bill, but it’ll seek to strengthen oversight and improve data sharing to allow officials to better identify issues.
“Data on these things would be shared automatically, rather than the way that it’s shared now,” he said. “And it would give the state a better way to either respond to complaints or take action if there’s an issue.”
He also said the bill changes the composition of the Incapacitated and Vulnerable Adults Fatality Review Committee — a panel established by state law to review concerning deaths and make recommendations on how the state can prevent similar deaths in the future — to allow for “better representation of the communities affected and the people that would actually be able to affect change.”
The Bulletin previously reported on the December 2022 death of Stephen Weidlich Jr., a man with physical and developmental disabilities who was found dead behind the care home where he lived. Additionally, in July 2019, Christine Marie Bill, a woman with disabilities, was found dead after overheating in a hot, sealed car, according to the Bulletin’s reporting. Before the Bulletin published its findings, the co-chairs of the Incapacitated and Vulnerable Adults Fatality Review Committee, Vanessa Blais and Francesca Broderick, said they hadn’t been told about either death and that each should have been reviewed by the committee.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/statehousclouds-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-26 14:57:12.152950
,Mississippi Today,2025-12-26 19:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Some professors say students struggle with reading and critical thinking. This center at UM tackles a more complicated truth,Candice Wilder,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/26/um-center-supports-relevant-reading/,"Students told Liz Norell, who oversees the University of Mississippi's Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning, that they don't do course readings if the assignments seem irrelevant or redundant.","There’s a complaint that Liz Norell often hears from faculty at the University of Mississippi: Students are not doing the course readings.
Is it true? And if so, what should professors be doing to help students?  
“We’ve been talking about this issue for as long as I’ve been in higher ed, and that’s almost 20-something years,” said Norell, an associate director of instructional support at the university’s Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning. “It’s obviously much more complex than just a simple solution or answer. But I think we’re all trying to figure out how to reach our students in this time when everything feels so hard.” 
Norell provides resources, professional development and other services to help faculty improve their teaching. Her role at the center aims to promote innovative teaching practices, improve student success and create more inclusive learning environments. 
When these professors’ broad theories about college students’ reading habits became too critical, Norell spoke with students.
Last spring, she surveyed 155 students about their reading habits. That semester, Norell also created a student focus group to gather more input for her research. Students shared with her three common reasons why they didn’t complete reading assignments. 
First, some instructors didn’t talk about the readings in class, which students said  made the assignments seem pointless. Some students said they felt unsure of how to apply the information they read on exams or in class discussions. Other students said the assigned readings for different classes within the same major or field of study were too similar. 
Rethinking the types of supplemental materials faculty assign could help their students, Norell said. Reading assignments should be relevant or purposeful to students’ lives. 
“My students tell me all the time, ‘Why do I need to read this? Why should I care about this?’” Norell said. “If I can’t answer that question as an instructor, or if my answer is ‘Because I told you to,’ then I’m not motivating students to learn.” 
Creating ‘aha moments’ in the classroom 
When assistant professor Corbit Franks began teaching athletic training, he considered himself a traditionalist.  
Franks, who is also a clinical education coordinator of athletic training, was adamant about assigning coursework that included lengthy peer-reviewed journal articles and multiple textbook chapters. He also insisted students write papers and do critical analyses of the class readings. 
Since Franks began working with Norell and her team at the center, he adjusted his teaching style and syllabi to accommodate what he sees as a decline in students’ willingness to read and engage with supplemental class work.  His new approach often involves providing “a thoughtful explanation” of why the course readings are useful for future clinicians and healthcare professionals.

If students come to class prepared to discuss supplemental readings such as research and peer-reviewed journal articles from the National Athletic Trainers Association Position Statement website, their knowledge of the profession, the human body and themselves will improve, he said. That effort can also help students pass their board certification exam. 
“When you look at most of the professions that these students are getting into, the biggest thing that they need is the ability to critically think and build upon one complex thought off of another,” Franks said. 
Franks said he tries to create “aha moments,” in class through reading discussion. It helps students see beyond the class and semester. The discussions can also help them engage with their future patients, clients and or athletes, he said. 
He also allows his students autonomy to design coursework such as questions for quizzes and exams, which helps him understand if they have a grasp on the reading assignments. 
Franks also redesigned his assignments around the skills he wants students to learn. 
“When it comes to certain projects, I allow them to do videos, podcasts or find other creative ways to show off their personality,” Franks said. “It allows students to learn, think creatively and critically, plus relay the information in a way they understand. Plus, it creates a sense of equity in the classroom.” 
Franks said he no longer sees teaching as a one-way street, with the instructor as the “authority figure ruling with an iron fist.” Instead, he said, his approach is a constant dialogue with his students.
“When you enter a classroom, you enter into a kind of a contractual agreement or mutual respect between student and instructor that you both are there for the betterment of the greater good,” Franks said. “It makes them feel comfortable to share and express their needs, thoughts or ask for help. It is effective for their overall success which is why I began teaching in the first place.” 
Getting back to the principles of teaching 
In October, Norell presented her first set of preliminary data on students’ reading habits to faculty in a small workshop titled “When and Why Do Students Read for Class?” She highlighted the disconnect she found between students’ motivation to read and what they are asked to do or learn for the course. 
Of students who responded to Norell’s survey, 55% reported a high motivation to complete their assignments, but less than 46% said they felt engaged with the course material.  Less than 44% said they felt well supported in their efforts to learn. The qualitative results also indicated that students don’t feel the assigned reading is useful or connected to their class performance.

Caris Miller, a senior studying integrated marketing, said she is the type of student who reads and completes all of her assigned readings for her classes. But if professors don’t use the textbooks students bought for class, students may feel less obligated to do the readings required for the course, she said. 
“Professors don’t understand that we also have four other classes we’re juggling, so having eight required textbooks that we don’t need, but you have us buy, just feels like a waste of our resources,” Miller said. “A lot of us here are also on loans or student scholarships. We have to be smart about everything, including our money.” 
Norell also asked faculty members to reflect on their own reading habits. It opened discussion around a point often overlooked on the issue: Students’ and adults’ ability to read and focus for long periods of time has decreased. 
A 2021 Gallup poll results released in 2022 indicated U.S. adults are reading about two or three fewer books than they did between 2002 and 2016. The numbers are lower for college graduates, according to Gallup. They read an average of about six fewer books in 2021 than they did between 2002 and 2016.
“There’s an opportunity for us all to think about reading like practice, such as building muscle or a yoga practice where you’re investing time to do it.” 
Norell said she is recruiting other colleges and universities to assist with her research project. Gathering student input from other institutions across the country will help paint a national picture of the trends and patterns in students’ reading choices, she said. 
That input can also help better understand faculty members’ perceptions of the issue. 
“I believe that learning happens when we are in environments where we feel psychologically safe, where we feel like we belong, and where we feel like people care about us,” Norell said. “And that’s all relational.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/03141842/3X0A6095.jpg,,,2025-12-26 14:11:40.906325

The Republican governor made the appointments Wednesday, and the two men may replace Sens. Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, and George Rauscher, R-Sutton, whom the governor previously appointed to fill two vacancies in the Senate.
Both appointees are subject to a confirmation vote of House Republicans.
Stephan St. Clair, a former Tilton aide, is Dunleavy’s choice to fill her vacant seat. He is a retired military police first sergeant and has lived in Wasilla for 15 years, according to a statement from the governor’s office. 
Dunleavy picked Garrett Nelson, a salesman and family man, according to his LinkedIn profile, to Rauscher’s seat. He has lived in Sutton for nearly a decade and is chair of the Sutton Community Council.
The appointments come after two resignations in the Senate set off a domino effect of appointments to what are typically elected positions. Sens. Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, and Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, resigned in November to pursue campaigns for lieutenant governor and governor, respectively.
The governor then had 30 days to appoint their replacements, Tilton and Rauscher, who were confirmed by Senate Republicans.
The governor then had until Dec. 29 to select his picks to replace them.
The legislative session begins on Jan. 20.

The unified GOP government enacted a major tax cuts and domestic spending law in July, but hit a roadblock in late September when the federal government shut down for a record-breaking six weeks.Here’s a look back at some of the biggest news stories from Washington, D.C.January The U.S. House began the year reelecting Louisiana Republican Mike Johnson as speaker and pushing through a series of GOP-favored bills focused on immigration and transgender student athletes. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., officially took over the role from Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pledging to protect the legislative filibuster, the 60-vote procedural hurdle that requires at least some bipartisanship for major legislation to advance. Meanwhile, several committees began the confirmation process for Trump’s nominees.

Just days ahead of his second inauguration, a judge sentenced Trump in the New York hush money case for paying off an adult film star in the leadup to the 2016 election. Trump, who moved his inauguration indoors amid arctic weather, marked the first day of his second term by signing a series of executive orders addressing immigration and birthright citizenship, as well as climate change and LGBTQ rights. He also pardoned 1,500 people who were convicted of various crimes related to the Jan. 6. 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Just before the end of the month, Trump signed the first bill approved by the Republican-controlled Congress, the Laken Riley Act. And he announced plans to implement tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, the start of one of his signature economic policies. FebruaryLawsuits against Trump’s actions began piling up within weeks as Democratic attorneys general, immigrant rights organizations and civil liberties groups accused the administration of overstepping its authority. Trump and other administration officials sought to reduce the size and scope of the federal government by firing thousands of probationary workers and called on the heads of all federal agencies to submit reorganization plans by mid-March. He also fired 20 immigration judges.Republicans in Congress started working through the several complicated steps of the budget reconciliation process that would eventually lead to the “big, beautiful bill.” MarchTrump’s efforts to dismantle the Department of Education began advancing shortly after the Senate voted to confirm Linda McMahon as secretary. In one of her first acts leading the department, she wrote in a memo its “final mission” would be to “to send education back to the states and empower all parents to choose an excellent education for their children.”Trump signed an executive order later in the month directing McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure” of the Education Department, though much of that authority rests with Congress. Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts issued a rare public statement defending the judicial branch against criticism from Trump. The Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee asked the Defense Department inspector general to look into the use of the Signal messaging app by high-ranking officials to discuss an imminent bombing in Yemen. A journalist at The Atlantic was inadvertently added to the chat and later published a series of articles about the experience. AprilThe Trump administration admitted in court filings that officials mistakenly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia of Maryland to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador.

The Supreme Court became more involved in the national debate about Trump’s policies toward immigrants, first ruling that the administration didn’t need to bring Abrego Garcia back before reversing course and ruling officials must “facilitate” his return to the United States. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, sitting alongside Trump in the Oval Office, later said he wouldn’t send Abrego Garcia back.Separately, Trump’s tariff policies were the focus of a Senate hearing. Republicans in Congress settled on an outline for their “big, beautiful bill” and later began advancing different parts of that package out of House committees. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he would refocus autism research funding on environmental factors. And Trump signed a series of executive orders addressing education policy. MayThe Supreme Court ruled that a ban on transgender people serving in the military could remain in place while the case continued at a lower level, that the Trump administration violated due process rights when it tried to deport some Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, that the administration could end temporary protected status for 350,000 Venezuelans, and that the Trump administration could proceed with deportations for 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who had been granted temporary protected status. Republicans in the House voted to approve a 1,116-page package that combined 11 bills into what would eventually become the “big, beautiful bill,” sending the measure to the Senate. Former President Joe Biden was diagnosed with “a more aggressive form” of prostate cancer.JuneTrump doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum, from 25% to 50%, saying during a trip to a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania that he would increase them even further if he thought it would be necessary to “secure the steel industry in the United States.” The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported later in the month that his tariff policies would reduce the country’s deficit but likely slow the economy. Immigration continued to be a central part of the news cycle with Abrego Garcia returning to the U.S., California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla being forcibly removed and handcuffed while attempting to ask Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem a question during a press conference in Los Angeles and the Supreme Court weighing in on lower courts issuing nationwide injunctions. Trump said the U.S. military had bombed ""three key nuclear facilities"" in Iran before calling for peace.

JulyThe Senate approved the final, much reworked version of the “big, beautiful bill,” sending it back to the House, which voted along party lines to clear the sweeping tax and health care package for Trump, who signed it on the Fourth of July. The legislation included several policy goals for the GOP, including on Medicaid, immigration and deportations and a national private school voucher program. The Congressional Budget Office expects the law will increase the federal deficit by $3.394 trillion during the next decade and lead 10 million people to lose access to health insurance.The Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration could continue with its plans for mass layoffs and downsizing at the Education Department.Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a “benign and common” condition for people over the age of 70, according to U.S. Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, the president’s physician.Senators from both parties expressed frustration that Department of Agriculture officials didn’t consult with Congress before proposing to move thousands of jobs out of the Washington, D.C., area. Trump announced a deal with European Union leaders that would result in a 15% tariff on most goods coming into the U.S. from those 27 countries.August

Trump started off the month instituting a 15% tariff on goods brought into the U.S. from about three dozen countries, though he raised that amount for several nations, including 18% on products from Nicaragua, 30% on imports from South Africa and 50% on goods from Brazil.A New York State appeals court ruled the $465 million civil penalty against Trump in the case where he was found liable for financial fraud for inflating the worth of some of his real estate holdings was excessive.Republican and Democratic state legislatures, urged on by the president and members of Congress, sought to begin the November 2026 midterm elections early by redrawing maps for U.S. House seats to give their party a baked-in advantage. Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook sued Trump after he attempted to fire her, arguing in court documents his actions were an “unprecedented and illegal attempt” that would erode the board’s independence. SeptemberA federal appeals court ruled that Trump did need to pay an $83 million penalty for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The Supreme Court ruled that federal immigration agents could racially profile Latinos in Southern California as a lawsuit over the issue continued through the federal courts. Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez testified before a Senate committee that she was fired from that role after less than a month because she refused to pre-approve vaccine recommendations. Trump and several other high-ranking Republicans spoke at the memorial service for conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated during an event at Utah Valley University. Kirk’s death was one of several instances of political violence this year that also included the killing of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, the arson at the official home of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and the shooting at the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta.A group of U.S. investors reached an agreement to take over TikTok, the immensely popular social media app, avoiding the need for it to go offline in the United States. OctoberCongress failed to approve the dozen full-year government funding bills before the start of the new fiscal year, leaving an opening for a government shutdown. Democrats tried to bring attention to health care costs and other issues throughout the weeks-long debacle. The funding stalemate impacted nearly every corner of the federal government, including pay for federal employees like air traffic controllers, food aid for lower-income families, Head Start and public lands.  The No Kings day protests highlighted some Americans' discontent with Trump and Republican policies a little more than a year before the 2026 midterm elections will measure that frustration at the ballot box. Trump demolished the East Wing of the White House to make way for construction of a ballroom that will be nearly double the size of the 55,000-square-foot residence and workplace. November The shutdown stalemate ended after Senate Majority Leader Thune promised Democrats a vote on a health care bill of their choosing before the end of the year. The funding bill approved by Congress and signed by Trump included three full-year funding bills but a stopgap for the rest of government, setting up the possibility of a partial government shutdown beginning in February if lawmakers don’t broker a deal before then. The final days of the shutdown included a tug-of-war between the judicial branch and the Trump administration over whether they needed to pay full benefits for the 42 million people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case that will determine whether Trump overstepped when he instituted tariffs using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Separately, the justices allowed the Trump administration to continue issuing male or female passports based on a person’s assigned sex at birth. Congress approved a bill forcing the Trump administration to release the Epstein files. A gunman opened fired on two National Guard members from West Virginia who were just blocks from the White House. U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died the next day as a result of her injuries.

Los residentes de San Marcos celebraron juntos la tradición navideña de las posadas mientras lidiaban con el miedo y la tensión causados por el aumento de las redadas del ICE.

Un viernes por la noche reciente, los organizadores de un festival comunitario en San Marcos estaban ocupados planeando una procesión vecinal y preparando bandejas de tamales para los invitados.
Al mismo tiempo, estaban preparando a la seguridad para vigilar la actividad de ICE en el área mayoritariamente latina y de bajos ingresos del norte del condado de San Diego.
 “Dependemos de la comunidad”, dijo la concejal de San Marcos, María Núñez, quien representa al Distrito 1 de San Marcos, donde el 55% de la población en edad de votar es hispana. “La gente está en alerta máxima. Si ven algo, escuchan algo, si hay ICE en la zona, nos avisarán”.
 La Universidad Popular, una organización cívica del norte del condado de San Diego, patrocinó el evento, llamado Posada Comunitaria, junto con la iglesia local Restoration Abbey. Es la tercera vez que se celebra en San Marcos, pero este año las festividades se celebraron en un contexto de aprehensión debido al recrudecimiento de las medidas migratorias bajo la administración Trump.
 La procesión, o posada, recrea tradicionalmente la peregrinación de María y José a Belén antes del nacimiento de Cristo. En San Marcos, residentes y organizadores desfilaron por el barrio, donde los complejos de viviendas asequibles albergan a muchas familias inmigrantes.
El evento sitúa la historia del Adviento en un contexto moderno, dijo Alex Aguas, sacerdote de  Restoration Abbey, que presta ayuda a solicitantes de asilo.
 “La práctica de la Posada realmente invita a la gente a reflexionar sobre ‘¿qué significa ser rechazado?’”, dijo. “O ‘¿qué significa estar al margen y buscar refugio en estos momentos?’. También tenemos la oportunidad de celebrar”.
 Mientras los invitados llegaban y bebían tazas de café y sidra de manzana, los voluntarios de seguridad con chalecos de color rosa intenso se reunían para discutir cómo gestionar el control del tráfico y estar atentos a los agentes de inmigración.

 “Todos nuestros equipos, todos nuestros chalecos rosados, han recibido capacitación en respuesta a la inmigración”, dijo Arcela Núñez, codirectora de la Universidad Popular y hermana de María Núñez. “Tenemos personal vigilando todos los puntos de este barrio”.
San Marcos, una ciudad de 94,000 habitantes en el norte del Condado de San Diego, parece registrar solo unos pocos arrestos por inmigración en el área de San Diego. Sin embargo, datos gubernamentales sugieren que las cifras han aumentado este año, y los organizadores afirman haber observado una mayor actividad migratoria recientemente.
 El Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas de Estados Unidos (ICE) ha arrestado al menos a 38 personas en San Marcos desde septiembre de 2023, 20 de las cuales se realizaron entre junio y octubre de este año, según datos federales proporcionados por el ICE en respuesta a una solicitud de la Ley de Libertad de Información (FOIA), procesados por el Proyecto de Datos de Deportación y analizados por CalMatters. CalMatters contactó al ICE, la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza de Estados Unidos (CBP) y el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional de Estados Unidos (DHS) para confirmar las cifras, pero no ha recibido respuesta.
El aumento de la aplicación de la ley y un cambio en la política que permite operativos en áreas como iglesias y escuelas, que anteriormente se consideraban santuarios, han tenido un efecto disuasorio en algunas actividades comunitarias. Arcela Núñez comentó que su organización debatió la posibilidad de cancelar el evento este año debido a estas preocupaciones. Decidieron seguir adelante, pero con cautela.

 Los organizadores estaban particularmente atentos a posibles informes de actividad de ICE en el Home Depot de San Marcos, a menos de una milla de distancia, donde se han llevado a cabo otras redadas de inmigración este año. Las tiendas Home Depot, donde se reúnen jornaleros inmigrantes para buscar trabajo, han sido blanco de las autoridades en Pomona , Los Ángeles y Sacramento este año.
 En octubre, la Patrulla Fronteriza y de Aduanas de Estados Unidos arrestó a 22 personas con antecedentes penales en sucursales de Home Depot en San Marcos y Encinitas, dijo el portavoz del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, Jason Givens.
 “Si algo sucede, busquen personal de seguridad con experiencia”, dijo Flower Álvarez-López, codirectora de la Universidad Popular, a unas dos docenas de voluntarios reunidos en círculo. “Podremos ayudarles”.
Los voluntarios distribuyeron velas entre los participantes, quienes formaron fila para marchar por el patio de un edificio de apartamentos vecino. Los músicos tocaron sus guitarras mientras cientos de cantantes les dieron una serenata a los residentes con melodías tradicionales como “Noche de Paz” y “Letanía para pedir posada”.
Su siguiente parada fue El Palenque Taco Shop, a la vuelta de la esquina del bulevar San Marcos. Los organizadores usaron linternas para guiar a los participantes e indicarles a los coches en el estacionamiento que dieran paso,  antes de llevar al grupo unas cuantas casas más abajo hasta la Heladería La Michoacana.
Los participantes hicieron una parada más en un complejo de apartamentos antes de regresar a la iglesia, donde las familias hicieron fila para recibir platos repletos de arroz y frijoles, tamales, porciones de pizza y conchas, un pan dulce mexicano.
El evento de San Marcos se desarrolló sin incidentes, pero ilustra la tensión que enfrentan los líderes comunitarios al intentar planificar celebraciones culturales mientras mantienen la vigilancia ante posibles operaciones de inmigración.
 Inés Delgado, defensora de derechos migratorios del Centro de Recursos LGBTQ del Norte del Condado, en la vecina Oceanside, se ofreció como voluntaria en la posada tras haber organizado una celebración por el Día Internacional del Migrante el jueves por la noche. El viernes por la mañana, comentó que algunos clientes se presentaron a una distribución de alimentos en el centro, pero confesó que habían estado demasiado nerviosos para asistir a las festividades la noche anterior.
 “Muchos dijeron que tenían miedo de salir”, dijo. “Quizás sea por el enfoque en la inmigración, pero también por salir de noche”.

 En las oficinas de la Universidad Popular en San Marcos, un cartel en la puerta dice “Aviso: propiedad y establecimiento privado”, advirtiendo a los agentes de inmigración u otros agentes del orden público que se requiere una orden judicial para ingresar a áreas no públicas.
 En el interior, carteles rosas adornados con flores recuerdan a los clientes su derecho a permanecer en silencio en caso de arresto y a preguntar a los oficiales si están detenidos.
“Muchos de nuestros socios comunitarios están instalando letreros como este”, dijo Arcela Núñez. “Así que si ICE llega, no queremos que entren y queremos que la gente se sienta segura”.
Detrás de su oficina, el grupo cerró la noche con un par de piñatas industriales en forma de estrella. Decenas de niños se esforzaron por romperlas y luego recoger los dulces después de que se reventaran.
 Aunque la organización y la iglesia organizan la posada y otros festivales comunitarios anualmente, la peregrinación vecinal de este año destacó particularmente la difícil situación de los “extraños que buscan bienvenida”, dijo Aguas.
 “En función del clima político cambiante, esa obra adquiere un significado y una resonancia diferentes”.

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)NORRIS — As the last round of students filters in from the school van to the main hallway, Principal Brian Brown greets each student by name, with a high five and an “I’ve been waiting for you all morning.”
After students arrive, they’re served breakfast, and Brown leads a boys’ group and girls’ group in singing Lakota songs to get the day started.
This is the morning routine at Norris Elementary, part of the White River School District in rural southwestern South Dakota. The school borders the Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations, and serves about 50 students from kindergarten through fifth grade who are predominantly Native American.

Norris is an unincorporated community in Mellette County, one of the most impoverished counties in the state. About a third of the students are raised by their grandparents, Brown said.
“We’ve still got kids that live in houses with no running water,” he said. “So, we have our struggles, we have our hardships.”
Three years ago, barely half of the school’s students were coming to class regularly. That struggle is common for schools serving Native American students in the state, according to data from the state Department of Education. Last school year, nearly half of Native American students were chronically absent, more than double the statewide rate.
But now, Norris’ attendance is above 90%. That’s higher than both the district and state averages. It’s been achieved by engaging one-on-one with students and families and implementing Lakota language and cultural programming.
The improvement is a source of pride for Brown and his staff.
“We can do it,” he said. “We can be successful, we can show people that we care about school and that we want to be the best that we can be.”
South Dakota Secretary of Education Joseph Graves has noticed the improvement. He said keeping students engaged through culturally relevant lessons and communication is an important part of replicating what’s happening at Norris.
“But it’s also that leadership, those people who are willing to make that happen, engage with kids,” Graves said. “You put those two together and it’s proven to be a very strong factor in the success.”
Graves said he wants to keep watching the school, to see if the trend continues and if it leads to increased proficiency and graduation rates.
The geographic isolation at Norris makes it difficult to hire and recruit teachers and staff. Two teachers are in dual-grade classrooms, the school’s head custodian and office administrator are also the school’s bus drivers, and Brown steps in at lunchtime to help serve food.
“We kind of have to make and manipulate our own resources just to get the kids what they need,” Brown said. “It’s been challenging, but then also, it’s been eye-opening to address the needs of the kids out here at Norris.”
Norris is one of many schools across the state trying to fill teaching positions. As of July, there were 144 open teaching positions, according to data from Associated School Boards of South Dakota.
A part of Brown’s morning routine is checking in with teachers during breakfast to ask which students they haven’t seen yet. If they aren’t there for roll call, Brown hits the road for a home visit.
He would’ve been doing that on a recent morning, he said, if he wasn’t talking to a reporter.
“I probably would’ve already went out this morning, and probably would have went and visited at least two houses this morning to parents and say, ‘Hey, how’s it going? What do you need? How can I help you?’” he said.
It’s not just about getting the kids to school. It’s about them wanting to come to school, Brown said.

In a small community, it takes everyone to keep students involved, said Wendy O’Brien, who teaches fourth and fifth grade at Norris.
“If you get the community members involved, and they come into the classroom and see what the kids are doing, I think they’re more supportive,” she said.
She wants students to form habits of good attendance. It’s especially important for students in her two-grade classroom.
“When they miss school, they miss learning,” O’Brien said. “Working with two grades, you don’t have time to reteach lessons.”
It’s also important to make the kids feel seen, Brown said. After taking over as principal in 2022, Brown, who works to preserve Lakota language, songs and philosophy, started finding ways to include Lakota culture in the school day.
Now, the morning announcements are followed by a group of students leading the school in Lakota songs. He also teaches Lakota studies to each grade once a week, and started the school’s first traditional Lakota drum group: the Black Pipe Singers.
“When children know their identity, they know who they are, where they come from, they will excel better academically and in basic life skills,” Brown said.
It’s one of the ways he can set students up for success before they get to high school, where more than one-third of Native American students in public schools don’t graduate, according to recent state data.
Brown calls the habits learned in elementary school the “bread and butter” of a student’s academic journey.
“It’s important to go to school every day, be on time, do the best that you can and work hard,” he said. “It promotes a more successful life for the children, and that’s what we try to establish here at Norris.”

Las tortillas que se venden en California tendrán un nuevo ingrediente, uno que está destinado a garantizar la nutrición de los bebés.
 A partir del 1 de enero, entrará en vigor una nueva ley que exigirá que la mayoría de las tortillas y productos de masa de maíz vendidos en el estado contengan ácido fólico, una vitamina importante para la salud infantil.
Las latinas en California tienen muchas menos probabilidades que otras mujeres de obtener suficiente ácido fólico al comienzo del embarazo, una brecha que puede provocar defectos de nacimiento.
 Los datos estatales muestran que, entre 2017 y 2019 (los últimos años disponibles), aproximadamente el 28 % de las latinas reportaron haber tomado ácido fólico el mes anterior al embarazo. Las mujeres blancas consumieron la vitamina con mayor frecuencia: el 46 % reportó consumir ácido fólico, según el Departamento de Salud Pública de California.
Esto aumenta el riesgo de que las latinas tengan un bebé con defectos del tubo neural, una estructura embrionaria que después se convierte en el cerebro y la médula espinal. Algunos ejemplos de problemas del tubo neural son la espina bífida y la anencefalia.
 Las investigaciones han demostrado que el ácido fólico puede reducir los defectos congénitos hasta en un 70 % . Por eso se encuentra en las vitaminas prenatales. Sin embargo, dado que las mujeres pueden no descubrir que están embarazadas hasta semanas o meses después, la salud pública recomienda desde hace tiempo que también se añada ácido fólico a los alimentos básicos.
 En 1998, Estados Unidos exigió a los fabricantes que fortificaran ciertos productos de granos con ácido fólico, como la pasta, el arroz y los cereales, para ayudar a las mujeres en edad reproductiva a obtener las cantidades necesarias. Desde que entró en vigor esta norma, la tasa de bebés nacidos con defectos del tubo neural se ha reducido en aproximadamente un tercio , según los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades.
 Pero incluso con la adición de estos alimentos, las tasas de defectos congénitos entre los bebés nacidos de latinas han sido consistentemente más altas. En busca de una adición más apropiada culturalmente, en 2016, el gobierno federal permitió a los fabricantes de masa de maíz agregar ácido fólico a sus alimentos, pero no lo exigió.
 Joaquín Arámbula, demócrata de Fresno y autor de la ley, dijo que excluir el ácido fólico de los productos de masa de maíz, utilizados en muchos alimentos básicos latinos, fue un “verdadero descuido”.
 Ahora, con la implementación del Proyecto de Ley 1830 de la Asamblea , California es el primer estado en exigir ácido fólico en los productos de masa de maíz. La ley exige que los fabricantes que operan en el estado agreguen 0.7 miligramos de ácido fólico por cada libra de harina e indiquen esta adición en sus etiquetas nutricionales. La ley establece exenciones para productores de lotes pequeños, como restaurantes y mercados, que podrían preparar sus propias tortillas.
 Meses después de la firma de la ley de California, Alabama aprobó su propia versión . Esta ley entrará en vigor en junio de 2026.
 Algunos grandes fabricantes llevan años añadiendo ácido fólico a sus productos. Gruma, empresa matriz de Mission Foods, afirmó que comenzó a fortificar sus alimentos en 2016, cuando el gobierno federal lo autorizó por primera vez. Un portavoz de la empresa afirmó que Gruma mantiene un compromiso de larga data con el apoyo a las iniciativas legislativas de fortificación y apoya las nuevas leyes en California y Alabama.

You can read more about the section here.

Rural communities in Mississippi are constantly being under-resourced, underserved and overlooked.
Growing up in a small town in the Delta, I witnessed firsthand the everyday struggles of my neighbors, from food insecurity caused by high medical expenses to limited access to basic health care services.
I grew up in Belzoni, a small town of less than 1,800 that lost its hospital in 2013. Since then, Belzoni residents have been left vulnerable, with no access to 24/7 emergency care and limited preventive health care options.

Currently Belzoni residents and residents of neighboring towns rely on a single emergency helicopter in Belzoni, and are forced to commute 20 to 35 minutes to the nearest hospital, often during life-threatening emergencies when every minute matters.
This new reality is not just inconvenient; it is extremely dangerous. My community has witnessed community members lose their lives because help could not arrive in time, especially during natural disasters and medical crises.
Without a nearby hospital, many residents began to view health care as a privilege rather than a right, often neglecting their health or abandoning preventive care altogether.
This is not just happening in Belzoni, though. Across Mississippi, nearly half of rural hospitals are at risk of closing, putting thousands more families in danger, according to a 2023 American Hospital Association report.
Additionally, over 200,000 Mississippians fall into the Medicaid coverage gap. They earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, according to a 2024 KFF report.
Without Medicaid expansion, this issue will only worsen.
Medicaid expansion would not solve every issue Mississippi faces, but it would give rural families the chance to invest in their health without sacrificing their essentials and viewing health care as a burden. It would also bring in necessary federal relief to struggling hospitals and provide coverage to families that are caught in the gap.
Medicaid expansion is not a political matter; it is a humanitarian matter.
It is about ensuring that all Mississippians, no matter their location, have access to reliable and quality health care instead of risking their lives simply because of where they live.
We have to take immediate action for our rural communities because they deserve better and simply cannot afford to wait any longer.

The deal is controversial and contested.
However, a spokesperson for NorthWestern Energy said Wednesday the utility anticipates a green light from FERC.
“We are working with FERC to provide additional information and are confident our application will be approved,” said NorthWestern spokesperson Jo Dee Black in an email.
NorthWestern Energy announced in August 2024 it would acquire the Puget shares at the coal-fired electricity plant at Colstrip at no cost. Puget is based in Washington, where state law ends coal-fired electricity for state customers by the end of 2025.
NorthWestern said the new shares would provide a benefit to existing customers on Jan. 1, 2026, when the utility acquired them.
However, NorthWestern since created a subsidiary it said would receive all the Puget shares, and it told the Public Service Commission the shell company was outside the authority of regulators.
The Public Service Commission regulates monopoly utilities in Montana.
This fall, the NorthWestern subsidiary filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to sell power from the Puget shares on the wholesale market.
In a move it later reversed, the Public Service Commission demanded the feds investigate the monopoly utility for attempting to evade the law in shifting the shares to the new subsidiary; the PSC said it would proceed with its own inquiry instead.
An energy watchdog, the Montana Environmental Information Center, has protested NorthWestern’s federal application and filed to intervene in the case.
The energy nonprofit argues in part that the NorthWestern subsidiary should have secured federal authorization for the planned transfer — and its failure to do so is “fatal” to any approval request for a wholesale deal.
The MEIC also said NorthWestern has not shown that existing customers won’t be subsidizing the costs for the wholesale market deals.
In its own filing, the NorthWestern subsidiary argues the feds should reject the argument that the transfer of the Puget shares needs federal approval in part because the utility says the value of the shares doesn’t hit a financial threshold for approval — $10 million.
The MEIC disagrees; the nonprofit said just because the cost of the shares was $0 doesn’t mean the value of the asset is $0.
It said NorthWestern itself has estimated annual revenues of nearly $30 million from the asset and said it would cost $700 million to build an equivalent plant.
Wednesday, NorthWestern did not have an estimate of the value of the shares immediately available, but in a filing, it argues the nonprofit isn’t using an appropriate measure to value them.
The value is one request from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
In the letter calling for additional information, FERC said the NorthWestern subsidiary must provide the original cost of the shares being transferred, undepreciated, in its filing.
The feds also called for details about the transfer within NorthWestern, including ownership arrangements, timing of arrangements, and rights or veto powers to any parties that are “disproportionate” to the deal.
“For example, do any of the owners hold special share classes with different rights that do not match their economic interest?” the letter said.
The letter called for specific information about the timing and structure of the transfer of shares from Puget to NorthWestern, and the timing of the transfer of the ownership interest between NorthWestern and the subsidiary, NorthWestern Colstrip 370Pu LLC.
The letter gives the NorthWestern subsidiary 30 days to provide the additional information.
In the meantime, NorthWestern spokesperson Black said the acquisition from Puget will be complete on Jan. 1, 2026. NorthWestern did not address what its plans are for the shares while the case is pending.
The NorthWestern subsidiary entered into a 21-month contract with Mercuria Energy America LLC and filed for FERC approval of the contract.
That request is also pending with FERC.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-0028-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-12-26 10:58:36.405620

For five months each year, the work of state government shifts into full public view. Decisions that are often made behind closed doors or over private video calls move into open committee rooms. Government leaders are pressed on the record. Lawmakers debate ideas in real time. And in the Statehouse hallways, our reporters ask the questions Vermonters need answered.
If you want VTDigger to keep asking those questions, please join our year end member drive with a gift today.
With Vermont losing 75% of its newspaper jobs over the past quarter century, VTDigger’s coverage of the Legislature is essential.
This session, we’ll be digging into major debates that shape daily life: how to fund education amid rising property taxes; whether health care proposals strengthen or strain hospital systems; how the state plans to confront housing shortages and homelessness; and what it will take to prepare communities for major flooding and other climate disasters.
We’ll track key bills, explain what they mean for people, businesses and towns, and flag potential conflicts of interest. We’ll also highlight testimony that doesn’t always make headlines and pay attention to what isn’t being discussed — and why.
Today, we’re asking for your support to help VTDigger keep reporting the stories no one else is covering. Give before midnight on Dec. 31 and your gift will be tripled. 

Triple your impact

Sincerely,

Ethan Weintstein
Statehouse bureau chief, VTDigger

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — A documentary about the police raid of the Marion County Record is set to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2026, more than two years after law enforcement stormed the newspaper office, the publisher’s home and a city councilwoman’s home.
Director and producer Sharon Liese says the film looks beyond the First Amendment implications of the raids and dives deeper into the small town of Marion in a way the public hasn’t seen before. She called it “a canary in a coal mine” type of story.
“The story that we eventually told is not what you would expect,” Liese said. “It’s not all about the First Amendment. It’s about what happens between a newspaper and its community in a small town. It’ll make people think about what journalism really is and what people really want journalism to be.”
“Seized” will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival Jan. 22 through Feb. 1. It is one of 10 documentary films chosen to compete in the U.S. documentary category and was chosen out of thousands of submitted films. 
Marion Police Chief Gideon Cody and officers carried out a search warrant on the Record newsroom, editor Eric Meyer’s home and a councilwoman’s home in August 2023. The search contributed to the death of Meyer’s 98-year-old mother. Days later, staff published their weekly paper with the headline “Seized but not silenced.”
Kansas Reflector was first to report on the raids, which were based on a nonexistent crime and defied federal and state laws that project journalists. The news brought immediate international scrutiny to the small town of Marion.
Cody is set to stand trial next year for telling a witness after the raids to delete text messages.
Liese, known for other documentaries such as “Transhood” and Emmy-winner “Flagmakers,” was inspired to follow Marion’s story with it being only a few hours away from her home in Overland Park, even though it wasn’t her usual type of story to pursue. 
“I was a little hesitant at first because I’d never started with pursuing a project that already had international visibility,” Liese said. “Every documentary filmmaker from New York City to LA is going to be clamoring to get this story, but then again it’s only two hours from my house. So I just thought I’d give it a whirl.”
Record publisher and editor Eric Meyer agreed to participate in a documentary as long as he had no financial or editorial control, and selected Liese because of her dedication to telling the story beyond just the raids. What mattered to him was journalistic storytelling, he said. 
“Sharon devoted a huge amount of time and effort into this to the point she’s practically a member of the staff here,” Meyer said. “I was never concerned about the journalistic quality. She likes to tell untold stories, whether they’re stories that liberals or conservatives would like.”

“Seized” producer Paul Matyasovsky has worked with Liese since 2023, including the film “Parker,” which was featured at Sundance in 2023. He was drawn to the story similarly to Liese after seeing it on the news.
“I heard about the story the day it happened and was fascinated by it from the beginning,” Matyasovsky said. “I’ve also spent a lot of my career in small towns, and they’re always very unique. That drew me in along with the freedom violations and constitutional questions.”
The more time the small film crew spent in Marion, the more the story evolved as more community members agreed to be interviewed for the film.  
“We wanted to feature the voices that the national media didn’t,” Liese said. “There’s the layer of small town politics, small town dynamics and the power struggle in a small town between a newspaper and its government. We spent two and a half years there. We really got to know the people in the town.”
Matyasovsky said throughout interviews for the documentary, the crew never wanted to take someone’s words out of context or manipulate anyone’s perspective. 
“The town of Marion felt that they were portrayed in the national media as ‘Hickville’ or a bunch of people who didn’t understand or respect anybody,” Matyasovsky said. “I hope that it’s clear that isn’t true. This bad thing should have never happened. But that also doesn’t mean that every single individual in the town is bad. And we all need to work hard to try to prevent these things from happening in the future.”
Meyer said he hopes the documentary will help break stereotypes of the people of Marion along with shining a light on the long-term implications of the raids. 
“We need to make sure that we understand that this is a town where, yes, something bad happened here. But we’re fixing it,” Meyer said. “We want to show this is a town where we won’t tolerate government overreach and bullying. Hopefully, the message is that Marion isn’t the backwater where they try to sit on the First Amendment, but rather when things come up, we deal with it.”
Through telling the story of Marion, “Seized” will serve as a reminder to the nation to remain holding people of power accountable, Meyer said. 
“This is all part of a trend that’s going on in the country of people wanting to use positions of power to bully and limit free speech,” Meyer said. “It’s the fundamental nature of democracy. We shouldn’t hide our heads in shame. Sometimes the best thing to do when something bad happens is to get out in front of it and not let it happen again.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA150879-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-26 09:57:31.444356

(Julia Goldberg/Source NM)Donald Trump was sworn in to office as the president of the United States for the second time on Jan. 20. Within hours, he’d signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, prompting New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, then co-chair of the U.S. Climate Alliance, to co-sign a letter refuting the withdrawal. That evening, he issued pardons for nearly all the Jan. 6 defendants. Shortly thereafter, he signed an executive order ending birthright citizenship.
Dear President Trump: NM delegation calls out federal administration

And that was just the beginning. Disruptions, changes and overhauls of federal programs and policies characterized the Trump administration all year long. They included cuts to national programs for education, health and food, along with ongoing efforts to reshape policy policies ranging from public land use to elections.
New Mexico state and federal officials responded in a variety of ways. Lujan Grisham called two special legislative sessions to address cuts in federal funding and allocated $30 million to address shortfalls in food benefits through the United States Department of Agriculture’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. New Mexico’s five-member federal delegation—all Democrats—registered opposition through letters, news conferences and proposed legislation.
As 2025 draws to a close, Source NM rounds up a non-exhaustive list of highlights from a year of federal fallout for the state. We also spoke with New Mexico U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján, U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham about their impressions of the last year. In the coming days, we’ll take a more in depth look at the top immigration, environment and education stories of 2025.

Funding cuts threaten programs for New Mexico

At the end of January, the federal Office of Management and Budget announced the government would temporarily stop payments on a variety of programs, prompting outcry from the state’s congressional delegation and a lawsuit from attorneys general across the country, including New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez. NM’s AG subsequently launched an online portal for programs impacted by the federal freeze to report the impact, which remains active and now includes an interactive map. The delegation continued to push back at what members described as “chaos” created at the start of the year through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury,of New Mexico’s 1st Congressional District introducing in February a bill titled the Nobody Elected Elon Musk Act. Cuts to programs for firefighters, farmers, children and more prompted ongoing opposition from the state’s federal delegation.



Luján: Trump ‘lied to the American people’

Source NM asked U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) to reflect on the first year of Donald Trump’s second term. The following has been edited for concision and clarity.
“When President Trump was running for his second term, President Trump ran on making everything more affordable for the American people. He said, in one form or another, that he would lower the cost of health care, that he would lower the cost of food, that everything would be more affordable under him. To the contrary, we’ve seen food prices go up.
The blanket tariff policy that President Trump keeps bragging about is making food more expensive. It’s making Christmas more expensive. It’s making holidays more expensive for everyday families across the country. 
He lied to the American people. He said he was going to help them, and I really think he’s hurting them. He’s making things worse for them.”



Trump kicks off immigration crackdown

Upon taking office, Trump signed multiple executive orders kicking off an ongoing immigration crackdown, including ones declaring an emergency at the U.S. border with Mexico; ending asylum for immigrants; and ending birthright citizenship. NM AG Torrez joined a coalition of AGs that immediately mounted a legal challenge to the latter order. That order has been blocked by numerous judges this year. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to take it up in 2026. In addition, his administration swapped out public land on the state’s border to the U.S Army and declared it a new “military” zone. The federal departments of justice and homeland security also issued warnings to jurisdictions with so-called “sanctuary” policies. Recent new data showed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested more than 1,800 immigrants in New Mexico in the first 10 months of 2025, more than 12 times as many as the same period last year.
Health care, food benefits cause partisan standoffs

At the start of October, the New Mexico Legislature held a one-day special session in order to allocate funds to blunt the impact of federal funding cuts, and address expiring Affordable Care Act tax insurance premiums. Those tax credits became a sticking point in federal budget negotiations and led to the government shutdown that ran from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12. By mid-month, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture had announced it would not be paying for SNAP food benefits come November if the government shutdown continued. Lujan Grisham, in turn, at the end of the month announced the state would allocate $30 million to pay for those benefits come Nov. 1. The governor called lawmakers back to the Roundhouse again Nov. 10 to approve an allocation of up to $162.5 million to cover statewide food assistance through the start of next year in case it’s needed.

Source NM spoke with New Mexico Gov. Lujan Grisham about leading the state during the first year of Donald Trump’s second term as president, and her advice for the next governor—Lujan Grisham’s second term ends in January of 2027—about how to navigate the Trump administration. The following has been edited for clarity and concision.
“I don’t want New Mexicans going into the end of the year, and starting the new year with despair, because it’s an easy place to go, particularly in a state that relies on Medicaid and SNAP and emergency relief funds and [Federal Emergency Management Agency]…I mean all the things, right? I want, particularly this holiday season, for them feel more like they’ve come first for the state of New Mexico, and for everything they throw, we work hard to have your back to the highest degree.
We’ve been very thoughtful about how we save and identify resources so that we’ve got the flexibility to meet these needs, because [Trump] thrives on chaos. He wants people to be apathetic and to give up, and he takes the fight out of you, and he’s not going to take the fight out of this governor. I’m not going to let people suffer without trying every single thing, including joining every lawsuit against the administration.”
Advice for the next governor:
“Don’t wait. Have a strategy. Engage all your local policy makers. Have money set aside all the time. Don’t forget the power of this state’s reserves to have them when you need them.”



Federal government pushes states for voter data

In July, the U.S. Department of Justice  began asking state election officials, including New Mexico, for their voter rolls. New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver told Source at the time her office was “reviewing whether or not we are legally able to prevent sending the private data, which would be Social Security, all dates of birth and driver’s license numbers.” 
NM Secretary of State signs letter to feds about voter roll data

Ultimately, the New Mexico Secretary of State says it provided the federal government with publicly available data roll information, which excluded Social Security numbers and full dates of birth. On Dec. 2, the US DOJ announced it was suing New Mexico and several other states for not providing the requested data. That case remains pending; at the end of December, Common Cause New Mexico and two residents filed a motion to intervene in the case.



Leger Fernández: ‘Every time America has been in its darkest moments, we have come out of it with renewed purpose’

Source NM spoke with U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, a Democrat who represents New Mexico’s 3rd Congressional District, on her reflections about 2025; what she thinks will happen in the new year; and why she has participated in the No Kings rallies. The following has been edited for clarity and concision.
“Even as Trump has been causing such pain, has been engaged in such corruption, has been willfully raising costs on New Mexicans and the American public, we’ve fought back, and there have been some good things too. I mean, not because of Trump, but that we’ve been able to accomplish from New Mexico as well.
What we are doing in the [United States House of Representatives] right now is utilizing the discharge petition [a procedural tool to force a floor vote], because in the House, the vast majority of Republicans are in lock step with Trump. They refuse to stand up for the constituents because they’re too busy bowing down to Trump. But there are some moderates who are also in districts that are at risk, who realize that they will lose their job in the midterms if they don’t start responding to their constituent needs. So I think that the political landscape next year is going to make a big difference, and the fact that Trump is seen now as more of a lame duck, that we’re going to start seeing a difference. 
I love the No Kings marches. I think what they do is they show that the American people have a voice and we are willing to take to the streets to raise up our voices. I often talk about how it’s a demonstration of how we belong to each other and with each other in this effort to reclaim our country, but also to bring hope and to recognize that across history, every time America has been in its darkest moments, we have come out of it with renewed purpose, with renewed vision and we have walked into the light of what is possible under The American promise of building a more perfect union.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/betterlceanup-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-26 09:57:31.444356

Here are some of the housing angles that drew our focus at CommonWealth Beacon this year. 
The persistent MBTA Communities fight
This showpiece 2021 housing law requiring multifamily zoning near the MBTA system survived a Supreme Judicial Court challenge, spawned 40 bills on Beacon Hill, and sparked a degree of political soul-searching even among its biggest backers. At a national pro-housing conference in September, advocates who spent years championing the law acknowledged it was “too effing complicated” – its town-by-town approach designed to give municipalities leeway but also creating endless room for resistance. 
Towns like Milton and Duxbury finally fell in line after the state’s high court agreed that Attorney General Andrea Campbell could enforce the law, and a lower court judge waved away challenges claiming lawmakers had created an “unfunded mandate” for cities and towns. But the delayed compliance and ongoing legal vexations kept the statute’s core state versus local control tension in the spotlight. 
Even optimistic projections suggest MBTA Communities might yield just 40,000 units over 10 years – a step to be sure, but nowhere near the 222,000 units Gov. Maura Healey’s administration projects the state will need in the next decade. And even as the final deadline for compliance looms – December 31 for the last group of towns – the fight is headed back to the state’s high court. 
Climate and housing collide
From worsening flooding to wildfires, climate change isn’t coming for Massachusetts housing – it’s already here. 
Experts warn that in 10 to 15 years, large swaths of the country may lack mortgages because insurance markets are failing across entire regions. Meanwhile, FEMA expanded flood maps putting thousands of Bay State homes in new risk zones. 
A federal retreat is complicating the crisis. The Trump administration ended FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program in April, pulling back $882 billion in climate preparedness funding (which a district judge has since ordered restored), then cut a fifth of the agency’s workforce and scrubbed coastal erosion prediction tools from its website – maps that Nantucket and other communities relied on for risk planning. 
And it is getting hotter, with drought conditions worsening by the end of summer 2025 after a brutal wildfire season the year before. As the state seeks to build more housing, it will need to grapple with climate threats from all sides, carving away at land once considered to be a safe bet for homeowners.  
Mixed federal messages on housing
When the Trump administration abruptly cut $30 million in grants to 78 fair housing organizations nationwide in February – part of the administration’s battle with the specter of “DEI” – Massachusetts ended up in the thick of it. Four national and local nonprofits sued, and a federal judge ordered HUD to reinstate the funding after determining the cuts violated congressional appropriations and administrative law. 
The temporary victory came with a warning: With HUD proposing a 76 percent staffing cut to its fair housing enforcement division, the infrastructure to combat housing discrimination remains under threat.  
While slashing fair housing resources, the administration also offered a seemingly contradictory approach to housing tax credits. The showpiece tax bill enacted over the summer expanded the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, while the president proposed reducing funding for rental assistance programs like Section 8, which help cover housing costs for low-income tenants.  
Add in the hard-to-assess Opportunity Zone program, which is pitched as a way to encourage development in areas that struggle to attract investor dollars, and the Trump approach to encouraging new and affordable housing starts to look like a strategy resting mostly on reducing taxes for developers while leaving social supports and subsidies to help low-income tenants off to the side. 
Lawsuits grapple with murky mortgage products 
Attorney General Andrea Campbell’s consumer protection division spent time in 2025 probing financial products that blur the line between helping homeowners and exploiting them.  
Her first-in-the-nation enforcement action against Boston-based Hometap argues the company’s home equity investments – giving the company a share of the house’s value in exchange for an infusion of cash – are actually illegal reverse mortgages disguised as investments. A Suffolk Superior Court judge let the case proceed in August, setting up a showdown over whether these largely unregulated products need to follow consumer protection rules. 
A politically explosive housing case involved BlueHub Capital, a Roxbury nonprofit whose CEO is a longtime Healey donor. A Superior Court judge ruled in September that BlueHub’s shared appreciation mortgages – which helped distressed homeowners avoid foreclosure but claimed a cut of future home equity – violated multiple consumer protection laws. The ruling came a year after the Legislature passed and Healey signed an economic development bill containing language exempting nonprofit shared appreciation mortgages from those very laws.  
In mid-November, after initially digging in its heels on the program’s integrity, BlueHub announced it was “pausing” these mortgage offerings. 
Rent control’s comeback
Three decades after Massachusetts voters banned rent control by ballot measure, the question may head before a new generation of voters. A coalition of advocates collected enough signatures to put a statewide rent stabilization measure on the 2026 ballot. If it passes, the initiative would cap annual rent increases at 5 percent or at the rate of inflation, whichever is lower, for most buildings across the state. 
The real estate industry is already gearing up for what could be one of the most expensive ballot fights in recent memory, calling it “the most restrictive rent control program in the entire United States.” 
The campaign splits even progressive allies, some of whom worry that proposing a blanket statewide cap on rents, rather than allowing individual communities to opt in, could hurt its chances. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who proposed her own rent stabilization policy in 2023, called the ballot measure “quite restrictive” and said she’d have preferred a local-option approach. But tenant advocates, who say Beacon Hill has ignored their calls for action year after year, see rising rents straining household budgets across the state, and they’re betting that voters will support the measure.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Top_5-Housing.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-26 09:11:40.823845

(Photo by Jacques Julien/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Public school students can’t use their cellphone during school hours, and the state Department of Education wants nearly $18 million to explain why.
As part of an initiative to get students off their phones, the agency is asking legislators for money to buy curriculum explaining the negative effects of screen time. The education department would partner with ScreenStrong, a North Carolina-based nonprofit that sells books and courses educating children and their parents about how screens can hinder learning and other parts of their lives.
“The evidence is overwhelming: screen overuse is a root driver of the student mental health and absenteeism crises facing schools nationwide,” reads an agency budget request. “Yet while families and teachers see the impact daily, few have access to clear, science­-based guidance for how to help.”
Research has shown that screens can have some benefit for education and learning, but using phones and social media excessively can disrupt children’s development and lead to lower attention spans, worse academic performance and diminished social skills.
If the agency gets the money, it will give all third- through eighth-graders books written for their age groups explaining how their brains work and how too much phone usage can cause problems. The books also offer alternative activities, encouraging children to play and talk to their peers, according to the nonprofit.
SC Board of Education passes statewide cellphone ban for K-12 public schools

After an initial year of providing the books to all students in elementary and middle school, the agency would switch to only students in third and sixth grades, according to the budget request. How schools would teach students this material is not explained in the request.
“Together, we will work with parents, educators, and community partners to reclaim students’ attention, restore genuine connection with peers and families, and strengthen the foundation for academic and behavioral well-being,” the request reads.
Keeping students off their phones has been a priority for the department in recent years, mirroring a similar push across the country.
Under a state policy approved in September 2024, students at all schools must keep their phones and connected devices, such as smartwatches, off and away from the time the first bell rings in the morning until the dismissal bell rings in the afternoon.
Districts had the discretion to create stricter bans, such as telling students not to bring their phones to school at all or requiring them to place their phones in locked pouches. The state provided districts about $2 million from a fund meant for security purposes last year to lock up students’ phones, including with pouches, designated lockers or cubbies.
Any school district that didn’t pass a ban at least as strict as the state-level policy by the beginning of 2025 risked losing state funding, but all schools met the deadline, an agency spokesman said previously.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cellphone-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-26 09:11:40.823845

(Photo courtesy of University of Iowa)Research led by a University of Iowa student is opening new doors to potential uterine cancer treatments that could allow patients to regain their health while retaining their ability to have children, the university reported.
Katie Colling, a fourth-year doctoral candidate in the UI cancer biology program, has found promising results from testing different types of drugs aimed at balancing hormones in the uterus — called progestins — on cell cultures created from patient tumor tissue, according to a university news release.
Most uterine cancer cases are caught early, Colling said, and are treated with a surgery that removes the uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries. This leaves these patients without the ability to have children. Surgery isn’t always viable, however, for patients with other health factors or those planning to have children, and the current progestins used for uterine cancer treatment are not effective for everyone.

“The problem with these drugs is that they don’t work for every patient. So some patients respond well initially, but for up to 40% of them, their cancer actually comes back, and that’s not a good thing,” Colling said in an interview. “Currently, there are only three progestins used in the clinic, or three hormone therapies, yet over 20 are used for other purposes in women’s health, such as contraception, and we don’t understand which is most effective for treating uterine cancer.”
Uterine cancer is the fourth-most common cancer in women and the fifth-most common cause of cancer death in the U.S., Colling said, and it recently passed ovarian cancer to become the deadliest form of gynecologic cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute, the cancer’s five-year survival rate between 2016-2021 was just over 80%, and close to 14,000 people have died of uterine cancer in 2025.
Working in the lab of obstetrics and gynecology researcher and UI professor Kristina Thiel, Colling said she has spent the past two-and-a-half years testing different progestins on cell cultures from tumors called “organoids” to see how they impact tumor growth and cell death within it.
She called the results she’s seen so far “really promising.”
“I have compared a large panel of progestins to those that are currently being used in the clinic, and I have identified five that are performing better than those currently used to treat patients,” Colling said.
Colling’s work had a big hand in earning the UI, as well as the University of New Mexico, University of Utah and University of Kansas, a five-year, $12.8 million grant from the National Cancer Institute, Thiel said.
The University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center is the lead organization on the project, titled “Advancing Hormone Therapy for Endometrial Cancer” and awarded its funding in August, and the UI team will receive around $500,000 annually to continue with its work testing progestins.
“Some of the data that Katie generated were integral to us getting this funding from the National Cancer Institute,” Thiel said.
Next steps in Colling’s work include taking the top progestin candidates she’s identified and testing them in mice, with the data from that phase planned to be combined with data from other institutions and used for clinical trials.
Spreading awareness
Colling’s passion for her work is driven by both academic and personal reasons, she said. The student researcher said she first got interested in cancer-specific research during a summer internship at New York University, and it was during that same summer that she learned her grandmother’s breast cancer had returned after 15 years of remission and metastasized “practically everywhere.”
“From that point on, I kind of saw her navigate the challenges and toxicities associated with cancer treatment and that really inspired me to research safer and more effective therapies for cancer patients,” Colling said.
One question Colling said she’s asked herself is why, with so many progestin options available and being used for other means, they haven’t been tried for uterine cancer treatment. The current progestin treatments have been utilized since the 1970s, and she said women’s health has been traditionally under-researched. This is why she said she’s “really excited” to further this study and advance cancer treatment therapies.
Both Colling and Thiel emphasized that the public should be educated about their research, as well as signs of cancer developing and other information to keep them safe and healthy. Colling recently won the 2025 Three Minute Thesis competition on campus, where she had to explain her research in language the general public would understand in three minutes.
One fact Thiel called “absolutely alarming” is that mortality related to uterine cancer is worse today than in the 1970s.
“I personally want women to know that abnormal bleeding that is not typical is one of the earliest signs of uterine cancer, and just go to the doctor and get checked for it, because early detection really is important,” Thiel said.

From the near-daily hand-wringing about the Trump administration’s latest actions to the prospect of voters seizing massive policymaking power in 2026 through a raft of ballot questions, state leaders spent much of the year sighing deeply and staring up at the ceiling.
Sure, there was some action, like banning renter-paid broker fees. But with most lawmaking decisions expected in the second year of the two-year term, and statewide officeholders up for reelection in 2026, this year featured far more sowing than reaping.
Here’s a look at the top five storylines that dominated the politics and policy landscape in 2025.
Trump’s second term upends Beacon Hill
This time a year ago, the Democrats who hold all the reins of state power were bracing for Donald Trump’s return to the White House after four years under President Joe Biden.
Today, those officials would likely say Trump’s second term has been even more damaging than they expected.
For most of the year, it seemed like Gov. Maura Healey, Attorney General Andrea Campbell, and legislative leaders were putting out — from their perspective — one federal fire after another. They careened through responses to major deportation efforts, offshore wind upheaval, disruption to food aid, and a new federal law that will reshape state budgets for years to come.
Reacting to the Trump administration became such a common thread that Senate President Karen Spilka and her deputies began branding some of their work, like an expanded law Healey signed shielding reproductive and transgender care from out-of-state or federal incursions, with the moniker “Response 2025.”
Many Massachusetts officeholders on the left are once again defining themselves in contrast to Trump, while Republicans here are still trying to thread the needle to show support for a president who remains unpopular among most Bay State voters.
Fiscal storm clouds continue to darken
Where would Massachusetts be without the millionaires tax?
The voter-approved surtax on the state’s highest earners — whose revenue must go to either transportation or education investments — has been mostly responsible for any bright lights in the state’s budgetary outlook over the past year, even if it might be due for a slight dip in the near future. All other tax collections (i.e., those that do not have specific constitutional limits on how they can be spent) are sluggish, employment growth has been flat for two-plus years, and state spending continues to rise at a significant clip.
And that’s all before accounting for the impending impacts of the federal reconciliation package, which officials say will trim $946 million in state tax revenue over a two-year period and shrink funding for health care by hundreds of millions of dollars.
State budget math has never been easy, but lately it’s as if the 10th-grade algebra problems have been replaced with college-level differential equations.
Continued cannabis chaos prompts reforms
Shannon O’Brien is back at the top of the Cannabis Control Commission more than two years after Treasurer Deborah Goldberg tried to oust her, but the regulatory agency and the industry it oversees remain in choppy waters.
The five-member panel is still operating shorthanded, a status it claimed for much of the year, and pressure points like the “wild west” of host community agreements continue to create headaches.
Stability could be on the way. After the controversy reached a boiling point, lawmakers advanced major reforms to the CCC’s operations and oversight of the industry itself. House and Senate negotiators still need to buff out some differences between their chambers’ versions of the bill, a compromise that’s more a question of when than if.
The commission is also checking off some items that have long lingered on its to-do list. Social consumption, often described colloquially as “pot cafes,” are on the verge of launching with the CCC’s latest blessing.
There’s another prospective disruption on the horizon, though: the 2026 ballot.
Opponents of recreational marijuana use, which voters legalized in 2016, are pushing a ballot question that would essentially revoke that authorization a decade later. The measure still has several hurdles to clear, as do 10 other proposals that could form a record-breaking field.
Legislature takes a long look in the mirror
It quickly became clear that legislative leaders did not like all the bad press they earned for last year’s chaotic wrap-up.
Speaking to fellow lawmakers to kick off the 2025-2026 term, House Speaker Ron Mariano lamented the “naysayers who couldn’t write enough about how incompetent we were.” A few hours later, Spilka contended that the Legislature’s “accomplishments are consistently overshadowed by a persistent negative media narrative.”
The scrutiny did achieve results, though. In June, after a characteristically long House-Senate negotiation punctuated with occasional disagreements, the Democrats who control both branches rolled out a package of internal rules reforms intended to make legislative operations more efficient and transparent.
Joint committees can now advance bills more quickly without first needing to secure buy-in from both representatives and senators, summaries must be published to make business more comprehensible to constituents, and some deadlines will work differently.
The most impactful changes are most likely backloaded. July 31, 2026, now marks the date by which major legislation needs to be passed by both branches and enter negotiations, not the date by which the House and Senate essentially need to reach compromise on anything significant — meaning the final few months of next year can still play host to substantial cross-branch bargaining and deliberations.
Theoretically, that should alleviate some of the end-of-session backlog that’s become notorious.
Maybe, just maybe, the July 31 lawmaking session will end before the sun rises the next day.
Audit law falls down a well
Sometimes, a landslide electoral victory just isn’t enough.
More than seven in 10 voters agreed to make clear in state law that the auditor has the power to examine the House and Senate, but more than a year after the body politic spoke, little has come of it.
Mariano and Spilka, long critical of Auditor Diana DiZoglio and her relentless approach, continue to insist that allowing her office to probe the Legislature represents a breach of the constitutional separation of powers. DiZoglio wants to litigate their arguments in court, but can’t do so without involvement from Attorney General Andrea Campbell, who says the auditor has not fulfilled all the necessary prerequisites for the next step.
Neither DiZoglio nor Campbell seem happy about the way their feud has stretched for months. Mariano and Spilka, meanwhile, have been mostly able to keep the curtain closed the way they wanted, offering up much smaller-scale external audits as an attempt at transparency.
The debate doesn’t end with the audit. DiZoglio has newly set her sights on another ballot question that would subject the governor’s office and the Legislature to the state’s public records law.
If legislative leaders keep information under lock and key from the auditor, her thinking goes, might as well circumvent their constitutional concerns and make it accessible to the public from the get-go.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Top_5-Beacon-Hill.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-26 08:56:52.023685

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) A Des Moines surgeon accused of negligence and wrongful death has agreed to pay a $2,500 civil penalty for inadequate management of medical records in the case.
According to the Iowa Board of Medicine, Dr. Marc Miller performed an outpatient, robotic-assisted laparoscopic hernia repair on a male patient on May 22, 2020. The patient was discharged later that day. The following day, the patient reported intense pain and swelling and was advised by Miller that the condition was normal and would likely resolve itself in a few days, the board alleges.
According to the board, Miller did not direct the patient to the emergency room or advise him to seek other forms of medical attention, and no entries were created in the patient’s medical record to document the report of pain and swelling.

Ultimately, the patient decided to go the emergency room on the afternoon of May 26, 2020, due to continued pain and swelling. His condition deteriorated as he went into septic shock, emergency surgery was performed and the patient died a few days later.
Earlier this month, more than five years after the patient’s death, the Iowa Board of Medicine charged Miller with one count of improper management of medical records in the case.
To settle the case, Miller agreed to accept a warning from the board and pay a $2,500 civil penalty. In addition, he agreed to complete what the board calls a “live, interactive course on medical records documentation.”
Court records indicate the patient in the hernia-repair case was 51-year-old Victor Untrauer of Polk County and that the surgery was performed at the surgical clinic of UnityPoint Health in Des Moines.
According to the Untrauer’s estate, which later sued Miller for wrongful death, Miller perforated Untrauer’s bowel during surgery, failed to discover the error during the course of the operation, and then closed the incision.
The lawsuit alleged Untrauer called Miller the next day to report severe pain and swelling. “Miller returned Victor’s call in the early afternoon of May 23, 2020,” the lawsuit alleged. “Miller was on call and in a hurry. Miller said Victor’s intense pain was ‘normal’ and would take quite a few days to go away.”
Untrauer “remained in intense pain for the next several days,” the lawsuit alleged, and told others he was in “agony” and, “I’m hurting so bad I can’t even try to lay down in the bed.” On May 26, 2020, the lawsuit alleged, Untrauer spoke to one of Miller’s agents, who reiterated Miller’s assurance that the pain was normal and did not require medical intervention.
Several hours later, Untrauer “decided on his own to go to the emergency room” where he went into septic shock and emergency surgery was performed. “During surgery, he went into cardiac arrest and had to be given CPR for 20 minutes and shocked five times,” the lawsuit alleged. “He suffered overwhelming multisystem organ failure … and died on May 29, 2020.”
Miller and UnityPoint Health denied any wrongdoing. In May 2023, the Untrauer family’s lawsuit was settled out of court. The terms of the settlement were not made public.

,California,2025-12-26 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,New California laws rewrite car-buying rules with return policy and pricing reforms,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/12/california-new-law-buying-cars/,California lawmakers let automakers opt out of recent changes to the state’s lemon law and approved a law giving used car buyers three days to return a used vehicle.,"In summary
California lawmakers let automakers opt out of recent changes to the state’s lemon law and approved a law giving used car buyers three days to return a used vehicle. 


California lawmakers made major changes to the state’s car-buying rules this year, including a  controversial rewrite of the state law that allows buyers to get their money back if they are sold a defective vehicle and a right to return a used vehicle within three days.
After an intense lobbying push this year from automobile companies, dealers and consumer groups, more legislative battles over California vehicle purchases could follow in 2026. Sky-high car prices show no signs of falling, and a Republican-led Congress and the Trump administration have sought to thwart Newsom’s goal of having 100% of new cars sold in California be zero-emission by 2035. 
Sen. Ben Allen, a Democrat representing the El Segundo area, said he expects California’s Democratic-controlled Legislature will likely push back against national Republicans’ attack on California’s vehicle policies in some form next year, though he said it wasn’t yet clear how.
“We’re very committed to this path, so stay tuned, but clean air is a priority for our state,” said Allen, who chairs the Senate’s Select Committee on Transitioning to a Zero-Emission Energy Future. 
In the meantime, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Allen’s Senate Bill 766, creating a first-in-the-nation policy that allows a buyer to return a used vehicle for a full refund within three days if the purchase price was less than $50,000. Dealers can charge a restocking fee. 
The law, which takes effect in October, also contains other protections for buyers intended to prevent them from getting suckered.

 Democrat, State Senate, District 24 (El Segundo)



Car dealers will have to tell a potential buyer — including in advertisements and initial written communications — the actual price of a vehicle instead of an unrealistic advertised price. Potential buyers will also have to be informed of the full financing costs and lease terms. 
The law also prohibits dealers from charging for add-ons that have no benefit to the buyer, such as free oil changes for electric vehicles — which don’t need oil changes.“That is a huge deal,” said Rosemary Shahan of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, which championed the bill. “It’s historic. It’s going to make cars more affordable.”
Allen said he came up with the idea for the bill after shopping for a used car in 2024. He said he wanted to see what it was like trying to buy a used car in California and didn’t tell the various dealerships he visited that he was a state senator.“I was kind of shocked by the hustle and the extent to which prices were quoted online and that ended up not really being truthful,” he said.He ended up buying a 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E, an electric vehicle.
Newsom blocked document fee increase
Most bills take effect immediately the year after they are signed, but lawmakers delayed the implementation of Allen’s bill until October to give dealers time to change their paperwork, amend their contracts and change their signs to meet the new law’s requirements.
Brian Maas, president of the California New Car Dealers Association, said the law should make buying a used car more transparent and easier for consumers.
“The bill certainly is a net positive in terms of more transparency about the total price and advertising,” he said. 
But he said the new law “clearly imposed more responsibility on dealers,” which is why Maas said his group was extremely frustrated Newsom vetoed its bill that would have allowed dealers to raise document-processing fees by $175.  
Senate Bill 791 would have raised the fees dealers can charge to process Department of Motor Vehicles and other paperwork from the current cap of $85 to up to 1% of the purchase price, capped at $260.
Maas said dealers were frustrated by Newsom’s veto message which said the fee increase wasn’t necessary because the state had imposed “no new state requirements” on car dealers. 
Maas said it was “especially frustrating that the veto message somewhat cavalierly said there are no new state requirements when the governor signed just such requirements a week earlier.”
Before the veto, SB 791 passed the Legislature overwhelmingly and with bipartisan support. The California New Car Dealers Association has donated at least $3 million to legislators since 2015, according to the Digital Democracy database. 
Maas said there are so many forms car buyers must fill out, almost all of them stemming from a law the Legislature passed, they’re getting to be like click-through agreements on websites that everyone just agrees to without actually reading.
“You shove form after form after form in front of consumers,” he said. “Consumers just tune it out, turn it off, and say, ‘You know what? I just want to know what my monthly payment is, what’s the interest rate, what the total price of the car is. And then let’s go. Why do I have to sit in here for a half hour or an hour and fill out all these forms?’ ”
Consumers face a watered-down lemon law
Newsom also signed Senate Bill 26, a bill that allows car manufacturers to opt out of changes to the state’s lemon law that gives consumers a right to get their money back if they buy a defective vehicle — sometimes referred to as a “lemon.” 
The result is that California car buyers have different legal protections under the state’s lemon law depending on which brand they buy.
The bill Newsom signed was in response to a law lawmakers hastily passed at the end of the 2024 legislative session, watering down the state’s 55-year-old landmark lemon law. Some 
auto companies, namely GM and Ford, were being sued so often for allegedly selling so many lemons that state courts were clogged with lawsuits. 
The companies and some attorney groups persuaded lawmakers and Newsom to pass legislation in 2024 that shrank the length of time a car buyer could sue under the lemon law to just six years instead of the entire life of a vehicle’s warranty
Last year’s legislation also puts more onus on car owners to initiate claims, not auto companies.
But other companies that don’t get sued as often for selling defective vehicles, such as Toyota and Honda, opposed the rule change. Those companies said the new law didn’t give them time to prepare their best defense
Newsom ended up reluctantly signing the 2024 bill, but he urged the Legislature to come back with a new bill in 2025 that would allow companies to opt out of the changes. SB 26 passed overwhelmingly and Newsom signed it.
Meanwhile, several car companies, including Ford and GM and dozens of RV and motorcycle manufacturers, opted in to the 2024 law this year.

As federal funding reductions and policy changes rippled through the health care system, California confronted service cuts, coverage losses and growing uncertainty.
During the summer, a congressionally-approved spending plan slashed nearly a trillion dollars from the Medicaid program over the next decade. Funding cuts and new rules – such as work requirements – are expected to push 3.4 million Californians off their Medicaid coverage as changes take effect.
In Washington, a dispute over whether to renew enhanced premium subsidies that help keep Affordable Care Act marketplace insurance plans affordable prompted the longest shutdown in history. Absent federal action, hundreds of thousands of people could be priced out of Covered California insurance in 2026. More than 2,300 Dreamers in California have already lost access to the state marketplace: The Trump administration overturned a rule that had allowed undocumented people brought to the country as children to buy subsidized health insurance. 
Federal immigration raids prompted undocumented people to skip care, and families reported worsening mental health, and federal anti-trans policies pushed providers to scale back on gender-affirming care.
Shifting federal policy forced the state the state to inject millions into Planned Parenthood to try to keep clinics afloat. Anticipating more restrictive federal immunization rules under U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, California advanced its own vaccine guidelines.
Federal changes weren’t the only reversal. State budget constraints and overspending in the Medi-Cal program led California to freeze new enrollment for undocumented people and cut some costly benefits, such as weight loss drugs. 
On affordability, Gov. Newsom delivered on his promise to cut down the cost of insulin. In 2026, diabetics will be able to purchase long-acting insulin pens at pharmacies for $11 a pen. After CalMatters shed a light on disappearing birth centers, state lawmakers approved a new law improving access in underserved areas, streamlining licensure requirements so that birth centers can more easily contract with Medicaid.
2026 outlook
The Legislative Analyst’s Office projects that Medi-Cal spending will continue to grow. Paired with the uncertainty of federal funding cuts, lawmakers may again seek ways to control costs and weigh priorities. 
As federal spending cuts phase in, they’ll have implications for hospitals and other providers, such as an uptick in uncompensated care.

Starting Jan. 1, a new law will take effect requiring most tortillas and corn masa products sold in the state to contain folic acid, a vitamin that’s important to infant health.
Latinas in California are far less likely than other women to get enough folic acid early in pregnancy — a gap that can lead to life-altering birth defects. 
State data show that, between 2017 and 2019 – the latest years for which state data is available – about 28% of Latinas reported taking folic acid the month before becoming pregnant. White women took the vitamin at a higher rate, with 46% of them reporting consuming folic acid,  according to the California Department of Public Health. 
This puts Latinas at higher risk of having a baby born with neural tube defects — defects of the brain and spinal cord. Some examples of that are conditions like spina bifida and anencephaly.
Research has shown that folic acid can reduce birth defects by up to 70%. That’s why it’s found in prenatal vitamins. But because women may not find out they are pregnant until weeks or months after, public health has long recommended that folic acid also be added to staple foods. 
In 1998, the U.S. required manufacturers to fortify certain grain products with folic acid, such as pasta, rice, and cereals, to help women of reproductive age get the necessary amounts. Since that rule took effect, the rate of babies born with neural tube defects dropped by about a third, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
But even with the addition to these foods, birth defect rates among babies born to Latinas have been consistently higher. In search of a more culturally appropriate addition, in 2016, the federal government allowed makers of corn masa to add folic acid to their foods – but didn’t require it.
Joaquin Arambula, a Democrat from Fresno, who authored the law said leaving folic acid out of corn masa products, used in many Latino staple foods, was a “real oversight.” 
Now, with the implementation of Assembly Bill 1830, California is the first state to require folic acid in corn masa products. The law requires manufacturers that do business in the state to add 0.7 milligrams of folic acid to every pound of flour and to list the addition in their nutrition labels. The law makes exemptions for small batch producers like restaurants and markets that might make their own tortillas from scratch.
Months after California’s law was signed, Alabama passed its own version. Its law goes into effect in June 2026. 
Some large manufacturers have already been adding folic acid to their products for years. Gruma, the parent company of Mission Foods, said it started fortifying its foods back in 2016, when the federal government first allowed it. A company spokesperson said Gruma “has a longstanding commitment to supporting legislative fortification initiatives” and supports the new laws in California and Alabama.

Gavin Newsom in 2025 announced the closure of another prison, a shutdown that's possible because the state is incarcerating far fewer people than it did just a decade ago.","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2025 announced the closure of another prison, a shutdown that’s possible because the state is incarcerating far fewer people than it did just a decade ago.


A year after Californians voted for a conservative shift in criminal justice policy, they began to see the results. 
Proposition 36, approved by voters last year, gave prosecutors the ability to charge people convicted of various third-time drug offenses with a so-called treatment-mandated felony – a choice between behavioral health treatment or up to three years in jail or prison. 
In the law’s first six months, 9,000 people were charged with a treatment-mandated felony and nearly 15% — or 1,290 people — elected treatment. Of the 771 people placed into treatment, 25 had completed it by the end of June. 
Conditions for incarcerated people were once again the subject of litigation and controversy. The state of California sued the Los Angeles County jail system, citing “inhumane conditions” and a “shocking rate of deaths.”
With temperatures inside some prisons reaching 95 degrees each summer, advocates for the incarcerated demanded air conditioning. The state responded by launching a $38 million pilot test of cooling systems and new insulation over the next four years at three of the department’s 31 prisons. Results of the test are not expected until mid-2029.
The prison population itself is dropping, in part because of changes to sentencing laws over the last decade. About 90,000 people are incarcerated in California prisons, down from a peak of about 170,000.
That falling prison population has given Newsom reason to shutter another prison, the fifth of his term. The prison, a former art deco hotel in Riverside County, is slated to close in 2026. The state expects to save about $150 million by closing the prison. 
Prison spending also caught renewed attention from lawmakers, one year after the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation ran out of money. The department is on track to exceed its budget by roughly $850 million over three years despite recent cuts.  
The union representing 25,000 prison guards — among the wealthiest public worker unions in the state – struck a deal for a new contract that gives California some financial relief in the short term but includes a mix of bonuses and raises that would kick in over time. 
2026 outlook: 
Fewer people in prison also gave new life to an effort to put prisoners in single-occupancy cells, a bill that didn’t make it to Gov. Gavin Newsom this year, but is expected to return in 2026.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama lawmaker has pre-filed a bill that would prohibit the use of the term West Bank in all government documents when referring to the Palestinian territory on the Jordan River. 
HB 81, sponsored by Rep. Mark Gidley, R-Hokes Bluff, would require the area to be referenced by its “historically, biblically, and legally accurate” names of “Judea” and “Samaria.” Gidley said in an interview that the change is necessary because the West Bank is left over from the time that Jordan controlled the territory, which is now controlled by Israel.
“It’s just an opportunity to make sure the narrative is correctly identifying the land that Israel controls,” Gidley said.

According to the United Nations, Palestine was put under administration from the United Kingdom in 1922 by the League of Nations and served as a “national home for the Jewish people.” In 1947, the UN took over decisions about Palestine, which proposed an Arab state and Jewish state. Jordan controlled the part of the region known as the West Bank today. In 1967, Israel took over the West Bank and the Gaza Strip after the Six-Day War. 
Conservative lawmakers in  Florida, Tennessee, Arkansas and Missouri have filed identical legislation, though Gidley said he was not inspired by other states or by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who introduced a federal bill in February. He said that the bill would be a way for Alabama to strengthen its support for Israel.
“Alabama is a very strong supporter of Israel, has been since 1943, will be forever,” Gidley said. “I think this just shows the strength of our support.”
He said he has “no idea” if any Alabama government documents refer to the territory as the West Bank. According to the bill, official government material includes “any guidance, rule, material, briefing, press release, communication or work product document.”
Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, the only member of the Alabama Legislature who is Jewish, said in an interview that while he is very proud of is Jewish identity, prohibiting the use of “West Bank” is not the way to reach peace. 
“I don’t think that that’s what most Alabamians are concerned about, what that term is in government documents,” Ensler said. “So in the scheme of a finite legislative session, where we only have so many days to get bills through, I would much rather we focus on the day to day issues impacting people.”
He said that Cotton’s federal proposal is one thing, but it is unnecessary to weigh into the complicated conflict as a state. 
“I do very much appreciate Rep. Gidley’s support for Israel. He’s been very understanding, particularly since October 7, the terrorist attack … I don’t think that it’s something we should be focusing on,” Ensler said.

(Photo via Google Earth)The medical director of a central Iowa health spa has been fined $10,000 for failing to adequately supervise work at the spa.
Earlier this month, the Iowa Board of Medicine charged Dr. Daniel Kollmorgen with violating state standards of practice for medical directors. According to the board, Kollmorgen has served as the medical director of 4Ever Young, a medical spa in Waukee, since July 2024. At the same time, he has allegedly worked two to three days per week in Oskaloosa, 80 miles from the Waukee business.
As medical director at 4Ever Young, Kollmorgen was required by law to review the work of nurse practitioners, which included patient histories, physicals and lab work, the board alleges. When board investigators visited the spa in June 2025, they allegedly observed that Kollmorgen was largely working remotely and was onsite at the spa roughly two to three hours per month.
The board alleges Kollmorgen violated state standards that called for him to be physically located, at all times, within 60 miles of the spa, and which also required him to provide at least four hours per week of in-person staff supervision. “Nor did he provide onsite review of medical aesthetic services,” the board alleged.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)On June 12 this year, editor Patrick Coolican and I sat down with Melissa Hortman to talk about the end of the legislative session. She walked in late carrying her lunch (Panera Bread), and I remember complimenting her fancy ice maker.
On June 14 — a Saturday — I woke up to multiple missed calls from Patrick. This was unusual, because we’re lucky at the Reformer to rarely work weekends. He called to tell me that he heard Hortman had been shot and she may have died.
My colleagues were all out of town that weekend, so it was up to me to go to the press conference. I cried on the way there. I didn’t know Hortman well. I would only speak to her at press events, but it was surreal that someone I had known was killed. So, unfortunately, that day is top of mind for me when I reflect on 2025.
Despite the tragedies at the front of my mind, it was a good year, even if I’m hoping next year will be far different.
The 2024 election resulted in an evenly split 67-67 state House tie between Republicans and Democrats. A judge ruled that one of the House Democrats didn’t meet the state’s residency requirements, meaning that Democrats were down one member. Republicans had a temporary majority, and they intended to use it. This was the catalyst to a historic 2025 legislative session.
Here are some of the memorable Reformer stories I wrote in 2025.
The 2025 legislative session 
To kick off the legislative session earlier this year, House Democrats didn’t show.
The legislators battled over their interpretations of the Minnesota Constitution, which saw the Democrats’ seats empty while Republicans swore in their own speaker. Republicans held floor sessions and voted on bills without Democrats.
House Democrats sued their GOP colleagues and asked the Minnesota Supreme Court to weigh in and find that Republicans weren’t able to elect a speaker or conduct business without them. The state Supreme Court ruled in their favor.
During this time, House Republicans also threatened to unseat a Democratic lawmaker who won a contested race, which caused negotiations between Republicans and Democrats to drag on. But the parties eventually came to an agreement: Seat the Democratic member and Republicans would gain control of the speakership. The DFL boycott lasted for three weeks.
Once the session started in earnest, I wrote about a Minnesota House member making an appearance on the reality show “Love Is Blind.” Her daughter was on the show and decided not to get married (i.e. love wasn’t blind for her.)
The session was well underway when another bombshell dropped in March: GOP state Sen. Justin Eichorn was arrested on suspicion of soliciting sex with a 17-year-old girl. He resigned from the Senate shortly after he was charged.
A slew of intriguing GOP candidates hopped into the race to fill Eichorn’s seat, including the wife of a House member, the son of a former state senator and former Minnesota Republican Party chair Jennifer Carnahan.
Toward the end of the session, legislative leaders spent weeks negotiating a budget behind closed doors. Lawmakers were unable to pass a budget during the regular session, and they needed a one-day special session to pass 14 bills.
Four days after the special session, Hortman was killed in a politically motivated assassination.
Patrick and I wrote a story about Hortman’s legacy. She was a shrewd politician who merely tolerated the spotlight, happily shared credit and accepted blame, eschewed higher office, and by all accounts was motivated chiefly by an interest in public policy, its details and how it could help as many Minnesotans as possible.
Thousands of Minnesotans lined up at the Minnesota Capitol to pay their respects to Melissa and Mark Hortman and their dog Gilbert. Hortman was the first woman to lie in state.
The Hortmans were remembered at their funeral in The Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis.
In July, I traveled to Detroit Lakes to cover the felony burglary trial of Sen. Nicole Mitchell. Mitchell took the stand and told jurors why she broke into her stepmother’s home in 2024.
The jury deliberated for three hours before finding her guilty. Shortly after her conviction, Mitchell resigned from the Minnesota Senate.
More tragedy struck in August — two children were shot and killed at the Annunciation Church in South Minneapolis.
The mass shooting spurred Walz to call for lawmakers to pass an assault weapons ban. Democrats didn’t pass an assault weapons ban when they had a trifecta in 2023 because some Democrats wouldn’t sign onto it.
People close to Walz said the governor was thrown off by the killing of Hortman, who was a friend and governing partner. But the Annunciation shooting appeared to light a fire in Walz to want to provide leadership during crisis, and he announced he would run for an unprecedented third, four-year term as governor.
I wrote about Sen. Omar Fateh’s run for Minneapolis mayor and how he was known for doing whatever it takes to win his priorities.
Last month, I fact-checked Walz when he said Minnesota has universal pre-K. Yeah, we don’t.
I pointed out that the DFL Party was standing by a northern Minnesota party official who has been charged with vehicular homicide. A few days after my story ran, the official resigned.
I was also at Mike Lindell’s Shakopee MyPillow warehouse where he announced he’s running for governor. He even has a bus.
Next year will be all about the governor’s race, which I’m excited to cover. Send me your thoughts or your tips at michelle@minnesotareformer.com",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250609_0089-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-26 08:11:53.107045

The state is holding onto $7 billion in unclaimed funds and property, waiting on their rightful owners to take it all back.
Most is cash, but people have left everything from jewelry to guns to a violin stashed in safe-deposit boxes around the Garden State, said Steve Harris, who has headed the treasury’s unclaimed property administration since 2008. Banks auction the boxes’ contents after five years and forward the proceeds — which amount to about $900,000 a year — to the administration for safekeeping, Harris said.
“People die, or they move and forget about it. Or someone doesn’t tell their wife that they have a box, and the bank opens it up and it’s loaded with cash,” he said.

The agency has returned $3.1 billion in cash and liquidated items since it formed in 1947, including $720 million in the last three years alone, Harris said.
Many of the items in abandoned safe-deposit boxes are gold and silver coins, jewelry, and cash, which could be a fortune, with gold worth over $4,000 an ounce, he said.
Officials also have found half-smoked cigarettes in the boxes, as if their owners dashed off, mid-puff, in the middle of admiring their riches. Sentimental items including Purple Hearts and other military medals sometimes get left behind too, he said.
“We try to find a family, in those cases, to get those medals back to them,” Harris said. “We will not sell those medals.”
The items are secured in a safe space, but Harris declined to say where.
“It’s not like Raiders of the Lost Ark. It’s more like maybe six or seven rows of items,” he said. “We have cameras and everything else, and nobody knows where it is — really only about six people.”

This story was originally reported by Amanda Becker, Orion Rummler and Mariel Padilla of The 19th. Meet Amanda, Orion and Mariel and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
In the months leading up to his election, President Donald Trump insisted that he had nothing to do with the far-right vision for his second administration known as Project 2025, a Christian-nationalist blueprint to remake the federal government. As the year draws to a close, a crowd-sourced effort, as well as trackers from advocacy organizations and labor unions, show that his administration has implemented roughly half of the goals laid out in the document’s 920 pages.
Project 2025 is rooted in injecting narrower interpretations of gender, sexuality and race in federal policy. It calls for ending nearly all of the U.S. government’s efforts to achieve equity, including the collection of data that could be used to track such outcomes across the public and private sectors.
It suggested eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. It also recommended removing out of every rule and regulation terms like sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender equity and gender awareness, along with abortion, reproductive health and reproductive rights.
The blueprint also suggested transforming the FBI into a politically motivated entity, abolishing the Department of Education and dismantling the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA).
The White House has made progress on all these fronts — through a series of executive orders and also politically motivated hirings, firings and restructurings that have fundamentally expanded the president’s influence and power across all branches of government.
There is a saying in Washington, D.C., that personnel is policy: the people put in charge of implementing key policies shape their ideologies. Russell Vought, one of Project 2025’s key architects, heads Trump’s Office of Management and Budget, which he has likened to the “nerve center” through which a president can exert their influence across the federal government. Peter Navarro, who wrote Project 2025’s section on trade, is a top trade adviser to Trump. Brendan Carr, who wrote a section suggesting reforms to the Federal Communications Commission, is now in charge of the agency.
Here are some specifics on parts of Project 2025 that have been implemented and how they could impact women and LGBTQ+ Americans:
 Reproductive rights

Trump maintained throughout the 2024 campaign that if elected, his administration would leave the issue of abortion access to the states. But as of November 2025, his administration had implemented about 40 percent of the Project 2025 policies aimed at restricting reproductive freedoms, according to Reproductive Freedom for All, an abortion-rights group.
Project 2025 is grounded in the fundamental premise that abortion is not health care and should not be treated as such by federal agencies. Anti-abortion sentiment is woven throughout guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services and sub-agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), its public health arm. One example is a September 2025 document outlining CDC priorities stating that the agency “will promote the dignity of human life at all stages of development, improve maternal health care, and strengthen the family.”
The document also guides the health department to collect data on people who have abortions, using “every available tool, including the cutting of funds, to ensure that every state reports exactly how many abortions take place within its borders.” The CDC confirmed in late November that it would not release an annual state-level report it has produced on U.S. abortions since 1969 — and that would have captured the first full year of data since Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, the Supreme Court case that overturned the federal right to abortion. In a statement to the anti-abortion organization Live Action, a spokesperson for the department attributed the delay to a former chief medical officer “direct[ing] staff to return state-submitted abortion data rather than analyze it.” The Center for Reproductive Rights, an advocacy group that favors abortion access, has pointed out that staffing cuts at the CDC included most of those in its Division for Reproductive Health, leaving the agency short-staffed to compile the data for the report, which is now due out in the first quarter of 2026.
Both the anti-abortion and abortion-rights movements want the report, though for different reasons: the former so it can strategize about how to further reduce the incidence of abortion; the latter so it can assess the impact of the Dobbs decision on abortion access and health care outcomes.
Additional Project 2025 reproductive health priorities accomplished by the Trump administration:

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in June rescinded Biden administration guidance that hospitals receiving Medicare and Medicaid dollars, which is nearly all of them, provide abortion care in emergency situations under EMTALA, a decades-old emergency medicine law.
Revoked a Biden administration-era order establishing an interagency Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access designed to ease access to contraception and abortion.
Project 2025 wanted to prohibit Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds, even for non-abortion services. This was accomplished when the GOP-led Congress approved Trump’s tax law in July and a federal appeals court in September said the legislation could take effect. Planned Parenthood has said it could result in the closure of as many as 200 clinics — or about one-third of all its health centers — and that 1.1 million could lose access to health care as a result.

The Trump administration did not make much headway on restricting access to the medication abortion drug mifepristone. Medication abortions now account for more than half of all U.S. abortions.
Project 2025 authors want the Food and Drug Administration to reverse its 2000 approval of mifepristone. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in September that he was reviewing Biden administration changes that expanded access via telehealth as well as the drug’s overall efficacy and safety. A less likely near-term possibility is the Department of Justice enforcing the long-dormant 1873 Comstock Act, which prohibits the mailing of obscene materials and articles intended for “producing abortion,” including medication like mifepristone.

 LGBTQ+ rights

Project 2025 called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop collecting data on gender identity and for the National Institutes of Health to fund studies into the negative side effects of gender-affirming care for transgender people. So far, these suggestions have largely played out.
At the beginning of the year, federal health agencies, including the CDC, purged website data referencing LGBTQ+ people. This was in response to a White House executive order that demanded agencies erase all traces of “gender ideology” from public statements, as well as policies and internal communications. Although a federal judge’s order has forced agencies to reinstate these webpages, the Trump administration has made it clear that it rejects data collection that includes LGBTQ+ people.
Project 2025 also proposed cutting federal funds for gender-affirming care for both adults and children, mirroring Trump’s own campaign promises. These cuts have taken shape in various ways: through a planned loss of benefits for federal workers, executive pressure placed on hospitals and policy changes that put trans people at risk of losing their insurance coverage or seeing higher out-of-pocket costs next year. A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to keep funding hospitals that provide gender-affirming care for trans youth. Still, clinics across the country are closing.
In a broader suggestion, Project 2025 advised the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that expanded federal nondiscrimination protections. On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to do just that. The White House has also urged federal agencies to rescind Biden-era policies that support LGBTQ+ rights. Many of these rested on the Biden administration’s interpretation of the Supreme Court case Bostock v. Clayton County, which found LGBTQ+ workers to be protected from workplace discrimination. In particular, the Trump White House has chosen to drop transgender and gay students from the government’s interpretation of  Title IX, the civil rights law preventing schools from discriminating against women and girls. This move changes how the federal government investigates Title IX abuses.
In one of its more extreme statements, Project 2025 equates the act of being trans, or “transgender ideology,” to pornography and declares that it should be outlawed. The White House has not made this specific declaration, but it has taken steps to exclude trans Americans from public life — all while referring to trans identity as “gender ideology.”
Additional Project 2025 anti-LGBTQ+ priorities accomplished by the Trump administration:

In January, the president signed an executive order signaling his administration’s opposition to gender diversity and trans identity as a whole.
By this spring, the National Institutes of Health had canceled over $800 million in research grants to understand LGBTQ+ health, including studies about cancer and HIV prevention. Most of those cuts were upheld by the Supreme Court.
The White House has ordered NIH to study the regret rates of trans people who receive gender-affirming care, which the Trump administration inaccurately describes as “surgical mutilation.”
The Trump administration has restricted trans Americans’ access to passports that reflect their gender and eliminated the choice to use an X marker instead of male or female.
The Pentagon has swiftly reversed transgender protections and access to health care.

The White House has also signalled support for Project 2025’s sweeping plan to promote and enforce heterosexuality in families, although it has been slower to take direct action.
The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project 2025, called for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to adopt the official stance that families are made up of a married father, mother and children and to redirect federal funds to support a “biblically based” definition of family. Protecting adoption and foster care services that refuse to work with LGBTQ+ married couples was a key part of this vision in Project 2025.
A recent executive order charges the HHS with addressing local policies that prohibit religious groups — or people with certain religious beliefs — from participating in child-welfare programs.
That is expected to affect more than half the nation — 29 states and Washington, D.C., prohibit discrimination against potential foster parents based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, according to the Movement Advancement Project, which tracks LGBTQ+ policy. In contrast, 14 states allow child welfare agencies to refuse services to LGBTQ+ families if doing so conflicts with their religious beliefs.
 Education

Both Project 2025’s authors and President Trump have long expressed a desire to eliminate the Department of Education. While they do not have the authority to do that, they have taken active steps to weaken the agency, giving more decision-making control to states and school districts.
Project 2025 education priorities accomplished by the Trump administration:

The president can’t lawfully eliminate a federal agency with an executive order, but he can undermine its functions and redistribute duties. In November, the administration announced that the Education Department’s core functions related to K-12 education, higher education, Indian education and international studies would be transferred to the departments of Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services, and State. Critics of the move — including education leaders, elected officials and families with vulnerable children — argue that it will hurt children with disabilities, those from low-income households and student loan borrowers, most of whom are women.
Trump signed an executive order in January directing the federal government to begin a campaign to monitor and influence K-12 curriculum. Among other objectives of the order, the secretary of education was instructed to eliminate federal funding for schools promoting “indoctrination” based on “gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology.” The order also called for an enforcement plan to make sure schools allow parents full access to their children’s educational records — an issue the administration connects with accessing information on children’s gender ideology.
Project 2025 encouraged Congress to consider school choice legislation. The Republican One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July, included a national school voucher plan that set up scholarships for families to attend private schools around the country.

 Military

Under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the military has moved quickly to align itself with Project 2025’s objectives, with an emphasis on reducing health care access for women and LGBTQ+ service members and an effort to overturn policies tied to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). These changes have the potential to influence civilian policies down the line, in part because military policies reflect the values and strategic priorities of an administration and signal what might be coming to other federal departments.
Project 2025 military priorities accomplished by the Trump administration:

Project 2025 called to end any public funding of gender-affirming health care for transgender service members. In May, the Pentagon announced it was halting new hormone treatments and surgical procedures.
Project 2025 also said policies allowing transgender people to serve in the military should be reversed. In January, Trump issued an executive order that listed gender dysphoria — identifying with a gender that’s different from the sex assigned at birth — as one of the medical conditions disqualifying people from military service. According to the Defense Health Agency, nearly 2,000 military personnel had that diagnosis as of 2021.
Project 2025 suggested prohibiting the federal government from paying the travel expenses of service members and eligible dependents who cross state borders to obtain abortions — a 2023 policy that was put in place after Roe v. Wade was repealed.  In January, the Pentagon rescinded the Biden-era policy that granted service members three weeks of administrative leave and travel stipends for abortion services.
Project 2025 called for the Pentagon to abolish all DEI offices in the Defense Department; in January, Trump signed an executive order ending all of the military’s diversity programs. Within the first 100 days of Trump’s second term, high-ranking people of color and women were fired, military academies were ordered to eliminate race-conscious admissions, the military announced it would no longer recognize commemoration months and thousands of images promoting diversity and minority milestones were flagged for removal. A new department task force was also created to promote “merit-based, color-blind policies” to ban race and sex considerations from military promotions.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image_123650291-1-1024x569.jpg,,,2025-12-26 08:11:53.107045

(Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada Current)Nevada’s 988 call centers are helping tens of thousands of people each year, and state administrators are already eyeing ways to improve the system in the upcoming years.
Shannon Bennett, a bureau chief within the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health, told lawmakers that since the nation switched to 988 from a 10-digit suicide crisis hotline, there has been an “almost 100% increase” in utilization.
 
The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, by calling or texting 988 or visiting 988Lifeline.org. Conversations are free and confidential.


Nearly 42,000 people in Nevada were served by 988 in 2024, according to a state memo. In 2025, Nevada’s 988 call centers had already exceeded that number by the end of November.
“We have seen tremendous growth,” added Bennett, “and we have a lot more to bring to the table as we move forward into 2026.”
Nevada has made significant progress in raising its in-state answer rate and reducing the amount it takes callers to reach a person. In 2023, Nevada’s hotline had among the lowest answer rates in the country.
That’s no longer the case.
According to 988 data reports, in November 2025, 4,070 calls were routed to Nevada call centers and 3,525 were answered, resulting in an 87% answer rate. (Calls not answered in state are routed to national call centers.) It took 31.9 seconds on average for the calls to be answered, and conversations lasted an average of 20 minutes.
The state’s monthly average answer rate has ranged from 73% to 89% in 2025.
Nevada supports its 988 call centers through a 35-cent monthly surcharge on phone lines billed in the state. That fee is set in statute and was approved by state lawmakers in 2023.
Assemblymember Joe Dalia, a Democrat from Las Vegas, asked whether the revenue from that fee is sufficient to cover the hotline’s operating expenses.
Bennett responded that the state’s current 988 contract costs $1 to $2 million a year more than what the 35-cent fee brings in annually. However, the hotline has funding and reserves to cover the current contract, which runs through 2028.
“Once we get to the end of the contract, or as we start to renegotiate whatever’s going to be next, we’re going to have to keep that in mind,” she said.
The state may be able to take advantage of Medicaid funding matches.
The state will also have to consider whether it wants to improve the hotline’s functionality and add things that it declined to add during the initial setup. That includes fully integrating the 988 system with 911 and 211, the state’s referral services focused on social services.
“We want that interoperability with 911, so I think as we move forward we may have to prioritize what is most important to us,” said Bennett.
Behavioral health calls inundate 911 and the long-term goal is for such calls to be seamlessly dispatched to 988. Technology to connect those systems exists, though the State of Nevada has so far not opted to pay for it, said Bennett.
Mental health advocates have long argued that law enforcement officers are not always the proper people to be responding to behavioral health crises in the community.
“We are doing a lot of work, and we have a lot more work to do, to really fully integrate the mobile crisis teams,” said Bennett. “So, if it is law enforcement responding, perhaps they have a clinician and a peer with them, so then those individuals in the community that may be in crisis are being de-escalated right there and getting the resources they need.”
The Division of Public and Behavioral Health’s 988 update came last week during a meeting of the Interim Finance Committee. DPBH appeared in front of the money committee to request approval of a transfer of reserve funding to cover costs associated with the hotline’s Southern Nevada call center, which is run by Carelon Behavioral Health.
The Southern Nevada call center opened last year. Prior to that, the only call center was in Reno.

Bob Ferguson to investigate.
Kelly Susewind, the agency director, questioned whether conduct by members of the state Fish and Wildlife Commission complied with state laws after poring through a trove of their emails and texts obtained and shared publicly by an advocacy group for hunters and anglers.
The Sportsmen’s Alliance had argued that commissioners violated state requirements for open meetings and records disclosure, and that they disregarded mandates to maximize hunting and fishing. The group was pressing Ferguson to remove four commissioners. 
Against this backdrop, Susewind made his extraordinary request for an inquiry into the commission, which oversees his department and has the power to remove a director should it choose.
“I know this is a big ask,” he wrote the governor Aug. 5. Susewind said an investigation could clear up a cloud of uncertainty shrouding the nine-person commission. If wrongdoing occurred, he said, the governor could remove members because each is appointed by the executive. 
A few days later, it became public that Ferguson had ordered an investigation. “The governor takes concerns from an agency director very seriously,” Ferguson’s communications director, Brionna Aho, told the Standard.
Four months later, the investigation continues. It may be February before it is done.
And, it turns out, Ferguson set it in motion earlier than previously acknowledged.
On June 20, according to documents the Standard obtained through a public records request, the Office of Financial Management signed a $40,000 contract with Chiedza Nziramasanga of Transformative Workplace Investigations. 
The firm was hired to “provide a comprehensive investigation of a reported experience in a work unit to allow leadership to determine if any discrimination, retaliation and/or other policy violations occurred as alleged.” 
Although the commission and agency are not identified in the contract, the Office of Financial Management confirmed that the contract was for the Fish and Wildlife Commission investigation.
The hiring came weeks after Ferguson received a petition from the Sportsmen’s Alliance to remove the four commissioners. Susewind said he was not told a contract was issued.
“I wrote my (August) letter and I was informed they hired an investigator,” Susewind said. “I’ve not been privy to anything going on with that contract.”
It’s not clear how the scope of the investigation overlaps with or goes beyond the Sportsmen’s Alliance claims.
Ferguson has not publicly commented on the Sportsmen’s Alliance petition and Aho declined to answer questions on how it factored into the hiring of the investigator. That petition and supporting materials were the first documents provided to the investigator in mid-August, based on information the Standard obtained through a public records request.
The governor’s office “was aware of a possible need to investigate, based on a preliminary conversation” with the department, Aho wrote in an email. “After the governor received the letter from Director Susewind laying out his concerns, it was clear an investigation was needed.”
Originally, the investigator’s final report was to be turned in by Oct. 7, with the contract ending Nov. 11. 
Earlier this month, the contract was extended and its cost increased. Transformative Investigations will now earn $64,000 and its findings are due by Feb. 13.
Commissioners who’ve repeatedly said there was no cause for an inquiry were further rankled upon learning the investigator won’t be done until next year.
“I’m very frustrated with the amount of time it’s taking to try and resolve the whole issue,” said Commissioner John Lehmkuhl, who the investigator interviewed in November.
‘It’ll yield what it yields”
Seeds of this investigation were planted in November 2022 when the commission voted to stop recreational hunting of black bears in the spring.
Sportsmen’s Alliance, an Ohio-based organization, opposed the decision. 
The next year, it started requesting emails, texts and other communications of commissioners, convinced the correspondence would reveal violations of state laws requiring public meetings and preservation of public records. It took a lawsuit, but the group received thousands of records.
On May 16, the group filed the petition asking Ferguson to remove commissioners Barbara Baker, Lorna Smith, Melanie Rowland and Lehmkuhl, alleging misconduct and malfeasance. 
Susewind, agency director for seven years, said he became concerned as he read some of the records produced in response to the alliance’s request. He shared his concerns with the governor’s office but said he was not asked directly by Ferguson’s staff to request some kind of action. He did that on his own.
“I just decided it was best for everybody to have an independent investigation to see what’s going on. It’ll yield what it yields,” he said.
Susewind, along with the commissioners named in the petition, are among those who’ve been interviewed by the investigator.
Alliance leaders have not received any response from the governor to their petition. Nor had anyone from the group been interviewed for the investigation as of early December.
“It is very surprising that this has not occurred as our inquiries and scrutiny are what precipitated the investigation,” said Michael Jean, Sportsmen’s Alliance attorney, in an email.
‘It’s very disruptive’
Commissioners targeted in the petition are frustrated. Some wrote letters to Ferguson to rebut claims in the petition and are disappointed at his lack of response. They feel the protracted inquiry is undermining the panel.
“This has been a pretty stressful, awful situation,” said Commissioner Lorna Smith. “It has had a chilling effect on everything this commission wants to be doing.”
Smith said she’s not sure the state’s ever carried out an investigation of a citizen commission in this manner.
“I do not see that they have any grounds for their claims. That’s how I think it will turn out,” she said. “If I or any other commissioners stepped over any lines, it was totally not on purpose.”
Lehmkuhl said, “It’s just sort of hanging over us. It’s very disruptive.”
Commissioner Jim Anderson said since becoming chair in August that he’s not felt the investigation has impeded the commission’s work.
“It is what it is. I don’t think we as a commission have gotten high-centered on this,” he said. “I would like to have it done yesterday because it would give us clarity of where things came out.”
Is change on the horizon?
The investigation is the latest flare-up for the panel. A report released last year included interviews with people who described the commission as “dysfunctional.” It also suggested that the commission’s structure might need to be overhauled.
And shortly after taking office, Ferguson halted two commissioner nominations former Gov. Jay Inslee made. He upset some wildlife conservationists by cutting a commissioner they supported and installing nominees with support from hunters, anglers, and a bloc of tribes.
A pending House bill would have the agency director appointed by the governor and the commission’s role shifted from oversight to advisory. There’s a Senate bill to retool the process for naming commissioners. Both face long odds in the upcoming session.
Sen. Mike Chapman, D-Port Angeles, chair of the Senate Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee, said at a hearing in early December that he’s not planning to advance either policy next year.
“If it were up to me and me alone, which it’ll never be nor should it be, but I believe that the department should be a cabinet-level position. But I have no intention of hearing a bill like that this session,” he said. He added that he also did not plan to hear the bill to change the makeup of the commission.
Chapman invited groups with concerns about how the department is being run to come together to find efficiencies and reforms so that the commission “is a state agency that we all can be, continue to be proud of.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Black-Bear-in-Hozemeen-NPS-Deby-Dixon-Copy-Large.jpeg,,,2025-12-26 07:12:28.958843

Adrian Plank, D-Columbia, speaks during a press conference March 6, 2025, in the House Press Gallery. Among his bills prefiled for the 2026 legislative session, Plank has proposed creating a statewide agriculture education program (Tim Bommel/House Communications).Missouri public school students could see more agriculture-based science lessons starting in kindergarten through high school under bills prefiled in both state legislative chambers that would establish a new statewide program. Lawmakers in the state’s more populous cities filed the bills, hoping agriculture education can benefit students in both urban and rural areas.
“I am a proponent of continuing to have (agriculture education)… and not just in our rural schools but to have this everywhere so that our kids are exposed to agriculture as a science,” state Sen. Barbara Washington, a Democrat from Kansas City, told The Independent.
She filed the bill for the second year in a row, inspired by personal experiences eating homegrown food and visiting Kansas City schools who incorporate agriculture into education.
The legislation uses an existing statute, which established a pilot program for agriculture education in 2020, to make way for a permanent program that can be rolled out statewide.
The pilot ran from 2020 to 2023, starting with 44 teachers in third through fifth grades participating. When it ended, only 20 teachers were participating. The COVID-19 pandemic put stress on the program, according to the program’s final report, and teachers had mixed feelings about the curriculum.
In periodic surveys, educators said they didn’t have enough time to complete the lessons in their entirety but said the hands-on activities kept students engaged. While the pilot program set the framework for the bill, the legislation would not lock in the same program curriculum or format. It would also be voluntary.
State Rep. John Martin, a Republican from Columbia, said he sees opportunities for the state to partner with Missouri Farmers Care. The nonprofit, which advocates for expanded agriculture opportunities, has a program called Agriculture Education on the Move which is currently in some of the state’s public schools.
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, which would be responsible for overseeing the program, is open to public-private partnerships.
“It is our intention to work side by side with the many current commodities groups that are providing this access currently,” the department’s spokesman said in an emailed statement. “It is our hope with this legislation to provide continued access for students in learning about agriculture in the state of Missouri.”
Martin started sponsoring the bill last year after Columbia Democratic state Rep. Adrian Plank asked him to team up.
Plank was the first to file the bill in 2024, but it didn’t get any traction. Last year, with Martin filing an identical bill, it passed a House committee with unanimous approval. But the momentum was stifled after Plank took a leave of absence to undergo heart surgery.
“Me and him together, we should be able to get it on to something this year, pretty easily,” Plank told The Independent.
Gov. Mike Kehoe appears to be supportive of the legislation, Martin told The Independent, and there is growing interest from agriculture organizations.
“Those farmers who come to my office are so anxious to be a part of exposing their world to children at a younger age,” Washington. “And if we expose the children to agriculture now, then they know that there are opportunities for them in the workforce.”
The estimated cost, based on last year’s fiscal note, is limited to teacher training at $116,000 annually.
“If the program gets bigger, which I believe it will, then we will go and advocate for funding for the program,” Plank said. “Especially if it is going to be as successful as I think it will be.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54368644057_ba7b03d684_k-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-26 07:12:28.958843

With lawsuits overshadowing Vermont’s first-of-its-kind climate legislation, new state leaders have begun trying to decipher the costs of a warming planet

For Sue Minter, Vermont’s newly appointed climate superfund specialist, the floods started early.
Back in 2011, when Tropical Storm Irene thrashed Vermont, Minter — serving as the state’s deputy secretary of transportation — helped rebuild the 600 miles of destroyed road and hundreds of damaged bridges. Just over a decade later, as executive director for Capstone Community Action, a regional anti-poverty nonprofit, she helped low-income and vulnerable Vermonters displaced by the 2023 and 2024 floods. 
With a history of public service dating back to the 1990s, Minter was tapped in September to be the program manager for the state’s new Climate Superfund Act. That legislation, overshadowed by a pair of federal lawsuits seeking to dismantle the law, seeks to hold major oil companies accountable for their pollution. Now, Minter is pushing the law forward while the courts consider whether the state law will survive. On Monday, the federal government again asked the courts to void the law.

The Vermont law imposes a one-time fee on fossil fuel companies for emissions between 1995 and 2024. A company qualifies as a payee if its extraction or refining of fossil fuels caused at least one billion metric tons of carbon emissions over the last two decades. 
Those payouts would help the state finance adaptation to climate change, largely caused by the burning of fossil fuels. 
“This current job is so meaningful to me because it’s getting back to the mission that I was on in 2011,” said Minter, a former state representative from Waterbury who made an unsuccessful bid for governor in 2016. “In the future those dramatic costs shouldn’t be borne entirely by taxpayers.” 
Her position oversees the wonkiest aspect of the 2024 law: determining how much climate change has cost the state. The assessment relies on attribution science, a type of modeling that connects events like heat waves and floods to climate change by determining how greenhouse gas emissions increased the likelihood of the event. 
Minter is managing that cost assessment, working with the consulting team — Industrial Economics, Incorporated — along with the state treasurer’s office and the Climate Action Office under the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources.
“We’re in the phase where we’re rolling up our sleeves and doing the analysis,” said Mike Pieciak, Vermont’s state treasurer.  “For our office this is the most technical and scientific part of the work.” 
In January 2027, the treasurer’s office will submit a report to the Agency of Natural Resources, which will have another year to connect those costs to oil companies like Chevron, Exxon and British Petroleum to determine which oil giants owe what to Vermont, according to the law.“This is a rigorous report,” Minter said. “We’re not just putting a number out there, we’re really establishing credible scientific evidence for what these costs have been and what they’re projected to be in the future.” 
Pieciak said he didn’t want to speculate at the total cost until the report was done, but a Vermont Resilience Implementation Strategy published by his office and the Agency of Natural Resources in September identified 300 resilience-related measures the state could pursue at an estimated cost of hundreds of millions of dollars.
Resilient design
Minter came to Vermont in the 1990s and learned about climate change through activists like former Vice President Al Gore and Vermont writer Bill McKibben. But she didn’t see the impacts of a warming atmosphere causing more extreme rain events until 2011, when Irene caused record flooding in Vermont. 
“She has a unique experience and background having been the recovery czar in Hurricane Irene,” Pieciak said. “So whether it’s Irene or more recent flooding, Sue very much understands the impact climate change has on Vermont and the importance and need to prioritize making our communities more resilient.” 
A big part of Minter’s job in emergency response was to convince the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, to pay for resilient investments to mitigate future floods. The resiliency built with federal and state dollars after Irene helped reduce the impacts of floods in 2023 and 2024, Minter and Pieciak said. The damages from those two flooding events cost more than $1 billion, according to the resilience strategy report.
“But right now we are not at all sure what FEMA’s future will be,” Minter said, noting that the Trump administration denied Vermont’s most recent disaster declaration over this summer’s floods. She said without a federal safety net, the superfund law was even more vital to ensure taxpayers wouldn’t foot the bill for climate-related disasters.
“A resilient design can protect and reduce costs in the future,” Minter said. “Unless we have a recovery program that can help with these investments, it’s going to be harder and harder for Vermonters to do.” 
Climate lawsuits
The law faces major pushback in a pair of lawsuits filed in May by the federal government and 24 states, led by West Virginia, who joined the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute, a lobby for oil companies. 
The suits claim that the Vermont law interferes with federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. 
In November, the Vermont Public Interest Research Group pushed back. The progressive advocacy organization told the courts that the law does nothing to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Rather the law asks polluters to pay for their pollution, much like the original 1980 superfund law asked polluters to pay to clean up contaminated sites, according to the group’s amicus brief.
“Nothing in the Act requires emitters and polluters to change their behavior or mitigate their emissions,” the VPIRG brief reads. “The Act only asks polluters to pay an equitable share of the bill to help Vermont adapt to climate change.”
Paul Burns, VPIRG’s executive director, said the organization has been long-involved with pressing for a climate superfund law. First, the organization backed a federal climate superfund law. In 2021, U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md, drafted legislation to tax major oil and gas companies for climate disasters based on the greenhouse gases emitted from 2000 to 2019. The cost recovery was estimated at $500 billion over 10 years.
When that ambitious plan failed, VPIRG turned to state leaders.
“In the wake of the (2023) flooding, we brought the voices and concerns of Vermont residents, farmers, and businesses to policymakers as they considered this legislation,” Burns said in an email. “That’s a big reason why support for the law was so strong.”
Their amicus brief followed a similar argument made by previous groups, including the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, an agricultural nonprofit, and the Conservation Law Foundation, an environmental advocacy group in New England. In August, Vermont asked federal courts to dismiss lawsuits brought against the state’s Climate Superfund Act. 
The U.S. government filed its reply on Monday, again asking the courts to void the law. The state has asked for an extension until January to respond. After that, the court will decide how it will address the flurry of motions filed since the summer, according to Vermont’s Attorney General’s Office.
“Irrespective of what happens in that case, the work that we’re going to do is incredibly important because we’re going to be defining, really, what the impacts of climate change have been in Vermont,” Minter said.

(Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A number of high-profile audits have yet to be released by the State Auditor and Inspectors office.
Audits into local towns and school districts and the state’s departments of education, tourism and recreation, and turnpikes are among over three dozen forensic examinations that have been requested and have yet to be made public, according to records released by the State Auditor and Inspector’s Office.
All the audits have been requested after 2020 except four. Three of those audits, involving the City of Henryetta and the towns of Calvin and Fort Towson, are in the final review phase, the records show. 
State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd said short staffing, a lack of funds and other factors, some outside of her control, impact when an audit is completed and released.

Editor’s note: This story is part of Oklahoma Voice’s end-of-year series that provides updates to some stories that captured the interest of Oklahomans in 2025.

The office’s manpower has been slashed by 25% even as the demand for investigative audits has doubled in the last decade, said Andrew Speno, a Byrd spokesman.
In 2026, the agency had a $5.4 million appropriation, down from $6.3 million in 2002, according to information provided by the agency.
The special audits are in addition to the 365 annual audits the office is required to conduct, Byrd said.
She said she has to prioritize special audits where there is suspected wrongdoing.
Department of Tourism and Recreation
Byrd’s office has completed but not released an audit of the Oklahoma Department of Tourism’s dealings with Swadley’s Foggy Bottom Kitchen. 
The agency ended its contract with Swadley’s and sued the company, alleging it over-billed the state when it was managing restaurants at some state parks. Swadley’s counter sued, alleging the state owed it money.
In February 2024, the state’s Multi-County Grand Jury indicted Ronald Brent Swadley, Curtis Ray Breuklander and Timothy Raymond Hooper with one count of conspiracy to defraud the state and five counts of presenting false or fraudulent claims against the state. They deny wrongdoing. The case is pending.
Byrd said the audit can’t be released until she gets permission from the Multi-County Grand Jury.
Oklahoma Turnpike Authority
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond in March 2023 requested an investigative audit of the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority. The agency had become a target of criticism after it announced plans for a new  turnpike in the Norman area. 
The new turnpike is among several projects in the 15-year, $8.2 billion ACCESS program.
“I have had many conversations over the past few months with legislators, community leaders, private citizens and state employees who have expressed a wide array of concerns with the financial conduct of the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority,” Drummond wrote in a letter requesting the audit. “These concerns include but are not limited to improper transfers between OTA and the Department of Transportation; improper contracting and purchasing practices; and internal financial controls.”
In August, Drummond expressed frustration that it had not been completed.
Byrd said that although her office has never audited OTA, an outside financial firm performs annual audits.
She said it has taken a while to get familiar with the agency. Drummond provided very broad parameters for the review, she said.
She would not provide a date for the audit’s completion, but said it will be soon.
“When it is ready, there will be no one happier than me,” she said.
Office of Management and Enterprise Services
In February 2024, Drummond asked for an investigative audit of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services, saying he had serious concerns about the agency’s procurement practices.
“We are waiting on any other specific instances he wants us to investigate,” Byrd said. 
Department of Education
Two audits regarding the State Department of Education are also pending. 
One was requested in 2021 by Gov. Kevin Stitt. It involves financial reporting requirements after an earlier audit found problems with Epic Charter School.
Stitt directed Byrd to determine if the agency and schools were complying with the Oklahoma Cost Accounting System’s financial reporting requirements. 
He also asked if the agency was requiring consistent and timely enforcement of those requirements.
The second audit was requested in October by Drummond and involves spending practices under former State Superintendent Ryan Walters, who resigned to take a job in the private sector. 
Byrd said Drummond has requested that the audit be put on hold.
“Additional issues have come to light that warrant a delay,” said Leslie Berger, a Drummond spokesperson.
Many times the audits find abuse, which never gets prosecuted, Byrd said.
“Legally, I am only allowed so much authority,” she said. “I am only supposed to write and issue a report. I am saddened when prosecutors don’t take action and prosecute the bad actors.”  
Byrd also said she doesn’t have the legal authority to initiate her own audits, something she would like the Legislature to change.
Her office can do investigative audits at the request of the governor, attorney general, Legislature, an agency head, district attorney or with a citizen petition.
Byrd took office in 2019. She is serving her second and final term as state auditor and is running for lieutenant governor.

June 2, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Heading into his final legislative session as a term-limited Nebraska state senator, Speaker of the Legislature John Arch of La Vista said he expects the short, 60-day session to fly by.
The session begins Jan. 7, and between the possible expulsion of a senator, discord over the repurposing of a state prison facility into an ICE detention center and a continued push for property tax relief, Arch acknowledged there are more than enough issues to occupy lawmakers’ time before they adjourn in April.
Arch’s top priority among those issues is filling a $471 million budget hole by Day 50, he said, the deadline lawmakers have to complete budget adjustments and send the proposal to Gov. Jim Pillen’s desk.

“Honestly, there is the budget, and then there’s everything else,” Arch said.
Budget struggles also took precedence during the Legislature’s 90-day session this spring, when lawmakers worked to fill a budget deficit that at one point grew to $432 million. After making numerous cuts that senators acknowledged were painful, the session concluded with the state’s two-year budget projecting a modest $4 million surplus.
That surplus didn’t last long, because new economic projections made in July put Nebraska back into a projected deficit of $95 million. When Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board met again in October, projections brought the expected shortfall to $471 million.
Arch said balancing Nebraska’s budget is more difficult than normal, because the state’s revenue streams continue to evolve. Passage of the federal “One Big Beautiful Bill” in July is expected to cost Nebraska’s state government about $406 million over the next four fiscal years, according to the state Department of Revenue.
Additionally, Nebraska is in the midst of scaling down its individual income tax rates to eventually hit 3.99% in 2027. Once lawmakers reach 2027, Arch expects state revenue sources to stabilize, which he said should make managing the budget a bit easier.
“After we flatten out in ‘27, there is a very simple formula, and that is: You spend less than you bring in,” Arch said.
The looming budget challenge is on the minds of many senators, and Arch said there may be fewer new bills introduced in 2026. Recent sessions have established a trend of a higher-than-average number of new bills introduced within the first 10 days of a legislative session, and there are still 240 bills carrying over from 2025, according to legislative records.
At the very least, Arch said lawmakers are aware that there needs to be extremely good cause to introduce any bill with an appropriation attached.
“I’ll emphasize ‘extremely,’” Arch said. “Because it’s just going to be very difficult for a bill to pass that has an A-bill attached.”

Aside from balancing the budget, the speaker said another one of his goals in setting the session’s agenda is scheduling as many priority bills as possible.
However, he acknowledged multiple other issues that could make staying on that track more challenging. He said any extraneous matters could mean priority bills suffer.
During the legislative break, Arch reset all existing priority bills from 2025 back to normal status. He said this was because he felt not all were “ready,” and he intends to start 2026’s floor debates with worksheet order bills before focusing on senators’ personal priorities. He noted that senators could still reprioritize the reset bills.
Even with less time for bills, Arch said there is still value to introducing bills on important topics for the sake of starting conversations. He noted that his recent bills on government efficiencies and legislative oversight took years to pass.

Arch said he intends to bring a smaller government efficiency bill in 2026 that would continue to eliminate certain government reports he views as “obsolete.” He said lawmakers should always keep government efficiency on their mind, because there is always something worth addressing.
On legislative oversight, Arch’s Legislative Bill 298 established a new Division of Legislative Oversight and a new Legislative Oversight Committee. This being a significant change to Nebraska’s governmental structure, Arch said it needs time to settle before further bills with changes should be brought.
Arch anticipates that property taxes will remain a top issue for lawmakers in 2026. While it is also one of his goals to make progress on tax reform, he said he doubts there will be enough revenue to pass new tax relief.
In recent sessions, Arch said senators have been more focused on quick fixes for immediate tax relief, mostly through allocating state dollars to local governments.
Arch said he would like to shift the focus to structural reforms that address the root causes of rising taxes. Arch identified several factors that he believes contributes to higher taxes — rising property valuations, unfunded government mandates, and local government spending.
He said the Legislature ought to revisit its discussion on spending caps, and encourage local governments to be stricter about how it spends money. Though that may take more than one session to accomplish, he argued it will be better for the state in the long run.
Arch, who will be term-limited after 2026, said he hopes people look back on his legacy and view him as a speaker who put the institution first.
The 2023 session — his first as speaker — was contentious from start to finish, and Arch said he was pushed in multiple directions in regard to his scheduling. In those instances, he believed ceding to the pressure would not be good for the institution, so he stuck to the Legislature’s policies and held strong to those principles in subsequent sessions.
“You have to have the opportunity to debate what is important in our society, and we as senators have to learn how to do that well,” Arch said. “Some days we do that well, some days we don’t.”

Reporter Katie Klingsporn also spent much of the year following rural health care challenges, library battles and a notorious shortcut.
The post DOGE hits, insurance premiums and school vouchers underscore 2025 in health and education appeared first on WyoFile .","When I majored in print journalism at the University of Montana many years ago, I was surprised to discover I had to take a wide variety of general studies courses over the first two years. I learned about everything from microeconomics to geology and Latin American literature. 
This year at WyoFile proved to me once again the wisdom in this approach. Because while I’m primarily an education and health reporter, the range of issues I covered extended well beyond that — from the politics embattling libraries to the fate of a popular hot springs destination and legal nuances of trail behavior in national parks. 
For me, the year’s biggest story was covering the potential and real impacts of President Donald Trump’s DOGE efforts on Wyoming. That, too, involved more than education — extending to public lands, the social safety net, child care and many other areas.
WyoFile’s first major DOGE piece, an all-hands collaboration of reporters and editors, recounted what became known as the “Valentine’s Day massacre,” when untold numbers of federal employees were fired.

For months after that initial article, we could barely keep up with the flood of news related to program cuts. Advocates worried that diminished resources would hobble outdoor recreation, harm public lands and hollow out tribal programs. DOGE efforts hammered humanities groups and slashed services at places like Devils Tower. I interviewed people, like a Laramie library specialist, who lost their jobs. 
Trump administration cuts also triggered a great deal of panic and uncertainty among groups that nearly lost their funding. Three such groups included Wyoming Job Corps, Adult Education programs at community colleges and after-school programs. Along with meeting the people who fuel these programs, I learned how federal funds prop up Wyoming-tailored initiatives and the benefits they bring. All three are arguably critical for those who use them. 
What else kept me busy? 
A Laramie lawmaker brought a bill to establish a universal school voucher program in Wyoming, igniting months of debate, legislative negotiations, a fish-fry business boycott and a lawsuit challenging the program’s constitutionality. That case is ongoing, and in the meantime, the program has been put on hold. 
Statewide property tax reforms kicked in, rippling downstream to where diminishing revenues meant painful budget cuts for hospital districts, county governments and services like libraries.

Speaking of libraries, partisan fights erupted in more Wyoming branches over who should determine what materials are appropriate for children, pitting free speech concerns against censorship.
Another pitched education battle unfolded in the town of Alpine. This one was over the town’s long-established need for a school, which resulted in the selection of a charter school provider not everyone was pleased with. 
And of course, there were court fights. These included disputed rulings on how Wyoming funds education, a challenge over the fate of the popular Star Plunge aquatic facility in Hot Springs State Park and the federal trial over speed runner Michelino Sunseri’s notorious shortcut on the Grand Teton.

The Sunseri case was full of twists and turns, but none more surprising than the November news that President Donald Trump had pardoned Sunseri. As Sunseri himself posted on social media, “You can’t make this stuff up.”
Health care saw shakeups this year due to federal policy. When Congress passed Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” it cut Medicaid and did not extend temporary COVID-era tax subsidies for Affordable Care Act insurance plans. With those subsidies expiring at the end of the year, costs are surging for consumers in Wyoming, which leads the country with the highest price jumps. Health advocates fear the price spikes will result in more uninsured residents, more uncompensated care and less preventative care. 
Another thing the Big Beautiful Bill did, however, was create the Rural Health Transformation Program, an initiative designed to funnel $50 billion to states over five years to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. Wyoming stands to receive up to $800 million, and its application proposes everything from nursing grants to EMS incentives to a state-run insurance plan.
Amid the tumult, politics and divisiveness of 2025, I also made an effort to shine a spotlight on stories of resilience, passion and innovation. I wrote about the people who step up to shape their communities and honor their past.

I profiled Wyoming’s farm-to-school food evangelist, a small but mighty orchestra maestro leading a scrappy central Wyoming symphony, a teacher whose pioneering literacy instruction is changing the lives of older students, and the people growing year-round strawberries in a high-tech indoor western Wyoming farm. 
In 2025, Wyoming also lost the towering and mischievous statesman Al Simpson and Dick Cheney, a Casper boy who went on to become America’s most powerful vice president. 
Selfishly, these stories of remarkable Wyoming lives buoy my spirit. Thankfully, they also make great copy. 
Happy New Year, and thanks always for reading.

The post Walking in a windy wonderland appeared first on WyoFile .","December ushered an array of weird meteorological conditions to Wyoming — from record-high temperatures to hurricane-strength winds and the rare winter rainbow.
The prismatic arch appeared over central Wyoming on Dec. 17, a rare spot of beauty amid raging wind gusts that wreaked havoc across the state. 
That day, winds hit speeds of 123 miles per hour in Red Canyon, 144 miles per hour on Mount Coffin and 91 miles per hour in Hiland, according to the National Weather Service Riverton Office. 
In nearby Lander, the wind knocked down trash cans and fences. It blew Christmas decorations halfway to Colorado, peeled shingles off of roofs, closed the highway to South Pass and felled trees. 
Elsewhere, high winds have knocked out the power to traffic signals in Casper and forced city officials to close the landfill. December gusts also toppled dozens of semi-trucks on highways like Interstate 80, the Wyoming Department of Transportation reported.

Balmy temperatures have attended the winds, breaking records in places ranging from Riverton to Worland and Rock Springs — where a high of 59 was the warmest temperature on record in December, according to the National Weather Service.
Residents accustomed to bundling up for single-digit temperatures, snowfall and ice skating during the holidays may instead reach for a windbreaker and umbrella this year.

This is the season of what’s supposed to be “Peace on Earth, Goodwill toward men.”  Yet, it seems there are more wars and atrocities happening globally right now than in quite some time.  What’s missing is not only a rational justification for the bombing and slaughter of our fellow men, women and children, but the realization that the global community has run out of time and resources to continue endless wars due to the climate crisis that threatens all humanity. 
Every day the media is filled with the latest climate-caused disaster.  On Christmas Eve, 100 mph winds in California have knocked out power to 100,000 people as yet another atmospheric river coming off a too-hot ocean drowns already-flooded homes and businesses. 
For Montanans, the memory of record-setting savage windstorms is still very fresh, resulting in an emergency wind disaster designation by Gov. Greg Gianforte and the continuous buzz of chainsaws at Christmas as clearing the debris continues.
But of course it’s not just wind storms – it’s flooding, drought, hurricanes, ocean warming and acidification, bizarre fluctuations in the polar vortex, and temperature extremes on both ends of the scale proliferating at an unprecedented rate across the globe.
These are not problems that can be solved by any single nation — nor by the belligerence and aggression that now emanates endlessly from the very highest officials of our nation, arguably the wealthiest nation on the planet.
There are any number of ways to truly address the problems we face.  We could perceive humanity as a community of nations that have long realized the best way to co-exist is through peaceful and respectful trade with each other.  If you have what I need, and I have what you need, the exchange takes place to our mutual benefit.  In fact, that’s the way most of us live our daily lives.
On the other hand, as we’re unfortunately experiencing, the alternative is to threaten, attack, and seek to inflict physical and economic harm on nations that hold resources we need — or worse, simply want.  Need examples?  How’s about tariffs, blockades, threats of invading Greenland and Venezuela, and piracy on the open seas —all currently being conducted by our once great nation? 
Or how about a very close to home example?  We’re going to mine what’s left of the West, including in environmentally sensitive areas like the West Fork of the Bitterroot River, to produce rare metals.  China has an abundance of those and a logical progression would be to simply buy them – willing buyer, willing seller — the very basis of what used to be called free trade.  
But that was before we decided China was a “global competitor.”  For what has never been very well explained.  Instead, the military-industrial complex now garners an enormous flood of government money fueling yet another bizarre arms race, apparently unaware that all our previous arms races really didn’t benefit anyone — and for sure not the planet itself or the environment on which our existence relies. 
If any Montanans doubt that, take a look outside here at the end of December — 50 degrees and rain as our hillsides remain bare and brown, lacking the snowpack that sustains our arid state through the longer, hotter summers.  Without water, Montana and the West are toast — as the latest struggle over the Colorado basin water so vividly illustrates. 
“Peace on Earth, Good will toward men” is not just a good idea, it’s a necessity now more than ever — and Christmas would be the perfect time for our so-called leaders to reflect on that ultimate truth.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1282163488-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-26 06:56:55.813648

In a lawsuit filed Dec. 18 in U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho, the conservation groups argue that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Army Corps of Engineers did not take into account the impact the Idaho Club Lakeside Marina Development would have on bull trout, which are a species threatened with extinction under the Endangered Species Act. 
In the filing, the Center for Biological Diversity and Idaho Conservation League challenged the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s July 30 concurrence decision that the project is not likely to adversely affect bull trout. 
“With construction crews already plowing ahead, federal agencies need to protect threatened bull trout from this misguided zombie project once and for all,” Sarah Brown, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Northern Rockies program, wrote in a written statement. “Carving up the North Branch of the creek could worsen polluted runoff into Lake Pend Oreille and put crosshairs on bull trout right in their critical spawning area. It’s time for the agencies to seriously consider the many threats this project poses.”
The development project was authorized adjacent to Trestle Creek, which the conservation groups say is one of the most important bull trout spawning streams in the Pacific Northwest. In court filings, the conservation groups say Trestle Creek has among the highest number of bull trout egg nests in all of Lake Pend Oreille’s tributaries. Trestle Creek flows into Lake Pend Oreille. 
In a press release issued Dec. 23, the Center for Biological Diversity announced that in response to its lawsuit, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ordered a stop to all construction work on the Idaho Club marina and housing development. 
In their order to stop construction work, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wrote that work on the North Branch of Trestle Creek cannot occur until the stream has dry, or no flow conditions.
The Center for Biological Diversity says that work had occurred on the project while the stream was still flowing, despite conditions in place that the stream had to be dry.

Clayton Henkel: “Two stories that didn’t attract major headlines in 2025 — one on breast cancer, the other on an all-Black WWII squadron — demonstrate that even in our deeply divided country, our elected officials can on rare occasions work together and find common ground. Perhaps a glimmer of hope for 2026?”
The irony of the moment was likely not lost on Rep. Renée Price.
Shortly after a tense, hours-long debate in the state House and the passage of a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) across North Carolina government, it was her time to speak on House Bill 254.

The Orange County Democrat stood and asked her colleagues to support legislation that would designate the fourth Thursday of March as “Tuskegee Airmen Commemoration Day” in North Carolina.
In 1941, the federal government established the 66th Air Force Flying School at Tuskegee Institute to train Black pilots for the war.
Almost 1,000 African Americans trained at the Army Airfield in Tuskegee, Alabama; and 450 of the men who completed training were sent overseas for combat duty. Most battled discrimination and other challenges not experienced by white individuals in the officially segregated U.S. military. And for those who survived, many such challenges persisted in the decades that followed — a phenomenon that DEI policies seek to combat.
“The Tuskegee Airmen were pilots, mechanics, bombardiers, navigators, crew members, nurses, and instructors,” Price said. “From 1943 to 1945 in the European Theatre, they provided escorts during bombing missions, helping the Allied Forces in achieving a victory in the global conflict that caused horrific destruction and casualties.”
The Tuskegee Airmen flew hundreds of patrol and attack missions — first flying older and less well-equipped P-40 and P-39 airplanes, before ultimately being reassigned to escort B-17 and B-24 heavy bombers, using P-47 and P-51 airplanes. They earned the nickname “Red Tails” from the distinctive painted tails of the Tuskegee fighter planes.
“I have a personal interest in this request,” Price shared. “Even though he was from New York State, my father was actually part of the 99th Pursuit Squadron and was with the 332nd Fighter Group.”
 Standing on their shoulders

Rep. Nasif Majeed (D-Mecklenburg) told members of the House that as a decorated Air Force combat pilot who flew 120 combat missions over North Vietnam, the history of the Tuskegee airmen was very dear to him.
“I stand on their shoulders,” said Majeed. “They were known as the Red Tails and all the bomber pilots said that because of their outstanding record, they wanted them to escort them because they lost fewer aircraft.”
The National WWII Museum notes that while 66 Tuskegee Airmen died in combat, it was one of the lowest loss records of any escort fighter group. They are credited with completing more than 1,500 missions, destroying 260 enemy aircraft, and sinking an enemy German destroyer.
Rep. Abe Jones (D-Wake) said it was a Tuskegee Airman who helped change the trajectory of his life.
After the war, Harold Webb became a teacher and a principal, and served as a leading force for school integration, according to the Raleigh Hall of Fame.

Governor Jim Hunt later appointed Webb as the first African American director of the Office of State Personnel in 1977. The former Tuskegee Airman worked to strengthen the state’s Equal Employment Opportunity program that was dedicated to diversifying and strengthening the state’s government workforce.
“I’m proud to be able to have a chance to vote for this bill,” Jones told his House colleagues.
 From aviator to prisoner of war 
Rep. Jay Adams (R-Catawba) became emotional as he thought about his own father in World War II.
“He was shot down outside of Rome in January of 1944. He spent 16 months in a German prison camp.”
Adams said it was after his capture in a dark, crowded box car that his father met a fellow southerner and aviator named William E. Griffin from Montgomery, Alabama. Griffin took flight training at Tuskegee, earned his wings in 1943, and flew more than 23 flights over enemy territory.
“William E. Griffin became one of my dad’s best friends. They dug tunnels together. They cooked together. They exercised together. They did everything together for 16 months.”

After the war, the two POWs lost touch.
Adams said his father was deeply saddened to learn in 1992 that Griffin died in 1969.
“Willie E. Griffin was the only Black guy in that prison camp. In the end of the war, there were 8,500 airmen there. But he was one of them. They were best friends. This is very special to me.”
Adams said it took years, but he made sure that letters his father had in Griffin’s own handwriting were returned to his daughter.
“He was very educated. He was a smart guy.”
Adams, a co-sponsor on the Tuskegee bill, joined 68 of GOP colleagues in voting to approve the bill to ban DEI programs.
Preserving the Tuskegee legacy amid efforts to dismantle DEI 
Earlier this year, in an effort to comply with Trump administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion, the Air Force removed videos that included stories of the Tuskegee Airmen from the military’s training materials.
Bipartisan outcry over that hasty decision led Air Force officials to walk back the order.
Locally, the Heart of Carolina Chapter of the Tuskegee Airmen and the Wilson V. Eagleson Chapter are now seeking the special day of commemoration outlined in House Bill 254 to ensure that the history of America’s first Black military pilots and their triumph over adversity is never not forgotten.
HB254 won a rare unanimous vote (114-0) on Wednesday in the state House and now moves to the North Carolina Senate.

FAIRMONT, W.Va. — The longest government shutdown in U.S. history didn’t just halt SNAP benefits — it pushed West Virginia’s nonprofit network to fill the gaps, potentially creating long-term repercussions for the sector.
For the first time in U.S. history, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits lapsed on Nov. 1, leaving 274,000 West Virginians without federal assistance for nearly two weeks. A U.S. District Court judge ruled on Nov. 2 that the Trump administration could not withhold the benefits, forcing the U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute $4.6 billion in reserves to states to provide to residents.

But in the intervening time, Misty Tennant, director of the food assistance non-profit Soup Opera in Fairmont, said her soup kitchen served nearly double the number of people it would typically.
“We give out emergency food bags every Friday of the month, and instead of 50 or 55 bags, we gave out 107,” Tennant said. “The numbers just keep increasing, and we’ve seen like 15 new faces today that we hadn’t seen ever.”
She said she’s relieved the benefits are back, but she and other nonprofit leaders say the fallout won’t end with the restoration of SNAP. Instead, the shutdown has created a set of long-term financial and workforce challenges that may take months, or even years, to recover from.

Rosemary Ketchum, the executive director of the West Virginia Nonprofit Association, explained how food banks were struggling with funding throughout the government shutdown.
“Many nonprofits that receive state or federal dollars, once those state or federal dollars were paused, they needed to deeply consider or reconsider what their cash flow status was,” Ketchum said. “Just because there has been a continuing resolution doesn’t mean that the faucet automatically turns some of those federal and state dollars on. This was the longest shutdown in American history, and many nonprofits, kind of on the day to day without a government shutdown, are doing more with less.”
Uncertainty around long-term, stable funding, may lead many employees of the nonprofit sector to step away from their roles, Ketchum said.

“We often forget that nonprofits are also economic workforce generators, and so about 14% of the West Virginia workforce is in the nonprofit sector, and we want to keep those folks employed,” she said. “Whether or not the government is shut down or active, those folks need to work and need to support their own families.”
Even though the government shutdown ended, Martin Howe, executive director of the United Way of Harrison and Doddridge Counties, said it doesn’t automatically fix all of the struggles in the nonprofit sector.
“Most likely a lot of the nonprofits may have to resort to utilizing their reserves … or take out loans, or ultimately some of them may have to cut back on certain programs they offered,” he said. “But even with the government opening back up, there’s going to be a backlog of processing for grants and things such as that that will take months and months to catch up on, so the strain is still going to be experienced by many of these nonprofits that deal directly with federal grants and similar funding streams.”

West Virginia’s two biggest food banks, Facing Hunger in Huntington and Mountaineer Food Bank in Gassaway, support smaller pantries across West Virginia.
Mountaineer Food Bank has 470 community partners throughout 48 of the state’s 55 counties, including the Soup Opera in Fairmont.
Beyond access to food, Daniel Brewster, a sociology professor at West Virginia University, said many families face shame that keeps them from seeking help even when they desperately need it.
“We live in a society that shames people for being poor,” he said. “There is that feeling of inferiority — that looking-glass self — where you start adopting the mentality of ‘people like me can’t do this.’”
Even as organizations brace for long-term financial fallout, Brewster said this crisis again highlighted how deeply West Virginians rely on one another when systems fail.
“We get this right a lot of times in West Virginia,” he said. “In moments like what we’re seeing with SNAP, the community steps up. When there’s catastrophic flooding, West Virginians step up.”

Now as things return to normal, those in the nonprofit sector reflect on the 42 days of uncertainty, Brewster notes that West Virginians often see the impacts of federal decisions long before Washington, D.C, acknowledges them.
“All of us are much closer to being in the situation of the people who are struggling right now than we are to being the richest people in the world,” Brewster said.
Faced with these long-term uncertainties, nonprofits are working to diversify their financial portfolios. According to Ketchum, they are looking into funding sources not tied to state or federal dollars.

Hot-button issues ranging from local land-use decisions to the Trump administration’s attacks on the rule of law were among the subjects of Colorado Newsline’s most widely read commentaries of the year.
Amid controversy over the use of Flock surveillance cameras in Denver and dozens of other communities in Colorado, Newsline editor Quentin Young’s Sept. 18 commentary on this new tool for mass surveillance was by far Newsline’s most-read opinion piece in 2025.
Other popular commentaries addressed Denver police spending, the Trump administration’s meddling in the Tina Peters case and the controversy over plans to build a gas station near a conservation corridor in the small town of Palmer Lake.

Turn your Flock cameras off
Flock Safety AI-powered surveillance cameras, which record images of passing cars and store the information in sharable and searchable databases, are present in more 75 communities in Colorado, including Colorado Springs, Boulder, Durango, Longmont and Castle Rock. Concerns about the cameras emerged this year as the Trump administration implemented its mass deportation policies, and civil liberties advocates have urged cities like Denver to stop using them immediately.
“That advice should be heeded by every city in Colorado that operates Flock cameras,” Newsline’s Quentin Young wrote in a commentary. “If they value their residents’ fundamental rights, if they want to avoid chilling free speech and association, if they want to uphold the freedoms that the country was founded on, they would turn their cameras off right now.”
What Colorado communities can learn from the Buc-ee’s saga
Controversy engulfed the small town of Palmer Lake this year when Buc-ee’s, a national gas station chain, announced plans to open a new travel plaza a few miles from town. Vocal opposition to the plans overwhelmed town council meetings and ultimately resulted in the resignation of the mayor and multiple trustees.
The crux of the issue, wrote Sammy Herdman in a Sept. 30 commentary, was groundwater scarcity.
“As Colorado becomes increasingly arid, contentious disputes about how to accommodate population growth and commercial development without exhausting groundwater resources are bound to arise more frequently,” Herdman wrote. “The Palmer Lake controversy is a harbinger, unless small towns proactively establish rules for growth in a water-limited future.
Coloradans get a glimpse of how the rule of law is being dismantled
March brought the first of many attempts by the Trump administration in 2025 to meddle in the state criminal case that led to former Mesa County clerk Tina Peters’ conviction and imprisonment last year. Trump’s Department of Justice wrote in a filing that it was conducting a “review” of Colorado’s prosecution of Peters, who was convicted on multiple felony counts for her role in a breach of secure voting equipment in an attempt to prove Trump’s lies alleging widespread fraud in the 2020 election.
“This is an attack on state sovereignty, and if Trump prosecutors succeed in modifying Peters’ sentence or conviction it will do grievous harm to the rule of law in Colorado,” wrote Quentin Young in his March 7 commentary.
Denver can’t afford Mayor Johnston’s decisions
Denver city leaders faced tough choices about how to close a $200 million budget gap this year, leading to cuts and layoffs that impacted nearly every city department — with the exception of the Department of Public Safety.
Mayor Mike Johnston’s budget spared the Denver Police Department from layoffs and even increased their funding, wrote Vinnie Cervantes in an Oct. 1 commentary, while proven alternatives like the Denver Support Team Assisted Response program continue to be underfunded.
“In 2020, there seemed to be a near-consensus that policing in the United States needed major reform and many cities conceded that new interventions in crisis response and public safety were needed outside of policing,” Cervantes wrote. “Yet, the Johnston administration has doubled down in investing more into policing through the absence of cuts and layoffs to Public Safety in the midst of massive cuts everywhere else in the budget.”
The Colorado governor joins team MAGA
A state employee this year filed a whistleblower lawsuit alleging Gov. Jared Polis broke state law by ordering the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment to produce information for a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement subpoena.
The case was the latest evidence that “Polis, at least on some crucial matters, is on team MAGA,” wrote Quentin Young in a June 26 commentary.
“Immigration officials have repeatedly acted in bad faith, yet Polis has chosen to give them the benefit of the doubt,” Young wrote. “This has come at great cost to Coloradans — not just the countless families in the state who might fear that masked government goons at any time could kidnap one of their own off the street, but also the tens of thousands of residents who grieve the erosion of constitutional order and have registered their fear and anger by marching in multiple protests against ICE’s unaccountable behavior.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-26 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Denied parole 28 times, Wayne County man still clings to hope",Jolan Kruse,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/26/denied-parole-28-times-wayne-county-man-clings-to-hope/,"James Lukes, 73, was 19 when he was incarcerated,. He is among nearly 70,000 people in the United States serving a life sentence who were under 25 at .the time of their offense.","James Lukes says he slips in his earbuds and the slow ache of blues fills his ears. Johnnie Taylor’s “Last Two Dollars” crackles through the radio, carrying him back to the dusty fields of his childhood farm in Mississippi. 
Now 73, Lukes says he has to lean on a cane as he shuffles through the prison yard of the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, where he’s spent more than five decades serving a life sentence. At 17, he was charged with the stabbing death of Grace Justice in a convenience store in Waynesboro. At 19, fearful of the death penalty, he pleaded guilty – a decision he has second-guessed for decades’. He maintains he is innocent. 
For the first two years, Lukes was young, angry and refused to believe he’d spend the rest of his life in prison. He quickly realized he needed to do something with his time. He took up playing basketball in the yard, but when his aging bones finally began to protest, he switched to watching television and taking walks. Lukes has taken re-entry courses, has a job and strengthened his faith by attending church regularly. 
Even so, the Mississippi Parole Board has turned him down 28 times since he became eligible for release in 1982. Lukes tried admitting guilt to the Parole Board in hopes of gaining parole, but to no avail.
Lukes is among 1 in 6 prisoners, or roughly 200,000 people in the United States, serving life sentences. Nearly 70,000 people serving life were under 25 at the time of their offense and over 40,000 people are serving prison sentences of 50 years or more. 
According to a Nov. 3 fact sheet from the Mississippi Department of Corrections, roughly 1,700 prisoners in Mississippi are serving life sentences.
In the years since Lukes was sentenced, the legal system has taken a deeper look at how it treats young offenders. 
Twenty-eight states have banned mandatory life sentences for those whose crimes were committed as juveniles, following U.S. Supreme Court decisions that have called the practice unconstitutional. High court rulings in Roper v. Simmons (2005), Graham v. Florida (2010), Miller v. Alabama (2012), Montgomery v. Louisiana (2016), and Jones v. Mississippi (2021) have cited brain science showing people under 25 are less capable of understanding long-term consequences and are more susceptible to peer pressure. 
In April 2021, the conservative-majority court reversed that trend, concluding in a 6-3 decision that courts could sentence juveniles to life without hope of parole, even without a finding that a juvenile was permanently incorrigible, a benchmark the court had set in Miller v. Alabama.
Juveniles don’t have the same rights and responsibilities as adults, advocates say, so they should not suffer the same consequences. 
Yet nearly 500 U.S. prisoners serve life-without-parole sentences for crimes they committed as juveniles. An additional 8,600 people as of 2020 are serving a sentence of life with parole or virtual life sentences for crimes committed as juveniles. 
Lukes reflects back on his teenage years, admitting he used to party too much. Prison has made him grow up, he said. While he is thankful to be alive, Lukes said he wishes he could have started a family of his own.
“When you’re in prison, you cannot do what you want to do. You have to do what they want you to do,” Lukes said. 
Lukes said he especially misses the Southern home cooking of potato salad and fried okra. Growing tired of the prison’s gray meat, he has opted for eating fish and chicken. 
It took Lukes two years to adjust to prison life. In the beginning of his time in prison, he would call home to his mother frequently, said his cousin Bobby Joe Gandy.
“He cried and cried. His mom said he had to confess or they’d execute him,” Gandy said. 
Gandy and his brother decided to go to the store where the crime occurred to question the victim’s husband, who owned the store. Five decades later, Gandy can still recite Ralph Justice’s response to him: “He said, ‘Somebody has to pay for it. I’m not.’” Justice died 28 years ago.
According to Lukes, when he arrived at the store, he saw blood on the ground. Afraid, he turned around and went home. Lukes said he later learned Grace Justice had run out of the store after being stabbed. She died on the highway. 
Having already pleaded guilty, Lukes said claiming innocence to a Parole Board could jeopardize his chances at leaving prison. 
“I was just sad, but I had to come up out of that because I was going to be here a long time,” Lukes said. “I’ll have to do the time no matter what I do, so I might as well focus on something that will help me do my time more easily.” 
For a while, seeing his family got Lukes through prison. He was furloughed for 10 days around Christmastime in 1979 and never violated the terms. He would go home and visit with family, and come back on time. His only write up in prison was for sending a Christmas card to a female guard. 
A change in administration took away Lukes’ furlough in the 1980s. Now, he relies on phone calls and the rare opportunities his family has to make the long drive up to the prison from Wayne County.
Lukes said he misses his family and hopes to go home to be with them. His family has advocated heavily for his release. His only obstacle is the Parole Board. 
A report from FWD.us says Mississippi’s parole laws “are a major driver of the state’s dangerously high prison population.” And with parole rates decreasing, prisoners like Lukes are trapped in a cycle of denials. 
“The Parole Board used to give parole. The last 10 to 15 years, they started cutting back,” Lukes said. “I don’t know why.”
The board has continuously denied Lukes, citing the violent nature of the crime and victim opposition. The Parole Board has not responded to a request for comment.

Former Parole Board Chairman Steve Pickett said 65% of prisoners in Mississippi are eligible for parole today, compared to about 35% a decade ago. The change comes from a push to undo tough-on-crime laws enacted in the mid-1990s, when prisoners convicted of violent offenses were ineligible for parole. 
Despite the increase in eligibility, Pickett, who served on the board nine years, said the rate of parole is lower now than in 2014. A public records request with the Mississippi Department of Corrections shows the parole grant rate for November 2025 as roughly 54%.
“Unfortunately, it’s just easier for people to throw money at corrections than it is to hold the system accountable,” Pickett said. “The general public is far removed from the world of corrections.” 
But it’s not just Mississippi affected by these practices. 
In Michigan, Henry Hill was 16 when his life came crashing down. He was at a park with his friends confronting other kids when the situation quickly escalated. 
Hill admitted to having a gun on him, but was running away from the scene when his friend shot and killed one of the other boys. Despite a sheriff testifying to this in court, Hill was convicted of first-degree murder for aiding and abetting and sentenced to life. 
A mental evaluation found Hill to have the education level of a third-grader and the mentality of a 9-year-old. Nevertheless, Hill was tried as an adult. 
“To be sentenced to the rest of my life in prison for a crime that I actually didn’t commit, I would have been able to understand it if I never got out, if I actually did something, but I didn’t,” Hill said. “And then on the flip side, if I did commit the crime, at what point is enough enough? 
So far, 22 states still sentence juveniles to life without parole. Despite efforts from local lawmakers to abolish juvenile life without parole, states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Mississippi remain stuck. 
Wisconsin state Rep. Todd Novak said he’s hopeful the legislature will pass a bill aimed at abolishing juvenile life without parole. A bill he sponsored in 2023 didn’t have time to pass before the session ended. Had it gone through, he said, it  would have eliminated juvenile life without parole and installed a sentence review mechanism for minors. 
Novak, a Republican, said Wisconsin needs to follow the ruling of Miller v. Alabama, which called the sentencing of juveniles to life in prison “cruel and unusual punishment.” 
Despite these rulings, Novak said he has seen  hesitation from lawmakers who are afraid of how the bill will affect public safety.
“I think the big key is to make sure people understand that if this passes, that all these 17-year-olds that were sentenced, that are now in their 40s to 50s, aren’t just automatically going to get out,” Novak said. 
Novak hopes the bill will address Wisconsin’s current harsh sentencing of juveniles. 
One example comes from a tragic event in 2022. A 10-year-old boy in Milwaukee was charged as an adult for the fatal shooting of his mother after she refused to buy him a VR headset. Wisconsin state laws require children 10 and older to be tried as adults for violent crimes such as homicide. 
In Mississippi, children 13 and older can be charged as adults for serious offenses like murder or armed robbery.
“Mississippi doesn’t see life for how it is,” Lukes said. “If someone did their time, let them go.” 
Republican state Rep. Becky Currie, who chairs the House Corrections Committee, declined to comment on whether there are  plans to amend Mississippi state law to address juvenile life without parole.  
In Michigan, Hill was able to gain parole in 2017, and has since been working at a factory and spending time with family. 
“So many evil people out here in society,” Hill said. “They don’t believe in second chances. They don’t believe in anything until somebody in their household or their family or friends get in a similar situation, then now (they think) we gotta get him out and see things with a different perspective.” 
Lukes is trying to find a pro bono lawyer to help reopen his case. His next hearing is in four years. He’ll be 77 years old.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/19143428/MT-State-Inmate-JamesLukes-FeatImage-01.jpg,,,2025-12-26 06:12:52.310031

Eight of the 11 universities in the state that responded to a request for data reported declines in the number of international students in fall 2025, compared to fall 2024, losing a total of 569 students over the year. That number was offset by the three campuses that gained a total of 120 students.
The University of Maryland, College Park lost the largest number of students, going from about 4,260 in Fall 2024 to about 3,980 in Fall 2025 — a loss of nearly 300 students, or 6.7%. Campus Counts, the university’s enrollment map report, does not provide data from countries with less than five students, meaning the decrease could be larger.
St. Mary’s College of Maryland had the largest decrease of 80% — but that reflected a drop from just five international students in fall 2024 and one in fall 2025.
Maryland Matters reached out to 16 Maryland universities early in the semester. Eleven provided data on the number of international students enrolled at their university, and five were either not traditional campuses, such as the University of Maryland Global Campus, or did not respond with data.
﻿﻿﻿
Total international student enrollment fell from 7,608 to 7,159, out of a total of more than 118,000 students on the 11 campuses this fall.
The declines follow the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown and revocation of thousands of student visas in spring. Though many of these visas have been restored, tensions remain high as international students grapple with potential challenges concerning their access to education.
Travel bans, visa interview pauses and a lack of support from the Trump administration, in addition to visa terminations, deter students from choosing to study in the United States and increase global competition, said Rachel Banks, the senior director of public policy and legislative strategy at NAFSA, an international educators association.
“We’re in this sort of fraught, anxious, uncertain period — you have students considering other options, especially in the English language space,” Banks said. “They’re high-quality, and welcoming.”
Banks also cited the Trump administration’s proposals to end duration of status by limiting international students’ studies to four years, while the original duration of status policy allows international students to stay in the United States until their studies are complete. Students — especially those in a Ph.D. program — may choose other countries to study due to concerns that they will not finish their program before their duration of status expires, Banks said.
“If there’s that uncertainty hanging over a student’s head, they’re going to think twice — you know — ‘I’m better off going to Canada, or the UK, or even countries that are non-English speaking,’” Banks said.
The University of Maryland, Baltimore County lost more than 200 international students from Fall 2024 to Fall 2025, leaving them with a 23% decrease. While the number of international undergraduate students increased by 22, the number of incoming international graduate students decreased by 234 at UMBC.
“While the decline in incoming international graduate students is concerning, we are optimistic that we will be able to work with international students to navigate the changing environment and continue to be a thriving community of international learners, researchers and teachers,” Yvette Mozie-Ross, the university’s vice provost for enrollment management and planning, said in a statement.
﻿﻿
Frostburg State University saw a 15.2% decrease in international students on campus. This does not account for its partnership with the Hunan University of Technology and Business in Changsha, China, which saw a 24.3%  increase in enrollment.
Salisbury University’s international student enrollment dropped by 11% — a decrease of 10 students. Fall 2025 numbers are the university’s estimate from late September.
Bowie State University, Towson University and the University of Maryland, Baltimore all faced decreases of less than 10% — losing 19, 11 and 12 students, respectively.
“International students are experiencing increased uncertainty in the past year from new federal proposals and policies that have targeted them,” Michael Sandler, the University System of Maryland’s vice chancellor for communications and marketing, said in a statement. “These actions will constrict the pipeline of international talent that contributes to our academic strength and scientific innovation.”
Three universities — the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Morgan State University and Coppin State University — saw increases in international student enrollment. Coppin State University had the largest increase of international students, at 25%, with 16 extra studens. The University of Maryland Eastern Shore and Morgan State University increased their international student enrollment by 8.1% and 9.2%, or 9 and 95 more students, respectively.
Banks emphasized the importance of international talent at universities, especially at large research institutions, such as those that contribute to research in the health care field or make technological advances.
She also noted that international students bring culture to domestic students who may not be able to have their own international experience, and presented worries about culture-focused small businesses that were inspired by international student’s presence.
“International students play an essential role in Maryland’s campus communities, bringing cultural diversity, global perspectives and research talent,” Sanjay Rai, the Maryland Higher Education Commission’s secretary, said in a statement. “While some institutions have seen short-term decreases, Maryland remains committed to being a welcoming destination for students around the world.”

(Photo by Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)Virginia’s transportation system is massive, with about 129,000 lane miles of roads and roughly 5,900 miles of rail criss-crossing the commonwealth, according to the Virginia Department of Transportation and a 2022 Virginia Statewide Rail Plan.  
There’s always some kind of improvement or expansion underway, leaving drivers and commuters wondering when relief will arrive. 
But before unpacking what projects Virginians can expect in 2026, federal funding looms as a major factor shaping what moves forward — and what does not.
“Probably the biggest change to transportation development for 2026 is the fallout that all of our local and state partners are feeling from federal funding,” said Brantley Tyndall, director at BikeWalkRVA. 
”Federal funding in many ways [will be] reduced or dried up. And in particular the USDOT has been ordered to oppose the funding of bike/ped projects. They are viewed as antagonistic to cars and driving. We think that’s very shortsighted. It’s going to lead to years and years of funding short falls that will be very difficult to fill.”
 Some bright federal funding spots

In November, U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Democrats, touted an almost $70 million release of federal grant funding to improve Virginia’s bus and rail systems. Part of that package includes $8.6 million to the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation system to replace aging vehicles. 
Also included under that $70 million amount will be roughly $10.9 million to the city of Alexandria and $50.3 million to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to convert buses to low or no emission vehicles. 
The money comes from the Department of Transportation’s 2025-26 fiscal year Low or No Emission program and a FY25 Buses & Bus Facilities Program — all part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed during President Biden’s administration. 
Also in November, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy released a similar press release announcing the same grants, describing them as part of the Trump’s administration’s investment in modernizing America’s transit bus infrastructure. 
 Highlights for 2026 at the General Assembly

With an eye toward 2026, here’s what some government and transportation officials say are on the horizon for the new year. 
Del. Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, chairs the Transportation Committee. She said one of the biggest issues her committee will be taking up next session will involve expanding photo speed enforcement devices, which she said did not become law during the previous session. 
“That was a big conversation last session and an important one,” Delaney said. “I think that we’re going to get a little more into [it] this session because the crime commission just released a study that I had asked them to complete.” Delaney said the report was based on conversations from the last session. 
“We just need to have this looked at a little closer so that we can really drill down on where the issues are, and what legislative solutions are needed to address,” she said. 
Delaney emphasized that some of those issues range from some transportation board members wanting to expand their use to include more locations — which some lawmakers disagree with. At the same time, there’s a debate about whether the current speed enforcement cameras already in place are doing what they’re supposed to be doing. 
“Are they fair? Are they just? And there’s been a lot of concern about their revenue generation,” Delaney said. “There are some localities in the commonwealth that are making thousands of dollars a year in profits off of their speed cameras. And now those funds are going to the general funds, and adding quite a bit of cushion to their budget. It creates, at a minimum, a concern that localities have an incentive to police for profit.”
The Virginia Mercury reported on this bill last session.
 Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel

“The biggest project in the history of the commonwealth is, have you ever heard of a little thing called Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel?” said John Mahaley, principal transportation planner at Hampton Roads Transportation Planning Organization. 
“If you’ve ever gone to the Outer Banks, you’ve been through there. That project needed to be done 30 years ago. Finally, we were able to get the money to do it.”
Mahaley said drivers will be able to see substantial completion within a year or so. But full completion — and opening the tunnel to traffic — won’t happen for several months after that, because eight express lanes still need to be built on either side of the water to match the tunnel.
 Washington Metro Area

Northern Virginia rail and transit commuters can expect to see line expansions, increased bus service and the installation of modernized bike parking within the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
“We’re installing new bike lockers across 73 of our stations,” a Metro spokesperson said. “What that does is kind of enable a kind of wider reach for Metrorail stations. Most people might only walk 10 or 15 minutes to get to a Metro station. But if they live 20 or 25 minutes away, it gives people a safe place to park [their] bike.”
Lockers would cost $1 a day and bikes would be protected from rain and snow. Installation of the lockers will be ongoing, with updates posted on WMATA’s website. 
For riders on the Yellow Line, starting Dec. 31, the Yellow Line will extend to Greenbelt, serving destinations in D.C. including Shaw and Columbia Heights, among others. In mid-December, WMATA released a proposed budget that includes rail and service increases on 15% of their routes. If approved by the Metro Board of Directors, the new services would go into effect July 1, 2026.

“We are really looking at more groundbreaking and ribbon-cutting throughout the region,” said BikeWalkRVA’s Tyndall, in areas such as Lakeside, Bryan Park and Kanawha Plaza. 
“So by early 2026 we’re going to have about 20 miles under construction or at least under contract being administered and something active or completed in every locality.”

(Photo by Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)As the year ends, we’re taking an opportunity to highlight our favorite stories of 2025. 
The past year saw bitter fights over Pennsylvania’s state budget, drastic changes to federal programs the state relies on, consequential off-year elections, economic turbulence, data centers driving historic demands on the power grid, and history-making lawsuits. 
To state the obvious, it feels like it’s been a year practically unlike any other for news. 
Through it all, we’ve had changes at the Capital-Star too. In February, Tim Lambert became our new editor. Emily Previti joined our team in May to lead a new audio initiative that’s brought our work to radio stations across the commonwealth. We said goodbye to a great reporter, John Cole, and gained a new one in Whitney Downard.
Our team is small — four reporters and an editor. And it can be daunting to keep track of so many moving parts. But when I look at the work my colleagues have done, always centering the ordinary Pennsylvanians impacted by state and federal policy, I’m proud and grateful to be a part of it. 
When a federal shutdown threatened SNAP benefits for some of the most vulnerable Pennsylvanians, Emily Previti went to a part of the state where roughly one in five people rely on the program to keep food on their tables: Northumberland County. Emily not only broke down the complex hurdles the state faced in getting benefits to those who need them, but managed to convey the sense of fear and vulnerability by the people most affected, as well as their efforts to stay resilient.
Peter Hall has been doggedly reporting on what proliferating data centers mean for Pennsylvanians and their electric bills, as the federal government pushes to keep U.S. companies dominant in Artificial Intelligence. I thought this story was a great look at one federal government effort — to keep coal plants online past their planned retirement dates — and what that could mean for Pennsylvanian’s electric bills and the environment.

Whitney Downard joined the Capital-Star in November, moving from one of our sister outlets in Indiana. She hit the ground running, covering one of the most consequential stories to emerge this year: the impacts of expiring subsidies for Pennsylvanians insured through Pennie plans, and the battle in Washington, D.C. over what to do about them. I loved this particular story because it was a human one, centering the stakes for one couple who rely on those subsidies for life-saving care.

As far as my work goes, I’m particularly proud of the stories I did documenting the Trump administration’s attempts to remake the federal workforce, and how it affected the tens of thousands of federal employees in Pennsylvania. While a lot has changed through lawsuits, pushback and changes in strategy in Washington, D.C., I think this early story I did captured the chaos of the early days of DOGE and mass layoffs, with a focus on affected workers and the impacts of the services they provide.

As Congress debates whether to extend the temporary federal subsidies that have helped millions of Americans buy health coverage, a crucial underlying reality is sometimes overlooked: Those subsidies are merely a band-aid covering the often unaffordable cost of health care.
California, Massachusetts, Connecticut and five other states have set caps on health care spending in a bid to rein in the intense financial pressure felt by many families, individuals and employers who every year face increases in premiums, deductibles and other health-related expenses.
Hospitals and other health care providers are citing Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump in July, as one more reason to challenge those limits.
The law is expected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over a decade, which mathematically should help the overall health care system meet the caps. But the law is also expected to increase the number of uninsured Americans, mostly Medicaid beneficiaries, by an estimated 10 million people. Health care analysts predict hospitals and other providers will raise prices to cover the double whammy of lost Medicaid revenue and the cost of caring for an influx of newly uninsured patients.
Whether regulators in some states will allow providers to justify higher prices and exceed the spending caps is unclear. Only California and Oregon can penalize providers financially if they fail to meet targets.
“Are we going to say, ‘That’s OK’? Or are we going to say, ‘Well, you exceeded the target. We’re still going to penalize you for that’?” said Richard Pan, a former state lawmaker and a member of the California Office of Health Care Affordability’s board. “That has not yet been decided.”
The California Hospital Association, the industry’s main state lobbying group, filed a lawsuit in October asking a state court to strike down the spending caps, which it argued fail to account for all the cost pressures hospitals face. Those pressures, it said, include an aging, sicker population; the rising cost of labor; expensive advances in medical technology; large capital outlays on required seismic retrofitting; and changes in federal policy, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The hospital group’s lawsuit also asserted that the state affordability office, by hastily imposing ill-considered cost-cutting targets, was undermining its other key mission of improving health care access, quality and equity.
California’s affordability office last year set a five-year target to cap statewide spending growth, starting at 3.5% in 2025 and declining to 3% by 2029. The annual caps apply to a wide range of health care entities, including hospitals, medical groups, insurers and other payers.
Earlier this year, it imposed much lower spending growth caps — starting at 1.8% in 2026 and declining to 1.6% by 2029 — for seven “high-cost” hospitals.
“The spending caps set by politically appointed bureaucrats could force cuts that result in many Californians traveling farther for care, facing longer emergency room wait times, experiencing more overcrowding and losing access to critical services,” Carmela Coyle, the hospital association’s president and CEO, said in an October press release.
The California attorney general’s office, which will represent the affordability agency, has not yet filed a response to the hospital group’s complaint and did not respond to a request for comment.
Hospitals’ pushback
California is not the only state taking a close look at hospital prices, which are widely considered a primary driver of health care costs.
“States, armed with information that points to payments to hospitals as a driver of what is way beyond affordable commercial premiums, have begun to take increasingly targeted actions focused on commercial hospital prices,” said Michael Bailit, founder of the Needham, Massachusetts-based consultancy Bailit Health, which has advised multiple states, including California, on ways to tame health care spending. “It is not surprising that the hospital industry is going to oppose such state actions.”
In its lawsuit, the California Hospital Association said the affordability office’s own report showed that pharmaceutical and insurance companies are largely responsible for high costs.
Hospitals in some states with cost growth limits, including Connecticut and Massachusetts, have expressed objections similar to the ones raised in the California lawsuit. They could follow their counterparts in California if their lawsuit succeeds, said Peter Lee, who led California’s Affordable Care Act marketplace, Covered California, for over a decade and is now a senior scholar at Stanford Medicine’s Clinical Excellence Research Center.
Lee said the work of California’s affordability office and similar agencies in other states is just about the only systemwide effort being made to cut health care costs. They are basically saying, “‘Look, health care is taking money away from education, it is taking money away from the environment, it is taking money away from everything in the public sector, and in the private sector it is taking money away from wages,’” he said. “‘We don’t know how you, the health system, are going to do it, but it is your job not just to provide quality but to lower costs. Here’s the target.’”
To be sure, achieving the cost savings that California and those other states are seeking is no easy lift. It will ultimately require persuading large, financially powerful players that compete fiercely for health care dollars to adopt a different mindset and begin cooperating to reduce costs instead. And that, in many cases, will mean lower revenue.
But the status quo, as many people know all too well, means continued financial pain for millions.
In early 2020, Estevan Rodriguez, a bartender at California’s Monterey Beach Hotel, had surgery for a staph infection in his leg. The bill came to nearly $168,000. His insurance paid most of it, but he still owed $5,665, which took him two years to pay, more than $200 every month. “It may not be a lot to some people, but it was a lot to me,” Rodriguez said.
He said he dropped his Hulu subscription, switched to a lower-cost cellphone, and got cheaper car insurance. He started going to food banks rather than the grocery store, he said, and had a lot less time with his kids, because he was constantly working to pay off the hospital bill.
Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, where Rodriguez had his surgery, is one of the seven hospitals identified by California’s affordability office as high-cost. A study by the office attributed high hospital prices in Monterey County to a lack of market competition “rather than higher operating costs or superior quality of care.”
The Monterey hospital referred a request for comment about its “high-cost” designation to the California Hospital Association. CHA spokesperson Jan Emerson-Shea declined to comment beyond the language of the lawsuit and Coyle’s press release statement.
Reduced competition
Health care analysts worry the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will reduce market competition even further by stressing already weak hospitals, leading some to shut services, merge with larger health systems, or close. One study estimates 338 rural hospitals are at risk of closing nationwide.
Less competition, in addition to fewer Medicaid dollars and an increase in uninsured patients, will only strengthen the incentive of health systems with the requisite market clout to raise their commercial prices, increasing premiums for employers and individuals.
“We think commercial prices will continue to increase as health care providers, and hospitals in particular, will seek to preserve or increase their revenue,” said Rachel Block, a program officer at the Milbank Memorial Fund, a foundation that focuses on health equity.
That in turn could pose a challenge to state affordability regulators tasked with overseeing compliance with growth targets for health care spending.
California’s affordability office is required to consider mitigating factors, including changes in federal and state laws. But some of its board members have expressed skepticism about letting hospitals offset Medicaid losses with higher commercial prices.
“There’s a lot of talk about using HR 1 and other federal policies as an excuse to raise prices on commercial payers,” Ian Lewis, an affordability office board member and policy director for UNITE HERE Local 2, a hospitality workers union in the Bay Area, said at the agency’s July board meeting, referring to the One Big Beautiful Bill. “There’s no more blood to be squeezed from this stone.”

Little things
Small essays on simple subjects.
Read the archive.

What about a towel? How many times do we turn it over and across? How small do we make that resulting square? Your mother or father or grandmother likely had strong opinions on the subject, perhaps linked to cupboard size. 
The most challenging items to fold are, of course, shirts. No method of folding shirts makes sense. I learned to fold the shirt vetically and reach both of the arms out as though the wearer was serving a volleyball. (Sometimes the arms naturally reach backward, as though the wearer was being arrested.) Then I folded the arms back toward the shirt and bisect the entire thing.
If you think that description’s confusing, try folding some shirts!
We don’t really have a vocabulary for a practice so basic and ingrained. We learn how to fold them, then we do it for the rest of our lives. Perhaps we squabble over who tackles the next batch. But we don’t focus on the folding itself. The knowledge stays locked inside us like the half-remembered melody of a song, activated when we hear the tune or pick up the rainbow sweater vest.
Clothes don’t have to be folded. You can always put them on a hangers. No item of clothing works better on a hanger than a long-sleeved shirt. A coat comes in a close second because there’s really no other place to put it except a hook, and that stretches out the back of its collar.
You can also leave them in a pile on the floor. This method, while supremely efficient and easy to understand, has faced rejection from mothers in law and neatness-obsessed roommates the world over. I’m not sure what their problem is.
For a brief time, I dry cleaned my clothes. When I moved back to Kansas to work at The Topeka Capital-Journal, I decided that I was going to wear suits every day to work. I like this as a concept: the suit works marvelously as a uniform suggesting formality and elegance. I don’t know that it worked, but I like to imagine that it did.
The suits had to be maintained, however, which meant regular trips to the dry cleaner a few blocks from my home. (Post pandemic, that branch of the cleaner has closed.) I loved the concept of outsourcing the entire operation — cleaning, folding and hanging.
The suits didn’t last. We were raising a kindergartner at the time, and the house was usually turned upside down for one reason or another. Career changes came soon after. I blinked a couple of times and there I was in the laundry room again, taking out a fresh batch of warm clothes and folding them one by one.
There are, I suppose, worse ways to spend a weekend afternoon. And I can always go back to the suits.

Property taxes and gun rights, meanwhile, have emerged as issues likely to dominate the 2026 legislative session, which kicks off in a little more than two weeks.
Donald Trump endorses Byron Donalds (Feb. 20)
With Ron DeSantis now in lame-duck status, one of the biggest stories in Florida politics was to whom would the Republicans run to succeed him. While names like Matt Gaetz, Ashley Moody, Casey DeSantis, Jimmy Patronis, and Jeanette Nuñez were bandied about early on, many of them became no longer viable for various reasons as the year progressed.
Byron Donalds was among those always in the mix, but his candidacy went into the stratosphere after President Trump endorsed him in a Truth Social post, before the Naples Republican had even formally entered the contest. “RUN, BYRON, RUN!” POTUS wrote and, less than a week later, Donalds announced his candidacy.
Since then, he’s never looked back in the polls and, with more than $40 million raised to date, is dwarfing both his Republican and Democratic opponents. Can any candidate catch him? That’ll be the story of the year in Florida politics in 2026.
The Hope Florida story breaks (April 11)
The Tallahassee bureau for the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald broke the Hope Florida story during the middle of the legislative session. If nothing else, the affair amplified the already cold war brewing between Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office and the Florida House of Representatives.
The story reported that just weeks after the administration steered $10 million from a Medicaid legal settlement to the Hope Florida Foundation — the entity led by Casey DeSantis designed to connect Floridians in need with government resources, nonprofits, the private sector, and religious organizations — in the fall of 2024.
The foundation moved those funds to two nonprofit groups (Save Our Society from Drugs, or SOS, and Securing Florida’s Future). Those groups then routed those funds to Keep Florida Clean, a political action committee created to beat the proposed constitutional amendment to legalize recreational cannabis in the state.

The story electrified the Capitol, and was immediately denounced as a political hit job by DeSantis designed to hurt him and the first lady. Hearings were held in the House of Representatives, and in October a Leon County grand jury began investigating the allegations. No indictments or final reports have been issued.
DeSantis appoints Ashley Moody to the U.S. Senate (Jan. 16); Blaise Ingoglia as CFO (July 16); Jay Collins as lieutenant governor (Aug. 12)
Call it the DeSantis Legacy Project. While the governor has just a year left in office, he’s been able to appoint people close to him to positions of power in the state that could shape Floridians’ lives long after he moves out of the Governor’s Mansion.

The governor undoubtedly had many worthy Republicans he could have appointed to replace Marco Rubio in the U.S. Senate. He chose a close ideological partner in Attorney General Ashley Moody. He then quickly replaced her in the Cabinet position with his former chief of staff, James Uthmeier.
He took much more time before selecting two of his then-closest allies in the Florida Senate — Blaise Ingoglia and Jay Collins — to succeed Jimmy Patronis as CFO and Jeanette Nuñez as his lieutenant governor, respectively.
DeSantis and Ingoglia have been singing off the same sheet music in the past half-year in their campaign to eliminate or substantially reduce property taxes in Florida in 2026. And while just as conservative as Moody, Uthmeier has embraced picking fights that capture headlines — not a bad strategy as he goes before voters for the first time in his life in 2026. Whether his involvement in the Hope Florida saga lifts his candidacy next year remains to be seen.
And Collins? When DeSantis named him as LG in August in Tampa, the governor hailed him as “the Chuck Norris of Florida politics.” Political observers speculated it was a matter of when, not if, the governor would endorse him to take on Donalds for governor next year.
That DeSantis endorsement hasn’t happened, however, and despite the millions of dollars in TV ads that aired over the past month on college football Saturdays and the Sunday morning political talk shows, Collins apparently still wasn’t ready to announce his candidacy at the end of the year. Will he do so in 2026?
Immigration (Jan. 7)
No governor was more excited about Donald Trump’s campaign pledge for mass deportations during his second go-round at the White Hose than Ronald Dion DeSantis.
Screenshot of AI-generated image posted on the official White House X account on July 1, 2025, promoting the “Alligator Alcatraz” name given to the immigrant detention center in the Everglades.
The governor surprised state lawmakers when he said just days into the New Year that he wanted to call a special session on immigration ahead of the regular legislative session.
“We’ve done a lot. We passed a major bill in 2023, but I think that there needs to be some additional legislation to help complement the federal government’s now–newfound appreciation to stop illegal immigration, and to hold people accountable. … We need to be prepared to act. I don’t think that you can wait until April or May to do something in that respect,” he said.
That led to the first of what would be many clashes with the Florida House and Speaker Danny Perez, when the Perez declaring he saw no need to hold a special session just then. Senate President Ben Albritton also initially rejected the call.
“It is completely irresponsible to get out ahead of any announcements President Trump will make, especially when uninformed or ill-timed state action could potentially impair or impede the success of President Trump’s forthcoming efforts to end illegal immigration, close our borders, and protect the sovereignty of our nation,” Albritton and Perez wrote in response.
Ultimately, the Legislature and DeSantis did come together on an anti-illegal immigration package in mid-February that included a provision making it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
That measure was blocked by a federal judge in Miami, who later found Attorney General James Uthmeier in contempt of court for referring to the court’s order blocking the law as illegitimate and unlawful.
The state made international news in the summer with the unveiling of a federal detention center in the Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” In December, Amnesty International said in a report that facility as well as the federal Krome North Services Processing Center may have violated international standards by imposing conditions that could amount to torture of detainees,
The Florida Legislature passes and Gov. DeSantis signs HB 1205, making it significantly harder to pass citizen-led constitutional amendments (May 2)

“This is the most important bill that we will be hearing in this chamber,” Democratic Senate Leader Lori Berman said about HB 1205 when the bill came before the chamber during the last week of the regularly scheduled legislative session earlier this year. “And as you’ve heard, it’s going to greatly restrict the access of the citizens of the state of Florida to be able to address the system.”
The bill was driven by the zeal of Gov. DeSantis, who announced at the beginning of the year that it was a top legislative priority for him. As the Phoenix reported at the time, the governor and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature argued that the measure was needed to combat signature petition fraud that they alleged had been exposed last year in the campaigns to pass constitutional amendments regarding legalizing recreational marijuana and abortion rights.
Floridians narrowly failed to pass the two constitutional amendments that DeSantis fiercely opposed. The effects have become apparent this year, with groups that had hoped to place amendments on the ballot throwing in the towel because of the tougher requirements. And it’s also threatened a new effort by Trulieve and others in the medical marijuana industry in Florida to get a new constitutional amendment on the ballot in 2026.
Democratic Senate Leader Jason Pizzo quits the Florida Democratic Party (April 24)
It was another difficult year for the Florida Democratic Party, which faces a more than 1.4 million voter registration disadvantage to the Republican Party at year end.
Pizzo’s stunned his colleagues and the political establishment in Tallahassee when he declared on the Senate floor that he was done with the Democratic Party, proclaiming it was “dead.” “But there are good people that can resuscitate it, but they don’t want it to be me.”
Two months after his departure, Chair Nikki Fried declared that “our message is s***,” during the Florida Democratic Party’s Leadership Blue gala in Broward County. “Our brand is broken. But quitting, hiding, waiting, or whining will not fix it. What will? Showing up.”
So, the question is going into the 2026 cycle is, will Florida Democrats show up at the ballot box a year from now? And can that make a difference? Nationally, the depression surrounding the party following Donald Trump’s election over Kamala Harris has appeared to dissipate, based on the results of the few major elections this fall. But as was the case going back to 2018 during Trump’s first reign in office, will a “blue wave” even make it to the Sunshine State?
Democrats were heartened in the spring when their two candidates running in special congressional elections lost by “only” 15 points in Florida’s First Congressional District and 14 points in the Sixth District.

The Sixth District seat was won by Republican Randy Fine over Democrat Josh Weil, who stunned political observers by raising more than $15 million in a race that the GOP incumbent in November of 2024 (Mike Waltz) had won by 33 points.
Weil announced in June that would run for the party’s nomination for U.S. Senate in 2026 against Moody, and boasted that his team would raise $10 million on its own for voter registration efforts in Florida leading up to the 2026 election, with an emphasis on Miami-Dade and Pinellas counties. Unfortunately for him and the party, Weil announced a little over a month later that he was dropping out of the race because of health concerns.
The party closed out the year on an up note, with Eileen Higgins becoming the first registered Democrat to become mayor of Miami since the 1990s. Fried notably praised Democrats, Republicans, and independents for Higgins’ big victory, because the party is going to need those voters not registered with the party to make an impact at the ballot box next year.
Former GOP U.S. Rep. David Jolly and Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings now look to be in a competitive battle for the party’s nomination for governor in 2026.
Local governments and citizens express revulsion towards Senate Bill 180 (Sept. 29)
The latest blow to local growth management laws in Florida was passage of Senate Bill 180 earlier this year. The measure effectively freezes local land-development regulations and comprehensive plans through October 2027. It didn’t generate much controversy during the legislative session, because for most of its movement through committees it was perceived as a thoughtful measure to help local residents recover from the devastating hurricanes Helene and Milton in the fall of 2024.

Calling it the “largest incursion into local home rule authority” since adoption of the Florida Constitution in 1968, 25 local governments have gone to court to try to block the law that restricts local governments from regulating development.
At the heart of the anger of local governments are two specific parts of the bill that freeze cities and counties from adopting land-use regulations considered “more restrictive or burdensome” than those in place before the recent (or future) hurricanes, even if the changes are unrelated to disaster recovery.
During a Manatee County legislative delegation meeting in Bradenton in late October, several citizens blasted state lawmakers, saying they had “betrayed” them in voting for the legislation.
Pinellas County Republican Sen. Nick DiCeglie said his motivation for the legislation was to ensure that local governments prepare and respond better to natural disasters than they did a year ago. In December, he filed a bill (SB 840) to scale back some the effects of SB 180 that will be heard in the 2026 session.

Will Florida become the first state in the country to eliminate property taxes?
That’s the scenario that Gov. DeSantis appears determined to to leave as one of his most important policy achievements before he leaves the governor’s mansion for parts unknown.
The governor made it clear during the 2025 legislative session that he’d prefer Floridians with homesteaded properties receive a tax break at the same time that the House and Senate was debating how big of a sales tax the state could afford as an alternative.
His advocacy picked up steam after he appointed close ally Blaise Ingoglia to replace Jimmy Patronis as the state’s chief financial officer. Ingoglia travelled around the state with his Florida DOGE (later rebranded as FAFO) team to accuse some of the biggest (and not so big) local governments in the state that they had indulged in millions of dollars of wasted spending — in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars.
Ingoglia’s efforts were a prebuttal to expected complaints from local officials that a major reduction in property tax revenues would deplete vital services for their residents. “I think there is more than enough room to cut local budgets, probably by the amount of 15%, and not even worry about taking away any money for essential services,” he said during a debate at the University of South Florida in November.
Reducing or removing property taxes can only be done by the public via a constitutional amendment. The question is, how many bills to do the job? DeSantis said at a press conference in Tampa in late October that he wanted only one to go before the voters next year. He blasted the eight separate proposals (including seven resolutions that would be constitutional amendments) proposed by the Florida House as “milquetoast,” with “not one proposal that would get people excited about.”
House members say they’re still waiting for DeSantis to offer any specific language for property tax relief.
Florida appeals court declares the state’s ban on open carry unconstitutional (Sept. 10)
For having the reputation as being one of the least regulated states in the country when it comes to firearms (“The gunshine state,” anyone?) Florida had been one of just a handful of states that banned the open carrying of firearms in the country.
No longer.
A three-judge panel of the Florida First District Court of Appeal ruled in September that the 1987 law banning open carry was unconstitutional — a ruling cheered by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier.
“Our office fully supports the Court’s decision,” he said on X. “This is a big win for the Second Amendment rights of Floridians.”
Days after the ruling, Uthmeier said that reinterpreting the law based on the court’s ruling was “not the cleanest solution and there’s likely cleanup that’s going to be needed by the Legislature.”
An implementing bill is likely, but Second Amendment advocates say they’re concerned about how far that might go.
“Members of Florida Gun Rights stand united and strong against any potential infringements on the recent ruling which declared Florida’s ban on open carry as unconstitutional,” Logan Edge of that organization told the Phoenix.
“The Legislature remains a hostile opponent against gun rights and open carry but, after many years of pushback, gun owners gained a massive victory in the courts,” he added. “We will make sure every Tallahassee legislator hears from gun rights activists and oppose any effort to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.”
Congressional redistricting (Dec. 4)
In advance of the 2020 U.S. Census, the state’s congressional delegation breakdown was 16 Republicans and 11 Democrats.
Gov. Ron DeSantis’ own congressional redistricting map (later declared by the courts to be constitutional) resulted in the GOP gaining four additional seats, taking a 20-8 lead (the state was awarded an additional seat in the Census).
Now, after President Donald Trump called on Texas to redraw its congressional districts to guarantee him an additional five Republican seats as he fears losing the House to the Democrats in 2026, other states have been following suit, with the Sunshine State only now beginning such efforts.
Gov. DeSantis and the Legislature appear to be in lockstep, with the only dispute so far being the timing: The House wants to come up with a new map by time the regular legislative session ends in mid-March, while the governor and now the Senate want them to wait and focus on the matter during a special session later in the spring.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/0-9-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-12-26 00:11:47.334037

Spend a morning with Spike at Royal Farms. For more than six years, he has stocked shelves, organized inventory, cleaned and supported his team in ways that help the whole store run smoothly. His enthusiasm lifts the people around him and quietly shapes the experience of everyone who walks through the door.
Stories like Spike’s are powerful examples of what can happen when businesses open their doors to people with developmental disabilities. Employing individuals with disabilities strengthens the workplace in real and measurable ways. It strengthens our communities as well. Yet far too many people with disabilities still struggle to find meaningful employment.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is twice the rate of those without disabilities. Only a quarter of working-age adults with disabilities participates in the labor force, compared with nearly 70% of those without disabilities.
Many people with developmental disabilities want to work but never receive the opportunity. Fewer than 20% have a paid job in an integrated setting, and among those who do not, nearly half say they want one.

Employers play a vital role in closing this gap.
Why employers should hire people with disabilities
When they embrace the strengths of people with disabilities, the benefits reach far beyond the individual employee. Businesses report that team members with disabilities are dedicated, dependable and eager to contribute. Many employers tell us that welcoming these employees brings renewed purpose to the workplace. Staff morale improves, teamwork deepens and customers notice the difference.
Research supports this experience. A study from the University of Toronto found that businesses that employ people with disabilities see financial benefits, including cost savings from higher retention. They also experience stronger employee and customer loyalty, as well as meaningful improvements in workplace culture.
People with disabilities bring unique perspectives and thoughtful problem solving. When they are part of a team, colleagues often become more mindful of how to make their work environment stronger and more welcoming for everyone.
Creating a supportive workplace for people with developmental disabilities does not need to be complicated. A few guiding practices can make a meaningful impact.

Train managers so they understand how to support workers with disabilities and when accommodations may be needed. The Job Accommodation Network is a helpful resource.
Provide reasonable accommodations. Many are simple or no cost, and most employers report that accommodations are far less expensive than expected.
Educate staff so everyone understands the organization’s commitment to supporting workers with disabilities and recognizes the value they bring.
Encourage connection among employees, which may include peer groups or informal support networks.
Understand the Americans with Disabilities Act so the workplace remains accessible and equitable.

Disability employment in action
Many local employers have seen firsthand how powerful this can be. Hannah Olexy works at Moonlit Acres Retreat Farm as a peer advocate specialist. She creates workshops and programs for people in the neurodivergent community, from gardening activities to health and safety training. Assistant Director Todd Bonney says, “Not only did we realize she can provide service, but in many ways she is doing it better than we do.” Hannah brings insight, compassion and leadership to everything she does.
Now is the time to make sure our workplaces reflect the belief that everyone has something valuable to offer. Creating employment opportunities for people with disabilities is not only the right thing to do. It strengthens businesses, builds healthier communities, and helps people discover purpose and pride in their work. When we open doors for others, we all move forward together.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AdobeStock_387670603-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-26 09:57:31.444356

The federal funds covering the cost of the move came through this fall, but for several months earlier this year, it was unclear whether that would happen.
In 2023, a severe storm damaged Ayer Hall’s HVAC system and a few floors where many of the center’s archives and cultural artifacts are stored. In November 2024, the Margaret Walker Center staff applied for a $317,039 federal grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services to cover relocating the historic materials while Ayer Hall is renovated. IMLS is a small federal agency that supports museums, libraries and cultural institutions across the country.
Then in March, President Donald Trump issued an executive order requiring the IMLS and other federal agencies to scale down to “the minimum presence.” At IMLS, nearly 70 employees  were placed on administrative leave at the small federal agency, which supports museums, libraries and cultural institutions across the country.
When the IMLS team was placed on leave, the Margaret Walker Center staff was left in limbo about their grant. After nearly six months of uncertainty, the center received its IMLS grant in September. 
“We couldn’t be more grateful,” said Angela Stewart, an archivist at the center. 
The Margaret Walker Center funding will also help cover the cost of professional development workshops with a focus on boosting museum operations and management.

Maintaining cultural institutions like the Margaret Walker Center requires funding that goes beyond the price of admission or local tax dollars, said Sen. Hillam Frazier, a Democrat from Jackson and a 1974 JSU alumnus. In states like Mississippi, where access to resources and support for cultural institutions may be meager, funding has been essential in preserving state history, he said.  
“It is a godsend to get this money, the tools and resources for an institution like the Margaret Walker Center at Jackson State,” Frazier said. “Museums and libraries are sometimes the only access to education that people may have where they can further explore their curiosity and areas of interests, as well as know their history.”
The importance of the history
After the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, Margert Walker Alexander, an accomplished poet and writer, founded the Institute for the Study of the History, Life, and Culture of Black People at what was then Jackson State College. 
At the time, universities and colleges across the country were adding Black history departments, courses and programs to their curriculum as a result of student activism from the Civil Rights and Black Power movements. 
U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, who knew Walker and attended Tougaloo College in the 1970s with her son Sigismund Walker Alexander, remembers admiring her “spirit and commitment to writing about Black people and Black life in the Deep South.” Walker was a pivotal figure in the movement to establish Black intellectual and academic studies,  he said. 
“She aspired for the institute to reflect her passion as an academic, artist and activist, and the university commended her preservation efforts,” said Thompson, a 1972 JSU alumnus.
When Walker retired in 1979 after 30 years as an English professor at Jackson State, the university honored her by renaming the cultural center after her. 
The center is also home to important collections and memorabilia from notable Black Mississippians such as a collection from William Lamson an architect and analyst for court cases dealing with school desegregation, voting rights, housing discrimination and judicial redistricting. Another example is a collection from Rod Paige, the first Black U.S.  secretary of education who was also an interim president of JSU, That collection includes memoranda, reports, speeches, scrapbooks and papers reflecting on Paige’s role during George W. Bush’s presidency. Paige died Dec. 9.
“There’s so much history of Black people in Mississippi that is in danger of being lost, so it’s important to keep funding and supporting these institutions to preserve her legacy but also the works associated with it,” Thompson said. 
Stewart, the archivist, said it was important to Walker to provide space for people to “learn how to think and be curious” rather than being told how to think. The importance of preserving archival work at the center helps engage visitors and students in research, scholarship and history. 
“We have to know who we are and where we’re going,” Stewart said. “That’s the importance of history. And archives do that.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/13120146/3X0A4990.jpg,,,2025-12-25 09:56:52.975813

(Hongjie Han/Getty Images)This time of year is when Anna Walker, who directs the Western Firefly Project in New Mexico, gets a few false reports in her inbox.
Well-meaning people, mostly in Albuquerque and other urban areas, see flashes of yellow light dancing through trees and become convinced they’ve seen a firefly. What they actually see is a laser beam that’s part of a high-tech Christmas display.
“They project light up into trees and make the lights kind of move around,” Walker told Source New Mexico. “Those fool a lot of people.”

False reports are one common challenge for the community science initiative chasing the elusive New Mexico firefly. Another is convincing the public that fireflies exist here at all. Christy Bills, an entomologist at the University of Utah, started the Utah Firefly Project 11 years ago, partially in response to the “assumption that we don’t have any” fireflies in the West, she told Source NM. Back then, she and a colleague launched a project with a website that solicited firefly sightings from the public and got a flood of responses. 
“We realized they were everywhere. They’re all over the state, and so we just kept tracking them and getting repeat confirmation about certain populations,” she said. “But the project expanded outside of Utah, because we were getting reports from Idaho and Wyoming and Nevada and Colorado and New Mexico.”
Bills decided to partner with institutions in other states to help verify reports. That’s how she met Walker, an invertebrate species survival specialist at the New Mexico BioPark Society. Walker was eager to join the effort, she said, partially because she didn’t know fireflies existed in Western states, apart from old references in museum collections. 
“That’s what drew me to this firefly journey, was that such a charismatic insect could exist without most people even knowing about it, because they haven’t been studied hardly at all,” she said. “Pretty much every time you go out into the field, there’s like a discovery waiting to be found.”
Fireflies are here if you know where to look, Bills and Walker insist. Since launching in New Mexico in 2021, Walker has confirmed 13 firefly occurrences from more than 100 reports. She’s also collected 27 specimens that she entered into the collection at the Museum of Southwestern Biology at the University of New Mexico. 
According to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, which touts itself as an open access database of “types of life on Earth,” four confirmed sightings of Photinus pyralis, the Common Eastern Firefly, have occurred in New Mexico since 2021. They all occurred between 8 p.m. and midnight in late June or early July in Northeastern New Mexico, specifically in Guadalupe, San Miguel and the border between Mora and Harding counties, according to the database. 
That is just one of at least 13 species of firefly that Walker says exist in New Mexico, though only a four or five are of the flickering, flying variety. Others are glow worms, and others are “dark fireflies” that never bioluminesce but share common ancestry with flashing fireflies, Walker said.

Of the 13 confirmed occurrences, three are “state records,” Walker said, which means she made the first confirmed sighting of a particular species in New Mexico, and they are still investigating whether several of the sightings are of new species.
But even as Walker sets out to confirm sightings and make new discoveries, she fears climate change is drying up the wetlands that nourish fireflies. For example, she got reports of fireflies in Gallinas Creek near Las Vegas but she was unable to find any after the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire occurred there in early 2022.  
“I worry that declines due to drought and forest fires may be responsible for our inability to find these populations,” she said. 
But she said will continue tracking down reports of fireflies, even if she’s initially skeptical, because of what happened right after she joined Bills’ project. 
Back on July 3, 2021, Walker set out to confirm a sighting of the Common Eastern Firefly, her fourth or fifth outing. The species  had never been reliably confirmed in New Mexico since the 1920s. The report came from someone in Mills Canyon, which rises on either side of the Rio Grande north of Roy, New Mexico, far from light pollution and under a wide open starry night.
Hundreds of fireflies greeted her, she said. It’s the biggest population she’s ever seen in New Mexico. 
“I don’t even know how to describe what the feeling was. I think it was just, like, awe, with nature again. You experience it a lot when you’re a kid, and then as you get older you forget that nature can be so awe-inspiring,” she said. “It just felt so magical, really.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/firefliesGettyImages-1437427544-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-12-25 09:12:42.303963

Coastal Carolina University is asking state legislators to set aside $390,000 annually in the state budget to start the Teal Works Program at the Horry County college. And Lander University in Greenwood is asking for $500,000 to add stipends to its existing internship program.

“Teal Works removes financial barriers and equips students with the skills and experiences necessary to thrive in the workforce,” Coastal wrote in its budget request. “The program will strengthen the talent pipeline, support local and regional economic development, and increase CCU’s visibility as a leader in preparing students for South Carolina’s workforce needs.”
Coastal plans to start out with $3,000 stipends for 75 students to cover a 10- to 12-week summer internship. Students who go to work in rural or underserved areas of the state can apply for an additional $1,000, according to the school’s budget ask.
The aid is not a loan. Students don’t pay it back. And it’s on top of what the companies hiring the students as interns might be paying.
By year five, the school hopes to get to 250 students, supported through a combination of state, federal and private funds.
Coastal will focus on placing students in high-demand industries, such as health care, education, information technology, manufacturing, agribusiness and hospitality.
The “Experience Your Education” Program has been operating at Lander for about 15 years, according to the university’s website.
Historically, participating students have received academic credits. Those who earn 120 credit hours can graduate with the Golden EYE Award. But now the school hopes to pay students who participate to help cover travel, meals and other summer living expenses.
“Internships provide invaluable educational experiences for college students, and satisfy course credit,” spokesman Graham Duncan said. “Yet, without financial support, many students often feel that these experiences are out of reach.”
Duncan also touted Lander’s record of students staying in South Carolina to work after graduation — 82% of the school’s alumni call the Palmetto State home.
“At Lander, we take seriously our responsibility to educate today’s students for tomorrow’s workforce,” Duncan said. “We believe this is a sound investment for South Carolina.”
Lander’s proposal did not give a dollar amount for its stipends or specify how many it plans to offer.
At Clemson University, the career center had been helping about 30 students each summer find internships. But in summer 2024, with an influx of state funding, that number jumped to more than 400 students, Neil Burton, the executive director of Clemson’s Center for Career and Professional Development previously told the SC Daily Gazette.
State stipends help nearly 2,100 SC college students land internships

“The challenge for a lot of students is there’s an upfront cost they think they can’t afford,” Britton said. “Paying the upfront deposit on an apartment while you’re buying a suit and trying to figure out how to get a car to go there may seem like minor things for a lot of folks. But for a lot of students, it’s prohibitive.”
USC also offers $3,000 to students who participate in internships within high-demand industries in the state, such as aerospace, automotive, energy, financial services, healthcare, insurance and manufacturing.
More than 1,750 students across the USC college system have participated, according to a statement from the university. The school awarded more than $5.2 million in stipends.
Updated numbers were not immediately available from Clemson. But as of last January, the Upstate school had given out a little less than $2 million to 1,151 students, according to a previous report from the university. 
Until this year, the programs at USC and Clemson were funded with surplus proceeds from the state lottery.
For the state budget that started in July, legislators approved $2 million for USC and $4 million for Clemson from the state tax collections. Those recurring dollars will continue in future budgets indefinitely.
USC is now asking for an additional $2.5 million annually to bring the program back up to previous funding levels.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Co-op-Industry-Expo_051224_SL_0018-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-25 09:12:42.303963

In their approach to higher education, Trump and Newsom shared one thing in common this year: reducing funding for colleges and universities. The federal government pulled back research funds while the state, facing a deficit, imposed austerity measures on the UC and Cal State University systems.


Money is power. If California’s public colleges and universities didn’t already know that, they certainly learned it this year. 
Though the U.S. Department of Justice launched numerous high-profile complaints against California schools — allegations of antisemitism at University of California campuses and concerns about a transgender athlete at San Jose State, to name a few — the most punishing consequences came from federal funding cuts. In its crusade to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs, the Trump administration cut funding for UC campuses, including research into dementia, coronavirus vaccines and HIV prevention.
UCLA bore the brunt of Trump’s ire. The Trump administration withheld over $500 million in UCLA research grants this year because of allegations that the campus wasn’t addressing antisemitism related to protests over the war in Gaza. The administration then demanded that UCLA pay a $1.2 billion settlement and forego certain academic freedoms in order to get the money back. In separate lawsuits, a U.S. district judge ordered the Trump administration to stop withholding funds and later said the proposed settlement was “coercive and retaliatory.”
It’s just one of several court rulings ordering the Trump administration to return research money to UCLA or other UC campuses. 
But the bulk of funding for California’s public colleges and universities comes from the state, not the federal government. After years where the state’s higher education system benefitted from a state surplus or was spared from budget cuts, 2025 proved different. 
Both the UC and the California State University system saw 3% reductions in funding this year, though the community college system emerged largely unscathed. Facing particularly severe cuts, Sonoma State tried to cut majors, such as economics and physics, and to slash its competitive athletic programs, only for a judge to halt many of the cuts. 
Looking ahead
Many of the court rulings issued this year were preliminary injunctions, meaning they’re temporary decisions until a final ruling occurs. That means many of the research grants could once again disappear. 
The Trump administration is also going after students without legal status, who have for decades been able to receive state financial aid and to pay in-state tuition at public universities. A November lawsuit could put an end to those financial aid programs, affecting as many as 100,000 students across the state. 
For the community college system, which educates the majority of students in California, the economy is often a key indicator in enrollment. If tariffs, a bursting tech bubble or other economic headwinds hit the state, students could return to college en masse, just like they did during the 2008 financial crisis.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092225_UC-San-Diego_AH_19.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-25 08:56:21.006924

California schools are likely to face continuing threats of funding cuts and more uncertainty.


Last year was tumultuous for California K-12 schools and their 5.8 million students — at least at the federal level. President Donald Trump slashed funding to schools, set about dismantling the U.S. Department of Education and launched an immigration crackdown that left countless families afraid to send their children to school.
The state pushed back against these moves, successfully fighting the funding cuts in court. But the uncertainty continues as the White House seeks ways to reshape public K-12 education. After-school programs, teacher training and Head Start are among the programs that remain at risk of funding cuts. Congress cut extra funding to rural schools last year, but advocates are hopeful it will return in 2026.
But there were bright spots in 2025. Test scores surged after years of post-pandemic malaise. Reading and math achievement still lags behind pre-COVID-19 levels, but education officials welcomed the improvements after years of investments in tutoring and student wellbeing.
Transitional kindergarten expanded to include all 4-year-olds. Now nearly every district in California offers free, play-based classes for children to learn their A-B-Cs and 1-2-3s and otherwise prepare for the rigors of elementary school. The expansion gives California the largest early education system in the country.
In hopes of boosting reading scores, California also rolled out a mandatory dyslexia screener and passed a law to overhaul literacy instruction. The new curriculum doesn’t go into effect until 2028, but many schools are already implementing and using the dyslexia screener to get extra help to children who struggle with reading disorders.
California also passed a law creating an Office of Civil Rights, intended to eliminate discrimination in K-12 schools, especially antisemitism. The new law, which stems from a surge in antisemitic incidents statewide, is expected to provide more transparency and accountability in how schools handle discrimination complaints.
Looking ahead
Immigration raids, federal funding volatility and culture war issues are expected to continue playing out in K-12 schools next year. The fate of the U.S. Department of Education will also affect schools, especially special education and civil rights. 
California’s budget outlook is murky, as well. Gov. Gavin Newsom has largely spared K-12 schools from funding cuts the past few years, but that may change this year as the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office predicts an $18 billion deficit. 
On the academic front, schools are expecting to see reading and math scores improve as the state rolls out new curricula. Politically, voters will be electing a new State Superintendent of Public Instruction to replace Tony Thurmond, who terms out in 2026 after eight years in the job. A slew of candidates have already jumped in the race, including former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/052125_Paradise-School-Mental-Health_MG_CM_17.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-25 08:56:21.006924

In a year marked by divisive rhetoric across the nation, those stories were among the most read on Utah News Dispatch’s website, along with announcements about homelessness, Sundance and decisions impacting kids. 
As news pushed the Beehive State into the national spotlight, here are some of the issues that rose to the top for Utah News Dispatch readers.

Fatal shooting as thousands march in Salt Lake City
As 10,000 Utahns joined in a nationwide No Kings demonstration protesting President Donald Trump’s policies and administration, shots rang out, sending the crowd fleeing and leaving one man dead.
When the chaos cleared, police said an armed volunteer, identifying himself as a “peacekeeper” for the event, had spotted a man with a rifle and shot at him, wounding him and hitting a bystander as he passed with the marchers. Arthur “Afa” Ah Loo died of his injuries, and the demonstrator with the rifle, who was legally permitted to carry his firearm in the protest, was released from jail without charges after nearly a week.
Months later, prosecutors publicly identified the armed volunteer, 43-year-old Matthew Scott Alder, and charged him with manslaughter, a second-degree felony. He is scheduled to make an initial court appearance Jan. 6.

Charlie Kirk assassinated at Utah Valley University
The first stop of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s “American Comeback Tour” was planned for Utah Valley University, where he would engage with students and the public in his signature “prove me wrong” question-and-answer debate. As he spoke at the campus’ open-air event, he was killed by a single shot that police say was fired by a lone gunman on a roof.
After a nearly three-day manhunt, Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Washington County resident, was arrested after family members and a family friend convinced him to turn himself in, according to police documents. Meanwhile, mourning for Kirk — and political and professional recrimination for those who spoke negatively about him — swept the nation.
Robinson has been charged with aggravated murder, a first-degree felony. Before he was even arrested, Utah officials were pledging to pursue a death penalty in the case, if he is convicted. As court hearings get underway, Robinson’s attorneys are pursuing restrictions on photos and videos of the proceedings.

Homeless services campus site revealed
For months, state officials searched for a site for what they say will be a centralized location for wraparound services for Utahns experiencing homelessness. When the news broke that they had landed on a location, reaction was swift and strong.
The site for the new 1,300-bed shelter is located at 2520 N. 2200 West, Salt Lake City. It’s an open field located directly west of I-215 and roughly a mile south from North Salt Lake’s city boundaries, in Salt Lake City’s Northpointe area. The small agricultural neighborhood lacks public transit and is far-flung from other services located around downtown.
The new homeless campus is envisioned by state homeless leaders to be a place where people experiencing homelessness can go for all of their services, all in one spot. But advocates have decried the strategy as a ploy to warehouse vulnerable Utahns out of sight and force people into mental health or drug treatment (and in an environmentally important zone, to boot). Surrounding neighbors also fear for what it means for their property values and public safety.

Sundance is out, and a flag ban is in
Two hot-button issues became intertwined in Utah this year — the announcement that the Sundance Film Festival will leave its home in Park City after more than 40 years, and legislation by Republican lawmakers banning most flags from classrooms and government buildings, notably LGBTQ+ banners. The Hollywood news site Deadline reported Utah’s flag ban could have tipped the scales out of the state’s favor.
Both developments drew dismay from the state’s Democrat-led capital city, even as Salt Lake City leaders came up with a loophole in the flag ban law. Meanwhile, some Republican legislators were eager to bid “Bye Felicia” to the film festival that they said doesn’t align with the state’s conservative values.
Sundance’s departure from Utah is a blow not just to local filmmakers, but also the state’s economy. In 2024, the Sundance Film Festival generated about $132 million in gross domestic product for Utah, 1,730 local jobs, $69.7 million in Utah wages, and $13.8 million in state and local tax revenue, according to an economic impact report.

Legislation, lawsuits and debates impacting youth
As lawmakers and state leaders prioritized issues impacting youth in 2025, several made the list of Utah News Dispatch’s most-read reports. 
Those included:

News that the company operating some of the most visited pornographic websites in the world, including Pornhub, agreed to pay Utah $5 million over allegations that it didn’t do enough to remove videos depicting rape, child sexual abuse and secret recordings. 
A bill to restrict the allowable age gap between an underage minor and his or her adult spouse, reducing the age difference to four years.
A debate among the Utah State Board of Education over whether schools were complying with a 2024 law restricting diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in all public institutions.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama lawmaker is proposing a bill that would require public high schools that participate in national signing to host signing days for military enlistment and trade schools alongside athletics.
Rep. Chad Robertson, R-Heflin, the sponsor of HB 75, said in a recent interview that he hopes it would help military recruitment and workforce development.
“We just wanted to make it even across the plane that, you know, if the schools are doing the [signing days] for athletes, then we do a signing day for the ones that are going in the military,” he said.

The move would come as branches of the armed forces try to improve overall recruitment While meeting recruiting goals in recent years, U.S. Army recruitment in 2022 missed its recruitment goal of 60,000 by nearly 25%. The U.S. Navy also missed its recruitment goal of 37,700 in 2023 by 20%.
“We just wanted to make it even across the plane that if the schools are doing the ones for athletes, then we do a signing day for the ones that are going in the military,” Robertson said. “It’s more of a signing day, though, for the military than would be for the technical because they actually do sign a contract at that point.” 
Robertson said there are other schools, such as Cleveland High School in Blount County, that have already implemented a system similar to what the bill proposes.
“They kind of just do everybody all at once and it’s kind of an awards day,” he said. “That was brought to my attention in the committee too, when I passed it through the Education Committee in the House that there were schools that were already celebrating this.”
Under the bill, schools would be required to provide “reasonable accommodations” for signing day, including but not limited to a space with seating and internet connectivity.
This is Robertson’s second time filing a bill similar to this. The bill passed unanimously in the House during the 2025 legislative session but failed to make it through the Senate because of time constraints. He said he doesn’t anticipate any pushback from legislators on this bill when they begin meeting Jan. 13.
“I wish I started it a little bit earlier, so that’s why I prefiled it,” Robertson said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Chad-Robertson-April-3-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-25 08:11:47.278784

We elected a new governor, became a battleground in the Trump administration’s push to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, saw a brief strike that shut down NJ Transit trains, and emptied our wallets paying for electricity.
Our photographers were there to capture all of it. Here are their best shots of 2025:

Amanda Brown snapped a gleeful Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill taking a selfie with supporters after she won the governor’s race on Nov. 4, 2025.

Anne-Marie Caruso captured the other side, a mournful Jack Ciattarelli conceding the gubernatorial race to Sherrill.

Hal Brown found Ciattarelli in a much more victorious mood on June 10, when Ciattarelli won the GOP primary for governor.

Anne-Marie Caruso was in Newark on Nov. 19 for an ICE raid and managed to get a photo of a federal agent looking her dead in the eye.

Ed Murray was in Jersey City on Oct. 14 to watch the city’s mayoral candidates debate, and he found former Gov. Jim McGreevey preparing in a sea of empty chairs. McGreevey went on to lose the race by a wide margin, ending his bid for political resurrection.

There were a lot of serious speeches at the Oct. 18 “No Kings” protests — and a lot of silliness, evident in this photo from Princeton by Mary Iuvone.

Gov. Phil Murphy spent a lot of 2025 awarding pardons and commuting prison sentences, and Dana DiFilippo on Nov. 10 captured this shot of Jamal Muhammad thanking Murphy for commuting his sentence.

Hal Brown found two guys just sharing a laugh in Camden on Jan. 28 — except here it’s Murphy and South Jersey power broker George Norcross, who at the time was still facing an indictment brought by Murphy’s attorney general (the indictment was tossed by a judge one month later).

Dana DiFilippo caught a lot of Trenton pols with her camera this year, including this one of powerful Bergen County Democrat Sen. Paul Sarlo on June 30, the day the Legislature passed the state budget.

Dana also snapped this one of harm reduction advocates staging a die-in at the Statehouse on June 30, after lawmakers opted to divert $45 million in national opioid funds to four of the state’s largest hospitals.

Reena Rose Sibayan snapped a classic “welp, I lost” photo of Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop on June 10 moments after he learned he would not win the Dem nomination for governor.

Amanda Brown captured a much happier Sherrill with Lt. Gov.-elect Dale Caldwell on election night.

Here’s a frame-worthy shot of a New Jersey institution, the Arlington Diner, from Anne-Marie Caruso.

Dana DiFilippo captured a tender moment between LaShawn Fitch and his mother, Barbara Robinson, after Fitch was released from South Woods State Prison on Dec. 4. Murphy commuted Fitch’s prison sentence after 17 years behind bars.

Anne-Marie Caruso snapped some tense moments at a Dec. 1 legislative hearing at the Statehouse where state Sen. James Beach, right, sparred with U.S. Sen Andy Kim over a bill to water down the powers of the state comptroller.

Dana DiFilippo went to “Not My Presidents Day” on Feb. 17, a protest against President Donald Trump’s new administration that attracted hundreds to rally in Trenton, including this very vocal woman.

Regional and statewide partners are making progress in developing the tools and know-how to respond to our collective flood risk. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Michael Gaughan and Katy Hansen: Vermont needs to get on the road to risk reduction.","This commentary is by Michael Gaughan, the executive director of the Vermont Bond Bank, and Katy Hansen, the director of the Rural and Small Cities Program at the Public Finance Initiative.



Vermont municipalities face a stark reality. The federal support that communities have relied on after disasters may be dramatically reduced in future years. The public will soon see the FEMA Review Council report, which is expected to recommend shifting more disaster response costs to states while also raising the dollar threshold for what qualifies as a federal disaster. Vermont is already confronting this reality with the recent denial of the July 2025 disaster declaration and the related on-again off-again funding for core infrastructure resilience programs.
For a state that has experienced over $240 million in FEMA related municipal damages from flooding in the past three years, the potential reduction in federal support threatens the fiscal and physical structures that undergird our communities. This is a staggering number, representing more than 30% of the Vermont Bond Bank’s current municipal loans, which obscures the threat to individual towns where disaster costs can be overwhelming. Take, for instance, towns such as Lyndon, where an estimated $18 million in damages occurred in 2024, roughly six times the town’s highway budget.

But this moment of uncertainty is an opportunity for Vermont to take matters into its own hands. Recently, the Bond Bank was selected to participate in the Public Finance Initiative’s Rural and Small Cities program, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, to receive capacity building and educational support to develop clear guidance alongside our loan programs for communities to reduce the risks caused by extreme weather to their infrastructure. This builds on the Bond Bank’s decades of experience lending to local government and addressing challenges of infrastructure planning and finance. Our team of experts organized stakeholders from across the state to discuss how to spur action while coordinating resources. 
As others have noted and the FEMA report is anticipated to make clear, we must take responsibility ourselves and change practices to save Vermont from the inevitable. Thankfully, regional and statewide partners are making progress in developing the tools and know-how to respond to our collective flood risk. 
The convening helped the Bond Bank to highlight the largest potential contributor to post-disaster fiscal stress for our municipalities — our municipal roads. This network connects us to families, jobs, schools, grocery stores and hospitals, and is where more than 80% of municipal flood damage has occurred over the last 20 years. 
The Bond Bank’s goal is to use its understanding of public finance best practices and the helpful tools from partners like the Vermont League of Cities and Towns (VLCT) to drive the development of more capital plans and financial benchmarks that incorporate technical analyses from regional and state partners. Simple at its face, the effort is interdisciplinary and complex in practice. The convening was important to help the Bond Bank develop guidance and spur implementation. The Bond Bank aims to coordinate low-cost financing sources and expand the Municipal Climate Recovery Fund (MCRF) to help communities when disaster strikes. The intent is to turn the recovery cycle on its head: align existing resources to reduce risk before disasters strike and plan for more post-disaster relief.
The MCRF, established in partnership with the State and Treasurer’s Office, has already demonstrated its value. Since launching after the July 2023 floods, it has provided $33 million in loans at just 1.3% interest to 27 Vermont towns, offering seven-year terms with two years interest-only to give communities breathing room as they await potential federal reimbursement. This isn’t flashy, but the point is its practical value. For example, Lyndon received $4 million in MCRF loans that gave them space to deal with critical, immediate needs and time to sort through what the federal government would support.
With engagement from the partners at the convening, an expanded MCRF program, when combined with the capacity of our Vermont banks, would help address our vulnerable road infrastructure by aligning incentives for communities to plan, design and invest in improvements, and if disaster strikes, ensuring that communities can access resources through loans and adaptation grants to build back in the right way. 
This approach demands a shift in thinking. It means partners like the Bond Bank need to do everything we can to reduce costs for borrowers while also giving direction on how to take the first step in the financial trade-offs of implementing resilience projects. While this is hard work, it’s also empowering. Instead of waiting for federal aid that might never come, Vermont communities can reduce risk before disasters strike and build resilience on their own.

The federal raid on Lake Street, the first of many clashes with the growing presence of the feds, was chaotic. Dozens of agents, armored vehicles, a kaleidoscopic array of agencies, and hundreds of protestors all packed into the blocks surrounding Las Cuatro Milpas under a constant rain.
It was impossible to tell from the ground why the agents were there, because so many agencies were involved and none would answer questions. I was grateful to the puppeteers of the Heart of the Beast, who let us file our story and photos in the shelter of the theater, soaked through and covered in pepper spray.

On Saturday morning, while preparing to cover a No Kings day of protest, we heard the news that Melissa and Mark Hortman had been assassinated overnight. I didn’t believe it at first, until the rest of our newsroom confirmed it. Vance Boelter, the alleged assassin, was still on the loose, with No Kings signs photographed in his car.
The State Patrol advised people not to come. Thousands of people still showed up to protest, some with quickly-made signs honoring Hortman.

The march was suffused with anxiety to the point of paranoia. I saw demonstrators constantly checking their phones and trading information about the ongoing manhunt. Boelter had disguised himself as law enforcement, officials said. People kept coming up to me and other photographers, asking us to use our long lenses to check the legitimacy of law enforcement badges or to get a closer look at men with face coverings.

I was especially struck by the tribute Red Lake Drum Group gave to the Hortmans’ memory. Hundreds of people gathered tearfully on the State Capitol lawn as the sun set, candles flickering under the massive elm tree that Melissa Hortman adored.

Even through the mile of atmosphere between us and the heat warping from passing jets, we could see the glint of shackles around their wrists, waists and ankles. Madison interviewed one of the men who was deported through MSP, who said that agents refused to say where they were being taken.

I was at Karmel Mall, a shopping center filled with Somali-owned businesses in south Minneapolis. I was searching for a cafe owner who freelancer Atra Mohamed had interviewed for a story about the downturn in foot traffic in the mall as people stayed away out of fear of ICE.
As I wandered the mall, multiple times business owners came out of their stalls, noticing my camera and my white face, and asked, “Are they here?” No introduction, no need to describe what they were referencing, just “Are they here?” Each time, I replied, “I’m sorry, I don’t know.”
But they were. Minutes after I left, agents detained several people, in one case smashing a car window to drag a person out. Here, you can see the broken glass sprayed over an unopened Taco Bell order.
Throughout what turned out to be a punishing year of violence, tragedy and chaos, the resistance movement remained strong. I would like for that to be my takeaway, but the year is ending on a raw note.
As I took an Uber to the airport to visit my family for Christmas, driving out of my neighborhood that’s now consistently filled with agents, the Somali driver told me about how for the first time in over a decade in America, he carries his passport all the time.
As we drove past the very spot where I’d watched shackled people marched onto a deportation plane in November, the driver said, “Pray for us, sister.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250603_0340-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-25 07:11:42.986944

(Getty Images)Your four-person Indiana Capital Chronicle team brought you a whopping 600 original stories during a busy year that featured a lively Statehouse and our first-ever staffing change.
We delivered play-by-plays of major legislative issues, from a mapping miss to budgetary brawls. We monitored top elected officials — misconduct included — and critical social services.
Before this year’s chapter in our story comes to a close, revisit your favorite and most important articles with us.
1. Map push dies
The Indiana Senate this month defied the wishes of President Donald Trump — despite a protracted national pressure campaign — when lawmakers there rejected a mid-census redraw of the state’s congressional maps.
The proposed maps were explicitly designed to bolster the GOP’s hold on the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm elections.
Trump kicked off the redistricting arms race in July, when he directed Texas to create five more GOP seats.
We began tracking the initiative: Vice President JD Vance’s visits to Indianapolis, Hoosier Republicans’ travel to the U.S. Capitol, closed-door caucuses and more.

The team logged gradual changes in Indiana Gov. Mike Braun’s stance as his wait-and-see approach shifted toward a special session dedicated to the redistricting effort.
And we covered lawmakers’ will-they-or-won’t-they decision on reconvening, which culminated in an early start to the 2026 session. The whole team — including new Deputy Editor Tom Davies — pitched in to analyze the proposed maps, man lengthy public hearings and probably irritate reticent lawmakers in our efforts to bring you the latest.
The Senate’s 31-19 defeat of the maps means the idea can’t be reconsidered until the 2027 session. Now, we’re following the short– and long-term political fallout.
2. Sheriff scrutiny
ICC’s mission, to fill in gaps in state-level coverage, sometimes takes us beyond the Government Center campus in Indianapolis.
Senior Reporter Casey Smith tackled the complicated story of a state investigation into a county sheriff’s alleged wrongdoing, finding that the only person disciplined was the detective who pursued the case.

And she followed up, reporting that a state law enforcement board is considering whether Dubois County Sheriff Tom Kleinhelter — who is accused of mishandling jail commissary funds and more — should be stripped of his police credentials.
Smith also kept tabs on a series she began last year on wrongdoing by former Clark County Sheriff Jamey Noel, which prompted greater state oversight of jail commissary funds.
She catalogued the court-sanctioned sales of Noel’s misbegotten property — complete with pictures of his auctioned luxury cars and self-branded merchandise — as the disgraced man begins making good on restitution orders.
3. Economic development sunlight
Just before she went back east, landing at a sister outlet in Pennsylvania, former ICC Senior Reporter Whitney Downard wrapped up a contentious chapter for the state’s embattled economic development authority.
Over the spring, Braun’s administration launched a forensic analysis into spending by the Indiana Economic Development Corp. and its relationship with several partners. Downard broke down the substantial report, released in the fall, and reaction to it.
The results prompted a spate of accountability-oriented changes. IEDC’s board has revamped its conflict-of-interest policies, with screened members exiting the room for certain projects, and investment policies. Only the full board makes binding votes now. And the quasi-public agency’s nonprofit arm is going to “wind down,” officials have said, although that hasn’t been completed.
Braun wants to move on from damage control. IEDC is revving up a renewed focus on regional development.
4. Indiana governor’s first year
It was a tumultuous first year in office for Braun, who was inaugurated mid-January — after the General Assembly reconvened for legislative business.
Amid slower revenue growth, he led the push to slash state spending, signing the state’s latest biennial budget into law in April.
But he spent much of his political capital on a property tax relief plan that lawmakers weakened and subsumed into a behemoth local government finance law. Revisions are expected this session.
Despite mixed results on his property tax agenda and defeat on redistricting, Braun said year one still featured plenty of wins, during a sit-down interview with Reporter Leslie Bonilla Muñiz.

He highlighted the remake of IEDC and the commission that regulates utility services; the cuts to agency spending and a leadership reorganization; and boosts to education and public safety.
5. Your mileage may vary
Braun’s ascension to the Governor’s Residence in Indianapolis also sparked scrutiny on upgrades made to his family home in southwestern Indiana, and frequent travel between the two.
Downard broke the news of the state’s plans to spend at least $118,000 on security improvements to the house in Jasper. The work included a gravel helipad, fencing, gates and a trailer for a round-the-clock security detail staffed by Indiana State Police.

Braun is the first governor in recent decades to reside outside of central Indiana while in office. Former Govs. Eric Holcomb and Mike Pence made the Indianapolis estate their primary residence, while former Gov. Mitch Daniels split his time between that building and his home in Carmel.
Jasper and Indianapolis are located more than two hours apart by car — or, just 45 minutes by helicopter.
Downard also reported Braun took 11 helicopter rides to and from his Jasper home over about six months, costing almost $24,000. The state said that it would have incurred those costs regardless, because Indiana State Police pilots needed the flight hours to satisfy federal license maintenance requirements.
6. License plates boost budgets
That metal plate fastened to your vehicle can bring in big bucks for nonprofit groups and the state.
Bonilla Muñiz found Hoosiers pumped almost $200 million into charitable causes over two decades — just by buying and renewing special group recognition license plates.
But recently toughened sales and signature requirements may force organizations out of the program and block prospective participants from joining.
Seen those all-black plates on the road? Smith got a preview of the “blackout” designs, which have already generated millions of dollars for the state.
7. Former administration leader disciplined
Smith has also been on top of wrongdoing by one-time Public Safety Secretary Jennifer-Ruth Green, who resigned in September, repeatedly breaking news along the way.
The Indiana State Ethics Commission this month approved a settlement featuring a $10,000 civil fine for Green, finding she violated political activity and misuse of state property rules.
That approval closed the ethics case against Green, but potential criminal charges remain under review by the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office, Smith reported.
Smith and ICC Editor Niki Kelly were the first to report on a remediation document revealing Green was the subject of a state inspector general probe prior to her abrupt departure.
She’s still running for Congress again, though. Her campaign has called the investigation a “politically motivated sham.”
8. Social service cuts
The spending cuts undertaken after the lackluster springtime revenue forecast are hitting social services for impoverished Hoosiers, ICC reporting shows.
Indiana enrollment in Medicaid, the low-income health care program, has dropped by about 300,000 people throughout the year, totaling 1.7 million in November, according to the latest forecast, delivered this month. The dip comes as officials continue aggressive post-pandemic eligibility checks.
Lawmakers have also approved cost-controlling work mandates for the Healthy Indiana Plan, a Medicaid-expansion health insurance program for 700,000 low- to moderate-income Hoosiers. But it won’t take effect until 2027, when a federal law imposes such requirements on expansion enrollees nationwide.

And there are big changes coming for providers serving the 8,000 children who receive autism therapy through Medicaid. The state plans to reduce its hourly rate 10% and is considering other cost-cutting strategies for the fast-growing program.
Families who need help paying for child care have also struggled, as a state freeze on vouchers enters its second year. It’s creating enrollment crunches for providers, also hard-hit by the state’s significantly lower reimbursement rates.
Indiana additionally opted out of a summer meal program for hungry low-income schoolchildren. Downard broke that story, then followed up, reporting that a key agency and Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith blamed the miss on poor planning by Holcomb’s outgoing administration.
9. Educational changes
Indiana schools saw mixed results this year.
Third-graders produced a historic jump in reading scores, but about 3,000 were held back for not meeting literacy proficiency standards.
Fewer students are missing large chunks of school, but chronic absenteeism rates still remain well above pre-pandemic levels. Smith, ICC’s education guru, broke down what a recent absenteeism law does.
Indiana has asked the U.S. Department of Education for permission to combine funding from 15-plus federal programs into one block grant, overhauling how the state spends and tracks billions in education aid.
Public higher educational institutions, meanwhile, reported enrollment gains but a lower college-going rate. They also axed or restructured hundreds of degree programs under a recent state law, and recorded millions of dollars in canceled federal research grants.
10. Two more executions
Indiana ended its 15-year execution pause last year after securing a new lethal drug. This year, the state put two more men to death.
Roy Lee Ward was executed in October for the 2001 rape and murder of teenager Stacy Payne. Benjamin Ritchie was executed in May, nearly 25 years after he killed Beech Grove law enforcement officer William Toney.
Details on both were sparse; no reporters were permitted to witness.
Death Penalty Action, a nonprofit that advocates against executions, encouraged protestors to ring the “Delaware Bell” as a sign of their opposition to the death penalty while gathered outside the Indiana State Prison on Monday, May 19, 2025, in Michigan City — ahead of the execution of Benjamin Ritchie. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Braun confirmed over the summer that Indiana spent more than $1 million on execution drugs. Three doses were purchased for $900,000 under Holcomb’s administration. Only one was utilized; the other two doses expired without use. Braun’s administration spent $275,000 on a fourth dose, used for Ritchie’s execution.
But his office has refused to disclose exactly how much the state paid for the latest three sets of lethal injection drugs purchased by the Department of Correction in recent months. At least one of those doses was expected to be used for Ward’s execution. The remaining sets expired at the end of October, according to court documents.
Five men remain on Indiana’s death row, but only four are currently considered competent for execution. No new inmates have been added since 2013, and capital prosecutions remain rare and costly.
Smith reports lawmakers are exploring other execution methods in new legislation. Braun told ICC he’ll “look at” whatever “comes up,” but said such measures “don’t rise to the level of” kitchen-table issues.

Charles Dickens MuseumLucy Whitehead, Royal Holloway, University of London

A Christmas Carol is usually read as a Victorian morality tale about capitalism and compassion. Yet an autographed script written by Charles Dickens during the American Civil War raises the possibility he may also have understood the story as speaking to the cause of ending slavery in the US.
First published in the UK on December 19 1843, the novella is famous for its advocacy of a reformed relationship between the Victorian capitalist Scrooge and the workers whose labour he profits from, epitomised by his downtrodden clerk, Bob Cratchit. The story has inspired countless adaptations in theatre, television and film.
However, a slip of blue paper held in Harvard’s Houghton Library shows how Dickens may have also seen the story through the lens of American slavery. As my current research in the library’s collections shows, on March 7 1864, Dickens wrote out and autographed A Christmas Carol’s most famous line so that it could be sold in aid of the anti-slavery side in the ongoing American civil war (1861–65).
The closing sentence – “And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God Bless Us, Every One!” – is usually associated with Victorian families united in the Christmas snow. However, Dickens’ contribution to a set of celebrity autographs being collected for sale at the 1864 New York Metropolitan Fair enlisted his novella in the cause of supporting the Union army’s goal of ending slavery in the US.
The New York fair was one of several events held across the Union states to raise funds for the US Sanitary Commission, a philanthropic organisation which promoted the health, welfare and convalescence of Union soldiers. We don’t know how much the autograph collection to which Dickens contributed ultimately sold for. But records show the collection, gathered by the wife of the US ambassador to Britain, Abigail Brooks Adams, was valued at US$1,000 – approximately US$20,000 (£14,500) in today’s money.
Dickens had been an international celebrity since the 1830s, and was well accustomed to requests for autographs. In 19th-century terms, this often meant a copied-out passage from one of his novels as well as a signature.
What survives of these autographs, written for fans in Britain and America, suggests that the passage he typically used was the death of Little Nell in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841). His unusual choice of the final line from A Christmas Carol therefore seems deliberate for this specific context.
In my ongoing research, I theorise this choice may have been designed to remind people that the message of A Christmas Carol also applied to enslaved black people in the US and show his support for them.
While there are no direct references to slavery in A Christmas Carol, there are good reasons to think it was on Dickens’s mind at the time he was writing the novella.
The two works he was publishing immediately before it – the travel book American Notes (1842) and serialised novel Martin Chuzzlewit (1843–44) – both make vivid reference to the inhumanities of slavery. They had been inspired by the five-month tour that Dickens made of the US in 1842.
There is a long cultural history of ghosts in chains like the ones that weigh down Scrooge’s partner, Jacob Marley, in A Christmas Carol. But at the time Dickens was writing it, he also had a more immediate reference point for the image of people burdened by irons.
In American Notes’s chapter on slavery, he quotes from multiple American newspaper descriptions of escaped enslaved people loaded with iron rings, chains and weights – including a 12-year-old boy with a “chain dog-collar around his neck”.
In A Christmas Carol, Marley attributes his chain, made of “cash-boxes … ledgers … and heavy purses”, to his heartless pursuit of business profit in life. Marley warns Scrooge that he too is a “captive, bound and double-ironed”, suggesting that exploitation for money will ultimately fetter the exploiter as well as the exploited.
Two recent adaptations of A Christmas Carol have suggested that Scrooge and Marley’s business is at least partly built on the trade in enslaved people. Jon Clinch’s 2019 novel Marley makes the link direct, while Steven Knight’s television series of the same year implies it.
For example, Stephen Graham’s Marley tells Guy Pearce’s Scrooge: “Look at these chains Ebenezer … Each link is a man or woman or child who died in our workshops”, mentioning locations not only in “London, Birmingham, Manchester”, but also “Batavia … Mauritius, the Bay of Honduras”. Slavery was present in the last three locations until at least the 1830s.
While Dickens opposed slavery, he was far from immune to racism. Notoriously, his support for the brutal British colonial response to an uprising of Jamaican plantation workers in 1865 contrasted with his career-long advocacy against the deprivations of the British working classes.
In Zadie Smith’s historical novel The Fraud (2023), the character of Dickens suggests that Brits should be turning their attention from the compensation given by the British government to slave owners in the British Empire to problems closer to home. Such a portrayal is supported by Dickens’s mockery of Mrs Jellyby in Bleak House (1853) for her “telescopic philanthropy”, which centres on Africans in the fictional “Borrioboola-Gha” rather than the people in her immediate vicinity.
If Dickens did intend to use the final line of A Christmas Carol to support the anti-slavery cause in the American Civil War, this would allow us to rethink how he may have seen the relationship between exploitation and inhumanity at home and abroad. It suggests that, in at least some circumstances, he was able to see these causes in connection rather than competition.

Luke Karg, of House Springs, had one last shot before graduating to win the Missouri TBF High School Trail Super Tournament for bass fishing – which he and his then 16-year-old fishing partner, A.J. Massa, had won the year before.
It’s the last tournament of the season for the Missouri student program of The Bass Federation, and it’s also the final opportunity to earn enough points to be named Team of the Year — the top-scoring duo in the state.
“The tournament itself meant a lot to us, with it being our last state tournament together,” Karg said. “It was very tough. There was, at most, two inches of visibility in the water, but a lot of fishing is just adapting to the changes.”
Karg and Massa headed out on the water for two days for eight hours each. At the end of each day, they weighed their top five fish. 
“The first day, they caught almost enough bass to win the tournament,” said Gary Foree, Karg’s mentor and family friend, who is a former professional fisherman. “They had almost 19 pounds, which is insane. There hasn’t been a tournament in three years over 17 pounds on Truman Lake.”
They brought in 16 pounds on the second day, which would have brought their total up to nearly 35 pounds. But unfortunately it didn’t count. Their boat malfunctioned, making them miss the weigh in.  
“It was pretty heart-wrenching,” Karg said. “It was one of our best bags as a team on one of the most difficult days.”
But it wasn’t all lost. 
Karg and Massa ended up taking second place at Truman Lake with one day’s worth of fish, and they still had enough points to be named Team of the Year, just as they were last year.
Karg has been part of the Team of the Year five years in a row, including as an incoming high-school freshman. 
That title also sent the team to the TBF Student Angler Federation High School National Championship, which was held at Oklahoma’s Grand Lake O’ the Cherokees in June. 
Only the top two high-school teams from each state can compete, and Karg is the only person in Missouri to have qualified for that opportunity five years in a row, according to officials for the national championship.
“To be one of the top two teams in Missouri for five consecutive years is pretty freaking amazing,” said Karl Buck, who previously led the federation’s high school program in Missouri and was also Karg’s team leader. “I’m just so proud it’s unbelievable. I mean, I can’t believe that I was involved in his upcoming as a fisherman.”
Karg began competitive fishing when he was 12 and participated in dozens of individual and team tournaments as a teen. Through it all, he struggled with an autoimmune illness that made him miss numerous days from school, he said, but he’s proud he still managed to graduate on time in May and continue fishing.
While it was grueling standing on a boat for hours under the hot sun, Karg said the national championship was exhilarating because some of the world’s top fishermen were watching. 
“It’s the biggest tourn of the year, and a lot of people only get to go to it once, if even,” Karg said. “It really could be the biggest tournament of your life.”
 A promise

Karg has loved to fish ever since he could hold a rod, said his father Rick Karg. Even as early as 5, he said Karg could catch fish when the adults around him were coming up empty. 
“There’s a magic,” Rick said. “My scientific brain says, ‘Is there like a vibration from his heartbeat that travels down the line because he’s got his finger touching it, that the fish like?’” 
Foree met Karg because of a life-changing promise he made to Karg’s mother, Becky Rumley.
Rumley was the nurse administering Foree’s chemotherapy treatment at St. Claire Hospital, and one day, she told him how much her nine-year-old son loved to fish. At the time, Foree thought he only had a few months to live.
“I ended up telling her that if I survive this, I’ll take him to Lake of the Ozarks and get him a five pounder because I used to be a [fishing] guide on the lake,” he said.
Luke Karg stands with a paddlefish he caught in Owensville (Photo submitted).
Foree did pull through, and when they went out fishing, Karg didn’t just catch one five-pound bass. 
“I caught three five-pound bass and two six pounders, and like a bunch of big fish,” Karg said. “It is probably the best day of fishing in my life. And ever since then, he’s just dedicated a huge part of his life to help teach me and my partner.”
Foree was equally amazed after Karg pulled out nearly 40 pounds of fish that day. 
“He just had the best day of fishing anybody could have,” Foree said. “That’s how I got him hooked on fishing.”  
Over the years, Foree taught him about tracking fish through the different seasons and how to read the water and the banks. He also helped him get his first boat.
Now, Foree said, Karg’s instincts are his fishing superpower. 
“So many times they won a tournament when the fishing was really tough, and Luke said, ‘Let’s try over here. That bank looks good,’” Foree said. “And they’ll go over, and they’ll catch enough fish on that bank to win the tournament.”
Karg believes his instincts have developed with the dozens of tournaments and countless hours of fishing. 
“Over time, it’s become more of an instinct, than having to think about, ‘Oh, I should make a change,’” he said. “It just naturally comes.”
For instance, at both the Truman Lake and national championship, Karg said he was painting his own custom lures while he was on the boat.
At Truman, he made the decision to color a half-inch chartreuse line on his spinner bait, he said, and he ended up catching much bigger fish, but less fish. If his lure had a straight tail, the catch was better as well, he said.
“It’s all about how the bait works in the water,” he said. “The smallest little detail that can just trigger the fish to eat. That’s where a lot of the fun comes into it for me, is all the difficulties and fun little changes you can make. You can go from catching no fish for hours on end to catching your limit in a minute.”
 ‘Find five’

Karl Buck remembers meeting Karg when he was about 12 on a dock at the Peaceful Valley Lake in Owensville, where Karg’s grandparents have a lake house. Buck used to run a student program called the Owensville Anglers, and they were finishing up a tournament that day.
“When we were doing our weigh-in down at the dam, they came down to the boat ramp to inquire,” Buck said. “He’ll probably hate this, but he was the most bashful young man, super quiet and reserved.” 
The Owensville Anglers is how Karg got his start with tournament fishing, which Buck says is much different than regular fishing. 
In a tournament, Buck said the first rule is “find five.” 
“You’re fishing for five fish,” Buck said. “Doesn’t matter what they weigh, they just got to be keepers,” meaning they are big enough to keep.
Luke Karg, left, and A.J. Massa hold up their top three fish at the TBF Student Angler Federation High School National Championship, which was held at Oklahoma’s Grand Lake O’ the Cherokees in June (photo submitted).
The fish go in the box where they’re kept alive and healthy, which is a standard conservation practice in the high-school tournaments. 
“After you have five, then you’re going to change your game,” he said. “It’s now no longer about just catching fish. You’re looking to upgrade the fish that you already have. Big fish get big for a reason. They’re hard to catch.”
Big fish know how to hide, and that’s where casting skills come into play, Foree said. He called Karg’s casting skills “insane.” 
“He can skip jigs and lures and put them in places nobody else can,” Foree said. “That’s why he’s so good.”
But he wasn’t always that good, Buck remembers, which is why Karg earned the nickname “Oops” after fishing with Buck and his son one day.
“Luke throws this cast — I believe it was a spinner bait — and it winds up on the roof of this dock, stuck,” Buck said. “So we go up and we get it. A little while later, he makes another cast and it gets stuck on somebody’s dock.”
After each time, Karg would just say, “Oops” and the nickname was born. Buck said when they fished together this past summer, he was blown away at his talent. 
Karg and Massa ended up placing 56th out of more than 200 teams in the national championship in Oklahoma. 
“We lost three three-pounders that came off the boat,” Karg said after the tournament finished. “That would have gotten us up to nine or 10 pounds. We would have been around 12th place probably.”
Karg said he’s proud of his accomplishment over this high school career, and he couldn’t have done it without his fishing partners Massa and previously Kyle Kannawurf, along with their boat captains.
“No one gives credit enough to our boat captains, which were both of our dads,” he said, “just giving the time to drive all the way out there and standing with us out the boat for eight hours straight a day.”
As boat captain, Rick said he was in “constant amazement” at his son’s skill.
“I’d just sit there and watch and think, ‘How in the world are you doing this?’” Rick said. “You’re like a super sharp shooter.”
Rick said he’s watched Karg fish for seven hours without catching anything, but he’d still have the focus and creativity change his strategy and get a big catch at the last minute. Karg’s humility and attitude are among the most impressive things about him, said Foree and Buck, particularly his ability to bounce back from setbacks. 
“He never got rattled,” Foree said. “Oh, he’d get upset if he lost a big fish, but he’d just say, ‘Okay, I learned something from that,’ and go on to the next one. His ability to focus and stay focused in times of turmoil when he loses fish or the weather changes is very, very important in professional bass fishing.”
Karg has his own boat detail business, and there are several career paths he’s interested in taking, including a professional fisherman. 
“But for that, I would have to be away from home around 200 days of the year,” he said. “So the one I’m probably gonna go with is a natural environmentalist studying fresh water fish.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Luke-Karg-and-Gary-Foree1-scaled-e1766100704252-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-12-25 07:11:42.986944

A telecom company based in Springfield has donated $5,000 among 10 rural food pantries in Vermont this month.
“Supporting local food pantries has long been important to us,” said Andrea Spaans, marketing manager and wireless supervisor at the Vermont Telephone Company and VTel Wireless, via email. “This December, we wanted to do more and make sure our support reached as many local pantries as possible.”
The small, family-owned company operating since 1890, provides internet, phone and television services across 14 rural villages in Vermont, according to its website. While it has contributed to local food pantries since the 2010s, it increased its seasonal donation this year to spread the joy across some of the communities it serves, Spaans said.
The Grafton Community Church, which runs the local food pantry, is a first-time recipient.
“VTel’s effort is amazing. So unexpected,” Mary Howard Hall, outreach coordinator who received a $500 check earlier this month, said in an email. “Their donation will go toward feeding our neighbors.”
Christmas is a busy time for the church and food pantry, which is open 8:30 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday, and 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Sunday. Additional hours are available if needed.
“Some people have keys to let themselves in to get food when we are closed,” she said. “Isn’t that wonderful? We have never turned anyone away.”
When the Grafton Inn across the street closed its kitchen at the start of the pandemic in 2020, they called the church. 
“I took all their food, which was a lot, and it disappeared in two hours,” Hall said.
That’s how the pantry at the chapel began, and they have kept it going since. It now offers shelf-stable foods, sometimes eggs, cheese and meats, and produce from the Vermont Foodbank, which they partner with.
Separate from the church budget, the pantry runs on donations of both food and money and costs about $10,000 to $13,000 per year, according to Hall. The town of Grafton donates $1,000 each year, and they apply for grants. With rising prices, it’s a lot for a small rural church – but also a priority.
“Each year, of course, we spend more money, as prices continue to rise,” she said. So they were happy to receive an unexpected check.
They work with local farmers and growers, as well as with Grafton Cares, a community effort that provides two lunches and two dinners a month at the chapel building at 4 Main St. They also offer rides to medical appointments and help coordinate Meals on Wheels deliveries, Hall said.
VTel’s holiday donation this year includes the Black River Good Neighbor Services in Ludlow, Chester-Andover Family Center, Danby Town Office Food Bank, Hartland Community Food Shelf, Our Place Community Food Center in Rockingham, Pawlet Community Church Food Pantry, Springfield Family Center, Wallingford Town Hall Food Cupboard and Woodstock Community Food Shelf, according to the release.
“Local food pantries are often volunteer-led and deeply rooted in the communities we serve,” Spaans said in an email. “Supporting them is a tangible way for us to back the people and organizations doing that day-to-day work and help ensure they have the resources they need.”
The donation follows VTel’s annual tradition of serving a free Thanksgiving dinner for VTel customers over 65. This year, it served more than 800 meals at Black Rock Steakhouse in Springfield and The Barn Restaurant in Pawlet, according to a VTel press release.
The company will continue to give back locally through its Round Up for Change program, which allows customers to voluntarily round up their monthly bill to the nearest dollar. The proceeds, which vary yearly, are donated to a selected organization at the end of the year.  The 2026 recipient is Meals and Wheels of Greater Springfield, a volunteer-driven organization that delivers approximately 500 meals each week to residents who are unable to shop or cook for themselves, Spaans said. It also provides wellness checks and social connection.

(Photo by searagen/Getty Images)It’s Christmas time, and you’ve got the entire holiday package wrapped up in a big, red bow:

Glittering tree
Twinkling lights
Jingling bells
Festive wreaths
Dashing reindeer
Cheerful snowmen
Angelic tree-topper

All these iconic images combine to transport us to the holiday destination of our dreams. However, Santa’s reindeer-guided sleigh may be losing its luster. Today, an old red pickup truck is making inroads into Americans’ traditional mode of holiday transport: Picture a vintage red pickup truck emerging from the snowy evergreen woods with a freshly cut pine tree loaded into the truck bed, or fastened on top of the roof.
This commercially popular image is plastered on tree ornaments, hand towels, greeting cards, gift wrap, coffee cups, and more. You can buy miniature vintage red pickups, too. Or you can make your own from two small wooden crates, LED stick-on lights, hot glue, and of course, a coat of bright red paint.
Have you ever wondered how — and why — the image of this classic red pickup has become synonymous with Christmas? What’s the connection?
Rooted in history
This ubiquitous pickup, with pronounced fenders, running boards, and dual round headlights, was common in the post-war era through the early 1950s. Some identify it as a 1935 Ford Model 50, or a 1939 Chevrolet Half-Ton, or possibly a 1949 Dodge B1-C-116 or 1946 Dodge WC.
During that era, pickup trucks were owned by rural Americans, farmers, veterinarians, and trades folks. No one called them “essential workers.” Their trucks were tools of their trade, used hard, repaired often, but trusted to get the job done over the long haul.
Today, 47% of Americans, including urban folks from all walks of life, own and drive pickups. A quick survey of big box parking lots and urban freeways reveals rows of pickups. Many of the over-muscled models, think Dodge Ram 3500, are considered status symbols. However, their truck beds often are empty.
In 2021, three-fourths of Christmas trees in American homes were artificial. The red pickup with a pine tree loaded in the truck bed harkens back to the days when families brought home freshly cut Christmas trees. My kids loved climbing into our old pickup to head to Ho Ho Holt’s Christmas Tree Farm near Stratford, where they hitched a ride on a tractor-drawn hayrack to the back 40 to choose a tree. When the Holts closed their business, we made the trek to Deal’s Orchard near Jefferson, where their on-farm store offers all kinds of goodies, from Deal’s fresh apple cider, apples, candies, holiday decor, and more recently its own hard cider. “Fill your life with experiences, not things. Have stories to tell, not stuff to show.” –is the quote posted on its website.
When the original pickup truck rolled off the factory floor, most Americans lived in small towns or on farms. In 1940, 18% of Americans farmed. Only 25% had phones, and 33% had electricity. Many Americans shopped in hometown stores, or ordered from a Sears-Roebuck Wish Book catalog. The catalog featured toys, clothes, gadgets, bedspreads, Blue Willow China sets – and more! Even if your family couldn’t afford to buy much, the arrival of the catalog was an invitation to dream. Grandparents, parents, and children alike could wish for something bigger, brighter, and better in their everyday lives.
Hallmark movies, a perennial holiday favorite, often portray small towns as an escape vehicle for Americans. When the heroine leaves the big city and ends up in a quaint town, she discovers its subtle charms. Sometimes she returns to her hometown for the first time in years, and now sees it with a different set of eyes. She might even discover the love interest she left behind.
Holding onto the past
We live in an America where 86% of us live in urban and suburban places, 75% trim artificial trees, almost 1 in 3 has an Amazon Prime membership, and SUVs account for 52% of new vehicle sales. How does this red pickup truck trend fit in?
The rustic red pickup isn’t simply a mode of transportation. It invites us on an emotional journey. “Over the river and through the woods to Grandmother’s house we go” connects us to warm memories of home and family. Only 25% of Americans still live in their hometowns, and the image of a red pickup traveling a country road creates the possibility of a return trip to rediscover our roots. Or, it might suggest a search for something that tumbled unnoticed out of the truck bed of our earlier lives. Only years later, we’ve recognized our enduring loss.
The vintage red truck captures a longing for simplicity, practicality, or a slower and less complicated time when we felt more grounded.
Nostalgia is a coping mechanism. It serves as an emotional buffer in times of stress, chaos, sadness, and loss. As we approach our 250th anniversary as a country, Americans are struggling with high food costs, inflation, tariffs, international conflicts and violence at home, a widening gap between rich and poor, and a chief executive whose words and actions repudiate the values passed down by generations – including those who relied on those pickups as the workhorse vehicle for their road trip to the American dream.
Is it any wonder that now, more than ever, we may be choosing to remember only a small time capsule of our Americana fever dream?
For despite the economic boom following post-World War II, life wasn’t always made of the stuff of Hallmark movies on the farms, in the small towns, and large cities of America during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Scratch below the surface, and you’d find:
· An estimated 35% of Americans living below the poverty line
· A polio epidemic ravaging families and their children
· A draft of Americans to fight across the globe, this time in the Korean War
· A resurgent Ku Klux Klan in reaction to the Civil Rights movement
Emotional journey
Bruce Hanson isn’t nostalgic for old pickups — he has the real thing: a 1947 Dodge. Hanson, a college classmate, likes to say we are graduates of the Bea Tift School of English. A decade after that earning our college degrees, I found that Bruce was combining farming with a photography/writing business. He occasionally submitted humorous poetry to me at Successful Farming. Although I haven’t seen Bruce for decades, I’ve reconnected with him and his wife, Mary Kae, through Substack.
Bruce’s old truck isn’t red. (It’s hard to imagine a firetruck-red workhorse truck.) Years ago, he penned a poem and photographed his old truck as part of a freelance assignment about auctioneering. Bruce titled it, “Sellin’ Dreams.” More recently, Bruce collaborated with a friend who lives in Hawaii who set this poem to music, and recorded the song. Bruce added his video and photographs of the truck, and the project was produced locally.
I asked Bruce if he ever planned to sell his truck at an auction, and his response articulates the old red pick-up truck phenomenon better than I ever could. He wrote:
“I would never sell it. I learned to drive in that truck. Chased cows and built fence with that truck. I drove it to high school football practice. My three kids learned to drive it. My youngest son drove his bride away from the church on his wedding day in that old ‘47 Dodge.”
Thanks to Bruce for sharing this YouTube video.
I hope you enjoy his take on this emotional journey.
Hold fast to dreams
During the empty nest phase of our journey to Deal’s Orchard these days, my husband and I often look through the rear view mirror of our pickup with rose-colored glasses. “It’s OK to look back at the past. Just don’t stare,” I remind myself.
We also have the choice of looking through the front windshield at what’s ahead. Is it possible the vintage red pickup suggests an optimistic journey through a time portal to a New Year filled with possibilities? This commercially popular red truck sensation is, at its core, about selling a dream. It might be a dream of the past-– or possibly one for the future.
Maybe, just maybe, there’s a subliminal message driving the popularity of the red truck theme: the determination to keep going, persisting, and moving forward through life’s journey, even when it’s difficult or seemingly hopeless. Maybe it’s the simple message of resilience popularized by underground artist Robert Crumb in the late 1960s:
KEEP ON TRUCKIN’

FORT HALL RESERVATION, Idaho — Standing atop Ferry Butte, Frances Goli scanned the more than half a million acres of Shoshone-Bannock tribal land below as she dug her hands into the pockets of a pink pullover.
The April wind was chilly at one of the tribes’ highest vistas in remote southeastern Idaho.
“Our goal is to bring fiber out here,” Goli said, sweeping one hand across the horizon. The landscape below is scattered with homes, bordered in the east by snowcapped mountain peaks and to the west by “The Bottoms,” where tribal bison graze along the Snake River.

In between, on any given day, a cancer patient drives to the reservation’s casino to call doctors. A young mother asks one child not to play video games so another can do homework. Tribal field nurses update charts in paper notebooks at patients’ homes, then drive back to the clinic to pull up records, send orders, or check prescriptions.
Three years ago, the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes were awarded more than $22 million during the first round of the federal Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program. But tribes that were awarded millions in a second round of funding saw their payments held up under the Trump administration. Last month, federal leaders announced modifications to tribal broadband programs as part of a larger effort to “reduce red tape.” The National Telecommunications and Information Administration said it plans to “promote flexibility” and launch a new grant in the spring.
Federal regulators declined to provide details. The announcement comes after a year of upheaval for federal broadband programs, including the elimination of Digital Equity Act funding, which President Donald Trump has called “racist,” and a restructured $42 billion Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment program, which U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said was influenced by “woke mandates.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Across Indian Country and on the Fort Hall Reservation, high-speed internet service gaps persist despite billions set aside for tribes. In early November, U.S. Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) asked federal agency leaders why funds already awarded had not been released to tribes and whether federal regulators were providing adequate technical assistance.
So far, the $3 billion tribal program has announced $2.24 billion in awards for 275 projects nationwide. But tribes that won awards have drawn down only about $500 million, according to a recent update from the Commerce Department’s Office of Inspector General.
The agency has initiated tribal consultation on the broadband programs, offering tribal leaders two dates in January for online meetings.
The Shoshone-Bannock Tribes have drawn down less than 2% of their awarded funding and the program has not yet connected a single household, Goli said. NTIA spokesperson Stephen Yusko said the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes are still slated to get their full grant award and, he confirmed, future spending will not be subject to the administration’s recalibrations.
Gaps in high-speed internet can be profound and urgent on tribal lands. Tribal members are historically underserved and, on average, live with the highest rates of chronic illnesses and die 6.5 years earlier than the average U.S. resident.
Diabetes and high suicide rates are among the most pernicious tribal health challenges — and federal research confirms telehealth can improve health outcomes. A KFF Health News analysis showed that people tend to live sicker and die younger in America when they live in dead zones, or places where poor internet access intersects with shortages of health care providers, leaving patients who need it most unable to use telehealth.
“We’re in survival mode,” said Nancy Eschief Murillo, a longtime Shoshone-Bannock leader. The tribes, which have an on-site clinic, need more health care both in person and with telehealth, she said. “Right now, our reservation? We don’t have accessibility.”

 Fort Hall has about 2,400 households. Nearly all of them live without high-speed internet.

Inside a trailer that serves as the temporary headquarters for Fort Hall’s tribal broadband office, Goli sat at a desk in June and scanned the Federal Communications Commission’s most recent online map of the reservation.
As the tribes’ broadband project manager, Goli didn’t like what she saw on the map. Blue hexagons highlighted varying rates of high-speed coverage and signified that high-speed internet is available on much of the reservation. Companies have told federal regulators they provide fast transmission speeds to homes there.
“These are untrue,” Goli said. Fort Hall has about 2,400 households, and nearly all of them live without high-speed internet, she said.
When it comes to tracking who on a reservation has high-speed internet, “everybody acknowledges, including the FCC, that the map is not 100% accurate,” said Robert Griffin, co-chair of the Fiber Broadband Association Tribal Committee, an industry trade group. He is also the broadband director for the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma.
Attempting to correct the maps is one of the many tasks Goli has taken on since becoming the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes’ broadband project manager in January 2023 — seven months after the tribes won the award.
A series of hurdles, including flaws in the plan initially approved by the federal government and a cyberattack, have delayed the project, she said. The attack hit in August 2024 and for months shut down nearly all phones and computers on the reservation.
“We didn’t have access to any of our information,” Goli told KFF Health News this month, adding that the tribes are still “in recovery mode” from the attack.
Goli, who grew up on the reservation and still plays basketball at the tribal gym, left her job as a data analyst in Seattle to return home to be with family and to work. For two years, and with no broadband industry experience, Goli has overseen the multimillion-dollar grant without a staff.
Her first task, she said, was to collect data that could help create a realistic plan to deliver broadband to every home on the reservation. “Data tells a story,” Goli said.

Fort Hall and many other tribal lands are remote with rugged, expansive terrain. To build fiber-optic cables underground, the tribes must navigate lava rock and work with the Bureau of Indian Affairs to get permits. To build communications towers, the tribes must ensure they follow migratory bird rules for American bald eagles. To provide wireless connections, the tribes must buy or license spectrum from federal regulators, Goli said.
When the federal tribal broadband program launched, more than 300 tribal applicants — pitching projects totaling $5 billion  — submitted requests to the NTIA. During a later round of funding, more than 160 tribal applicants asked for more than $2.6 billion, even though only $980 million was available. There are 574 federally recognized tribes in the United States.
The tribal program funding was not enough to “build out Indian Country,” said Joe Valandra, chief executive and chairman of the broadband consulting firm Tribal Ready. Valandra is a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota.
Congress created the tribal program to be used in combination with funds from the larger $42 billion Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment, or BEAD, program, Valandra said.
But now, it seems “the administration has no appetite for expensive broadband infrastructure builds in rural areas,” said Jessica Auer, a senior researcher with the community broadband networks team at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a research and advocacy nonprofit.

Auer, who has followed the implementation of tribal programs, said the administration may think the money already given to states for BEAD, as well as the use of satellite internet connections, will be enough for tribal lands.
“They seem to have a strong interest in declaring this problem solved,” she said. Low-earth-orbit satellites, though, are costly for the consumer and do not always offer the consistent high speeds they should, she said.
Goli’s plan does not include the use of satellites. On Fort Hall, the few households that have fast speeds now buy Starlink, but tribal leaders say the $80 to $120 monthly subscription costs are too expensive for most members.
The newly revised plan will use a hybrid of fiber-optic cables and wireless internet to ensure that people can “live their lives, whether it be health, education, telehealth,” Goli said.
 First fiber-optic lines will cover two-mile segment on northern end of reservation

Ladd Edmo, a councilman for the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, thinks the tribal broadband project is taking too long.
Goli “is doing the best she can,” Edmo said.
Ladd Edmo, a longtime member of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes’ business council, lives near the town center on the Fort Hall Reservation, but his internet is slow, he says. “I get a lot of buffering.” (Photo by Sarah Jane Tribble/KFF Health News)
But when he thinks about the millions waiting to be spent, Edmo said, he worries federal regulators “can just grab it back.”
“I’m not afraid of the current administration,” said Edmo, who is in his fifth term on the tribes’ business council. “I just think that they’re looking for money everywhere they can.”
Edmo lives about half a mile from the Fort Hall townsite and said he can’t really use his internet because he “gets a tremendous amount of buffering.” When he travels to doctors for his prostate cancer treatment, Edmo has them print paper schedules to keep track of his treatment.
He said he is not a big fan of telehealth, “probably because I don’t know how to use it.”
 
For 53-year-old Carol Cervantes Osborne, who also lives on the reservation, having internet is a necessity. Osborne is in constant pain from severe rheumatoid arthritis.
“I’m just all broke down,” Osborne said as she stared at the open pasture last June. She talked about how she misses riding cattle roundups. At times, Osborne has been bed-bound because of her arthritis and bad knees. She said she tapped her credit line, which uses land and cattle as collateral, and signed up for Starlink so that she can connect with doctors remotely through telehealth appointments.
“I’m poor because of it, but we’ve got to have it,” Osborne said.

Meanwhile, nearly 15 months after the cyberattack, Goli said the tribes are beginning to hire vendors.
“Things happen very slow when it comes to processing things in the tribal government,” Goli said, adding there are a lot of “checks and balances.”
This month — as the holidays approached — Goli said she was excited.
“We’ve actually started our first segment of fiber,” Goli said. The engineering work is done, and they have begun issuing permits, she said. The fiber-optic lines, built by a private vendor, will cover a two-mile segment on the northern end of the reservation. The line will come from outside the reservation and connect to the tribes’ data hub, which is an old radio station still being converted into broadband offices.
“It’s our first segment, and we’re really using this as a test,” Goli said.
Eventually, the old radio station will be central to operations, with fiber-optic cable lines that web out over about 800 square miles to reach the reservation’s five district lodges. Each lodge will establish a communications tower, which will use the fiber line to power wireless antennas that will then provide high-speed internet to the reservation’s most remote homes.
Goli said the tribes are applying for another extension — and, she said, they would not be the only award winners of the Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program to ask for more time. Working with tribes, she said, takes time.
“It really saddens me that we’ve been left behind all these years,” Goli said, but “this is our opportunity. We want to do it right, slow and steady.”
Sarah Jane Tribble, KFF Health News’ chief rural correspondent, spent more than a year interviewing Frances Goli through calls, texts, and emails. She traveled to Fort Hall Reservation twice, having received tribal approval to visit the land: in spring 2024 and again in summer 2025. Tribble also reviewed publicly requested copies of the tribal contract and interviewed dozens of industry and regulatory broadband experts.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, denounced the administration as a “government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, for the billionaires.” It was the best-attended rally ever held by Sanders, a two-time presidential candidate, until another record-breaking crowd in Los Angeles in April.
Seven months later, Civic Center Park and the Capitol grounds were again swarmed by an estimated crowd numbering in the tens of thousands, during the largest of more than 50 No Kings protests held in Colorado on Oct. 18.

In the meantime, lawmakers at the Capitol had passed long list of bills to contain the federal fallout, including protections for transgender people and gender-affirming care, a landmark state voting rights law, and much more.
Below is a selection of Colorado Newsline’s most-read and most-shared news stories of 2025.
Capacity crowds turn out in Colorado for Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez
Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez drew large crowds at stops in Greeley and Denver, where they made the case that a fight against a billionaire “oligarchy” should be the focal point of the party’s resistance to the second Trump administration.
“In the hundreds of rallies that I have done, we have never, ever had a rally as large as this,” Sanders said during a rally in Civic Center Park. “And Denver, your presence here today is not just significant for Colorado. You are sending a profound message all over the world. The whole world is watching, and they want to know if the people of America are going to stand up to Trumpism, oligarchy and authoritarianism.”
Colorado Senate committee advances bill to ban guns that accept detachable magazines
A law passed by the Colorado Legislature this year banned the sale of semiautomatic firearms that can take detachable magazines. Sponsors framed Senate Bill 25-3 as an effort to enforce the intent of Colorado’s existing large-capacity magazine law from 2013, which limits magazines to 15 rounds of ammunition. Gunmen in two recent Colorado shootings — in 2021 at a Boulder King Soopers and in 2023 at a nightclub in Colorado Springs — used magazines banned under that law.
Colorado House approves pair of bills for transgender health care and protections
With transgender rights on shaky ground at the federal level under the Trump administration, Colorado lawmakers this year approved two bills to strengthen protections for transgender people and gender-affirming care. House Bill 25-1309 codified into state law existing state public health rules about gender-affirming health care coverage, while House Bill 25-1312 added protections for transgender people in schools and courts.

In May, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed the Colorado Voting Rights Act, establishing various protections contained in the federal Voting Rights Act at the state level. 
Senate Bill 25-1, the first bill of the 2025 legislative session, prohibits election practices that limit the participation of people of color and other protected groups. It also includes protections for LGBTQ+ voters, expands multilingual ballot access, and requires accommodations for people with disabilities at residential facilities. The state attorney general can enforce voting rights under the Colorado measure, so the state does not need to rely on federal courts to enforce voting protections.
​Trump signs formal pardon for Tina Peters, lawyer claims it applies to state charges
This month, President Donald Trump said that he had signed a formal presidential pardon for Tina Peters, the former Mesa County clerk convicted of her role in a breach of her office’s secure elections systems, part of an attempt to uncover evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election.
Trump does not have the power to pardon Peters, who was convicted on state charges. But her lawyer, Peter Ticktin, lobbied Trump for the pardon after developing an unsupported theory that the presidential pardon power does in fact apply at the state level, expressing hope that the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority will rewrite the centuries-old legal principle of dual sovereignty in criminal proceedings.
In shift, Sen. Bennet supports Colorado constitutional amendment for emergency redistricting
Earlier this month, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat who is running for Colorado governor in 2026, announced he would support a constitutional amendment to allow the state to redraw its congressional districts to offset partisan gerrymandering in other states.
Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat who is also running for governor in 2026, was the first statewide elected official in Colorado to support the idea of redrawing the state’s congressional districts mid-cycle. Redistricting efforts by Democrats come in response to Trump’s successful pressure on Republican-led states, including Texas, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio, to redraw their congressional lines so the party can pick up more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Protest against Trump brings about 8,000 people to Colorado Capitol

In April, about 8,000 people rallied and marched at the Colorado Capitol in Denver for one of the many volunteer-organized Hands Off! protests against the Trump administration. Addressing the crowd, Weiser told the crowd that the Trump administration “didn’t get the memo that immigrants make America great,” which is why he joined a lawsuit challenging Trump’s “unimaginable step of thinking a Sharpie could overrule the Constitution” when he issued an executive order to end birthright citizenship.
“In America, when we stand together, when we stand on our principles, we will always prevail,” Weiser said. “We cannot be silenced.”
U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans misrepresented family’s immigration history
Colorado Rep. Gabe Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican, has leaned heavily on the story of his Mexican-American grandfather, who he said immigrated the “right way” and “legal way,” to defend the extreme mass-deportation policies being pursued by the Trump administration.
But Evans mischaracterized the story of how his Depression-era ancestors achieved the American dream, and misstated key dates and details in his grandfather’s biography, according to documents obtained by Newsline. Those records show that his grandfather, Cuauhtemoc Chavez was squarely on the wrong side of the “strong immigration policies” Evans now invokes his name to champion.
Tens of thousands of Coloradans rally and march against Trump at No Kings protests
The largest anti-Trump protest of the year took place in October, when thousands of people gathered in opposition to Trump’s administration at a No Kings rally and march in Denver, one of more than 50 No Kings protests held across Colorado amid rising tensions over the country’s direction in his second term. On the state Capitol steps, the crowd heard from a lineup of speakers including former state Rep. Joe Salazar, who said in a fiery speech that Trump’s agenda “threatens to tear the fabric of this country apart.”
“There is no king in America, and we will not be silenced by authoritarians,” Salazar said to cheers.
Michael Bennet upends race with Colorado governor bid
Flanked by many of the state’s most prominent elected Democrats, Bennet announced his run for governor in an event in Denver’s City Park in April. His decision upended a race that had been expected to be a wide-open contest between multiple up-and-coming Colorado Democrats.
“Everything we care about now is at stake in our country,” Bennet said in a short announcement speech. “Business as usual is simply not enough, and that’s why I’m running for governor of Colorado.”

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. — Mike Lamp may not be very busy as the cooling November temperatures settle on his apiary in Monongalia County, but that doesn’t mean the work stops entirely.
Serving as the president of both the West Virginia Beekeeper’s Association and the Monongalia County Beekeeper’s Association, Lamp and several other beekeepers throughout the state are working together to shore up protections for apiarists across the state.
Next year’s West Virginia legislative session will see a bill drafted by those beekeepers to protect the rights of beekeepers and encourage growth in the industry. The bill would create uniformity for beekeeping laws across the state, set aside funds to increase flora growth and pollination, and prepare for an incoming mite that threatens the bee population by making information about it clearer and available.

West Virginia saw an estimated 40% decline in the honey bee population from 2024 to 2025, according to the West Virginia Department of Agriculture. State Apiarist Shanda King said losses as high as 62% have been reported nationwide.
West Virginia Del. Daniel Linville, R-Cabell, said the bee decline can be attributed to a variety of factors, including harsh winters and an invasive species of mite.
The varroa mite came to the U.S. from Asia and transmits diseases throughout honey bee colonies. If enough bees in one colony die off before winter, no new worker bees can be produced and the remaining ones cannot effectively keep the queen bee warm by shivering around her, resulting in the whole colony dying off.


Bee mortality can make it harder for farmers to produce food because there are not as many pollinators.
“When you have a healthy population of pollinators of all kinds, that is tremendous for agriculture, for farmers, for all these things,” Linville said. “The more pollinators you have, the better as it relates to all types of farming, and obviously if you have fewer, then it’s a lot more difficult to produce the amount of that fruit or vegetable that you’d like.”
This upcoming bill, dubbed “The Bee Bill,” aims to fight the decline by increasing beekeeper protections in West Virginia.

The bill’s sponsors say the state’s beekeepers are dealing with an inconsistent regulatory environment — some local governments are more neutral toward beekeeping, while others outright criminalize it.
If passed, this bill would prevent some local bans on beekeeping, eliminate unnecessary licensing, strengthen legal protections for beekeepers and raise the legal standards for nuisance complaints, according to Eryck Stamper, a beekeeper and one of the drafters of the bill. The idea is to create more uniformity around beekeeping laws within the state and leave beekeeping regulation up to the WVDA as opposed to local governments.
“The goal is to have the state, which is doing a really good job as it already is, managing the bee population and program here in West Virginia,” Stamper said.
According to Lamp, the main goal is to protect beekeepers.
“No matter where they are, they can register their bees and be safe knowing that… as long as they’re abiding by the Department of Agriculture’s standards, of course, that they don’t have to worry about being fined or going to jail or anything crazy for being beekeepers and supporting our agriculture,” he said.

In addition to creating more consistent laws, the bill will also earmark funds from the Protect Pollinator special license plates to go to the State Road Fund and be used by the West Virginia Department of Highways to create pollinator plots by planting and maintaining flora along state highways.
Finally, the bill will also help prepare for an oncoming mite similar to the varroa mite. The tropilaelaps, or “tropi” mites, have not come to the U.S. yet, but are expected to be as devastating to the population as the varroa mite. According to King, both the tropi and varroa mites can spread disease throughout honey bee colonies, but the tropi mite reproduces at a much faster rate and is much harder to detect.
Where a varroa infestation might be manageable if caught early on, the tropi mite “can destroy a hive in weeks,” according to Jim Smith, another beekeeper supporting the bill.
The bill would define language around the newly emerging species and educate others about it.
“We know that tropilaelaps mites are gonna be here soon,” Lamp said. “It is just a matter of time before it gets here, like varroa mites got here, like everything else does. This is just a proactive step.”
According to Linville, some things everyday people can do to help support the state’s bee population are grow pollinator friendly plants like goldenrod and dandelions, know the difference between pollen-producing plants and nectar-producing plants, which bees need to produce honey, and grow a garden or even take up beekeeping themselves.
“Hopefully, if this bill makes it across the finish line, you can start keeping bees yourself,” Linville said. “It’s not an incredibly expensive thing to do, also it’s not a crazy time commitment.”
The West Virginia Beekeepers Association also encourages people to reach out to their local representatives about the bill to try and get it passed.
“We really want folks to reach out on our behalf because there are about 2,000 of us in this state of 1.8 million people, and as much as that doesn’t sound like a big number we touch a lot of folks,” Lamp said. “We support our communities and our cities and our counties and our state as a whole and we want them to support us too.”

The drafters of this bill are overall hopeful and do not expect much pushback for it, but understand that people may want laws like this to be left up to the local level, according to Lamp.
“There will be work to do beginning in January, but we’re hopeful that this can be one of those roughly 10% of introduced bills that can make it across the finish line,” Linville said.
West Virginia’s 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 14, 2026 and lasts until March 14.

He later lowered the rate to 15%, including for South Korean cars.","Shoppers are able to access Korean snacks and other groceries at H Mart in Cary on Oct. 8, 2025. (Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)During the holidays, we’re bringing back our journalists’ favorite stories of 2025. This one is from October.
Christine Zhu: “As a Chinese American whose parents are immigrants, Asian grocers like H Mart were a substantial part of my life growing up — and they still are today. I’m proud that I was able to amplify coverage of Asian American communities during the current political climate in a meaningful way.”
Robert Cerniglia, a Korean American who’s lived in North Carolina for all his life, recalls the late 2016 opening of H Mart in Cary as monumental for members of his community.
It’s where he shops for snacks and other food items that aren’t readily available in other places. It’s the only H Mart in North Carolina, and shoppers flock to it from all over the state.
But in recent years, prices have been going up.
“A lot of the stuff that I normally buy has just increased in price,” Cerniglia said. “This is definitely something we’ve noticed a lot since the pandemic. The pandemic was really the highest price increase that we’ve seen, but it’s not really getting better.”
Representatives for H Mart did not respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment.

“Everything has continued to be more expensive,” said Matthew Laurentz, another H Mart shopper. “Inflation has continued to drive things up.”
The current political climate hasn’t helped with that.
Since taking office in January 2025, President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on many international exports, including those from South Korea.
The country was the sixth-largest U.S. goods trading partner in 2024, with bilateral trade in goods totaling $200 billion, according to the Congressional Research Service. 
In July, Trump announced a 25% tariff on goods made in South Korea. He later lowered the rate to 15%, including for South Korean cars.
Officials representing the two nations have recently made “meaningful progress” in negotiations over $350 billion of investments in the U.S. that Seoul had earlier pledged in a deal to reduce tariffs, according to Reuters. But in the meantime, consumers are paying the price.
Vehicles and electronics comprise South Korea’s top exports to the U.S. by value. These include vehicle manufacturers like Hyundai and Kia, and electronic brands like Samsung and LG.
Prices have increased across the board since implementing more tariffs, but Ira Gabriel, senior group manager for corporate and marketing PR at Hyundai Motor America, stopped short of blaming the tariffs for the higher prices. 
Gabriel said pricing adjustments are influenced by a number of factors, including market dynamics, consumer demand, and upgrades to vehicle features as part of the annual model year changeover. 
“We will continue to respond to shifts in supply and demand with a flexible pricing strategy, targeted incentive programs, and a commitment to adding value for our customers,” Gabriel told NC Newsline in an email.
More than just cars and computers
Over the past few years, Korean cosmetic products — K-beauty for short — have skyrocketed  in popularity among younger Americans. South Korea shipped more skincare and cosmetics to the U.S. than any other country last year, AP News reported.

Korean snacks and media are also attracting more mainstream attention. Netflix’s KPop Demon Hunters is returning to theaters for Halloween, and Buldak ramen and other Asian foods have gone viral on TikTok. 
But even as the cultural bond between the U.S. and South Korea grows stronger, their geopolitical relationship has become more strained. 
Tensions between the two countries rose last month when more than 300 South Korean workers were detained after an immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.
Following negotiations, the South Korean government chartered a flight for them to return home. 
The company said in a statement on its website that the safety and well-being of its workers is a top priority. 
“Hyundai works closely with HR and legal teams to ensure compliance with immigration and visa regulations,” Gabriel wrote in an email.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4179-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-25 06:12:07.113179

(Photo courtesy of Chad Elliott)The first time I portrayed Santa Claus was for my older sister’s kindergarten classroom. I was 19 years old, 6’2” and 180 pounds and I could not yet grow facial hair. Not a very convincing St. Nick.
I vaguely remember my sister warning me that I would have to park at a certain spot near the school as it was a very small community school which had a 180-degree window view on ground level around the classroom she was in. So in order to surprise the children, it would be paramount not to be seen.
I drove through the icy winter morning in my beat-up old 1985 Toyota Tercel, scraping the interior of my windshield as the defrost was not very efficient in the frigid temperatures. It didn’t help that I was putting off a lot of condensation beneath the pearly nylon beard and wig. It made me feel claustrophobic and anxious knowing that I would be representing Christmas for about 50 children for the rest of their lives. I kept asking myself, what I was thinking by agreeing to do this? That is a lot of pressure for a 19-year-old college kid.
Nonetheless, I barreled down the small, country highway which led to the town of Minden, Iowa. I waved at passing cars, laughing nervously to myself as families did double takes down the highway. I imagined parents explaining away the image of Santa sputtering down the road in a light blue and slightly rusted Japanese economy car to their young ones about how his sleigh must have broken down.
I roared up to the school and immediately regretted my parking situation. But I was also running late with no time to waste moving to a new space. So I wandered up the open lot which led to the door of the classroom. I could already hear the shrieks and shrill screams, “Santa! Santa!”
I did my lowest, “Ho, Ho, Ho,” and suddenly realized that I should’ve done more preparation. I had done improv acting and spent plenty of time in the theater growing up, but this role was different. There are certain protocols. Memories are being made and if I forgot to say certain things in a certain way, I could ruin Christmas for these kindergarteners!
For those of you who have not portrayed Kris Kringle, I am going to let you in on a little secret. It is all about capturing the persona. But also, perhaps even more importantly, you must have a firm grip. Imagine strangers handing off their most precious gift they have ever received in life while it is wriggling and screaming not wanting to be with you at all! All the while, your grip is impeded by cotton gloves but you can NOT drop them. You must be calm, jolly and answer strange questions about your fictional life in a faraway land. In short, you must lie — lie right through your teeth, and through that cheap, general store, nylon beard. The more fanciful the lie, the better, as to make sure the character you are creating has mystique and depth.
Of course, the usual dialogue then occurs, “Have you been a good boy/girl? What would you like me to bring you for Christmas?” You sometimes get some very original answers, but not always — not even often. You must act genuinely surprised when the children after the first in line asks for the exact same thing as the kid before them. It happened this day in my sister’s classroom. Every child wanted a toy tractor. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.
I eventually got pretty comfortable during my first time portraying the iconic figure. I unloaded prepackaged gifts for each of them and thoroughly enjoyed our 30 minutes together. I acted as jolly as I could muster, but then I decided it was time to go. I would quit while I was ahead.
I stepped out onto the icy pavement, still in character waving at the children in the windows. Their little red faces were pressed up to the glass lining the building like ornaments bobbing up and down, still giddy with excitement to have met a celebrity of such caliber.
I kept walking, every once in awhile turning around to wave at them some more. I had pulled it off! I felt a sense of pride to have not completely botched it up for those kids’ sake and my sister’s sake.
The ice crunched beneath my snow boots as I got closer and closer to the car. My car! The kids could still see me! They would know I was an imposter! A few would most certainly begin to doubt if Santa Claus even existed!
My mind raced. “Should I turn around once more? Do I just keep walking down the street?” I had to decide quickly.
I got to my driver’s door and stopped for a second. I took a deep breath and turned around hoping that class had resumed. But as I turned, my fears were confirmed. There they were — the little elves were all lined up and waving at me just as thrilled as when I stepped into the classroom.
I then did the only thing I could think to do at 19 years old, dressed as Santa in Minden, Iowa. I threw my hands up into the biggest shrug like a silent movie actor and waved a really big “around-the-world” wave as if to say, “I’m outta here!” My boots squeaked as I wheeled about, opened the creaky, driver’s door and after three attempts to start the engine I finally sputtered away waving out the window. While all this was happening I kept muttering under my breath, “This cannot be happening … This cannot be happening …”
I think I even saw a few of the kids cock their heads like perplexed puppies in the window.
I pulled the car over when I reached the edge of town, far from the gaze of kindergarteners. I sat silent in the car trying to take in just how quickly things turned around for me back at the school. One minute I was Father Christmas, bringer of all good things, the next I was just a teenage art major posing for his sister’s class.
The squeak of my heel was still playing over and over in my mind. What had just happened? I comforted myself with the knowledge that my much more experienced sister would come up with the perfect excuse as to why Santa drove away in a rust bucket, blue Toyota.
It was then that it happened. I laughed the biggest, most jolly belly laugh I had ever laughed. A laugh to make Santa proud.
Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!

The light display turns 90 this year, according to research by the State Archives. (Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)For 90 years, the North Dakota Capitol’s window-lit Christmas tree has been an annual holiday staple.
The Christmas tree design in the Capitol windows first appeared in 1935, said Sarah Walker, head of reference services for the State Historical Society of North Dakota, who has researched the display.
Construction on North Dakota’s Capitol was completed in 1934, replacing the Capitol building that was destroyed by fire in 1930. Walker’s research from newspaper stories showed that architects and the superintendent of the Capitol Commission discussed using the tower to display designs. 
The first Capitol lighting display was in 1934 as construction on the building was wrapping up, Walker said. It depicted a cross in the windows to commemorate Easter.
Later that year, the star of Bethlehem, containing 120 lights and measuring about 16 feet in diameter, was the first Christmas decoration for the building, although it was affixed to the top of the building and not displayed in the windows, she said.
Walker said it’s unclear from her research if the Christmas tree was red and green when the display first appeared in 1935. But she found a 1936 Bismarck Tribune article that described a red and green pattern.

“It’s such a cool tradition, and it’s so cool to think about how long it’s been going on,” Walker said. “I have not heard of this anywhere else.”
Other window-lit designs were also showcased during the early years of the building to celebrate a Kiwanis Club convention, the National Anti-Tuberculosis Association, a Christian ecumenical group and a dance held at the Capitol in conjunction with the legislative session, she said.
“It was meant to be used as a tool to welcome people and celebrate holidays,” Walker said. “I kind of think they were trying to be as inventive as possible and just created this really cool tradition.”
The red and green tree design has been consistent for decades, Walker said. A 1962 photo from the State Historical Society of North Dakota shows it similar to today.
Eighty-eight colored plastic window shades, 48 green and 40 red, on select windows on the north and south sides of the Capitol create the state’s iconic Christmas symbol, said Brandon Solberg, facilities director for the Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Capitol grounds. 
It takes five members of the facilities department to install the window shades every year after Thanksgiving, Solberg said. After that, the custodial staff need to ensure the colored shades are pulled down each night on the appropriate windows. The remaining windows are shaded to create a darkened outline for the tree.
“You can see the Capitol tower from so many different angles, and from so far away, that to have it lit up for the holidays is just great,” Solberg said. “It’s quite a process to do that on every floor, every night.”

The Capitol also lights its windows to display the new year on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. The windows are also lit to display 4th on the Fourth of July. 
“Some offices aren’t very bright so they have to bring in lamps to kind of brighten up the room, so it can get kind of complicated,” he said. 
The building was illuminated with “ND 125” on Aug. 16, 2014, to celebrate North Dakota’s 125th birthday. In recent years, the Capitol has lit a single number in its windows to commemorate the football championships won by the North Dakota State University Bison, he said. 
The facilities department receives many requests to do other designs, in other colors, for special events, Solberg said, but the department typically turns down those requests because it would take too much time to set up and coordinate.
With the installation of new windows at the Capitol in 2026, Solberg said the architect was made aware of the annual window lighting to ensure the tradition continues.
He also said they are exploring the possibility of installing LED lighting in certain offices with automatic window shades that could make the lighting easier in the future, but those additions would require funding from the Legislature.
Walker, who is from Bismarck, recalls looking for the Capitol Christmas display as a little girl.
“I can remember just always looking for it to be up,” she said. “I really do kind of feel a sense of, ‘this is home.’”

Dec. 18, 2025 (Ian Karbal/Capital-Star)The Christmas season seems to start earlier and earlier each year. 
Some retailers start selling decorations around Halloween, while radio stations switch over to an all Christmas music format well before Thanksgiving
But for Brandon Mytrysak Christmas is a year-round focus. He’s the owner of Mytrysak Family Tree Farm and Growhouse in Indiana County, which sold around 1,000 Christmas trees this year. The day after Thanksgiving is when they open their doors for people looking for the perfect tree, tours and family activities. Then right before the holiday, the doors close. 
For Brandon, his wife Stacey Mytrysak, and even their three young daughters, there’s little downtime before that’s the months-long preparation for the next year’s rush begins.
“People don’t realize that this business here is an all-year thing,” Brandon Mytrysak said. “We’re constantly cleaning up, or getting ready for planting season, or repairing everything that broke during our tree season, mowing, shearing, and all that … In this business, basically we have to make all of our money in about a month to continue on to the next season.”
Despite the challenges — Brandon also works another full time job and Stacey works part time — a lot of the appeal is the joy they bring to others around the holiday season. But it also connects them to both their family’s and community’s histories.

The Christmas Tree Capital of the World
Signs welcome visitors entering Indiana County to the Christmas Tree Capital of the World. More than two dozen retail and wholesale farms grow Frasier Firs, White Pines, Colorado Spruces, Canaan Firs, Douglas Firs and more for the holiday. 
While it’s no longer true, if it ever was, that Indiana County farmers sell more Christmas trees than anywhere else in the world, the Mytrysak family has been part of the tradition for around 75 years, since the nickname first appeared.
According to the Indiana County Christmas Tree Growers Association, the industry began in the area around 1918. In 1956, an estimated 700,000 trees were harvested in the county. That’s around when the Associated Press referred to Indiana County as the “Christmas Tree Capital of the World.”

In 1958, a challenger emerged. The community of Shelton, Washington, attempted to claim the title for itself. But an Indiana County nursery operator put an end to the effort when he revealed he’d received an order of 15,000 trees to Tacoma, Washington. Another town in the Pacific Northwest – Estacada, Oregon – has also made similar claims recently.
According to the Pennsylvania Christmas Tree Growers Association, the state currently ranks second in the nation for the number of Christmas tree farms and fourth in number of Christmas trees cut each year.
Despite the dwindling number of Christmas Trees sold and growers in Indiana County, the name has stuck. And for a county already steeped in Christmas traditions, it’s been a label they carry with pride.
Indiana Borough, the county seat, is the hometown of Jimmy Stewart, the star of the holiday season staple “It’s A Wonderful Life.” The film made the community a minor tourist destination for Christmas fanatics across the country. There’s a Jimmy Stewart statue and museum, an “It’s a Wonderful Life festival,” and theaters that play the film in December. The main street, Philadelphia Street, is illuminated with Christmas lights for the holidays — some spelling out catchphrases associated with Stewart.
Bus tours full of Christmas tourists stop at the Mytrysak’s farm as well.
“Since we’re the Christmas Tree Capital, people love to just hear about the trees — how they grow, what we do,” Stacey Mytrysak said. “A lot of people think, ‘You plant that tree, next year it’s going to look like a Christmas tree.’ No, no, no. We have to shape them every year and fertilize and everything else. If not, they wouldn’t have that Christmas shape.”
A tree can take between six years and several decades to grow, depending on the size.
On top of working the farm, Stacey Mytrysak runs a gift shop and runs wreath-making classes. She and Brandon have also filled the property with family activities for the holiday season.  There are photo stations, tractor wagons, a small train, a fire pit for chilly nights, and a winery often sets up a booth during the pre-holiday season.

‘Keeping their memory alive’
Brandon is a third-generation tree farmer. His grandparents first began in the business in the late 1950s, roughly the time the county was labeled as the Christmas Tree Capital of the World.
When he was young, Mytrysak would work the fields with his grandparents and uncle. He helps Brandon and Stacey on the farm.
“I always enjoyed doing it,” Brandon said. “Ever since I can remember, I would be on the four-wheeler with my grandpap, helping him sell trees and talk with people. And in the summer time, he’d be shearing the smaller trees, and I’d be doing the little ones with my hand clippers, and all that stuff.”
“Doing it just kind of is my way of keeping their memory alive,” he added. “And hopefully I’m showing my kids the way, how we do it. Whenever we’re out here, I sit there and say ‘When I was your age, I’d be out here with my grandparents.’”
But Brandon’s grandparents have both since passed away, and the original family farm, a 10 acre plot, was handed down to his uncle, who still runs it.
In 2019, Brandon and Stacey bought the roughly 60 acre plot of land where they work now. Brandon said that’s when his wife got especially involved in the work.
“I could go up in the fields and just shear them all day. That wouldn’t bother me,” Stacey Mytrysak said. “With my kids, I’m able to put them off to school, come out here and work, go pick them up again. That’s what makes it nice, me being able to come out and work here on my own hours.”
Still, it can be a seven-day work week. But, they understand the demands and embrace them. Brandon works full time teaching landscaping to inmates. Stacey is a part time police officer in Windber Borough, Somerset County, and teaches swim lessons at the YMCA.
They also take pride in participating in community events, like hosting the Thanksgiving Day Turkey Trot to raise funds for the YMCA, or the Christmas in July festival. And each year, they donate trees to military bases around the country through the Trees for Troops program.

“I wish my grandparents were around just to see how we’ve progressed and how good of things we’re doing, not only in the Christmas tree world, but in the community as well,” Brandon Mytrysak said.
In the long run, Brandon and Stacey say their goal is to pay off as much debt on the farm as they can, and get it to be self-sustaining. That way they can give their daughters the option to continue the family tradition when they get older.
They say their older daughters, 8 and 10, are starting to show an affinity for the work, and spending time on the farm.
“They’re doing the same thing that I used to do when I was little,” Brandon Mytrysak said. “My father would dig the holes and I would try to go behind and shove the trees in the holes. Then my dad and uncle would come behind and kick them in.”
Stacey said it’s getting to the point where her kids get upset if they don’t go to the farm for the day, and have told her “‘Mom, you can never get rid of the farm.’”
“I’m okay if they turn it into something else, but I’d like to keep them something farm-wise” she said. “I like horses so I always joke and say, ‘It’s okay if you get horses. My husband gets mad when I say that.”
On Christmas itself, the family typically goes to either Brandon’s mom’s or Stacey’s parents’ house, where presents are waiting under a tree, from Indiana County, of course.
“That’s usually where we try to catch our breath, so to speak, and enjoy our kids and our families,” Brandon Mytrysak said. “Then it’s out here [to the farm], and away we go.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/img_8647_720.png,,,2025-12-25 05:57:07.626755

(Photo by Charles Paullin/Inside Climate News)The controversial proposed Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center has cleared its final major regulatory hurdle, winning approval from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. 
In a letter dated Dec. 19, DEQ officials gave the green light for the 944-megawatt peaker plant to operate in Chesterfield near the Dutch Gap conservation area south of Richmond.
Dominion Energy has argued that the plant is needed to meet energy demand on the hottest and coldest days of the year. The new plant is slated to run about 30% of the time and will be able to be fired up in just minutes. It is set to be built on the site of a former coal fired plant that was retired in 2018 after operating for 70 years. Two gas turbines currently remain in operation at the site, providing about 400 megawatts of electricity. 
“This project will provide reliable power for hundreds of thousands of homes, businesses, schools and hospitals in Chesterfield and beyond. As part of our all-of-the-above energy strategy, it will ensure our region has the reliable power we need to continue growing and thriving,” Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton said.
Fenceline communities near the project have been rallying against it for years. They argue that air monitors inside the towers and in the surrounding region do not fully capture the pollution the plant will emit. While emissions would be significantly lower than those from the previous coal plant, advocates said residents living nearby should not be subjected to them at all.
“We are profoundly disappointed that DEQ is siding with corporate polluters and ignoring the health impacts of air pollution from this dirty methane-fired power plant on our community,” said Glen Besa, chair of Friends of Chesterfield. 
The State Corporation Commission approved the project in November and also allowed the company to recover $1.47 billion from ratepayers to cover construction costs. The project is expected to come online in 2029 if construction begins in 2026, as Dominion hopes.
The Southern Environmental Law Center recently filed a petition on behalf of Appalachian Voices, Chesterfield NAACP, and Mothers Out Front challenging the final order, prompting the SCC to put that order on hold while it reviews the merits of the case. The petition argues that the project does not comply with the Virginia Clean Economy Act or the standards outlined in the Virginia Environmental Justice Act.
“We hope that the commission will see and acknowledge the unfairness of continuing to force particular communities to bear the brunt of pollution from fossil fuel infrastructure,” said SELC Senior Attorney Grayson Holmes. “Since this is the first case assessing what constitutes a ‘threat to reliability,’ sufficient to overcome the Clean Economy Act’s presumption against building new gas plants, we also hope the Commission will recognize that permitting Dominion to claim this narrow exception on flimsy evidence sets a bad precedent.”
Dominion has said the project is critical to maintaining grid reliability. It would be the first of six gas plants the company has said in its integrated resource plan will be needed to meet rapidly growing demand, largely driven by energy-hungry data centers across the state.
“We stand behind the SCC’s approval of the project. It was approved after a year of exhaustive review, an extensive public hearing and participation by thousands of Virginians,” Slayton said.
The petition is now under review by the SCC, and it could be weeks or months before the appeal is resolved, depending on whether the commission requests additional briefing.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)FRANKFORT — Leaves crunch under Kasia Bradley’s boots as she walks through the woods on Kentucky State University’s campus, listening for another sound — the knocking of a woodpecker against a tree. 
“You hear it?” Bradley said, noting the volume of the knocking. “It’s probably red-bellied.” 
She thought she had heard the call of a red-bellied woodpecker earlier that December afternoon, and she’s seen the bird on both sides of campus. “That’s just an ear over time that I’m like, ‘Oh, can I distinguish what bird that is?’ Bradley said.

Bradley, an extension associate for forestry and natural resources at the university, has been spending a lot of time in these woods this year because of the woodpeckers, or what she calls “ecosystem engineers.” The holes woodpeckers create to build nests are sometimes reused by songbirds like chickadees or bluebirds, creating habitat for other species. 
Supported by a grant from the National Wildlife Federation that promotes conservation of vulnerable species on university campuses, Bradley and her extension colleagues alongside community volunteers have been working to slowly reshape the woods along the Thorobred Trail into a place that better supports native birds. 
That especially includes the red-headed woodpecker — a different species within the same genus as the red-bellied. Both of them are part of the seven woodpeckers that call Kentucky home. 
While the red-bellied woodpecker has orange-red feathers on top of its head, the red-headed woodpecker’s head is entirely crimson — a “striking redhead,” Bradley said. The red-headed woodpecker is also called a “flying checkerboard” due to its vivid red, white and black coloring. 
“This bird’s a beautiful bird. It’s probably one of the most favorite woodpeckers in my opinion,” she said of the red-headed woodpecker.

It’s also a bird that has steadily and steeply declined in population, losing approximately 54% of its population from 1966 to 2019, according to data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. While not listed as threatened or endangered by wildlife authorities, in part because of its large range across North America, that steep population decline has made it a species of concern in some U.S. states like Wisconsin. 
Habitat loss is one of the reasons cited for the red-head’s decline, a significant factor in why bird populations across North America in general have declined by the billions since the 1970s. 
“Especially red-headed woodpeckers, they like open woodlands, savannahs,” Bradley said. “That’s something that we’ve lost a lot of in our state.” 
“If we can focus on a bird that needs a little bit of help, that’s a striking bird that is in everyone’s backyard … that really kind of brings the community in,” she said. 
Finding the ‘snags’ among the forest 
Walking through the brush, Bradley and her colleague Anna Claire Rogers come across a wooden bird box attached further up a tree. The box, blending in with the woods, is one of the ways they’ve been trying to bring the community together around these birds.
Woodpeckers usually prefer their homes to be “snags,” or dying and dead trees among the forest that woodpeckers can drill into to make cavities for nests or to store their food. But if a woodpecker can’t find a suitable snag, then a bird box can serve as an alternative home. 
“Forests don’t have to be pristine, or what we think of as pristine. They’re living in these dying trees, ” said Claire Rogers, also an extension associate at the university. “Everything is used.” 
Extension associates at the university have held workshops this year to bring the community in with their grant-funded work; one of the workshops focused on identifying trees, while another focused on building the bird boxes themselves. They’ve placed three boxes so far over the approximately 10 acres of woods they’re focusing on along the campus trail. 
Bradley and Claire Rogers credit the funding from the National Wildlife Federation for giving them the resources to go about their work transforming the woods. They’ve been able to buy chainsaws, loppers and handsaws along with herbicide and chemical sprayers to combat invasive plant species.

Clearing out the sheer prevalence of invasive species in the woods is something that Claire Rogers specializes in. She easily points out where a mess of thorny, red-hued wineberry branches reach out of the ground, or where green Japanese honeysuckle leaves continue to grow in the middle of winter. 
These invasive species can crowd out native plants on the forest floor. Japanese honeysuckle and winter creeper vines can grow aggressively fast, even climbing trees, Claire Rogers said, harming a tree’s health with thickets of vines.  Native birds such as the Kentucky warbler or prairie warbler need a diversity of plants and growth as habitat for nesting and food. 
A “monoculture” of invasive plants essentially deprives native birds of that flora diversity. 
“That results in a lot of different things, but mostly the suppression of our forest floors or our grassland corridors, suppression of those native species that our wildlife depends on,” Claire Rogers said.

Building campus connections
Bradley and Claire Rogers have had plenty of support in their conservation efforts from the local bird watching community. 
Gary Spandel, a retired employee with the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources and the secretary of the Frankfort Audubon Society, has been visiting campus at least once a month to take a survey of the birds around the woods. 
He helped with intensive surveying of campus in 2023 that found 92 species of birds, ranging from hawks to turkey vultures to the red-bellied woodpecker. 
“I walk that Thorobred Trail pretty regularly,” Spandel said. “KSU is very lucky. It is kind of a forested campus.”

Another benefit Spandel sees with the grant-funded conservation effort: getting Kentucky State University students more involved with the nature next door to them. 
“The advantage of even a handful of acres next to campus is, you know, hopefully that will influence the students there,” Spandel said. “Those are our future.” 
Bradley and Claire Rogers see the campus forest as a “classroom” of sorts, too. Bradley said students don’t always want to drive out to the university’s educational farm, and having the natural environment close by to engage students is a plus. 
For now, they plan to wait until the spring to potentially add more bird boxes when woodpeckers are seeking new cavities to use and new homes to find. 
“There’s so much opportunity out here for it to just be better, and that’s what we’re working on,” Bradley said.

(Emily Jones/WABE)This coverage is made possible through a partnership between WABE and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
On the outskirts of Savannah, Georgia, a line of large chest coolers waits outside Wise Brothers Processing. Inside them, skinned deer lie packed in ice, ready to be cut into cubes, ground up, or made into sausage, depending on the customer’s order. Once ready, the meat is wrapped and placed in the freezer for the hunters to take back home.
This is all pretty standard for deer hunters, the way animals they shoot become meat to feed their families. But a lot of this meat isn’t going back to the hunters who brought it — it’s bound for a soup kitchen in the heart of Savannah.
“The charity that we use, they feed 250-plus people, three times a day,” said Debra Wise, who runs the business along with the rest of her family. They’ve sent 500 pounds of ground venison to Old Savannah City Mission so far this year, she said.
The Wises are taking part in the Georgia Wildlife Federation’s Hunters for the Hungry program. Georgia hunters are allowed to kill up to 12 deer in a year, but many don’t have the freezer space to keep them all or don’t need that much meat to feed their families. Hunters for the Hungry allows them to donate the extra. The state recently increased funding to $350,000 annually, allowing the program to expand from six processors to 56 and add freezer trailers to store additional meat. This year, the program has set a goal of collecting 140,000 pounds of donations, which the state Department of Natural Resources estimates can feed 560,000 people.
“They reached out to us and asked us if we would be interested in accepting the deer for the hunter program, and of course we jumped right on it,” Wise said. “Anything to help someone out, we’re all about it.”
Each processor donates the meat and distributes it within their local community. Hunters for the Hungry isn’t specifically designed to address rural hunger, and some meat — including the Wise Brothers’ — goes to city-based charities. But since most processors are located out in the country, where the hunting is, a lot of the donations end up staying there. 
Across Georgia, nearly 15% of families are food insecure, meaning they have limited or uncertain access to adequate food, according to Feeding America. Some of the highest rates are in rural counties. Rural Hancock County, nestled between Atlanta and Augusta, has the highest rate in the country of children facing food insecurity, at 47%. Nationwide, 86% of counties with the highest food insecurity rates are rural.
The hunger rates in rural areas stand in contrast to the amount of food produced there. For example, in Georgia agriculture is the biggest industry. The state is first in the country for broiler chickens, hatching eggs and peanuts, and produces significant amounts of beef, dairy, corn and blueberries. But most of that food is produced at a large scale to supply the wider U.S. food system, going to processors and distributors before reaching grocery stores, which means the majority of people who grow food and farm animals have to rely on grocery stores to buy their food just like people in big cities. 
“Not every county or not every region has all these different products, so we rely on a food system that is able, through processing and retail, to combine all these products for the benefit of consumers,” said University of Georgia professor Vanessa Shonkwiler, who studies local food systems. “But then back to our rural food insecurity — this food system is not necessarily able to reach everyone.”
Collective reliance on that system also means impacts of climate change — even in other parts of the country or elsewhere in the world — can further undermine food security by disrupting supply chains and making prices more volatile. 
“There’s not necessarily a recipe that we can apply here and there,” Shonkwiler said. Because people are so spread out in rural areas, she added, typical solutions like food pantries aren’t always effective.
“One size doesn’t fit all. And it’s really the collaboration between different entities that makes it work or doesn’t,” Shonkwiler said.
Nonprofits, churches, universities and other groups have taken many approaches to rural hunger. Some of Shonkwiler’s students recently conducted feasibility studies of different models, including a small neighborhood grocery store and a mobile grocery truck. Some nonprofits actually run small grocery stores. Another organization Shonkwiler works with is preparing to try out a model that’s worked in Europe, in which a self-service grocery store is set up in a shipping container for people to access essentials without the added expense of staffing.
The common thread to efforts that succeed, Shonkwiler said, is the level of buy-in from local leaders and the community, who need to be invested in the solution for it to work.
But even working models are now struggling after the 43-day government shutdown halted funding that food-aid organizations count on. “It’s directly the survival of the nonprofit here that is at stake,” Shonkwiler said.
Some have had to shut down stores or programs that serve rural Georgia, at least temporarily, so they can keep feeding people in the long term. Other federal funding cuts have hit rural food programs, too. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Childcare Access and Nutrition Systems grant program, for instance, funded a food bank, a farmers market, a mobile kitchen and other programs in rural southwest Georgia — but it was canceled earlier this year, according to Georgia U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff’s office.
For people in food deserts, living at least 10 miles from any supermarket and struggling to make ends meet, that means resources they’ve come to count on may not be available this holiday season.
But rural Georgians are finding other ways to help each other out. Beyond the state-sponsored Hunters for the Hungry program, Wise Brothers Processing often donates meat to families in need. Recently, Wise said, a local church contacted them about a family with a sick child who needed some help. They’ve sent the family venison and plan to send more soon.
“That brings joy to our hearts, to know that we’re able to help someone else when we’ve had to have help before, too,” Wise said. “It’s just, you know, the Lord has blessed us, and we’d like to bless in return.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/hunters-4-hungry-georgia-1024x768.webp,,,2025-12-25 05:11:47.194737

We cover public officials’ actions — the bills they propose, debate, and pass (or don’t pass), as well as the trials they hold, the lawsuits they file, and the elections they win or lose. 
But we also tell the stories of Connecticut residents.
That storytelling can take several forms. Sometimes, it’s a story about how an old or new law is affecting people’s lives. Other times, it’s a quirky, under-the-radar story about life in our state that may or may not have a direct tie to public policy.
Our top 10 stories this year, defined by engaged minutes — the total amount of time people spent reading them — exemplify that mix. The list includes part of an investigation that led to legislative change, the verdict in a high-profile trial, practical information about energy charges and new laws, and a feature on the nation’s oldest public ferry.
As 2025 comes to a close, we hope you enjoy looking back at the stories that readers spent the most time with this year.

They’re carrying worries about rent, utilities, health insurance, groceries, and whether their paycheck will last through the month. These pressures aren’t abstract. They shape daily decisions for families trying to stay afloat in an increasingly expensive state.
At the same time, New Hampshire is navigating major fiscal choices that will determine whether essential services remain stable or become harder to sustain. Those decisions often happen quietly, but their consequences show up quickly in places like child care programs.
From inside a nonprofit child care setting, the disconnect is hard to miss. I work closely with educators and families who are living these pressures every day. Child care is a labor-intensive, essential service that keeps the workforce moving. Programs operate on razor-thin margins, employ dozens of workers, and support hundreds of families who rely on stable, affordable care in order to work.
Yet child care providers are frequently told that broad economic strategies, particularly those focused on reducing business costs, will eventually benefit workers and families. On the ground, that promise hasn’t materialized.
For most child care programs, marginal financial relief does not translate into meaningful change. It doesn’t allow programs to hire additional staff, raise wages, expand capacity, or lower tuition. Staffing costs drive child care expenses, and unlike large corporations, programs can’t absorb losses or offset them elsewhere. Families, meanwhile, are already stretched to their limit.
New Hampshire has pursued business-friendly fiscal policies for years, yet affordability has only grown worse. Housing costs continue to rise. Workforce shortages persist. Child care remains scarce and expensive. The benefits of these policies have flowed unevenly, while the strain on essential services has intensified.
When state revenue declines or becomes less predictable, the impact doesn’t disappear. It shows up in communities, in municipalities, and in the programs families depend on. Funding uncertainty makes it harder to sustain child care scholarships, workforce supports, and other systems that allow parents to stay employed and children to thrive.
In child care programs across the state, the consequences are already visible. Parents worry about whether they can afford another year of care. Educators love their work but struggle to keep up with rising rents and everyday costs. Programs are forced into impossible decisions that affect staff retention, enrollment, and long-term viability.
That instability doesn’t strengthen the economy — it weakens it.
When child care becomes less accessible or less reliable, parents can’t work consistently. When parents can’t work, employers lose staff. Communities lose services. And working people end up paying more, often through higher costs and higher property taxes.
A strong economy isn’t built on hope or trickle-down assumptions. It’s built on smart, balanced investments in the systems that allow people to participate fully in the workforce. Child care, housing, health care, and education are not side issues; they are economic infrastructure.
From my vantage point inside a nonprofit child care program, the connection is clear. Our economy depends on whether families can access care and whether the workforce providing that care can afford to stay. Fiscal decisions that overlook this reality risk deepening the very affordability crisis they claim to address.
If we want a stable workforce and strong communities, we must evaluate economic choices through the lens of the people and systems that hold everything together.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/childcareinvestment-1024x695.jpeg,,,2025-12-25 05:11:47.194737

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)As people who are close to the news, like myself and the other members of the Maine Morning Star team, 2025 was, to put it bluntly, a lot. But it is our life’s work to take in that flood of updates and information and present it in a way that is useful and hopefully engaging.
Reflecting on the year behind us, and bracing for what’s to come, I asked the reporters — Emma Davis, AnnMarie Hilton and Eesha Pendharkar — about what they saw as the biggest stories of the year, and also the reporting that gave them joy and helped fuel their drive to keep going.
Several themes emerged for them this year, namely economic issues and how changes at the federal level were compounding challenges for people in Maine. 
“I feel like I didn’t go more than two days without writing about energy prices or anything energy-cost related,” said Hilton.
Stories about the price of power ran the gamut, from Central Maine Power’s proposed rate hike and the public opposition to it, to extensive legislative debate over reforming the state’s net energy billing program, to President Donald Trump’s halt of offshore wind development. 
Reporting on how Mainers are coping with rising energy costs, Hilton said one of the questions that often arises is how states are balancing the need to transition away from fossil fuels and adhere to their climate goals while considering the cost to ratepayers — particularly as the federal government has increasingly pulled back from helping subsidize low-emission technologies and the expansion of renewable energy.
“Cost of living is such a driver for people’s politics right now,” Hilton said, pointing out that many people “are turning to politicians because they want answers and they want help, and so it’s become such a political thing because they are looking to them to solve that problem.” 
Similarly, Pendharkar noted that even the most local stories this year seemed to be driven, at least in part, by the actions of the Trump administration and how those have “trickled down to Maine.”
With her focus on health care and education, among other beats, she’s reported extensively on cuts to Medicaid and other changes that will dramatically increase the cost of health care for many Mainers. She also pointed to other federal changes, such as ongoing threats to food aid and proposed cuts to housing funds, and noted how these often have a compounding effect.
This is even the case for issues and stories that are more insulated from federal changes. For example, the use of restraint and seclusion in Maine schools — which Pendharkar examined in a series produced as part of a fellowship with the University of Southern California Center for Health Journalism — is exacerbated by a lack of special education services, which have been cut by the U.S. Department of Education.
“There’s just an intentional effort on the federal level to move away from providing supports to people who most need it and I think those stories reflect that shift and how we are coping with those services being taken away,” Pendharkar said. 
This year, a large part of our role as journalists has been to “pick and choose for readers what is important, to pay attention to the implications, to continue to press officials in terms of what’s happening, and hopefully overall to be able to cut through the noise and present stories for people that actually provide clarity and help in some way,” said Davis. 
Davis has closely followed both the debate about immigration enforcement in Maine, as well as what it looks like on the ground. For example, Davis developed a relationship with Wells Police Chief Jo-Ann Putnam, who explained why she elected for Wells to be the only agency in the state to sign a contract with immigration authorities (which was later rescinded after public outcry). Davis said this “gave our readers unique insight into the department’s thinking about the partnership.”
Davis also broke the news that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had cut $5 million in grants to research per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) mitigation. Her reporting also highlighted how the federal agency had given conflicting reasons as to why it canceled the funding, some of which was awarded to the Mi’kmaq Nation and Passamaquoddy Tribe. U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree cited her coverage when pressing the EPA administrator on the issue.
These stories and others show how our specific focus on state policy can “paint a better picture for people” who are trying to keep up with all the news and changes coming from the federal government. 
Favorite stories
It’s hard to reflect on this past year in Maine without thinking about the state’s ongoing conflict with the White House in regards to the rights of transgender students.
With her background as a national reporter for EdWeek focused on diversity and inclusion, Pendharkar was well-suited to take it on. And while many stories focused on the Trump administration’s various investigations and threats, as well as the legislative debate, Pendharkar said one of her favorite stories of the year featured the voices of trans students who showed up at the State House last spring to protest and speak out against a slate of bills that sought to roll back their access to sports and other rights. 
Pendharkar said it allowed Maine Morning Star “to put real faces on the issue of trans students being attacked and they were able to stand up there and say what that means to them.”
Asked her favorite story of the year, Hilton also pointed to a piece she did that highlighted the person at the heart of a policy debate.
Since Arthur Bernard lost his son Arthur Strout in the 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston, he dedicated his life to advocating for tougher gun laws in Maine. His drive helped lead the successful grassroots effort to pass a red flag law at the ballot box in November. After Bernard was honored by the Maine Gun Safety Coalition, Hilton had a conversation with him during which he reflected on that work and what he still hopes to accomplish. 
Reflecting on the stories she’s told this year, Davis said she enjoyed travelling to Caribou to report on one of Graham Platner’s town hall-style meetings, during which he made a direct appeal to U.S. Sen. Susan Collins’ former neighbors and others about how they are thinking about the political novice who is challenging Maine’s longtime senior senator. 
Next year’s Senate election, including Platner’s primary race against Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, “shows we are at a really interesting point in time in our political discourse — or reckoning,” Davis said.  
“Getting to hear directly from people about why they are still attracted to him despite the controversies, or how they are thinking about who they want to lead next and what type of leadership they want to see,” she said, will be a major story carrying into next year.
While Maine’s U.S. Senate race and 2nd Congressional District election to replace outgoing U.S. Rep. Jared Golden will capture national attention, Pendharkar noted that the race for governor is also going to be “pivotal.” 
The Democratic stronghold has “helped buffer Mainers from many impacts of federal policy,” but with an open race for Mill’s seat, as well as many tight legislative races, that could change. 
We wrap up the year with a lot of questions about the direction of the state and nation, as well as what will be done to ensure people in Maine can afford to stay healthy and keep the lights on. But we look forward to hearing from our readers, telling your stories, and doing our best to inform and educate about how the decisions made in the halls of power carry into your day to day.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MtBattyStar-scaled-e1766076781581-1024x729.jpeg,,,2025-12-25 04:57:01.750785

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)There’s a reason Ebenezer Scrooge hovers over Christmas.
English author Charles Dickens created the miserable skinflint back in 1843 for “A Christmas Carol,” the novella that has spawned too much cultural detritus to estimate. Scrooge persists because he’s the way so many people feel about the holiday, if you caught them away from family or friends.
Sometimes, you don’t want to be merry. Sometimes, you don’t want to celebrate with your coworkers. Sometimes you want to pull your coat around yourself, hurry home and eat soup in front of a roaring fire before heading to bed.
I bet that sounds like the perfect Christmas to some of my readers this morning. Depending on the year, it might sound that way to me.
The joy of Christmas, of course, is that we don’t have to experience it alone if we don’t want to. We can meet with family and friends or attend community gatherings. The holiday lives within the connections that we make.
Yet Scrooge stands for more than isolation, I think. He represents a certain perverse joy in refusing to be indoctrinated with seasonal frivolity. Maybe Christmas carols make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. Maybe you would rather eat Chinese takeout than prepare a sumptuous turkey dinner. In which case, you can join Ebenezer with a hearty, “Bah, humbug!”
Frankly, I’m ready to yell “Bah, humbug” at much of the world after this past year. Let’s never do this again, 2025.


 
Remember, Scrooge’s sin in Dickens’ story doesn’t have much to do with the holiday of Christmas itself. The day serves as a signpost in a time travel story. The heartless businessman has undervalued the people around him and the difference they make to the world.
You could learn exactly the same lesson on Arbor Day, if you wanted. And you won’t have to eat eggnog or mess with mistletoe, either.
Finally, you just have to hand it to Scrooge: He was a Victorian diva. No one without theatrical flair would declare: “If I could work my will, every idiot who goes about with ‘Merry Christmas’ on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!”
Tell me you wouldn’t want to get together with Scrooge and hate-watch some reality TV. He would be a natural. Either at that or lambasting enemies on social media.
Yes, yes, I understand. Scrooge needed to treat poor Bob Cratchit better. Yet PolitiFact crunched the numbers back in 2022 and found that “Cratchit was making far more than the average worker in London during the Victorian era.” His 15 shillings a week work out to about $21.44 an hour, one expert said.
Vindication for misunderstood Ebenezer, I say. He wanted to make some money and be left alone with his ghost friends.
Anyway, I’ve taken enough of your time this morning. You have family to wake, presents to open, food to make and share. But if you have a Scrooge in your life — or if you perhaps embody some Scrooge-like tendencies — don’t fret. Christmas has places for the happy and grumpy among us alike.
He can eat at his own table if he causes too much trouble.

Legislative sessions are rough whenever state government is short of money, and Nebraska spent the last legislative session checking couch cushions. 
The state’s projected budget deficit sits at $471 million, pretty close to the $500 million target for spending cuts set by Gov. Jim Pillen.
This budget-cutting session starts a political year in which Nebraska could see competitive races for Congress in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District and the U.S. Senate, plus the possibility of a 2026 rematch from the 2022 GOP primary for governor.
Nebraskans don’t need reminding of what happens when elected leaders need to goose supporters to show up. Many can close their eyes and hear the familiar promises of property tax relief offset with loosely defined cuts to waste and fraud.
But stop before we reach the point when political interests align into camps that argue who will be the losers of what they will again describe as a zero-sum game. One that often isn’t. 
Take a deep breath and relax.

Wes Moore has made housing a focus of his administration, repeatedly citing the state's 96,000-unit housing shortage.

Wes Moore's favorite statistics is the state's 96,000-unit housing shortage, but analysts and advocates say the number is more complicated than it seems at first blush. (File photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Since he took office in 2023, Gov. Wes Moore (D) has made housing a focus of his administration, and nearly every speech, proclamation and press release since then has featured the state’s 96,000-unit housing shortage.
Does that mean there are 96,000 unhoused people in the state? Hardly. The number is the end product of a complicated formula that measures “latent demand” for housing, but analysts say it’s a solid number and a good starting point for discussions on the issue.
“These are regional measures of housing ecosystems,” said Anjali Kolachalam, policy manager for Up for Growth, a nationwide nonprofit that focuses on easing the far-reaching housing crisis through new housing development.
“What it doesn’t mean is that you can look out your window and see hundreds of thousands of people unhoused … that there are 100,000 people on the streets of Maryland waiting for a house.”
The number comes from Up For Growth’s Housing Underproduction Report. The organzation released the 2025 Housing Underproduction Report late last month, which nudged Moore’s favorite statistic down slightly, from a 96,000-unit shortage for the 2023 report to a 94,000-unit housing shortage for 2025.
The report compares available housing units to the “latent demand” of housing in a region, based on the housing market, Kolachalam explains.
“Underproduction is basically a measure of ‘housing you have’ and ‘housing you need,’” she said. “The ‘housing you have’ is basically the existing housing units, second and vacation homes and uninhabitable units. These are units that are currently renter or owner occupied, or they couldn’t be inhabited anyways.”
“Housing you need” reflects demand and includes households that “should have formed but didn’t” due to high housing costs or lack of options, she said.
High housing costs are driving people out of Maryland, new state report finds

“Missing households is basically a measure of latent demand,” Kolachalam said. “Latent demand is represented by kids who can’t move out of their parents’ place. Or, people who have more than one roommate when maybe they are looking to live alone because they are a little bit older.”
In the 2025 analysis, Up for Growth determined that nationwide housing underproduction reached 3.78 million units, according to the most recent report reflecting 2023 data. That’s a decrease from the previous report, which found a 3.85 million unit underproduction nationally. Underproduction peaked during the 2021 housing market at 3.89 million units.
The report shows a similar decrease in Maryland over the last two years. The 2023 Housing Underproduction Report shows that Maryland faced an underproduction of 96,000 units in 2021, which is the figure used in a recent executive order Moore issued to reduce administrative hurdles for new development to address the “shortage of at least 96,000 housing units.”
It may seem like an improvement to Maryland’s housing supply, but analysts warn that tracking “housing underproduction” is a complicated data point.
A reduced number does not always mean that more houses have been built, though that could be a factor, the report notes. In some metro areas, such as Baltimore, reduced underproduction could indicate a decrease in demand as people leave those areas for more affordable locations.
“The modest improvement in regional housing market conditions can be linked to concurrent increases in supply and reductions in demand in urban centers,” the report said. “At the same time, housing starts and unit deliveries were strong across many of those same metro areas. High levels of permitting activity in 2022 … ushered in a 15-year production high of single-family detached homes and the highest new apartment construction since 1987.”
A recent report from the Comptroller’s office reported that from 2010 to 2023, Maryland saw 2.3 million residents move to other states. In the report, Comptroller Brooke Lierman said that outmigration is a symptom of the state’s housing affordability crisis.
The Moore administration is not taking any victory laps yet.
“The decrease of 2,000 units estimated by the report is a statistically insignificant change in a statewide context,” said a statement from the Department of Housing and Community Development. “More critical to evaluate is our current rate of housing production. At this rate, Maryland’s 94,000-unit shortage would take another 50 years to address.
Need for speed: Executive order aims to reduce administrative hurdles to new housing

“Next week, the Department will publish housing production targets for the State of Maryland that will estimate the needed production rate to solve the state’s housing shortage,” the statement said.
Regardless, housing affordability still tops the list as the No. 1 concern from Maryland voters, with nearly a quarter saying it is the biggest problem facing the state, according to polling by the Maryland Association of Realtors. It said one in three Maryland families are cost-burdened by their monthly rent or mortgage payment, including 52% of Maryland renters who pay more than 30% of their income on rent.
Meanwhile, there’s debate on how useful tracking underproduction is as a data point, as state officials, developers and advocates work to tackle housing unaffordability in the state.
“The 96,000-unit housing shortage figure is a useful starting point,” said Aaron Greenfield, director of government affairs with the Maryland Multi-Housing Association, in a written statement. He noted that Maryland has a “significant supply deficiency.”
“It helps highlight the scale of the challenge, but it does not fully capture the complexity of Maryland’s housing needs, particularly in the rental housing market,” he said. “While 96,000 units communicates the magnitude of the problem, Maryland must focus not only on the total number but also on ensuring we can actually deliver the right mix of housing across income levels.”
Matt Losak, executive director of the Montgomery County Renters Alliance, says that while looking at the state’s “underproduction” metric may help with future planning of housing needs, it does “nothing” to make housing more affordable for those struggling now.
“They’re talking about folks who would move here in the future in anticipating the growth of our population,” Losak said. “They have nothing to do with protecting or preserving the affordability and quality and stability of existing households.”
Losak and other renter advocates support policies such as “good cause evictions” and rent stabilization to help keep people comfortably housed in the state. He is skeptical of having a singular focus on building new units.
“There is a theory that we can build our way out of the unaffordability and instability, but that theory is pockmarked with numerous holes,” he said. “The landlord-developer industry is not going to build their way out of profits … While we have no problem with people building more housing, more types of housing, we just don’t believe that policy is a substitute for renter protections.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC01957-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-25 02:56:46.643234

(Photo via Discover Martin County)Dear Santa,
I know you’re already in the air delivering gifts around the world, but I hope you’ve got an emergency miracle stuffed in your big bag. Our Florida state parks could sure use your help.
You generally reserve your presents for boys and girls whose goodness is worth rewarding. Trust me when I tell you the parks are reeeeeeally good. They’re incredibly popular, drawing 28 million visitors every year and generating $75 million in revenue. Plus, they’ve won national awards four times, more than any other state park system.
Yet they’ve been treated oh so badly by the people in charge of Florida.
Last year our Duffer-in-Chief, Gov. Ron DeSantis, tried to put golf courses, hotels, and pickleball courts in several of the parks. In the uproar that ensued, the Legislature passed a law that said no governor could do something so stupid ever again. That wasn’t the exact wording, but it was certainly the intent.
The Legislature also told the Department of Environmental Protection to compile a list of all the things that the parks DO need. We finally got the DEP report, Santa, and it’s a doozy.
“Florida state parks face $759 million backlog of needed repairs, state report finds,” read the headline in the Tampa Bay Times story.
The money is needed to “address aging infrastructure, safety improvements, accessibility upgrades and modernization of essential facilities such as restrooms, trails, utilities and visitor centers across Florida’s 175 state parks,” the DEP report says. (It’s actually 176, but who’s counting?)
Santa, I read the report and said that word that gets Ralphie in so much trouble in “A Christmas Story.” No, not fudge.
Reading the report was like seeing an online review of a once-great hotel that’s gone to seed. The elevators get stuck, the kitchen constantly runs out of crucial ingredients, and the bathroom plumbing backs up once a week.
The list of what’s in need of repair includes the parks’ visitor centers, cabins, pavilions, boardwalks, fences, restrooms, boat ramps — you name it. Not to mention trying to protect or improve the water quality in the springs, rivers, lakes, and beaches owned by us taxpayers.
I’m not going to tell you that everything in the report is the gospel truth. For instance, I noticed that for the state’s most popular park, Honeymoon Island in Gov. DeSantis’ hometown of Dunedin, the report says the campsites need repair. Honeymoon Island is a wonderful place to visit, but only during the day. It has no campground.
Nevertheless, enough of the report is so dead on that I think it should be required reading for everyone who has any control over the state’s purse strings. Santa, this is such an emergency, I’m ready to dial both 911 and the law offices of Morgan & Morgan.
Susannah Randolph via Sierra Club
Instead of regarding the report’s findings as a staggering burden, though, “this is a real opportunity,” said Sierra Club Florida Chapter Director Susannah Randolph, — no, not Rudolph, Santa, I said RANdolph.
Her organization is lobbying for the state to start filling all these needs like an empty stocking hanging from the mantle. To make this wish come true, Mr. Kringle, may require a miracle or two.
Now the question is: Will the nitwits who let Florida’s greatest treasures get so terribly tarnished be willing to spend the money to polish them back to a bright shine?
Tell me you closed it
Santa, did you know that Florida’s state park system is a wild wonder? It gives us a glimpse of what the state looked like before so much ugly sprawl paved over everything.
You should come check it out once you’re done with your worldwide run. Replace your toasty red suit with a vented fishing shirt, some cargo shorts, and flip-flops. You can choose from sites spanning nearly 800,000 acres and go camping, hiking, biking, canoeing, kayaking, or simply gazing in open-mouthed wonder.
There’s also plenty of quirky kitsch, as befits a Florida institution. What other state can claim to have a park employing a school of professional mermaids like Weeki Wachee Springs State Park?
Weeki Wachee mermaids via Visit Florida
The first Florida state parks that preserved natural sites date to the 1930s. They were not created out of some grand vision to attract tourists. They were make-work projects for the Civilian Conservation Corps, an agency that was part of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal to beat the Great Depression. The work turned out pretty well, if you ask me.
Those first parks, including Hillsborough River State Park, Highlands Hammock State Park, and Myakka River State Park, are all still amazing places to visit. These are all gifts from the past for us modern-day Floridians, a reminder of what our state once looked like.
With the state’s oldest parks nearing the century mark, you’d think the state would be sprucing everything up for the celebration like the buffers, stuffers, and stylists of Oz prepping Dorothy and her pals to meet the Wizard.
Alas, Santa, some of the best parts of the parks are closed for repairs or replacement and have been for some time.
Take, for instance, the Hobe Mountain Tower in Jonathan Dickinson State Park — the park near Hobe Sound where, just last year, the governor wanted to build not one, not two, but THREE golf courses.
The 27-foot tower sits atop an ancient sand dune that rises 86 feet above sea level. Thanks to that impressive elevation, it provides some of the greatest views anywhere in our flat-as-Flat-Stanley state.
But the tower has been shut down since last year. That’s when an engineer’s report spelled out how badly deteriorated it had become.
“The report documented the rot in the wooden parts and rust in the steel parts,” said Jim Howe, president of the Friends of Jonathan Dickinson State Park. “Many bolts have rusted to the point they no longer provide real connection.”
Howe told me he read the engineer’s report sitting in the park manager’s office. Halfway through, Howe said, he looked up at the park manager and said, “Tell me you’ve closed it.”
The manager replied, “The minute I finished reading that.”
The friends group has been trying to raise the money to tear down the old tower and build a replacement. So far, they’ve collected about $25,000, Howe said. That’s not nearly enough.
“I think when it’s all done it may be a half million or more,” he told me.
Gee Santa, wouldn’t it be nice if, instead of trying to put golf courses in there, the state instead paid to put up a new tower?
How we got here
Now Santa, you may be wondering: How did we manage to let our parks get into such sorry shape?
Matt Caldwell via Florida State Parks Association
When I asked Florida State Parks Foundation president Matt Caldwell that question, he was quick to blame our recent spate of storms with names like Matthew, Ian, Helene, and Milton.
“A lot of our parks were right on the front lines for impact from the hurricanes,” the former legislator told me. Repairing the damage from those impacts took precedence over the routine maintenance and additional expansion, he said.
As always when the subject involves parks, I contacted Eric Draper, a Florida native who served as Florida state parks director from 2017 until 2021.
To Draper, one of the signs that we have serious problems is the amount of work that the staff’s own cabins and offices need. Nearly every page of the DEP report names staff housing as derelict and in need of repair.
Eric Draper. when he was Florida State Parks director, via Eric Draper
Year after year, Draper said, the staff would ask for money to make the repairs and improvements mentioned in the DEP report. Year after year, he said, the money they needed was not forthcoming from the Legislature.
I suspect the problem was that our fine legislators misconstrued what state park funding stood for. They looked at it as a sop to the environmentalists, never a favored group with our lawmakers. The greens never bring them enough green, if you know what I mean.
But that’s like thinking that only members of the local Tourism Development Council care about tourism. Lots of businesses depend on tourism to meet their bottom lines, and the same is true for the parks. Lots of businesses depend on it.
I think the legislators should have grasped that by fixing the parks, they would be employing ecology to boost our economy. The parks are a major tourist draw. Keeping them in good working order ensures the tourists have a good experience and are likely to come back.
Do the folks at Disney or Universal let those attractions fall into disrepair? They do not.
But we have, and now the bill has come due.
What happens next
The big question, Santa, is whether our elected leaders will take this report as a road map to fix the problem. Or will they ignore it, the way they did the scientific report on how to clean up our toxic algae bloom problem.
The sponsor of the bill that called for the report says she’s ready to get to work on its findings.
State Sen. Gayle Harrell via Florida Senate
“This gives us the basis to start planning and putting resources into our parks,” state Sen. Gayle Harrell, R-Stuart, told the Times. “It’s a first step to making sure our parks remain the best in the country, and it gives us a starting point.”
We shall soon see if she’s able to build enough support to start paying for some of the necessary work. Remember, though, that in the session that happened earlier this year, the Legislature didn’t want to spend more than a mere $15 million on park facilities improvement.
They also went back on their word from the year before and repealed a requirement that the millions of dollars rolling in from Seminole sports gambling would be spent on buying property that needed to be preserved.
Meanwhile, the legislators enabled a Louisiana developer to get an $83 million payday for 4 acres of land in Destin that wasn’t on anybody’s preservation list. Paying a campaign contributor was worth more to them than rebuilding our broken parks. Does that make any sense to you? Me neither.
There is one bright spot in all this, and in a most unlikely place.
I know you’re probably planning to dump 16 tons of coal at the Governor’s Mansion. He’s certainly due some serious payback for siphoning millions from needy kids to pay political consultants. But hold up a second.
I don’t know how you did it, Santa — did you send the Ghost of Christmas Past? The Ghost of Christmas Present? The Ghost of No Political Future? Whatever you did, it worked. Gov. DeSantis recently announced he’s proposing $50 million to be spent on the state parks facilities in 2026.
“That’s a big ask,” Draper told me.
Randolph of the Sierra Club took DeSantis’ support for a good sign too, and said, “We’re going to push it all the way.”
So, Santa, I hope you can bring our current crop of lawmakers the intestinal fortitude to follow Harrell’s lead and start fixing the parks. A new spine and a noisy conscience would help, too. Fixing this park repair backlog would be the greatest gift you could give all 23 million of us Floridians.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hobe-Mountain-boardwalk-via-Discover-Martin-County-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-25 00:11:47.203562

(Photo by Fiordaliso/Getty Stock Images)Their complaints are often ignored or brushed aside, but fibromyalgia sufferers see some hope in a recent court ruling that Social Security Administration officials were wrong to discount an Anne Arundel County woman’s description of the suffering the condition caused her.
Crystal Hultz was first denied Social Security disability benefits back in 2014. Throughout her many attempts to challenge the decision, administrative law judges believed her subjective testimony was not properly supported by medical evidence.
But in a Dec. 15 opinion,  a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that in cases where there are no objective medical tests or markers to identify debilitating conditions, like fibromyalgia, subjective testimony must have more weight.
“This case is about crediting a patient’s accounts of the chronic, debilitating, and little-understood illness fibromyalgia,” Circuit Judge Roger L. Gregory wrote in the opinion.
“Fibromyalgia is a serious and mysterious condition, disproportionately affecting women, that our current science is incapable of observing through objective medical testing. Accordingly, we must give due weight to Ms. Hultz’s subjective testimony about the severity of her symptoms,” Gregory wrote.
He said the administrative law judges and lower courts that supported the initial denial were wrong to disregard her struggle with fibromyalgia, reversed the denial and sent the case back for administrators to calculate Hultz’s benefits.
Jeffrey R. Scholnick, the attorney representing Hultz, said she cried on the phone when he called her last week about the ruling.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I called her on Monday and said, ‘Congratulations, people believe you now,’” he said in a recent interview.
Scholnick said the ruling will help other people get disability benefits when they are struggling with debilitating conditions that cannot be detected through definitive medical tests.
“It’s the nature of this disease (fibromyalgia). Because people don’t see it, they don’t believe you,” he said.
Hultz is one of about 4 million people in the United States who struggle with fibromyalgia, a condition that causes pain all over the body, and can lead to fatigue as well as emotional and mental distress, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Diagnosing fibromyalgia largely relies on a patient’s subjective description of symptoms, as there are no medical tests that can objectively confirm the condition.
Hultz’s symptoms began in 2013, severely limiting her ability to work. She applied for disability the next year.
According to court documents, fibromyalgia and lupus interfered with her ability to do daily tasks, such as “opening jars, handwriting, turning keys, preparing meals, performing heavy household chores, accomplishing yard work, and carrying heavier objects with the hand that suffered from pain and numbness.”
After appealing the initial denial in 2014, what followed was a series of court hearings, denials and appeals spanning over a decade.
Throughout the process, administrative law judges disregarded fibromyalgia as a feature of her disability. One judge omitted the condition entirely when denying her benefit, and one physician consulted for Hultz’s case believed she had a “component of ‘malingering.’”
Lynne Kennedy Matallana, CEO and founder of the National Fibromyalgia Association, said that people in Hultz’s situation often get “lost in the system” and can give up trying to seek out disability benefits.
“We still have situations where the diagnosis of fibromyalgia and the understanding of it continues to be debated,” she said. “Those of us dealing with it are initially in such horrible straits, because we went from living very happy lives and being able to take care of families and things to all of a sudden having an illness.
“There are those people, like this woman, that get lost in the system and never get the help that they need,” Matallana said.










Fibromyalgia is a serious and mysterious condition, disproportionately affecting women, that our current science is incapable of observing through objective medical testing. Accordingly, we must give due weight to Ms. Hultz’s subjective testimony about the severity of her symptoms.


– U.S. 4th Circuit Judge Roger L. Gregory


Meanwhile, other physicians working with Hultz, along with family members, testified that her fibromyalgia led to days of fatigue and pain that often left her bedridden.
Her luck began to change in 2020, when Gregory ruled in a similar case, Arakas v. Commissioner, affirming that Social Security officials must take subjective testimony into account for conditions that do not have a tangible test or medical marker to identify them.
Gregory wrote in Hultz’s case that the court “must be guided by our precedent in Arakas v. Commissioner, which held that ALJs (administrative law judges) may not rely on objective medical evidence even as just one of multiple factors to discount a claimant’s subjective complaints regarding symptoms of fibromyalgia.”
Judge G. Steven Agee agreed with the majority that the administrative law judges in Hultz’s case should have put more weight on her subjective testimony. But in a partial dissent, he said he believed the court went too far in its remedy.
“Rather than simply vacate the ALJ’s decision and remand for reconsideration of Hultz’s claim, it went a step further, opting to outright reverse the ALJ’s decision and deem Hultz entitled to disability benefits in the first instance,” Agee wrote. “In doing so, it departed from the process courts typically employ when an ALJ errs.”
Matallana says it’s important for people with fibromyalgia and other disabilities to push through court challenges to receive benefits.
“I do recommend that people find an attorney who will represent them,” she said. “When you’re sick, you don’t know how to get up the energy and the strength to fight something like this.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1428788053-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 23:56:35.533632

(Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Stock Photo)Maryland lawmakers may again consider legalizing physician-assisted suicide (PAS) this session. Before they do, they should confront an uncomfortable truth: In a state where African Americans already face stark inequalities in health care, PAS, even if intended compassionately, would introduce the power of state-authorized death into a system that has long failed to protect Black Marylanders’ health, dignity and, too often, their lives.
The Maryland Department of Health documents clear and persistent inequalities in health outcomes in this state. Black residents are more likely to die of cancer even though they are less likely than whites to develop it. Black infants die at more than double the rate of white infants. Black mothers die in pregnancy at twice the rate of white mothers. And the proportion of Black physicians in the state is far lower than their share of the population. What happens when we add the power of prescribing death to a health care system that already does not treat all lives equally?
This concern is the subject of my new Maryland Family Institute Research Brief, “Knee on the Neck: Assisted Suicide and the African-American Experience in Maryland.” The title reflects the sober reality: For Black Marylanders, PAS risks magnifying the ultimate outcome under the guise of impartial health care.

African Americans have good reason to be cautious about giving physicians greater authority over life-and-death decisions. Georgetown scholars Patricia King and Leslie Wolf have observed that Black patients “have been abused, neglected and exploited” within American medicine and therefore “have reason to believe that their lives are not valued in the same way as whites.”
That historical memory is not distant. It echoes today in biased diagnostic patterns, under-treated pain and survival gaps across multiple diseases.
PAS does not correct these injustices. It amplifies them.
In states that have legalized PAS, very few physicians are willing to participate.Oregon, the first state to adopt the practice, has roughly 13,000 physicians, yet in a recent year, only 146 wrote any lethal prescriptions. Just 32 doctors wrote most of them, and one doctor wrote 51. When life-ending authority is so concentrated, the biases of a tiny number of persons will dominate its practice. Maryland would be naive to assume that racial prejudice, whether conscious or unconscious, would play no role in determining which patients are encouraged toward death.
PAS can be especially harmful in Black communities, where churches and pastors play a central role in affirming that every life, even in suffering, has God-given worth and dignity. For many African Americans who have spent a lifetime resisting messages of inferiority, a physician’s authoritative suggestion of suicide can easily, if unintentionally, displace the preaching of hope and faith with a darker message: Your life is more burdensome than valuable. Your death may be the more reasonable path.
Maryland need not guess how this plays out. Three decades ago, after extensive review, a bipartisan New York task force unanimously rejected PAS, warning it would be “profoundly  dangerous” for stigmatized populations and impossible to regulate equitably. Maryland’s racial disparities today are no better than New York’s were then. If PAS posed “extraordinary risks” there, it poses equal if not greater risks here.
I write as a sociologist, a married Catholic priest, a father in an interracial family and a lifelong Marylander, formerly living in South Baltimore and now Prince George’s County. We must not adopt a policy that makes premature death the most accessible “treatment option” for those already receiving unequal care. PAS will not bring justice, equality or dignity. It will bring quiet but devastating pressure on those whose lives our health care system already struggles to protect.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2160474864-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 18:57:43.520840

‘Twas the Night Before Christmas

Thank you for letting us tell your stories, Delaware.
’Twas the night before Christmas across the First State,
A few journalists still working, though the hour grew late.
They crafted headlines with thoughtful care,
Finishing articles they were happy to share.
From Newark to Wilmington and old New Castle’s Green,
They had followed angles as a reporting team.
From Dover’s broad stretches to the curve of the bay,
They had tracked every lead throughout the days.
Across towns and counties the year’s stories grew,
With acts of compassion and traditions renewed.
Parades and performances, milestones to cheer,
The voices of neighbors that shaped the year.
Businesses celebrated triumphs and starts,
Libraries and nonprofits opened their hearts.
Families gave deeply, volunteers led the way,
And communities strengthened day after day.
Now Rehoboth lay quiet, the Bandstand at rest,
Lewes’ windows shimmered, holiday-dressed.
Cape Henlopen breezes turned colder and clear,
As beach towns settled at the close of the year.
Through Brandywine Valley where Christmas winds blow,
Greenville kept shining with a welcoming glow.
Hockessin’s houses trimmed in ribbons and pine
Stood peaceful beneath the December moonshine.
In Middletown storefronts glimmered at night,
Lanterns and candles casting warm light.
Smyrna’s bright corners felt merry and fair,
While Milford’s calm river held reflections of care.
Three counties, one mission – to share points of view,
And shine a warm light upon all of you.
As Delawareans settled in for a long cozy rest,
Delaware Live logged off and wished everyone their best.
They whispered to readers, clear, warm, and bright,
“Merry Christmas, First State, and to all a good night.”

(Bella Davis/New Mexico In Depth)Ashley Vance wakes up most mornings surprised by the quiet. No shouting. No searching for a safe couch. No fear of who she might encounter in a crowded shelter. For the first time in years, the 20-year-old trans woman has a door she can lock, a bed that’s hers, a future she can imagine.
But Ashley’s relief is fragile.
Her journey from foster care to shelters to the small housing program helping her today reveals a larger truth: when the child-welfare system stops at the threshold of adulthood, queer and trans youth are often left to find stable housing alone. In all of New Mexico, there are two housing programs built specifically for LGBTQ+ young people, according to Adrien Lawyer, co-Executive Director of the Transgender Resource Center of New Mexico—with limited beds, years-long waitlists, and almost no state funding.

This story originally published on New Mexico In Depth.

“I always knew who I was, so I always thought of myself as a girl,” Vance said. She was still just a kid—at 10 years of age, meant to be worrying about homework and friends—when she began her transition. By 11, her home life had become unstable, and a teacher contacted the state’s Children, Youth and Families Department (CYFD) after growing concerned about her well-being.The agency tried sending her back home, but after she ran away several times, they conceded she needed a safer place.
What followed, though, was a different kind of instability.
“Every time I got used to a place, CYFD would move me again. I never had time to settle. I never had time to be a kid,” she said. Some homes were crowded, others unwelcoming, and she often hid who she was to avoid trouble.
At 15, the state referred her to Casa Q, a housing program in Albuquerque for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer teens with nowhere else to go. For several years, it offered her a kind of predictability she needed: meals with housemates, weekly outings, adults who understood what it meant to be queer. “It was the first place where I felt seen,” she said.
The names and pronouns of staff members are listed on a wall at Casa Q. (Bella Davis/New Mexico In Depth)
That stability ended the day she turned 18 and, due to state rules, her placement ended automatically. New Mexico is considered “top five” in the nation for LGBTQ+ legal protections, with state policies that affirm transgender residents, according to Lawyer. Yet the state’s legal protections don’t help young queer adults aging out of foster care find safe living spaces.
After leaving Casa Q, Ashley experienced a blur of friends’ couches or city shelters. At one of the city’s largest shelters, she cried every day. “I didn’t feel safe. I had to keep myself quiet about who I was just to make it through the night. When I told people I was trans, that was a mistake,” she said. Even simple acts, like asking for respect, using her correct name and pronouns, or showing her identity, could put her at risk of harassment or exclusion.
Her search for something more than survival eventually led her back to the only programs in the state built specifically for queer and trans young people. Casa Q provided stability when she was a teenager. Casa Lola, another small program painstakingly built by the queer community for LGBTQ+ young adults struggling to access safe and stable housing, now gives her a chance to rebuild what she lost when childhood services ended but adult support never fully appeared.
Behind the Numbers: Youth Left Out
Homelessness in New Mexico has intensified sharply. A statewide annual count in January recorded 4,683 people experiencing homelessness—a more than twofold increase from 2,057 in 2021.
By one recent ranking, New Mexico had roughly 217 homeless individuals per 100,000 residents, placing it among the states with higher rates nationwide.
This year, the annual count identified 428 homeless youth in Albuquerque and 409 elsewhere, for a total of 837 youth statewide. Youth under 18 made up 22% of transitional housing and 17% of emergency shelter residents in Albuquerque, and 38% of transitional housing residents outside the metro.
The count also shows 34 individuals statewide who identify as  transgender, nonbinary, questioning, or other gender identities, but it is unclear how many are youth.
National research suggests these numbers understate the scale of LGBTQ+ youth homelessness.
Covenant House, a national nonprofit helping youth particularly vulnerable to homelessness,  estimates that about 40% of homeless youth in the U.S. identify as LGBTQ+, despite making up a small fraction of the general youth population. LGBTQ+ youth are 120% more likely to experience homelessness than their peers, according to the organization. CYFD has cited the same figures in its “Supporting Youth to Thrive” manual, acknowledging the disproportionate impact on LGBTQ+ young people.
Many end up cycling through shelters or living on the streets.
Finding Safe Harbor
In New Mexico, Casa Q is one of the rare places built to understand the needs of young queer people. The name itself reflects the mission: a safe home, “Casa,” for queer youth, “Q.”
A homeless shelter specifically for LGBTQ+ and youth of color, it serves teens escaping family rejection, homelessness, or violence. Since opening 10 years ago, it has served more than 100 young people, many arriving with nothing: no clothes, no ID, no safe adult to call.
The home is licensed by CYFD, has five bedrooms, and can serve up to eight residents at a time. “There are very few places like this. We’re the only program that’s lasted this long, and the need hasn’t slowed down,” said Executive Director Shannon Darrell.

For many teens, Casa Q is the first place where adults share their lived experience as queer people. Darrell explained, “It makes a difference when young people see themselves in the people supporting them. They feel safer. They open up faster.” Jericha Lee, the program’s director, added, “When I was younger and going through my own challenges, I didn’t have anything like Casa Q. Youth shouldn’t have to choose between a bed and their identity.”
Bella Garnet, a client advocate, said, “Unfortunately, the world is not very kind to members of the queer community, especially the trans community. A lot of our youth come from abusive homes. Their biggest challenge is trust and accepting that someone actually wants to help them.”

Ashley found that trust at Casa Q. “They taught me how to feel safe around people again,” she said.
Support continues long after residents leave. Lee said, “Just like having family, having a support system that never goes away.” Former residents can return for food, hygiene products, or a conversation, keeping a lifeline open well into adulthood.
Bridging to Adulthood
What happens when residents turn 18? Some transition to Casa Q’s Transitional Living Program (TLP), which supports young adults ages 18 to 23 in off-site apartments. Residents gain independence while receiving support with healthcare, employment, and education. They’re expected to maintain a job and savings to cover at least six months of rent.
“We meet them wherever they’re at,” Lee said. “Let’s work on finding you employment. Let’s work on school. If they do not feel prepared, we’ll work on extending it.” Two current TLP residents previously lived at Casa Q as minors.

But the program is small, with a long waitlist. “By the time clients move out, many have aged out or found other programs,” Darrell said. “We need more housing, opportunities, and funding to help these young adults succeed.”
When Ashley reached 18 years of age, there weren’t any openings in the program. But eventually she was able to find a spot at Casa Lola, across town, which operates under the Transgender Resource Center, a statewide organization addressing housing gaps for adults.
Like Casa Q, the name signals its mission: “Casa,” a home; “Lola,” honoring a trans woman who experienced chronic homelessness and died from related health consequences. Lawyer, co-Executive Director, explained, “Even when she finally got help, it was too late. Her story is a reminder of how deadly housing insecurity can be. Casa Lola bridges the gap for people who age out of youth programs or are struggling to find stable housing as adults.”
The house provides six beds, with stays up to two years. And it also has a long wait list. Since opening in early 2024, 20 people have stayed at Casa Lola. Three have completed the program and moved into permanent housing, while the others remain in the house or are continuing to work toward long-term stability. Most staff are LGBTQ+, ensuring residents are surrounded by adults who share their identities.
Krys Pomeroy, who works at Casa Lola as a resident assistant, emphasized the sense of community: “A lot of folks who come here have been through places where they weren’t seen, weren’t supported. We provide that sense of family and accountability.”

For Ashley, Casa Lola provides stability after years of uncertainty. “I have a stable living situation, and I’ve always had to be really independent. I never had a place I could call home until programs like this,” she said. “People here get me. They’ve helped me not feel like I have to hide. I feel welcomed, and if I have a bad day, I have people to come home to.”The program has also helped her set concrete goals. “I’m saving 30% of my paycheck, around $150 each time, for things like a car, an apartment, cosmetology school, and finishing my GED. For the first time in a long time, I have goals that make me feel better about myself.”    The Funding Challenge
Casa Lola and Casa Q are part of a fragile spectrum of LGBTQ+ housing. One catches youth before the system fails them; the other bridges the gap into adulthood.
Together, they highlight an urgent need for affirming housing in Albuquerque. There are similar housing programs, like New Day, Crossroads for Women, and Barrett House, but they aren’t specifically designed to be affirming spaces for the LGBTQ+ community.
Sen. Michael Padilla, D-Albuquerque, who was himself a foster youth, said aging out of care is like “the floor falling out from under you.” The stakes are high. “I looked at the data, and 70 to 77% of individuals who have ever been in foster care, and 77% of their children, end up in foster care. There is a perpetual cycle of instability,” he said. “I would say 35 to 40% of aged-out foster youth become homeless before they’re 21.”
Padilla sponsored 2019 legislation creating the state’s Fostering Connections program to help aging-out foster youth a year with housing assistance and educational support, using federal Title IV-E and Chafee Act funds. “The children that are affected by these services don’t have a bunch of high-powered lobbyists running around the Roundhouse,” he said. “I feel like I’m their lobbyist. I’m their person up there.”
But for LGBTQ+ youth specifically, Casa Q and Casa Lola fill a gap that general foster care transition programs don’t address: the need for housing where young people don’t have to hide who they are to stay safe.
Both programs face the same obstacle: funding. Casa Q’s transitional housing program relies on grants and donations. Casa Lola operates primarily through a private gift that enabled the house’s purchase, with staff pursuing grants and other resources.
Lawyer noted the challenge of expansion: “The worst thing for our communities is to say, ‘look at this wonderful thing we made for you,’ only to close it because we couldn’t fund it.”
Despite limited resources, staff continue to stretch their capacity. “It can feel heavy sometimes,” Garnett said. “But being able to be there for them in their darkest moments gives you purpose.”
Vance knows how rare her path has been. She moved from Casa Q to Casa Lola, one of the few in New Mexico to successfully navigate both programs.
But she also knows how easily it could have gone differently. “I think about the people I met in shelters who didn’t make it here,” she said. “A lot of them are still out there.”
Vance can picture a path ahead. But her story underscores what advocates say is urgent: programs like Casa Q and Casa Lola can change a life, but only if a bed is open when a young person needs one.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ashleyvance-copy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 17:58:27.024499

(Courtesy of Anna Keyzer)LINCOLN — A proposal from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services for changes to a Medicaid waiver allowing aging Nebraskans and those with a disability to remain at home is causing panic for some families and caregivers.
The proposal to the state’s Aged and Disabled Waiver would limit the need-determined reimbursable hours of caregivers from a current cap of 112 hours to 70. Of those hours, a paid live-in family caregiver could be reimbursed up to 40 hours, a part of the program with no current cap. 


Aged and Disabled Waiver eligibility

Be eligible for Nebraska Medicaid.
Have a disability or be over the age of 65.
Meet Nursing Facility Level of Care.
Demonstrate need for services.

More information is available here.


The annual costs that Medicaid would reimburse under the waiver would also be limited based on changes in the yearly costs of nursing home care statewide.
“If they truly do this, it’s going to be pretty devastating to our family,” said Anna Keyzer of Lincoln, who has utilized the payments for up to 112 weekly hours to help afford to care for her 21-year-old son, Simon. “I don’t know how anyone would suddenly lose 72 hours’ worth of a paid job and be OK.”
Yearly nursing home costs were $92,438 in the last fiscal year, which ended June 30. Families would need an administrative review once costs reach 150% of the annual cost ($138,657), and families could be paid as much as 175% of the cost of that care ($161,767) if they pass a clinical review from a DHHS team. 
DHHS says the changes are needed to make the program, which splits costs between the state and federal government, fiscally “sustainable.” The state faces a projected $471 million shortfall by mid-2027. Pillen is seeking to cut state spending by $500 million. DHHS is the largest state agency.

‘Pulling their lives apart’
Keyzer adopted Simon from Bulgaria in 2013, just before his 9th birthday. He weighed 18 pounds then and now weighs 72. Keyzer became his caregiver when he turned 19, and the family struggled to find outside options, including some who would quit soon after or leave during a shift. 
Simon has Renpenning syndrome, a rare genetic condition that occurs mostly in males. He is hard of hearing and blind, has auto-aggression, is tube fed and has osteoporosis because of a lack of nutrition when young.
Marie Wohlers of Crawford said her family is reimbursed for 80 weekly hours of family provided care under the AD Waiver to care for her 28-year-old daughter, Michaela. Wohlers noted that in the Nebraska Panhandle, support systems are already fairly limited, and she said families are mindful of rising costs.
“I feel like it’s pulling their lives apart, and with no support systems in place that if this happens, what happens to these individuals?” Wohlers said.










I really, truly hope that they listen to us family members, as caregivers, as taxpayers, that our opinion truly counts, because we are what the State of Nebraska is about.


– Marie Wohlers of Crawford

Michaela has Rett syndrome, a rare genetic neurological disorder that primarily affects females and causes progressive loss of motor skills and language. She is unable to move herself, can’t walk or talk, is tube fed, has severe gastrointestinal issues, is at-risk for pressure sores and has a seizure disorder. 
Wohlers said she and her husband involve Michaela in their Panhandle cow-calf ranching operation as much as possible.
Wohlers worries the proposal puts Michaela and others at a higher risk for poor health or being taken advantage of. Wohlers said the waiver is meant to give individuals a better quality of life.
“I just feel like a lot of these things are going to make things more challenging, and it’s going to limit the quality of life for a lot of individuals,” said Wohlers, a former Crawford school board member.
Those wishing to submit public comments can email dhhs.HCBSPublicComments@Nebraska.gov, fax 402-471-8792 or mail Division of Developmental Disabilities, 301 Centennial Mall South, P.O. Box 95026, Lincoln, NE 68509-5026. DHHS hosted four public forums in mid-December.



Proposed waiver changes

Maximum reimbursable caregiver hours, 112 hours reduced to 70 hours.

No more than 40 hours could be paid to an in-home family caregiver.
An additional 30 hours could be added, but would need to be delivered by someone outside the home.


Maximum reimbursable costs each year are based on yearly nursing home costs, which were $92,438 as calculated by DHHS.

Families would need to undergo an administrative review if costs reach 150% of the annual cost ($138,657).
Families could be paid as much as 175% of the cost of nursing home care if they pass a clinical review from a DHHS team ($161,767).

‘Preserve the program long term’

At an emergency Dec. 19 meeting of the committee, Tony Green, director of the DHHS Division of Developmental Disabilities, said the changes are needed because, for the past 10 years of the program, costs have been “far outpacing” population growth, of 34%. 
More than 10,000 Nebraskans are now using the specific Medicaid waiver, according to DHHS.
DHHS spokesperson Jeff Powell and Green said the waiver’s total costs have increased 322%, from $91 million to $383.6 million (an average of $29.3 million annually). The duo said the individual cost per person has risen 218%, from $14,610 to $46,415 (an average of $3,181 each year).
Green said the Legislature has not provided a budget to support those costs, so DHHS is trying to find an alternative route through the “normal” five-year renewal point.
“It necessitates the state doing something to preserve the program long term, or we would have to implement a waiting list,” Green told the Olmstead Advisory Committee.
One of many Medicaid waivers
Phil Gray, second vice president for the Arc of Nebraska, a statewide nonprofit that advocates for Nebraskans with intellectual disabilities, said at the Olmstead meeting that the state’s description of the proposed changes might seem “reasonable,” but the “reality” parents might face is different.
“I’m not convinced that this process is going forward in any kind of manner … that you can manage in a reasonable way without having the catastrophes we’re hearing about,” Gray said.

Gray and others note that the AD Waiver proposal follows Pillen and Green taking steps to end a services waitlist for Nebraskans with developmental disabilities. Some said they worry success for one waiver now could hurt another.
Keyzer also worries the move is “political,” so Pillen and DHHS can say they offered solutions, even if they’re not “real” or practical. She and other families noted that many family caregivers work for minimum wage ($15 an hour, effective Jan. 1), yet some agency caregivers could be paid much more per hour. 
They say the changes aren’t fiscally responsible.
“These are the most intense mama and papa bears in this state who have been protecting their loved one and … fighting every step of the way to make sure that our children are alive and are OK and are living their best life,” Keyzer said. “We will continue to fight.”
Balancing hours
Joni Thomas, an AD Waiver recipient and Olmstead advisory member, said she had polio when she was two and a half, in 1959. It was the end of the second wave of the epidemic, and though the vaccine was out and her family had received it, she was already sick. She spent nine months in the hospital, including six in an iron lung.
Thomas said her mom was given the opportunity to put her in an institution, but her mother refused, saying, “She’s my child, and if she lives through this, I’m taking her home.”

Now 68 years old, Thomas said she grew up always wanting three things out of life: to own her own place with a personal set of keys, to drive and to have a job and not what she’s facing now. Thomas retired in 2023 and founded a nonprofit to bring awareness to an “untapped” pool of talent.
“I got all of those things,” said Thomas. “But at the same time, the programs are set up to really kind of keep you impoverished.”
Thomas currently uses the AD Waiver to cover about 10 hours overnight, to help her sleep comfortably and safely, and a few hours daily so she can go to the bathroom three times a day and help prepare food, of which she said a whole-food, plant-based diet has reduced sickness and kept her out of the hospital. 
If Thomas is limited to 70 hours or more, depending on a couple of proposed exceptions, it’ll affect how many hours she has per day, including to sleep. 
The fear is also real for Thomas’ mother, who is 91 and has significant dementia. The family worries the waiver changes would cause one of Thomas’ mother’s “greatest fears in life” to come true, that she couldn’t stay at home and live out the rest of her life comfortably.

When Thomas first found out about the changes, her first thought was, “Oh my God, the whole thing I fought all my life for is going to happen to me.” 
She said care needs to be certain, and doesn’t want to rely on a volunteer to use the bathroom. She said for those questioning her opposition to living in a Medicaid facility, they should visit one and ask themselves if they would want to live there. 
‘Cutting off our nose’
Multiple Olmstead advisory members and families have also pushed back on Green, with many questioning whether the calculated nursing facility rate the state is using is accurate.
For instance, Kierstin Reed, president and CEO of LeadingAge Nebraska, which represents nursing homes and assisted living facilities, told Green that institutions have a variety of payment rates based on the complexity of need. She told Green she would “guarantee” most would exceed $162,000, if not well more with some daily rates of $1,000.
Reed told Green the $92,000 limit would count for “bare minimum,” “custodial-level care,” not the care needed for AD Waiver participants. She told him the waiver changes are a “choice.”
“We’re cutting off our nose to spite our face,” Reed told the Nebraska Examiner.

Nebraska also has a workforce problem, Reed said, and some facilities can’t support the needs of all patients, either. Some Nebraskans don’t have a nursing home within 100 miles, let alone bed openings in one that accepts Medicaid residents. Reed said families also know their loved ones’ needs.
“They have the intuition to know what the routine is and what things need to look like and what their loved one needs and what every sound or every movement might mean,” Reed said.
Wohlers, whose family lives north of Crawford, said there is a day center in Chadron, almost 30 miles away, which was a “clear no” for Michaela.
“Not being able to talk doesn’t mean you don’t have thoughts or things you want to say or things you want to express,” Wohlers said. “It just means it’s harder for you to do so.”

Reed also expressed concerns that many AD Waiver recipients will still need the same level of care they are receiving now, which exceeds the state’s proposed hourly limits, and that family caregivers won’t have time to work to make up for the income lost to the new caps.
Keyzer is one of many families who worry whether they could get another job to fill the gap while still providing the same level of care their loved ones need. Many said they also worry about relying on strangers for care.
Green, responding to Reed, said “there’s not a clean way” to know how many families are above the proposed 70-hour limit. He said limiting families to 40 hours is “common” in other states.
‘Budgets are balanced on our backs’
Alana Schriver, executive director of the Nebraska Association of Service Providers, said many service coordinators are not aware of the changes being proposed for services that are a “lifeline” for many families. She said the timing seems intentional to seek public comment over the holidays, when families and advocates might be distracted or short on time.

Schriver said human lives are “more important than any dollar bill” and that anyone might need the AD Waiver one day. She placed blame for tight budget times on Gov. Jim Pillen for signing significant income tax breaks in 2023.
“Tax breaks for the wealthy should not come on the backs of the aging and disabled,” Schriver said.
Thomas said Nebraskans with disabilities are taxpayers, and she lives a “typical life” where she picks up her grandson five days a week and watches him at home while his parents work. But Nebraskans with disabilities are “at the bottom of the list.”
“Once again, budgets are balanced on our backs,” Thomas said. “I thought we were moving beyond that, but we’re not.”

Keyzer echoed those concerns and suggested DHHS fundraise or try to ask for additional state dollars. Green did not answer Keyzer when she asked if DHHS tried to seek additional funding, and Powell did not answer when the Examiner asked. 
“Is this really the way to produce funds?” Keyzer asked. “To scare us all, right before the holidays, and tell us we have to figure out how to survive without incomes and still take care of our kid? I don’t know how to do that.”
While the changes are still in the proposal stage, some families said they’ve been told their hours will be cut Jan. 1. Green sidestepped a mother when she asked him at the Olmstead meeting. Powell said no changes would occur until July 1.
‘Paying grandmas to be grandmas’
Pillen signed significant income tax cuts during his first year in office, in 2023, for anyone making more than $18,000. Since then, he has faced significant budget challenges, which also complicated his plans for additional property tax relief, moving his proposals toward a shift from broadened or increased sales taxes.
Speaking with the Examiner ahead of the 2026 session, 69-year-old Pillen, who turns 70 in one week, said he’s old enough to remember when neighbors took care of one another and “government was not in this stuff.”
“I’m 100% to take care of the most vulnerable,” Pillen said. “But, I mean, the hardcore reality, we the people in Nebraska, in instances, are paying grandmas to be grandmas.”

Jim Pillen as he signs four bills on improving government efficiencies. July 16, 2025. (Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)
Pillen said he has to ensure there’s accountability and not “waste and abuse.” He said DHHS had written $300,000 checks so Nebraskans aged 98 to 100 could stay at home, which he said “sure as hell” ought to be the exception, not the norm.
According to DHHS data, it’s unclear how many situations Pillen described have occurred. Powell said 95% of AD Waiver recipients already receive services “at or below the proposed budget limit” based on the nursing home rate. Green and Powell said 255 participants exceed the proposed cap of about $162,000, which is 175% of the nursing home rate. 
Reed and Schriver said the high costs are for the most medically needy Nebraskans. Thomas added that 255 people might not seem like a “big deal,” but “it is if you’re that person.”
‘Hope that they listen’
A couple of Olmstead Committee members asked Green why he didn’t bring the proposal to the advisory group sooner, to which Green said he disagrees that the changes affect waiver access.
“Access to the waivers is still here, and preferred,” Green said.
State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue is one of a handful of lawmakers watching the changes. He said he is and will remain “deeply engaged” and feels he is a voice, as he understands on a personal level how services and changes can impact a home. 
His oldest of three children, 37-year-old Isaac, was diagnosed at age 4 with Fragile X syndrome, an inherited genetic disorder that affects the X chromosome. 
“We have had tremendous people walk with us in the special needs arena,” he said. “I fight hard for special education and for the disabled community because I know what the needs are.”

Of possible waiver changes, he said that he has been digesting and trying to discern what it all means. He said he is eager to hear organizations and others weigh in by Jan. 5. He knows changes could impact many and that some could face possibly devastating decisions of sending their loved one to a care facility. 
His son lives with the family and attends day services at Duet in Bellevue, a community-based provider for people with developmental and intellectual disabilities.
“Any time you have a restriction or a reduction in services, there is going to be a negative impact,” Rountree said. For people who require around-the-clock care, he said the changes “will be detrimental, almost destructive.”
DHHS plans to submit the state’s waiver renewal request to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in early 2026. DHHS anticipates savings after, but Powell repeatedly declined to give current agency estimates, citing the possibility that the proposal could change.
“I really, truly hope that they listen to us family members, as caregivers, as taxpayers, that our opinion truly counts,” Wohlers said, “because we are what the State of Nebraska is about.”

(Photo by Eli Voorhies for Washington State Standard)U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. declared a public health emergency Wednesday over this month’s flooding in Washington state. 
The action from Kennedy, the head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is focused on helping meet the needs of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. As part of that, his agency is providing access to HHS emPOWER, which gives data on the number of Medicare enrollees reliant on medical equipment dependent on electricity and other health care services that could make them especially vulnerable to a disaster.
The announcement could be a good sign for the state’s chances of getting a major disaster declaration from President Donald Trump to potentially open up tens of millions of dollars to deal with the flooding’s aftermath. 
Gov. Bob Ferguson plans to ask for such a declaration in the coming weeks.
The flooding from heavy rain and overflowing rivers forced thousands of evacuations, breached multiple levees and damaged numerous highways. It still didn’t quite reach the levels some forecasts predicted. One person has been reported dead.
Kennedy’s order follows an emergency declaration from Trump that unlocked federal resources to respond to the storm. 
John Knox, of the department’s Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, said in a statement that, “HHS stands ready to assist state and local response efforts in the state of Washington due to the potential health care impacts from severe storms.” 
Health and Human Services has also waived penalties for violating federal health privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, for hospitals. 
“With today’s declaration and waiver, HHS is helping ensure that residents in the storm’s path have continuous access to the care they need during and after this storm,” Knox said. “ASPR’s highly trained personnel are prepared to support state and local actions to save lives and protect the delivery of health care services.”
The federal Disaster Distress Helpline is also available for crisis counseling. The multilingual hotline, open 24 hours a day, can be reached via call or text at 1-800-985-5990. 
The declaration is retroactive to Dec. 9. 
A windstorm forecast to arrive in western Washington on Wednesday could exacerbate problems, as saturated soil from the recent rain could make trees and powerline poles especially susceptible to falling over. But the wind is now not expected to be as intense as predicted earlier this week.

As new legal battles challenge President Donald Trump’s National Guard troop deployments in U.S. cities, Vermonters have been amping up efforts to express their public opposition.
From handing out flyers at the Vermont National Guard headquarters in Colchester to meeting monthly to discuss local efforts, a small group of residents said they are finding growing interest and solidarity to the cause of fighting what they call fascism.
On a recent Sunday afternoon, about 25 people showed up at the Fletcher Free Library in downtown Burlington to learn about a “Do Not Turn On Us” effort to connect with military personnel about their right to disobey illegal orders.

Rachel Siegel, one of the eight or so organizers, said the event sprouted from a national community effort involving a handful of people from different states earlier this year, including one from Vermont. 
Before they knew it, they had set up a mailing list, organized emails and began to help coordinate groups across the county.
“It was just a tremendous amount of stuff for a group of people that are not an organization and have no infrastructure. We had no staff. We didn’t have a comms person,” she said.
Siegel said she also distributed flyers on Labor Day at the Air National Guard’s open house in Colchester, reminding the Guard of its duty to “protect and assist Vermont communities” during emergencies. That spurred enough public interest for the local activists to host monthly meetings to discuss different kinds of local actions, she said.
A former city councilor in Burlington and former director of the Peace and Justice Center, Siegel has participated in many civil actions over the years opposing apartheid, F-35 fighter jets and policies of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.
She and her daughter were among 13 protesters who were arrested in 2018 as they blocked traffic while opposing family separations outside the ICE facility in Williston.
The flyering events outside the National Guard went very well this year, she said, with passing cars and members of the Guard willing to take flyers.
Joseph Brooks, a spokesman for the Vermont National Guard, said in an email that the residents handing out flyers exercised their First Amendment right “in an organized and respectful way.”
“We have had no incidents or altercations with anyone, and as result it fosters a productive dialogue. The fact that we can have such a dialogue is a testament to the strong relationship we have with the community and that our fellow Vermonters reflect back to us,” Brooks wrote.
Colchester resident Sherri Wormser said she heard about the event and joined because she thinks Vermonters need to present an organized front to prevent illegal military deployments in America or abroad.
“It’s still very important for all of us to speak up against the injustices that are occurring here and in bigger cities as well. But I’m also concerned that if it’s not stopped, that smaller and smaller towns are going to have the presence of the National Guard,” she said.
She said they plan to meet over the weekend “for ongoing resistance and flyering.”
Residents were dismayed last week when the Vermont Air National Guard was deployed to the Caribbean, reportedly in support of Trump’s military escalation against Venezuela. 
Siegel said she found the deployment “abhorrent” and was concerned about young adults heading into a potentially violent situation during the holiday season.
“I hope that they know their legal rights. We will continue to do what we can to connect with families and friends so that they can share our message to follow their oath and not obey illegal orders,” she said.
Wormser said it is “horrifying” for young troops to have to risk their lives abroad for a mission not authorized by Congress.
“We cannot forget the human aspect of all this. Our neighbors may be asked to kill somebody’s neighbors 2,000 miles away,” she said.
While he wasn’t one of the original organizers, Gordon Clark of Burlington said he is glad to be part of the local activism effort.
“We’re currently a small group of Vermont citizens who are shocked and appalled by what is going on in our country these days on many different fronts, but on one in particular: the use of our National Guard … being sent to other American cities and unconstitutional orders and whatnot. So we started an effort,” he said.
He learned of the group by word of mouth and said he hopes more people learn about the opposition effort and join them. 
“I would ask [Gov. Phil] Scott what he is doing about the deployment of the Vermont Air Guard to an apparent forward area of an unsanctioned war in the Caribbean,” he said.
The activists’ latest effort — a petition — went live on Dec. 1. It calls on Scott to oppose the deployment of the Vermont National Guard to American cities, against American citizens, and in unauthorized military actions abroad. It has 123 signatures as of Wednesday with several comments from Vermont residents who have signed it.
The organizers plan to send the petition to Scott when they have a substantial number of names, said Clark, who has also collected more than 60 signatures on a paper petition he is circulating.
Siegel said the local group has not yet come up with a name, but keeping people engaged in small actions feels motivating “because we know that fascism is, in part, fueled by people giving up hope.”
“If we, the people, can do a small thing. If they can create a petition. If they can sign a petition. If they can show up at an open house and hand out flyers. If they can make a flyer,” she said. “Any of these small things that keep people engaged and active will help people continue to do more things like that and help us resist and stop all authoritarianism.”

Joe Nguyen speaks on the Senate floor on Jan. 20, 2023. (Legislative Support Services)Joe Nguyen is stepping down as director of Washington state’s Department of Commerce and is expected to be named the next leader of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber.
Nguyen told Commerce employees on Tuesday that he is leaving but didn’t disclose his new job. He said he didn’t anticipate taking off “until sometime in January.”
“Although I can’t tell you where I’m going just yet, I will be working in Seattle, closer to home,” he wrote in an agencywide email. “Sometimes opportunity knocks, even when you haven’t invited anyone to your door. Recently I was offered an opportunity outside of Commerce that I have accepted because it was the right thing to do for my family.”
The chamber, an independent business organization with 2,600 members, plans an announcement Monday concerning its chief executive officer position. A spokesperson declined further comment.
Rumors of Nguyen’s selection had begun circulating online and among business lobbyists in recent days. Nguyen did not return multiple phone calls for comment.
The job has been open since Rachel Smith left as the organization’s president and CEO to become president of the Washington Roundtable.
Nguyen, a White Center Democrat, was in his second term in the state Senate representing the 34th Legislative District when Gov. Bob Ferguson named him to the high-ranking post. He is the first member of Ferguson’s executive cabinet to quit, though others have retired. 
Nguyen led an agency with a $7.9 billion budget and that administers more than 100 programs in the areas of housing, energy, community and economic development, local government and business services. One of its largest portfolios is promoting development of affordable housing, a top priority of Ferguson’s.
In his email to employees, Nguyen wrote he was “honored” that Ferguson “put his faith in me nearly a year ago and I thank him for that trust.” He said he did not know if Ferguson would install an interim leader or hire a new director right away.
In a statement, Ferguson praised the outgoing director and didn’t say how he plans to replace him.
“I spoke with Joe, and it’s clear he received an offer he couldn’t refuse,” Ferguson said. “I deeply appreciate Joe’s work this past year. Joe always has an open invitation to join my administration in the future.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/joe-nguyen.jpg,,,2025-12-24 16:11:51.739221

[…]","A black-capped chickadee is seen in Anchorage on November 19, 2020. (Photo by Lisa Hupp/USFWS)It took me decades to really notice birds, to give them my full attention. When I did finally invite them into my life at age 43, I fell deeply—and some friends might add, madly—in love with our winged and feathered neighbors, especially the little ones that swarm backyard feeders throughout Alaska’s long and harsh winters.
At the heart of my late-in-life love affair with birds are black-capped chickadees, which first gained my attention more than sixty years ago, when I lived along the edge of rural Connecticut. Like other common New England birds, they quickly faded into the background of my world, for as a boy I was drawn to more exotic creatures: snakes and salamanders, frogs and turtles and trout.
My general disinterest in birds lasted more than four decades, until I settled in the foothills along Anchorage’s eastern edge.
On what’s known to locals as the Hillside, all manner of things began to grab my attention in new ways: the Chinook winds that rush and sometimes roar through the Chugach Mountains and down into the Anchorage Bowl; the winter commutes of ravens, which daily fly between their nighttime roosts in the mountains and the scavenging-rich environs of downtown and mid-town Anchorage; the spruce bark beetle and its infestation of local forests in the 1990s. But nothing grabbed me as deeply as the chickadees. They transformed my world, showed me some of what I’d been missing. In a way, they became my teachers.
“Something strange has happened,” reads one of my earliest Hillside journal entries, in December of 1993. “Something strange and magical and delightful. I’ve fallen under the spell of tiny forest creatures that rarely gained my attention in past years.”
My enchantment began on a Saturday morning, shortly before the winter solstice. Lolling in bed, I happened to glance outside. In the wooded backyard, several black-capped chickadees fluttered around a backyard spruce.
“Wonderful,” I thought. “Here’s a chance to meet some of my new neighbors.”
Inspired by their presence, and on something of a whim, I put an old, slightly bent baking pan on the back deck railing and piled on some sunflower seeds. Nothing happened that first day. But on Sunday, while seated at the dining room table, I watched a small feathered being land on the pan. It had a black-capped head and bib, white cheeks, a whitish beige belly and gray-streaked wings.
The chickadee grabbed a seed and zoomed off to a nearby tree. Then, in flashed another. And a third. For each, the routine was similar: dart in, look around, peck at the tray, grab a seed, look around some more and dart back out. Nervous little creatures, full of bright energy, they soon had me laughing at their antics. By the time they moved on, I sensed an all-too-rare upwelling of fascination and delight.
Within days, a whole new world opened up as woodland neighbors I’d never known, or even imagined, joined the black caps at my feeders: red-breasted nuthatches, common redpolls, pine grosbeaks, and pine siskins. What’s remarkable is that all of those species were—and are—common residents of the Anchorage area. Yet in prior days and years, I had no idea.
My newfound interest in birds grew quickly, surprising even me. What started as mere curiosity quickly bloomed into a consuming passion. I roamed bookstores in search of birding guidebooks, spontaneously exchanged bird descriptions with a stranger and purchased 50-pound bags of sunflower seeds.
All of this seemed very strange to a middle-aged guy who’d never been intrigued by birds — except for charismatic raptors — and had previously judged bird watchers to be rather odd sorts. I didn’t know what it meant, except that a door had opened. And I passed through.
My interest soon expanded outward from my feeders to the local landscape’s forests, coastal flats and tundra, and then even farther beyond, to Alaska’s far reaches. Suddenly, songbirds seemed to be everywhere. Where had they been hiding all those years? Of course they hadn’t been hiding at all. I simply hadn’t cared enough to notice them.
Helped along by local experts, I’ve gradually learned to recognize the songs, calls, and markings of dozens of species. But my favorites remain the songbirds that stay here year-round, adding bright voices and lively energy to our largely dormant winter landscape.
And among those birds, black caps have a special place at the top of my affections, partly for this reason: They’ve reminded me how my world can expand when I make the effort to pay attention. What else awaits me in our world, I wonder, that I haven’t yet discovered or noticed?

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-24 20:45:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT teen released by ICE marks first success story of new pro bono attorney coalition,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/24/ct-pro-bono-attorney-immigratio-ice/,The American Immigrant Legal Clinic offers services pro bono to immigrants who cannot afford legal representation.,"Advocates, attorneys, politicians and members of Meriden’s community gathered on Wednesday to celebrate the return of Kevin, a 16-year-old immigrant who had been detained in a federal detention facility for six months in Texas before his recent release. 
An attorney who worked on Kevin’s case said he saw the case as the first success in a much larger effort to provide legal representation to immigrants who are at risk of deportation by the federal government. 
Glenn Formica, a Connecticut-based immigration attorney, with support from the organization Connecticut Students for a Dream, has been bringing together lawyers and legal service organizations with different specialties to offer their services pro bono to immigrants who cannot afford to hire legal representation. They call the project The American Immigrant Legal Clinic, or TAILC. 
Formica said that during the first Trump administration, he’d been representing “crazy numbers” of immigration cases. In 2020, he said, he was representing 140 pro bono cases in his private practice.
“This time around, I needed something different,” he said. 
In the past, he’d done some work with community groups, trying to teach people about “red folders” and “blue folders” — methods for organizing the documents they would need if they were detained by ICE, Formica said. Red folders contain documents regarding employment and familial ties that can help persuade a court that the person is not a flight risk and should not be held on bond. Blue folders contain documents that make a legal case for the person to remain in the U.S. 
But this time, Formica wanted to go further. 
“I want the community to stop being lambs and I want them to be wolves, and I want them to learn what they need to learn to go hire lawyers and manage lawyers,” he said. 
Formica said the organization, which now includes 20 lawyers, was planning to open a clinic in New Haven in January, where people could bring the documents and have their cases transferred to panel attorneys and legal service organizations who could help.
Frances Bourliot, a partner with the legal firm Gonzalez Olivieri in Texas, who also assisted with Kevin’s case, said the new American Immigrant Legal Clinic was meant to fill a void that existed in the immigration system.
“Too many people in our community never get a real chance to be heard — not because of any judgment on the merits of their case, really, just because they don’t have access to legal support where it matters the most,” said Bourliot. 
Bourliot said the clinic also works with communities to teach them about what documents they might need and how to navigate the court system. 
“Organization in the beginning can be the difference between chaos and clarity,” she said. 
Maegan Faitsch, an attorney with Connecticut Legal Services, said she got connected to Kevin’s case after receiving a call from the pastor of St. Rose of Lima Church in Meriden, a church with a large immigrant congregation. 
Kevin, whose last name has been withheld out of concern for his safety, and his father were detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after a routine immigration check-in in Hartford in June, shortly before Kevin was set to graduate from Maloney High School.
The two were transferred to Texas. Kevin’s father was deported. Kevin was transferred to a detention facility for children run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, where he remained for six months.
Faitsch said ICE attempted to deport Kevin twice, once in the middle of the night. According to Faitsch, ICE had granted Kevin a single phone call before his departure, which he used to call her. She said she was able to stop Kevin’s removal from the U.S. 
ICE officials did not respond to a request for comment.
Kevin’s lawyers connected with Bourliot in Texas and with Rep. Matt Blumenthal, D-Stamford, who works with the firm Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder. Blumenthal filed a petition in U.S. federal district court for Kevin’s release. The federal government decided to release him after that, they said.  
“I think sometimes putting the pressure on the government and letting them know that there are people out there who care about these kids, who are looking at what’s happening and who are there ready to fight for them and to protect their rights — It seems to be working for now,” said Bourliot. 
Kevin told reporters in Spanish that conditions in the detention facility weren’t bad, but that they had little communication with family members. He said he spent his days reading or looking for things to do. He said that the other young people in the facility were often under stress, having taken risks to leave their countries of origin, and having no knowledge of what had happened to the family members with whom they had arrived in the U.S. Some of them, he said, had been in the facility for a long time, and the experience had taken a toll on their mental health. 
“It’s very hard to go through this process, and I’ve seen a lot of people that have had a hard time because of it,” he told the crowd gathered on Wednesday. “It’s not easy and we’re all human and we shouldn’t be treated like this.” 
Kevin said he still misses his father, with whom he was close. Andrea Sanchez, an executive consultant for CT Students for a Dream, said the organization planned to help Kevin access college when he is ready. 
His immigration case is still ongoing, and Formica said the attorneys planned to request Special Immigrant Juvenile Status for Kevin, which, if granted, would give him the ability to remain in the U.S.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0738-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 15:57:22.747249

The most current version was updated on Dec. 19, 2025 (Courtesy Montana DPHHS). RiverStone Health, the public health department of state’s largest county, Yellowstone, has confirmed the first death of influenza in the state this season, as Montana statistics show that influenza cases are happening more rapidly than last year at this time.
The state’s most current published data goes through Dec. 19 and shows 1,238 cases so far.
RiverStone reported that an unvaccinated man in his 80s died two weeks ago. That was the state’s first confirmed flu death this winter.
But Yellowstone County is reporting a large uptick in influenza cases.
So far, there have been 584 reported cases and 25 hospitalizations. Both of those numbers mean that about half of the cases in state have been confined to Yellowstone County. Statewide, there have been 49 hospitalizations, according to the most current statistics.
A five-year average of flu in Montana shows that flu tends to be the most active during the last two weeks of the calendar year, but the 2024-2025 spike in Montana hit later, not peaking until March when the number of hospitalizations reached to nearly 120.
The trend for flu this year more closely resembles severe recent flu seasons, for example, 2023-2024, which saw 19,909 cases reported statewide. That included 907 hospitalizations and 44 deaths. Last year’s flu season was also notable: Fewer cases were reported, but the state reported a five-year high of 68 deaths due to the virus.
So far, 69% of the hospitalizations have been from people older than age 65, and more than 90% of those needing to be admitted were age 50 or older.
“Influenza may feel familiar, but it can be a severe and even life-threatening illness,” said Dr. Megan Littlefield, RiverStone chief medical officer. “It is important that everyone takes precautions to prevent spreading illness, especially to protect our vulnerable populations.”
 



 

	 More information about influenza 			



The flu spreads through coughing and sneezing with symptoms that can include high fever, chills, headaches, exhaustion, sore throat, cough and body aches.  It may take about one to four days after being exposed to the virus for symptoms to develop. Additionally, you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else one day before symptoms develop and up to five to seven days after becoming sick.
Everyday precautions can help stop the spread of influenza. Those measures include:

Getting vaccinated.
Wearing a mask or covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
Washing your hands often with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available.
Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
Avoiding close contact with sick people.
Staying home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or necessities.

If infected with influenza, prescription antiviral medication such as Tamiflu can decrease symptoms and help speed recovery. These medications are most effective if given within the first two days of symptoms and are recommended for those most at risk for serious complications: children less than 2, adults older than 65, and those with underlying lung disease, heart disease or other chronic medical conditions.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)A unanimous five-judge panel of the Montana Supreme Court has rejected a request by youth plaintiffs who successfully argued that the state has a constitutional obligation to protect the climate to assume control over legal challenges to several of the laws passed by the 2025 Legislature.
The order, issued Tuesday, said that the Held v. Montana litigants had not been able to show that the Treasure State’s highest court needed to assume jurisdiction, nor had they established why a district court setting couldn’t address their concerns.
The Held group of plaintiffs successfully led a first-of-its-kind lawsuit that said that the Montana Constitutional guarantee of a “clean and healthful environment” obligated the state to adopt more protections for the climate and human health. That trial took place in a Lewis and Clark County District courtroom and the decision was later affirmed by the Montana Supreme Court.
Since then, the Legislature has modified some of the state’s environmental laws. However,  the Republican-led state House and Senate said that while the state must disclose “greenhouse gas” emissions for many projects, that data cannot be used to halt progress in mining or natural resources, an action the Held plaintiffs disagree with.
Other cases, including on the federal level, have had much less success because the environmental protection has so far been derived from the state’s Constitution, not necessarily federal law.
The Held litigants are more than a dozen people, including minors, who argued that the Montana Supreme Court should take up the matter because of the urgency of environmental degradation and because the lawsuit had implications statewide. They petitioned for a “writ of supervisory control,” which is an extraordinary measure used sparingly by the Supreme Court to assume control of cases that would normally be heard in district court.
The five-member panel said that the Held plaintiffs did not establish that the issues were so urgent that they could not be addressed by a district court. In fact, the court cited several examples of timely matters heard by lower level courts, and cases where the Supreme Court had declined to take cases.
“(The Held litigants) brought their petition seven months after the law took effect,” the Supreme Court opinion said.
They had used a finding from the original Held case, which said that every ton of greenhouse gases exacerbates their injuries as the basis of their appeal to the Supreme Court. However, the court rejected that argument.
“Although petitioners argue that the development of the factual record is unnecessary given the factual record in Held, they do not address why the district court would not be equipped to consider the legal issues in a timely fashion and permit them to present an appeal in the ordinary course,” the opinion said. “In fact, district courts entertain constitutional challenges routinely and have the tools to address allegations of irreparable harm or similar questions of urgency.”

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle) Federal officials have ordered a temporary halt to the planned shutdowns of two coal-burning Indiana power plants amid President Donald Trump’s attempts to boost the coal mining industry.
The U.S. Department of Energy orders issued Tuesday require Northern Indiana Public Service Co. and CenterPoint Energy to keep those generating plants operating despite their intentions of closing them this month.
The 90-day orders say the two coal-burning units set for closure at NIPSCO’s Schahfer Generating Station near Wheatfield and one at CenterPoint’s Culley Generating Station along the Ohio River near Newburgh must remain “available to operate” until at least March 23.
The orders come as Trump has pushed policies to promote the coal industry while deriding the shift toward solar and wind energy as sources of electricity.
The Energy Department said the Indiana plants orders were needed because the “reliable supply of power from these coal plants is essential for keeping the region’s electric grid stable.” Both orders cited the growing power demands of data centers among the reasons for keeping the plants in operation.
“Keeping these coal plants online has the potential to save lives and is just common sense,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. “Americans deserve reliable power regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining during extreme winter conditions.”
The federal agency has issued similar orders for power plants in other states in recent months, including a large coal-burning station in Michigan.
Companies’ response
Indiana’s major utilities have over many years been shifting away from coal-powered plants toward using natural gas and renewable sources for electricity generation.
It was not immediately clear Wednesday how NIPSCO and Centerpoint would abide with the orders to keep the coal-burning plants in operations.

NIPSCO, which has more than 450,000 electric customers across northern Indiana, said it would comply with the order and was “reviewing the overall impact to our customers and company.”
“We recognize the importance of both reliability and cost management for our customers, and we will continue to engage with federal, state and local stakeholders as we adapt to evolving regulatory requirements,” Vince Parisi, NIPSCO’s president and chief operating officer, said in a statement.
CenterPoint, which serves about 150,000 customers in the Evansville area, announced plans in 2023 to convert its last coal-burning unit at the Culley Generation Station to natural gas by 2027.
The company said its plans would reduce costs while preserving the Culley station’s generating capacity and adding solar and wind power sources in the coming years.
CenterPoint said Wednesday it would “continue to work collaboratively with our federal, state and local partners and remain focused on prioritizing affordability and energy security.”
“Working together, we will help contribute to regional electric reliability efforts to focus on what is most important — safe and reliable service for our customers and fellow Hoosiers during the upcoming winter months,” the company said in a statement.
The NIPSCO units set for closure generate about 850 megawatts of electricity and date to the 1980s, according to the federal orders. The CenterPoint unit generates about 100 megawatts and began operations in 1966.
Coal foes blast orders
Environmental groups and consumer advocates denounced the Energy Department orders, arguing they would force “households to pay more for coal’s deadly air and toxic water pollution.”
“The federal government’s order to force extremely expensive and unreliable coal units to stay open will result in higher bills for Hoosiers who are already reeling from record-high rate increases in 2025,” said Ben Inskeep, program director for the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana. “We can’t afford this costly and unfounded federal overreach.”
An analysis by the Citizens Action Coalition released in July of Indiana’s five investor-owned electric utilities found that residential bills spiked by 17.5% in one year, or $28 a month on average statewide.
Ashley Williams, executive director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana, called NIPSCO’s Schahfer plant “one of the most notorious polluters in the country.”
“On-site coal ash contamination of groundwater, along with a proposed massive gas plant and AI data center, compounds an extremely dire situation and creates an unconscionable environmental burden,” Williams said. “The Trump administration is trying to steal away our futures by keeping us tethered to the dirty coal energy of the past.”

This story is co-published by the Wrangell Sentinel and Northern Journal.
An Indigenous community is locked in a debate about the pros and cons of a major new mine on their traditional lands — and a big cash payment promised by the developer.
There is strong support, and fierce opposition. A lot of money to be made, and a wild river to protect. The community faces a pivotal choice.
Though this story sounds like it could be unfolding in rural Alaska, a version of it has actually been playing out just across the border with Canada, in northwest British Columbia. Still, it has implications for the Alaskans who live downstream from the proposed mine site.
In a referendum after weeks of heated debate, members of the Tahltan Nation earlier this month voted overwhelmingly to approve a deal with a Canadian mining company that hopes to revive a huge gold and silver mine, called Eskay Creek, which stopped producing in 2008. The project is located above the Unuk River, which flows into Alaska near Ketchikan.
The Tahltans’ backing is a major step forward for the project, and it comes as the Canada and B.C. governments intensify efforts to build more mines in the name of national security and economic growth. Several of the projects are near the border with Alaska, where state and federal elected officials are separately pushing mines that could help wean the U.S. off a foreign supply of minerals used in energy, electronics and weapons.
Just one day after the Tahltan vote, Canada’s federal government announced that it had approved a merger between two multinational mining firms with a condition that calls for advancing two other proposed mines in Tahltan territory. Both projects sit above tributaries of the Stikine River, a major, salmon-bearing waterway that straddles Canada and the U.S. and empties into the ocean near the small Southeast Alaska town of Wrangell.
Louie Wagner Jr., a Tsimshian and Tlingit resident of Metlakatla, a Native community at the southern tip of Alaska’s panhandle, said he’s concerned about the health of the Unuk River and its future with mines in its watershed.
Wagner and his family have fished and hunted moose along the Unuk for generations.
“That little river cannot handle it,” Wagner said in a recent phone interview. The Unuk is notable, he added, for its abundance of eulachon, a small, oily fish also known as hooligan that’s a staple for Indigenous communities in Southeast Alaska.
Though rarely discussed in Alaska circles, the Tahltan Nation’s approach to mining has major implications for the industry’s future in the transboundary region. A top U.S. Department of Interior official visited the region last year to learn more about models for how Indigenous nations can partner with mining companies.
There are more than a dozen early-stage mining projects in Tahltan territory, many above rivers that flow into Alaska. And the Eskay Creek vote could serve as a preview of future deals between the Tahltan government and the for-profit mining companies promoting development.
For months, members of the First Nation debated whether to approve a deal, known as an impact benefit agreement, that Tahltan elected leaders had negotiated with Vancouver-based Skeena Resources, the company pushing Eskay Creek.

The specifics of the agreement have not been made public. But Tahltan officials have said it guarantees benefits worth more than $1 billion over the life of the mine, mostly in cash but also in contracts and wages.
The deal also calls for an upfront payment from Skeena, intended to be distributed to individual Tahltan members — to the tune of $7,250 each, according to Tahltan officials. And the agreement reportedly gives the First Nation government some environmental oversight over the mine.
The nation backed the deal with support from more than 77% of the roughly 1,750 Tahltans who voted, according to the Tahltan Central Government. Payments are expected to go out to members in 2026.
“Tahltan Central Government is not standing on the sidelines,” Tahltan president Kerry Carlick said in a statement after the vote.  “We are embedding ourselves directly into the governance of environmental protection.”
Tahltan leaders have long worked to navigate political tensions between an expanding mining industry and efforts to protect traditional lands and wildlife.
The Tahltan government has entered into a number of agreements with mining companies. But it also has opposed efforts to mine coal and drill for natural gas near the headwaters of major rivers in the region.
And some Tahltan members have been outspoken critics of the Eskay Creek project and the company promoting it.
In the leadup to the recent vote, arguments erupted on social media, and relationships among community members grew strained, some Eskay Creek opponents said in interviews.
“This is causing internal conflicts,” said Tamara Quock, a Tahltan member who lives in northern B.C. some 350 miles east of the mine site.
Quock said she thinks the promise of the direct payments “enticed” some people to vote in favor of the agreement. Debate over the project, she added, grew more intense after that condition was added to the deal.
Quock said she feels Skeena is “using the Tahltan people” to generate its own profits.
She and other critics have voiced concerns about a perceived lack of transparency and potential conflicts of interest within the First Nation’s government. They also say they are worried about possible environmental impacts from the project, which would involve digging two open pits and storing millions of tons of mining waste above the Unuk River.
Skeena didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Alaska Native leaders, fishermen and environmental advocates who live downstream, in Southeast Alaska, for years have expressed concerns about Eskay Creek and other proposed mines in the region, saying they don’t trust Canadian regulators to safeguard Alaskan interests.
“You can’t cut these watersheds in half and expect to adequately protect them,” said Guy Archibald, executive director of the tribally led Southeast Alaska Indigenous Transboundary Commission. “Right now they’re cutting the baby in half and ignoring the effects on the Alaska side of the border.”
The commission last month filed a legal challenge in B.C. court, asserting that regulators had failed to consult Alaska tribes on several proposed mines in the region, including Eskay Creek.
Meanwhile, after a major spill last year at a Canadian gold mine in the Yukon River watershed, Alaska’s congressional delegation called for more oversight of Canadian mines near transboundary rivers like the Unuk and Stikine. The statement from the delegation — which has strongly supported mine development in Alaska — called for “binding protections, financial assurances, and strong transboundary governance.”
“As British Columbia seeks to advance numerous mines just upstream from Alaska, we are still asking them to fully remediate legacy sites and firmly commit to binding protections for Alaska interests,” Joe Plesha, a spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, said in a recent statement. “Senator Murkowski is actively considering new ways to make our B.C. neighbors take Alaskans’ concerns seriously.”

Ottawa and B.C.’s provincial government, meanwhile, are funding new infrastructure projects and prioritizing permitting for energy and resource development projects, including Eskay Creek and the expansion of a huge copper and gold mine in the Stikine watershed, called Red Chris.
Canadian officials say existing regulations are geared to minimize impacts in the shared watersheds. Major projects undergo thorough environmental assessments before they’re approved, a spokesperson with the B.C. agency that leads those reviews, the Environmental Assessment Office, said in an email.
“Making sure large-scale projects are properly assessed is critical to making sure development is sustainable — to ensure good jobs and economic growth while also protecting the environment and wildlife, and keeping communities healthy and safe,” said the spokesperson, Sarah Plank.
Tahltan officials declined an interview request and did not respond to questions about Alaskans’ concerns or the First Nation’s agreement with Skeena.
Supporters of Eskay Creek say it could be transformational for the Tahltan Nation. Among proponents of the deal is Chad Norman Day, a former Tahltan president who has worked in the mining industry and now runs a consulting firm that does mining-related business.
“The benefits which flow to the Tahltan Nation from here will empower the people and territory unlike anything we have ever seen,” Day said in a statement after the vote.
Many Tahltan people work in mining, and the First Nation already generates revenue from Red Chris and another large operating mine, Brucejack, which started producing gold in 2017.
In 2019, Tahltan citizens voted in favor of an agreement with a different mining company pushing another, much bigger proposed mine partially in the Unuk watershed, called KSM. The outcome of that vote was nearly identical to the recent Eskay one, with about the same percentage in favor.
The first nation also, in the past five years, has entered into two joint decisionmaking agreements with the B.C. government for regulatory reviews of mining projects, including Eskay Creek.
Before it can start producing, Eskay Creek needs an environmental approval from the provincial government. A decision is expected early next year.

Farmers, researchers, the state and the federal government are trying to fight the infestation, but it’s a never-ending battle for landowners.","John Parker Campbell describes the wild pigs on his family farm as “a constant headache.” 
Hogs will eat up corn and peanuts that have just been planted, damaging acres of crops in a night. Some years the hog damage is worse than others but it has been a problem since his father started farming in Copiah County in the 1990’s.
In Mississippi, wild hogs create around $60 million to $80 million in damage every year, including eating crops and damaging property. Farmers, researchers, the state and the federal government are trying to fight the infestation, but it’s a never-ending battle for landowners. 
“Farmers have enough stress as it is. They don’t need this modern-day locust,” said Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce Andy Gipson
Campbell and his father use traps and have an electric fence around their property to keep the hogs out. The fence has been effective, although the feral pigs have broken through parts of it before. However, it was expensive to initially put up and costs thousands of dollars each year to maintain. 
“You have to know that they’re out there,” said Campbell. “We keep an eye on our fields but you can get busy and then go a couple days without looking and they can just do a tremendous amount of damage.” 
The wild hog population has grown over the past 40 years, not just in Mississippi, but across the United States. In the 1980’s they lived in 17 states, now they can be found in 35. Previously, it was thought they cost the U.S. $2 billion a year but new research indicates that number is actually over $3 billion. 
Wild pigs are not native to the United States. The first population was escaped livestock brought to the Americas by European settlers. Later, Eurasian boars were imported for hunting and joined the wild hog population. With no natural predators and plenty of land, water and food, their numbers have grown.

While some owners successfully deterred pigs by using electric fences, the only way to manage the larger population is by killing the hogs.
Mississippi was the first state to launch a statewide wild hog-control program in 2020. The program provides education and traps to landowners.
The program operates with a budget of $183,000 a year which mainly goes to staff salaries and maintenance of smart traps and cameras. The program has four application cycles with each cycle receiving between 35 and 40 applications.
There are a number of ways to reduce the pig population, including using traps, aerial gunning and poison. While wild hogs are considered nuisance animals and can be hunted year round, hunting is relatively ineffective at controlling the larger population. 
Aerial gunning in Mississippi is only used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It also has limited use as the pigs can easily run into the trees for cover, whereas in places like Texas, there is more open and flat land. While there is ongoing research into the use of poisons, including contraceptives, it’s challenging to make sure that other animals don’t eat them.
Trapping is one of the most common methods and is preferred as it requires less time and effort than other methods. A new study from Mississippi State University looked at the economic benefits of trapping.
The average landowner in the study had an estimated $20,000 in hog damages per year. It showed that reducing a local pig population can lead to less damage and $300-$4,000 in savings per pig the next year for land owners. But combatting the wild hog problem is an expensive and constant battle. 
The study involved intense, dedicated hog removal through Delta Wildlife, a conservation nonprofit. 
Jody Acosta, Delta Wildlife’s nuisance-and invasive-species program manager, and his team set up and monitor traps around the Delta. While the team is experienced and knowledgeable, Acosta is clear that the job is not about the glory of hunting but about pest management.

Some of the trap doors will only close when a Delta Wildlife team member remotely pushes a button. So they work around the clock, often late at night, checking the live video feed of the traps. Once they successfully trap a group of pigs, a Delta Wildlife worker quickly makes their way to the trap so they can dispose of the pigs and reset the trap.
The study estimates that it would cost a land owner about $200 per pig if they outsourced every part of trapping. Strickland, one of the study’s authors, acknowledges that “it’s absolutely a big number” but says that the average landowner would likely pay less. Despite the initial sticker shock, Strickland said the study shows that pig removal results in a “positive return on investment” and that government programs are economically viable. 
Long term, Strickland thinks it’s possible to reduce the wild pig population through a concerted effort and investment. He urges farmers and landowners to take wild pigs seriously even if there’s only a few on their property at the moment.
“The problem will only get worse and worse,” said Strickland.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/09131825/Wild-Hog.jpg,,,2025-12-24 15:12:07.269728

(Photo via State Library and Archives of Florida Postcard Collection)University of Central Florida researchers using genetic information say that, with intervention, depleted flamingo populations in Florida can recover. 
A study led by biology graduate student Jessica Folsom used genomic data in determining the flamingo population and its genetics in Florida and proposes strategies to restore the population. 
Researchers found that flamingos in Florida and around the Caribbean display few genetic differences, including those held in captivity. 
Flamingos in Florida often fly in for a few months, but building a long-term breeding population would pose a challenge. 
“For more than a century, there were almost no conservation measures for flamingos in the U.S.,” said Steven Whitfield, a co-author of the study and a director at the Audubon Nature Institute. “That’s partly because flamingos were long considered a non-native species to Florida. With our work, we want to show they have always belonged here and there’s a scientific basis to support their recovery.”
According to the research, the long-term outlook for flamingos is “good,” but the existing population is not sufficient for recovery. “Moreover, habitat destruction, pollution and warming temperatures add to the challenges they face.”
“Natural recovery of the flamingo is unlikely in Florida without intervention,” Whitfield said in a news release. “But our study shifts that conversation. We can now confidently say ex-situ [managed in zoos or aquariums] flamingos are genetically compatible with wild populations, which opens possibilities for a future release program, even though logistical hurdles remain.”
Reintroduction, although, must be guided by policy, the researchers said. 
Lawmakers, for at least five years, have proposed replacing the mockingbird with the flamingo as the state bird.
In advance of this coming session, SB 150, filed by Sen. Gayle Harrell, a Republican from Stuart, passed the Environment and Natural Resources committee unanimously last month and has two more committees dates.
HB 11, an identical bill filed in the House by Republican Reps. Jim Mooney from Islamorada and Chip LeMarca from Lighthouse Point, passed the Natural Resources & Disasters subcommittee last month and has two more committees to pass.
Those bills would designate the scrub-jay as the state songbird, too.
“The flamingo is iconic to Florida. When I was growing up it was flamingos and palm trees. … But the awareness really comes with the conservation. The flamingo is now thriving in Florida,” Mooney said during a December House committee meeting.

Extirpation
Hunting and habitat loss during the 1800s resulted in extirpation of Florida’s flamingos by the early 1900s. Since then, the bird has shown “only faint signs of a true comeback,” according to the research. 
“Despite high vagility and the presence of nearby flocks in the Caribbean, the Florida population has yet to show substantial recovery,” the report says. 
“The ex-situ [managed] population had higher diversity compared to wild birds and were not significantly differentiated from the wild population, making these flocks possible sources for reintroduction projects,” the study says.
Flamingo representation is common in Florida, being displayed, for example, on state lottery branding and a ginormous piece of art in the Tampa airport.
“As a native Floridian who grew up in Tallahassee, Florida, I was fascinated and a little surprised to see the flamingo as a prominent state icon, yet I had never seen one in the wild,” said Folsom, the researcher who led the study. 
Hoffman said that zoo flocks, including Zoo Miami’s, were founded after a Hialeah horse racetrack owner released about 20 flamingos in the wild in the 1920s to boost his business.

Flamingos are protected by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service List of Birds Protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 2023. That law makes it illegal to hunt, kill, sell, export, or transport any migratory bird without a permit from the federal government.
The study was published in the American Ornithological Society’s Ornithological Applications journal. 
According to a 2024 Audubon Florida report, “Our iconic American Flamingos blown in from Hurricane Idalia in 2023 continue to remain in Everglades National Park thanks to available forage and quality habitat — a bright pink indicator of the success of our Everglades conservation efforts.”
An Audubon survey found 101 wild American Flamingos in Florida in February 2024, nearly half in Florida Bay.
“Flamingos were historically numerous in Florida until the 19th century plume trade — when an ounce of feathers was worth more than gold — decimated wading birds in South Florida,” the Audubon report states.
“Even after legislation and Audubon wardens protected these birds, extensive draining and ditching of the Everglades destroyed their habitat. Now that restoration momentum is flowing in the River of Grass, we are hopeful that protected wetlands and improved water flow will create enough habitat resources for the Hurricane Idalia flamingos to survive and thrive here.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC15095-1024x645.jpg,,,2025-12-24 14:58:24.551980

Laura Kelly, a Democrat entering her last year in office, is concentrating on shaping a new state budget, water policy and early-childhood development.","Gov. Laura Kelly, a term-limited Democrat, said her priorities in the 2026 legislative session will be development of a reasonable state budget, launching the new Office of Early Childhood and locking down a statewide strategic plan for use of water resources. In this Dec. 16, 2025, image, Kelly speaks during an interview with Kansas Reflector. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly approached the final year of her second term with a familiar plea that the Kansas Legislature pass a reasonable budget and a bleak realization the state wouldn’t be able to compensate for federal reductions in spending on health care and food programs.
The bell tolls 2 p.m. Jan. 12 on the annual legislative session in Kansas with the term-limited Democratic governor and a Republican supermajority in the House and Senate. As Kelly moved closer to departing the office, Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, would continue his campaign for governor and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, would be occupied with a campaign for state insurance commissioner.
Kelly, scheduled to deliver the State of the State address on Jan. 13, said developing a budget for the fiscal year starting July 1 would be her primary quest.
“No. 1 is always the budget,” she said in an interview with Kansas Reflector. “That the Legislature pass a balanced, reasonable, sane budget that funds the important responsibilities of state government.”
Kelly said it wasn’t possible for the state to fill in for slashed federal appropriations to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
“We are not really taking that approach. That’s the way we’ve been since these cuts started coming down,” the governor said. “One, we don’t really have the money. Where do you stop on those kinds of things? Can we backfill the cuts to Medicaid that are coming? Absolutely not. SNAP? We cannot.”
The U.S. Congressional Joint Economic Committee estimated the “One Big Beautiful Bill” signed by President Donald Trump would eventually strip Medicaid coverage from 90,000 Kansans, place rural hospitals across Kansas at greater risk and prompt Affordable Care Act premium increases. Changes to the ACA compel higher personal insurance premiums after Dec. 31, but Medicaid cuts would be staggered during 2026, 2027 and 2028.
Overall, Kelly said, Kansas could lose least $150 million through federal reductions to health care programs.
The federal government has funded about two-thirds of the annual cost of Medicaid in Kansas, and covered all but administrative expenditures for emergency food aid under SNAP.
“Kansas is not alone,” Kelly said. “These programs like SNAP and Medicaid were really built on the premise of a partnership.”
Kelly said another objective was to sustain the push for economic development. The state’s commitment to financially support relocation of the Kansas City Chiefs to a stadium in Wyandotte County and a headquarters in Johnson County was a “game-changer for our state,” she said.
The governor said the process of recruiting the NFL franchise was an example of what Republicans and Democrats at the local and state levels could accomplish through collaboration. Masterson and Hawkins, as well as Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, D-Lenexa, and House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, D-Lenexa, stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Kelly and Lt. Gov. David Toland for the announcement Monday in Topeka.
“You don’t often see this type of bipartisanship in our politics today, but that’s how we do things in Kansas, especially when the stakes are high,” Kelly said.
In the 2026 session, Kelly said she also would focus on finalizing a long-term plan for preserving and enhancing the state’s water resources.
“We are on the cusp of coming up with that strategic plan that I’d like to see in place before I’m out of office,” Kelly said. “As I’ve said before, I don’t expect to solve the water problem by the time I leave, but I would like in place a structure and a funding source that will insure that we can address water.”
In addition, the governor said she was committed to standing up the new state Office of Early Childhood by July 1. The goals would be consolidation of programs housed in a cluster of state agencies and the upgrading of services beneficial to children.
“We will spend and invest a lot of energy to make sure,” Kelly said. “Part of the point of the Office of Early Childhood is to be more efficient, so I’m hoping that we won’t be looking at needing money.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC160871-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-24 13:58:06.949556

Andy Beshear and other Democratic state officials temporarily blocks the Trump administration from abruptly withdrawing federal money from housing programs for the homeless.
“More than $21 million in unlawfully held funds will now be processed for housing efforts in the commonwealth, supporting veterans, seniors, families with children and individuals with disabilities,” said a news release from Beshear’s office. 
Many Kentuckians at risk of returning to homelessness because of federal funding switch

Beshear said he was “thankful that today’s ruling will protect housing for 700 households and 1,200 Kentuckians.”
U.S. District Judge Mary S. McElroy of Rhode Island granted the preliminary injunction against a decision announced last month by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to shift billions in funding in the Continuum of Care program from permanent housing to temporary transitional housing.
Beshear’s office said the HUD changes would have capped funding to states for permanent supportive housing at 30% and required states to reapply for money previously approved by Congress and awarded in 2024. Now, that funding will be processed without the need to reapply, the news release says.
Kentucky was at risk of losing 70% of the more than $15 million currently approved that supports permanent supportive housing in 118 of the state’s 120 counties. The cap would have also negatively impacted more than $20 million in federal funding for rental assistance and supportive assistance for homeless Kentuckians, said the governor’s office.
HUD’s funding priorities for alleviating homelessness and its response to the judge’s ruling remain unclear. The New York Times reports a HUD spokesman, asked about the legal developments, said the department was “committed to program reforms” and would proceed according to the law.
Adrienne Bush, executive director of the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky, said the preliminary court order “provides legal clarity as the case moves forward as well as a directive to the federal government to honor its funding commitments made to communities, nonprofit organizations, and households in 2024. 
“The preliminary injunction should begin to provide some relief from the unnecessary disruption we have experienced since the government reopened in November. We look forward to seeing the administration’s update on renewal processing on December 30, and we hope that this gives families currently housed under the Continuum of Care program some peace of mind this holiday season.”
Earlier this month, HUD rescinded its Nov. 13 notice announcing the funding changes an hour before a court hearing on two lawsuits challenging the new policy, prompting McElroy, the federal judge,  to say, “It feels like intentional chaos.”

Greg Gianforte has requested President Donald Trump issue an emergency declaration to respond to damage caused by high winds on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation.
“On December 17, 2025, a historic, long-duration high-wind event and associated blizzard caused widespread destruction across Montana,” Gianforte wrote in a letter.
He said the storm brought gusts from 60 to 90 mph and more than 100 mph in the mountains.
“Most critically, the storm caused structural failure of the roof of the water holding tank supplying the Fort Belknap Indian Community,” Gianforte wrote.
The request Wednesday for emergency federal assistance is the second this month following flooding in northwest Montana, a blizzard in northeast Montana and high winds across the state.
Friday, the governor announced that President Trump had approved the request for help from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for flooding in Lincoln and Sanders counties and the Blackfeet Nation.
In the news release Wednesday, Gianforte said damage from the recent storm exposed Fort Belknap’s primary water source to potential contaminants, necessitating a boil order for approximately 700 homes, a detention facility, a hospital, restaurants, and tribal offices.
In the letter, Gianforte said the unique demographic and geographic challenges make the impact on the Fort Belknap Indian Community especially dire.
“Many households in the community are multi-generational, housing a high concentration of vulnerable populations, including children and the elderly, who are at increased risk during a water crisis,” the letter said.
He said federal support is needed due to the severity and complexity of the emergency, and it would go toward repairing the water tank, securing reliable and safe drinking water, and alleviating the financial burden of the “unanticipated second disaster in two weeks.”
An estimate of the damages statewide related to recent disasters was not immediately available Wednesday from the Governor’s Office.
However, Trump’s approval of the earlier emergency declaration allows up to $5 million in federal funds to help with response measures, according to the Governor’s Office.
Gianforte said the recent wind and snow affected the entire state, with 43 of 56 counties recording gusts of 70 mph or greater, and in northeast Montana, a blizzard that lasted up to five hours.
“Federal support is essential to ensure the health and safety of the affected population,” Gianforte wrote.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos08-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 13:58:06.949556
,DC,2025-12-24 18:09:30+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,National Guard shooting case moved to federal court as prosecutors weigh death penalty,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/national-guard-shooting-case-moved-federal-court-prosecutors-weigh-death-penalty,,"WASHINGTON — The man accused of shooting two National Guard members near the White House last month, killing one, was charged in federal court Wednesday, moving the case out of the local court system.United States Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro wrote in a statement the “transfer of this case from Superior Court to District Court ensures that we can undertake the serious, deliberate, and weighty analysis required to determine if the death penalty is appropriate here.”West Virginia National Guard members Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, were shot while on patrol in Washington, D.C., the day before Thanksgiving. “Sarah Beckstrom was just 20 years old when she was killed and her parents are now forced to endure the holiday season without their daughter,” Pirro added. “Andrew Wolfe, by the grace of God, survived but has a long road ahead in his recovery.”Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, was already charged with first-degree murder while armed, assault with intent to kill while armed and two counts of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. The federal charges now also include transporting a firearm in interstate commerce with the intent to commit an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than one year and transporting a stolen firearm in interstate commerce.New details disclosedA seven-page document submitted to the court details Lakanwal’s movements ahead of the shooting, which took place just before Thanksgiving. But it doesn't shed any light on his possible motives.  A special agent with the FBI, whose name was redacted in the affidavit, wrote the .357 Smith & Wesson revolver used in the shooting was legally purchased by another person in Bellevue, Washington, in February 2008. But after that person, identified by the initials J.D., died in February 2023, the weapon was stolen. The affidavit alleges that Lakanwal obtained it from someone identified as W-1 after originally trying to purchase an AR-15, a compact AK-47-style stockless pistol and a pistol in October of this year. Lakanwal told this person that he believed he needed a weapon since he was driving for the ride-sharing services Lyft and Uber, according to the affidavit. The FBI agent, however, wrote that Lakanwal hadn’t driven for those services since May 25 and was unemployed when he sought the weapons. The person identified as W-1 in the affidavit was able to secure the .357 Smith & Wesson revolver and gave it to Lakanwal on Nov. 14. “W-1 explained that he gave the firearm to (Lakanwal) because he believed (Lakanwal) wanted it for personal protection while working as a rideshare driver. W-1 stated that W-1 was extremely nervous during the exchange and was visibly shaking,” the FBI agent wrote. “According to W-1, (Lakanwal) observed W-1’s nervousness and placed an arm around W-1 in an effort to calm him. W-1 stated that it is common knowledge among his peers that firearms acquired 'on the streets' are typically stolen firearms.”The revolver was loaded with five bullets at the time. Lakanwal went to a Big 5 Sporting Goods store the next day to purchase a box of ammunition. Route to D.C. trackedThe same day, Nov. 15, Lakanwal searched Google Maps for “Washington, D.C.” and “The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500,” according to the affidavit.The FBI agent wrote that Lakanwal’s Toyota Prius was in Washington state on Nov. 16, based on “license plate reader data that is made available to law enforcement through Customs and Border Protection.”The car was in Idaho on Nov. 19, Illinois on Nov. 21 and Washington, D.C., on Nov. 23. Day of shootingA few days later, on Nov. 26, Beckstrom and Wolfe were on patrol about two blocks from the White House when shot. Video footage from different locations near the shooting at 17th and I streets northwest showed Lakanwal “coming around the corner at the intersection with his hands raised in a firing stance.” He then “immediately began firing in the direction of Beckstrom and Wolfe, and they are both captured on video collapsing on the ground,” according to the FBI agent’s affidavit.

Two majors in the National Guard, identified as NG M-1 and NG M-2 in the affidavit, were talking with Beckstrom and Wolfe when the shooting happened. “NG M-1 reported that he heard gunshots; as he heard gunshots, he observed Beckstrom and Wolfe fall to the ground,” the FBI agent wrote. “NG M-1 then observed (Lakanwal), who was dressed in a knee-length, dark-colored jacket and armed with a revolver, (fired) additional shots. NG M-1 pulled his issued service weapon and fired shots at (Lakanwal). (Lakanwal) fell to the ground where he was detained by NG M-2.”The FBI agent wrote that both “Beckstrom and Wolfe were unresponsive and suffering from gunshot wounds to the head.”Beckstrom died as a result of her injuries at 5:58 p.m. the following day, Thanksgiving. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia charged Lakanwal with first-degree murder on Nov. 28, adding it to other criminal charges. Lakanwal pleaded not guilty in DC Superior Court during an arraignment on Dec. 2 and was denied bond in the case. West Virginia Gov.

The Department of Public Safety sent troopers to Winner and Sturgis for the ninth set of patrols undertaken as part of Gov. Larry Rhoden’s “Operation Prairie Thunder” public safety initiative.
The city of Brookings posted a notice on Dec. 12 saying that troopers would be in the area Dec. 17-19 for a Prairie Thunder saturation patrol. The city would “not be participating” in the operation, the notice said.
State tallies $43,000 in trooper overtime costs during Operation Prairie Thunder

Gov. Larry Rhoden, who announced the initiative in July, chastised the city for the announcement, which coincided with a press release from the Highway Patrol on previous efforts in Huron and Belle Fourche.
“It’s unfortunate that the city of Brookings would jeopardize an anti-crime operation and put the safety of our officers at risk by publishing this information,” Rhoden said in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight.
Operations in Huron had drawn concern from some members of that city’s Hispanic community when additional troopers came to town in November for the first of two saturation stops, inspiring several social media posts about what some believed to be federal immigration raids. 
The Highway Patrol signed cooperation agreements with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement in advance of launching Operation Prairie Thunder, which initially targeted the city of Sioux Falls and surrounding areas. In total, troopers have questioned 81 people about their immigration status since the operation’s launch, and 57 people have been detained on behalf of federal immigration agents. 
Prairie Thunder patrols have led to a total of 419 arrests, according to the Department of Public Safety, and 271 of those arrests involved drug charges.  
The state never confirmed or denied plans to visit Brookings. Rhoden’s statement last week also said the state could not discuss “operational specifics” on future saturation patrols. 
The state routinely announces saturation patrols and sobriety checkpoints in certain areas, but news releases on such patrols only say which month they’ll take place.
Tuesday’s news release on Operation Prairie Thunder’s efforts in Sturgis and Winner said the saturation patrol resulted in 13 arrests and 25 total drug charges across the two cities, but did not mention the city of Brookings.

In response to a question from South Dakota Searchlight, Highway Patrol spokesman Brad Reiners confirmed that the Highway Patrol had not conducted a saturation patrol in Brookings.
Brookings Mayor Ope Niemeyer told South Dakota Searchlight that he was away from town on business last week, but said he hadn’t heard anything this week about extra troopers in town while he was away. He wouldn’t be able to comment on what impact, if any, the city’s announcement had on saturation patrol plans, he said.
The city had posted the notice to let residents know there could be additional officers in town, Brookings City Manager Paul Briseno told South Dakota Searchlight on Wednesday, and to clear up any confusion within the community about where those officers came from. There had been “questions in the community” about Operation Prairie Thunder, he said.
The state gave notice to Brookings that it intended to conduct its Dec. 17-19 saturation patrol, Briseno said, but did not reach out about its change of plans.
Rhoden spokeswoman Josie Harms did not immediately respond to a question on whether the city’s announcement of a patrol influenced decisions about where to send troopers.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-24 18:05:22+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Healey explores options to cover Mass. residents losing health insurance,Alison Kuznitz | State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/health-care/healey-explores-options-to-cover-mass-residents-losing-health-insurance/,"Healey said Tuesday that the loss of subsidies will translate into ""upwards of 350,000"" Mass. residents losing their health insurance.","AS THOUSANDS OF residents drop coverage or hunt for higher priced plans through the Massachusetts Health Connector, Gov. Maura Healey said Tuesday that officials are exploring how to connect residents with other insurance options.
“We’ve seen premiums expected to increase two or three times,” Healey said on GBH News’ Boston Public Radio. “Now the good news — and I hope to be out with more word on this soon — we’re working to see how we can come up with ways to cover people.”
Tuesday marked the Health Connector’s deadline for Bay Staters to sign up for plans that start on January 1. It’s been a tumultuous open enrollment cycle, with more than 10,000 people already dropping coverage as they grapple with sticker shock from premium spikes.
In the aftermath of the country’s longest government shutdown, Congress couldn’t reach a bipartisan deal to extend enhanced premium tax credits, which are slated to expire on December 31 under a 2022 federal law.
Healey said Tuesday that the loss of subsidies will translate into “upwards of 350,000” Massachusetts residents losing their health insurance. GBH co-host Jim Braude asked Healey to clarify whether her administration is examining whether those people “could be covered by the state in some fashion.”
“Well there are other programs, Jim. There are other health insurance plans,” Healey replied. “And we just want to make sure that, you know, those people, if they qualify for a different plan, that we’re able to get them into that.”
Analysts say Massachusetts residents will face additional health insurance losses in 2027, as new Medicaid work requirements take effect under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. A recent report advised the state to develop a model similar to the “COVID-era command center” to thwart coverage losses and ensure compliance with forthcoming federal regulations.
Massachusetts is expected to lose $3.5 billion annually once all health care components of that federal law take effect, according to Audrey Shelto of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation of Massachusetts. 
Healey did not directly answer a question from a caller who asked the governor to use her power and tap into the state’s more than $8 billion rainy day fund to stave off federal funding cuts. The caller, identified as Chris in Boston, said he has a disability and relies on MassHealth.
“I will say I am focused as we move into this budget season on making sure that we do what we need to do to protect the most vulnerable among us,” said Healey, who must file her fiscal 2027 budget proposal by January 28.
Later in the interview, Healey lamented that “health care is broken in this country.”
“And we’re seeing it every day with what’s happening with escalating health care costs for people and businesses around this country,” Healey said. “You know in Massachusetts, we can only work with the money that we have. And you know, you see the reports of hospitals struggling.”
The governor’s comments came after a veteran nurse called in to reflect on the closure of Carney Hospital in Dorchester during the Steward Health Care bankruptcy crisis. The caller, identified as Susan in Milton, told Healey Massachusetts has a “dearth of hospitals” and that she “had never seen health care so bad in my life.”
The state seized another Steward hospital, St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Brighton, by eminent domain in September 2024. Nurses at the facility — since renamed Boston Medical Center-Brighton — voted to authorize a three-day strike depending on how contract negotiations unfold, the Massachusetts Nurses Association announced Monday.
BMC Brighton nurses are concerned about potential plans to eliminate certain positions, curtail access to a pension plan, reduce paid time-off benefits, increase health insurance costs and not raise pay for the majority of nurses, the union said. The MNA said it represents 650 nurses at the hospital.
“To do this to our members, who already sacrificed so much during the turmoil of the Steward crisis and stuck with this hospital to ensure the safety of our community just adds further insult to the injury we have already suffered,” said Kate Cashman, a BMC Brighton nurse and bargaining committee co-chair.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gov.-Maura-Healey-at-the-Boston-Public-Library-on-Dec.-23-2025.webp?fit=1024%2C567&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-24 13:58:06.949556

(File photo)North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey is asking President Donald Trump not to pardon Greg Lindberg, who pleaded guilty last year to fraud and money laundering.
In a letter dated Tuesday, Dec. 23, Causey described Lindberg’s criminal conduct as deliberate and sustained.
“Mr. Lindberg’s criminal conduct was not incidental, technical, or victimless,” Causey wrote. 
Lindberg, 55, was once the biggest political donor to the North Carolina Republican Party. A former insurance executor, he pled guilty last year to leading a $2 billion fraud and money laundering scheme, which profited off of thousands of people who had insurance through his Durham-based companies.

In a separate trial, he was convicted of attempting to bribe Causey, a Republican, who wore a wire for the Federal Bureau of Investigations to record Lindberg. 
The full FBI investigation took 18 months. In his letter to Trump, Causey wrote that Lindberg was recorded attempting to bribe him, in his official capacity as insurance commissioner, to remove a senior department official who found and exposed “serious financial improprieties” in Lindberg’s insurance work.
“The evidence presented was not speculative. It was contemporaneously recorded, exhaustively investigated, and ultimately proven in federal court,” Causey wrote. 
“Mr. Lindberg’s actions were a calculated attempt to undermine regulatory oversight, evade accountability, and silence those whose duty it was to safeguard policyholders, retirees, and working families,” the letter continued.
Causey said Lindberg’s misconduct and its consequences did not end with his conviction.
Instead, the victims — including policyholders and employees – continue to face the fallout and repercussions associated with the wrongdoings. 
“These harms are real, ongoing, and irreparable,” Causey wrote. “A pardon would not undo them; it would compound them by signaling that wealth, influence, and persistence can outweigh accountability.”
The letter comes as Lindberg has hired Keith Schiller, a longtime Trump associate, to lobby for a pardon on his behalf. 
U.S. Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican representing North Carolina who is not seeking reelection in 2026, said in a social media post that he fully agrees with Causey.
“There should be no pardon given the troubling nature of this crime and all the evidence that supported the conviction,” Tillis wrote on X. 
During Trump’s first administration he granted a pardon to former N.C. Congressman Robin Hayes. Hayes, who was head of the N.C. Republican Party at the time, was accused of lying to FBI agents during the bribery investigation and had accepted a plea deal. In issuing the pardon, the White House said Hayes had the support of Tillis and other members of the state delegation.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG-3249-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-24 12:59:00.453913

Liz Brown will no longer chair the Indiana Senate’s Judiciary Committee after she earlier quit a Republican leadership position in protest of the congressional redistricting plan’s defeat.
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray’s office announced late Tuesday that Brown had been removed from the Judiciary chair post she had held since the 2021 legislative session.
Brown, R-Fort Wayne, was a vocal supporter of the redistricting proposal demanded by President Donald Trump that the Republican-dominated Senate rejected in a 31-19 vote on Dec. 11. The following day, Brown resigned as the Senate assistant majority floor leader in charge of communications.
Brown’s position as Judiciary Committee chair had more direct influence on legislation, such as the handling of an immigration crackdown bill she’s sponsoring that has resulted in a conflict between her and state Attorney General Todd Rokita.
Brown said in a statement that Bray informed her of her ouster on Tuesday.
“It is apparent that effects linger from our failure to draw fair maps that would promote conservative Hoosier voices in Washington,” Brown said. “Senator Bray is utilizing his right to redefine Senate leadership after a tumultuous Fall. As I’ve said, our caucus has rebuilding to do to repair communication and trust with voters, and I will continue to do that.”
Bray’s office did not immediately reply Wednesday to a request for comment about why he removed Brown from the position.
Brown is also in a primary fight for her Senate seat.
Sen. Cyndi Carrasco, R-Indianapolis, will replace Brown as Judiciary Committee chair when the legislative session resumes in early January.
Carrasco, who joined Brown in voting to support the redistricting plan, is in her third year as a senator and is vice president and general counsel at the University of Indianapolis. She served as state inspector general under Gov. Mike Pence and was the unsuccessful Republican candidate for Marion County prosecutor in 2022.
No other leadership changes have been made among Senate Republicans following the vote on redistricting, which the GOP senators opposed by a 21-19 margin.
Senate Majority Floor Leader Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, was another outspoken redistricting supporter but has maintained his high-level post and memberships on the Senate’s influential appropriations and tax committees.

He spent his days surrounded by those in suits and tidy haircuts advocating for change, sticking out intentionally to draw attention to his cause. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Morgan Walker Brown.","Died Dec. 16, 2025
Colchester, Vermont

Morgan Walker Brown died peacefully surrounded by love on Dec. 16. A person of enduring determination and wise compassion, to the very end he used his prose and his voice to advocate for people in need. Morgan inspired many to follow in his example of empathy, kindness and compassion. 
Among the many hats that Morgan wore, he was primarily a writer and activist in the Montpelier community. In recent years, he even began to show up around the community in a Santa suit to bring a smile and joy to those often forgotten in his role of Wandering Santa; this role had started as a small act of love for his visiting granddaughter and blossomed into a much larger deed as he subsequently brought holiday cheer to homeless encampments during the coldest months. His poetry was read aloud in press conferences and by legislators in the State House. Most importantly he presented it as a tool to advocate for people to have shelter and housing. 
Morgan spent many years experiencing homelessness in the latter half of his life. He was never afraid to push people to truly understand disability justice. Even while unsheltered, he never missed an opportunity to advocate for those who had less than he did. He spent his days surrounded by those in suits and tidy haircuts advocating for change, sticking out intentionally to draw attention to his cause. Morgan was not paid for this work; it was not a job but a calling in every sense of the word. It was who he was and was in every stitch of his being. 
After decades of experiencing homelessness, he found what he recently referred to as his “forever home,” which brought him stability, real community and deep friendships. He lived his life out in a small studio apartment that was “enough” for him. He had longed for all of this while he lived unsheltered and worked his whole life for all people to have the privilege of a place to call home. In the end of his life he was clear that he had found peace. 
Morgan leaves behind his beloved cat Cleopatra whom he adopted from the Central Vermont Humane Society 11 years ago. She lives up to her name as the Queen of his house. She brought him so much comfort and love, especially in the final year of his life in which she bestowed upon him strength and the ability to bear his trials with grace and dignity. She was most definitely his heart. 
He is survived by his siblings Alison Lawson and Jeff Hackett, his two children Justin Brown and Alex Grey, his daughter-in-law Rina Brown, and his beloved granddaughter Kirana Brown. 
And also, by his many friends, his beloved community, and those who have not yet found home. 
There is no better way to represent his wishes except in his own words. Morgan asked for all of us left behind to bring his empathy, love and compassion into all aspects of our lives. His challenge to us is to care for those who are experiencing homelessness; to fight for humane policies that treat all people like fellow human beings, every single day. 
In 2021 he wrote this poem while there was a twenty-seven-night protest on the statehouse steps to keep people sheltered:
In Lieu of Flowers 
(Remember and Care for the Living) 
For those living unhoused, 
abandoned to the streets, 
left to live in the woods, 
underneath bridges, 
sleep in dumpsters and the like; 
it is far too late to think of, 
remember fondly, send flowers 
or otherwise honor and memorialize them 
after they have languished and died from lying wet, 
frozen, alone and forgotten, 
due to deliberate indifference 
as well as from a lack 
of sufficient caring and empathy 
Morgan Brown fought for people, he represented people, and he showed up for people. In his final days, he asked that his legacy be carried on in all of us. Let us show up as he would have. In his own words, let us care for and remember the living each time we think of him. Morgan asked that donations in his honor be made to End Homelessness Vermont and Another Way. 
A memorial service will be held at a later date.

If we’re being honest, 2025 did not start out great. For basically the whole month of January, a series of wildfires raged across Los Angeles, killing hundreds (more on that number below). On the other side of the country, an Arctic blast brought historic snowfall and bitter cold deep into the South. Then Donald Trump took office for a second time on January 20 and immediately began to unravel the climate progress the United States had made under Joe Biden.
The rest of the year, which is on track to tie for the second hottest on record, was just as momentous, bringing all manner of climate events — some good, some bad. In a lot of ways, we’ll look back on 2025 as a critical moment, both for the environment and humanity. Here’s why.
 A firestorm consumes Los Angeles

Starting on January 7, wildfires continued for weeks and burned 78 square miles across Los Angeles, driven by strong winds and fueled by extra-dry vegetation. (The conflagration had climate change’s fingerprints all over it.) The fires destroyed more than 16,000 structures and forced more than 180,000 people to evacuate. In part because the blazes were burning through extremely affluent neighborhoods, the economic damages are estimated to be between $76 billion and $131 billion. The fires were 1 of 14 billion-dollar disasters to hit the U.S. in the first half of 2025, according to the research group Climate Central. (In May, the Trump administration announced that the federal government would stop tracking billion-dollar disasters, an essential way to assess climate risks.)
Officially, the fires killed 30 people. But this year, researchers got a better idea of just how bad wildfire smoke is for public health, as it exacerbates conditions like asthma and cardiovascular disease. In August, scientists published a new estimate of the L.A. wildfire death toll that factored in fatalities caused by the resulting haze: 440, or even higher. The next month, other researchers estimated that wildfire smoke already kills 40,000 Americans each year, which could soar to 71,000 by 2050 if humanity’s carbon emissions remain high. The flames themselves, it seems, kill but a small fraction of the fire’s total victims.
 Trump takes takes a hatchet to environmental regulations

Los Angeles was still burning when Donald Trump was sworn in for a second time and quickly began overhauling government agencies and axing environmental rules. The Trump administration’s deep cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, could leave communities even more vulnerable to the threat of wildfire smoke. Later in the summer, Trump signed the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill into law, which among other things tore up the only climate plan the U.S. had. That killed the tax credits that consumers were using to electrify their homes and offset the cost of EVs, and destroyed the capital that Indigenous tribes were using to develop clean energy projects. (Also see Grist’s recent coverage of the weird ways that Trump has been changing the culture and language around energy and climate change.)
 Extreme flooding is here to stay

Just as climate change is making wildfires worse, it’s actually making rainfall more catastrophic, too. That dynamic played out tragically on the Fourth of July weekend when flash flooding struck central Texas, most devastatingly in Kerr County, killing at least 135 people. Part of the problem is that, generally speaking, the warmer the atmosphere gets, the more moisture it can hold and eventually dump as rain. Making matters worse, the Gulf of Mexico has been exceptionally warm of late, which sent still more moisture into the atmosphere above Texas. (The same factors were fueling gnarly storms across the central and southern U.S. in the spring.) The resulting devastation is forcing a disaster-response reckoning not just in Kerr County but in similarly vulnerable communities across the U.S. Really, the world over is struggling to cope with extreme flooding: Storms and cyclones have killed more than 1,750 people in Asia since mid-November.
 Data centers emerge as a major environmental threat

In 2025, another kind of human-made environmental disaster garnered growing scrutiny: data centers. In February, we reported on Georgia joining other states in extending the life of fossil-fuel power plants (which the Trump administration has also been forcing to stay open) to meet the tech industry’s extreme demand for electricity. The AI boom is hurting consumers, too: All that extra infrastructure is driving up electricity prices for households, especially in data-center hotspot states. The industry is such an environmental mess that Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, suggested this summer that we build data centers in space instead.
Data centers are creating a water crisis, too: Nationwide in 2023, the facilities used 17 billion gallons of water directly to cool equipment, but they required more than 10 times that amount indirectly because they use so much electricity that’s generated elsewhere with steam. Accordingly, researchers at Cornell University this year found that the industry can reduce both its water and electricity footprints by building data centers where there’s abundant wind or solar energy, like West Texas.
 Earth crosses an ominous planetary boundary and tipping point

This year, scientists hit us with a one-two punch of bad environmental news: the crossing of the first “tipping point” and the breaching of another “planetary boundary.” A tipping point is when an Earth system suddenly and often irreversibly changes into something dramatically different, while a planetary boundary is a threshold that keeps the planet’s environments hospitable to life. Think of it like driving down a road, where the tipping point is an imminent cliff and a planetary boundary is a big sign warning of the drop.
In September, scientists announced that the seventh of nine boundaries had been crossed, this time the steady acidification of the oceans. (A quarter of humanity’s CO2 emissions have been absorbed by seawater, which creates carbonic acid.) That acidification is interfering with the ability of many organisms, like corals, mollusks, and crustaceans, to build their shells.
And speaking of corals, less than a month later, another team of researchers announced that the precipitous decline of reef ecosystems has pushed the planet to its first major tipping point. In the last 50 years, half of the world’s live coral cover has disappeared, as acidification pairs with rising ocean temperatures. All that stress causes corals to release the symbiotic algae that provide them energy, leading to coral bleaching. Even though corals are tipping, scientists are still breeding them in labs, hopefully finding varieties that can better stand the heat.
 Countries cop-out at COP

You’d think that with such dire news about tipping points and planetary boundaries coming out, the world would get more ambitious about lowering its emissions. But 10 years after the Paris Agreement — which set out to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, or in an ideal world, 1.5 degrees C — countries at the United Nations’ annual COP30 climate conference in November failed to come to an agreement on winding down fossil fuels. So we’re on track to get between 2.3 and 2.8 degrees of catastrophic warming by the end of this century, according to the U.N.’s own math. Every fraction of a degree means ever more severe effects of climate change — melting ice, sea level rise, extreme heat — and the further we go past 1.5 degrees, the more carbon we’ll have to remove from the atmosphere to bring temperatures back down to a safe level.
 Hurricane season ends without a single US landfall

This spring, forecasters were looking at high ocean temperatures in the Atlantic — the fuel for hurricanes — and predicting an above-average season with around 10 named storms. But as the summer stretched on, the hurricanes that seemed headed for the mainland U.S. instead turned back out to sea. Hurricane season ended on November 30 without a single hurricane making landfall in the country for the first time in a decade, thanks to some atmospheric quirks above the Southeast.
The Caribbean, though, did not fare so well this year. At the end of October, Hurricane Melissa — supercharged by climate change — ravaged Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Because of extra-hot ocean waters, the storm’s maximum sustained wind speeds doubled from 70 mph to 140 mph in just 18 hours. So while it’s unusual for the U.S. to escape landfall for a whole season, tropical cyclones will only get worse from here as ocean temperatures climb: This was only the second year in recorded history to have spawned three or more Category 5 hurricanes.
 Climate action has become unstoppable in many ways

Heading into 2026, it’s easy to look at all this and say, “Well, we’re borked.” Yes, the environment is buckling under the increasingly heavy burden of climate change. And yes, the Trump administration will continue its war on climate action. But unstoppable changes — the good kind — are also in motion that will help improve public health and reduce emissions, no matter what the federal government decrees.
For one, those environmental tipping points have positive counterparts that are now unfolding, thanks to local incentives and national policies elsewhere. The market share for new electric vehicles in Oslo, Norway, for instance, exploded from 13.6 percent to 95.8 percent in a decade, according to a report released in October. Solar panels have gotten so cheap that it’s now more economical to deploy renewables than to build more fossil fuel infrastructure. Accordingly, renewables are growing like crazy in the U.S. and beyond, with a new report finding that wind and solar are more than meeting the global rise in demand for electricity. Indeed, in the first half of 2025, renewables generated more electricity around the world than coal for the first time. The leaders of Africa’s growing economies, meanwhile, plotted a bold strategy this year to become a continent of climate solutions.
And keep in mind that in the absence of federal U.S. action on climate change, states and cities have stepped up to fill the void and have even increased their ambitions this year: They set their own emissions-reduction targets, regulated their own utilities, bolstered public transportation, drafted energy-efficient building codes — the list goes on and on. Yes, 2025 was an ominous year, both environmentally and politically, but that doesn’t mean that all is lost in 2026.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-24 17:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Advocates call on lawmakers to make changes to probation system,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/24/advocates-call-on-lawmakers-to-make-changes-to-probation-system/,"Legislation was introduced this year, but it never received a public hearing. Advocates want lawmakers to consider a similar bill in 2026.","Advocates, formerly incarcerated people and family members of incarcerated men and women are calling on state lawmakers to put forward a bill that would prevent people on probation from being sent back to prison for minor technical violations.
Legislation was introduced this past spring by Rep. Josh Hall, D-Hartford, but it failed to receive a public hearing. Advocates are urging lawmakers to consider a similar bill during the coming 2026 session.
Hall’s proposal sought to prevent people from being automatically sent back to prison for non-criminal violations of parole — things like missed appointments, failed drug tests, missing curfew or treatment or leaving the state without permission.
Hall’s bill also suggested introducing a system of “earned time credit” where people’s probation sentences could be shortened for complying with the conditions of their release. It would also have removed the fees associated with probation, including a $200 supervision fee and additional fees that vary depending on which program the probationer is enrolled in. (The $200 fee is usually waived by the court, and that program fees for sex offender programs are based on a sliding scale depending on a person’s income, according to a spokesperson for the Judicial Branch.)
Advocates and lawmakers gathered to discuss the issue at the Elmwood Community Center in West Hartford last week.
At the event, Talia Orr, co-founder of Seniors in Hartford Organizing for Power, told the story of her grandson, who is currently incarcerated. Several years ago, at age 28, he was arrested and placed on probation for three-and-a-half years. 
For the first two-and-a-half years, Orr said, her grandson was doing well until he missed a dose of medication. He missed a required health care appointment — a violation of his probation — and was sent back to prison for two months on a $50,000 bond. Orr declined to give her grandson’s name, citing concerns for his safety.
Orr said after her grandson was released, he checked into a rehab center. But his probation officer failed to inform the court, she said. When her grandson missed a required court date, a warrant was issued for his arrest and he was incarcerated again, this time on a $500,000 bond. 
Orr told the Connecticut Mirror that after about 30 days, things were straightened out with the court and her grandson was released. But in September of this year, his probation was revoked after being arrested again on another technical violation. He took a plea deal and was sentenced to three-and-a-half years. 
“If he makes it through all the restriction and pressures, including receiving proper medication and reentry support, that will really help stabilize him,” Orr said at the event. “He will be 37 years old.” 
Alex Brown, who is now working toward a masters degree in social work at the University of Connecticut, said at last week’s event that she also faced challenges while on probation. She’d spent four-and-a-half years at York Correctional Institution after being charged with vehicular manslaughter at age 19. At age 25, she was released on probation, and vowed she would never be incarcerated again. 
“ For many women, the fear of a [probation] violation shapes everything. A missed curfew, a forgotten permission slip, a phone call that doesn’t go through, any of it can mean being sent back,” Brown said. 
After years on probation, Brown said she received a violation for having police contact during a domestic violence incident. She was arrested and incarcerated for 48 hours. 
“ When I was originally incarcerated, I used to watch women come back again and again, and I just didn’t understand why. I used to think if someone just gave me a chance, I would never come back,” Brown said. “But I went back too — and it’s not because I was dangerous. It’s not because I committed a new crime, but because technical violations function as a revolving door in the system.” 
For Brown, the violation also led to an extension of her probation period. She has now been on probation for nine years. 
“Technical violations function as a revolving door in the system.” Alex Brown
Lawmakers who were present at the meeting expressed concerns that probation violations are required to be listed on applications for food assistance, known as SNAP. 
State Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, a member of the Judiciary Committee, told CT Mirror that she planned to rally other lawmakers to pressure the legislature’s Judiciary Committee chairs to take up the bill when the 2026 legislative session begins in February. 
“ The system’s broken, and people are just trying to do their best and keep getting punished,” said Gilchrest. “ People should not be incarcerated for these technical violations. It just feels like we keep moving back the starting line.”
Gilchrest said that as chair of the Human Services Committee, she could also introduce a separate bill that would address one of the concerns of advocates — the fact that people have to report any violations of probation on their applications for SNAP benefits, making them ineligible for SNAP.  
“And to hear … you missed a letter, or you got caught doing something that’s not putting the public in danger, and now you’re going to lose your food and you’re going to be put back in jail … that seems absurd,” said Gilchrest. 
Rep. Kate Farrar, D-West Hartford, who also attended the event, said she sees a clear need to boost funding for reentry centers, which provide assistance to returning citizens. “It’s really about making sure that as folks are coming back into their communities, that they actually have a fair shot at being able to support themselves,” Farrar said. 
Sen. Gary Winfield, a New Haven Democrat who co-chairs the Judiciary Committee, told CT Mirror in an interview that he supported the concept of the bill. He said depending on the probation officer, parole violations could be “teachable moments” for both the officer and the person on probation, or they could be used as overly constrictive ways to control the probationer. 
“It’s an important subject that I think should be raised,” he said.  
But Winfield said he couldn’t promise the committee would introduce a bill, given the large number of issues they have to consider in a short timeframe. 
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, said in an email to CT Mirror that while he was “sensitive” to the concerns about probation, which had been discussed in the past, the bill had failed to get widespread support from lawmakers. 
“Perhaps it will be looked upon more favorably during the upcoming session that begins in early February,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0671-Copy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 12:59:00.453913

Marcel Andrew Lapierre, 88, passed away peacefully at home on Dec. 13, 2025.
Marcel was born on the Lapierre Dairy Farm in Shelburne on Jan. 29, 1937 to Euclide and Yvonne (Roy) Lapierre. A true Vermonter, he embraced the values of helping others, working hard and taking care of his family.
He worked for over 30 years delivering ice cream for Sealtest Ice Cream, Bove-Fagan Ice Cream Distributors, and West Lynn Creamery to chain stores in Vermont and New York. Following his “retirement” he worked for Lily Transportation and Ryder as a transfer driver, and finally for Bond and O’Reilly delivering auto parts. He continued working until the age of 83! Nothing made him happier than being behind the wheel of a tractor or a truck.
On Oct. 14, 1972 he married Joyce LaGrow, who predeceased him in 2023. He was also predeceased by his parents, sister Yolande Turmel and her husband Robert, and brother-in-law George Bouffard.
Marcel is survived by his daughter Melissa of South Burlington, beloved “grandcat” Mudpie, sister Jacqueline Bouffard of Colchester, and brothers Claude (Gail) of Shelburne and Lucien (Mary-Lou) of Jericho, as well as many nieces, nephews, friends and neighbors.
We are incredibly grateful to the wonderful nurses at UVM Home Health and Hospice, who enabled him to remain at home during his final weeks. Melissa would especially like to thank Gale Smith, RN, for his kindness and comfort at the very end.

Lowell, Massachusetts
Died Dec. 9, 2025
Lincoln, Massachusetts

Linda Kelliher Samets of Charlotte, Vermont, and New York, N.Y., passed away peacefully in Lincoln, Massachusetts on Dec. 9, 2025, following complications from recent surgery. A beloved wife, mother, sister, artist, horsewoman and friend, she was 79.
Linda was born on March 8, 1946, in Lowell, Massachusetts. The fifth of nine children, she attended Concord-Carlisle High School, where her artistic gifts emerged. She graduated from Massachusetts College of Art and Design (MassArt), which nurtured her creativity and helped set the course for her career and life. After college, Linda worked at an advertising agency in Boston before moving into a graphic design role at WGBH.
After moving to Vermont, Linda opened a one-room design studio in Burlington. At the time, she had been turned away from local agencies that told her that her work was too unconventional. But Linda knew better. She trusted her instincts. And so, she created her own place, her own path, and, eventually, her own company.
Over the decades that followed, Linda, together with her partner in life and business, Yoram, transformed her small design firm into Kelliher Samets Volk (now KSV), a nationally recognized marketing agency with offices in New York and Burlington. Her creativity, intuition, professionalism, and humanity influenced generations of designers, writers, and strategists.
Beyond her work at KSV, Linda was dedicated to numerous community organizations in Vermont, including Ohavi Zedek Synagogue, Special Olympics, Burlington City Arts and the Gailer School.
Linda had a deep love for animals and often said she preferred their company over that of most people. While she always had dogs and cats at her Charlotte home, her greatest passion was for horses. For many years, she owned and operated Windrunner Farm, a 30-horse barn in Shelburne, and she continued riding four or five days a week well into her seventies. For Linda, riding served as both a grounding influence and a source of joy.
After retiring from KSV, Linda’s life revolved around her family, horses, and her home in Charlotte, where she lived for over four decades. Though she described her daily routine in retirement as “puttering,” in reality, it was action-packed: she walked three miles a day (tracked carefully), painted in her home studio, cooked dinner for herself and Yoram every night, and enjoyed cards, dominoes, and any TV show with enough horses in it. On Friday evenings, she and Yoram brought Shabbat into their home, lighting candles and saying prayers, finding purpose in something bigger than themselves.
In addition to her husband, Yoram, Linda is survived by her daughter, Alex Samets, of Baltimore, Maryland, and her son, Theo Samets, of Los Angeles, California. She took great joy in seeing her children become the adults they are today. In recent months, she looked forward to becoming a grandmother and spending more time in Baltimore.
She is also survived by her sisters, Mardie Luppold, of Shirley, Massachusetts, and Leslie Luppold, of Concord, Massachusetts; her brothers, David (Christine) Luppold, of Concord, Massachusetts, Jonathan (Denise) Luppold, of Maynard, Massachusetts, and Jay (Deborah) Luppold, of Concord, New Hampshire; her brother-in-law, Robert Marquis, of Concord, Massachusetts; her sister-in-law, Carole Smith, of Portland, Oregon; and many beloved nieces and nephews. Linda was predeceased by her sisters, Priscilla Marquis and Deborah Luppold, and by her brother, Richard Luppold.
In lieu of flowers, contributions in Linda’s memory may be made to Ohavi Zedek Synagogue, a community she valued deeply, or to the Graham Equestrian Center.

(Photo by 	mroland/Getty Images)A supermoon — large, full, near the eastern horizon, with a golden, orange glow. The moon was at perigee, the closest point to the earth, and it looked massive and so bright that I thought the Kauffmans had installed a yard light. Of course not. The Kauffmans have no electricity here in Buggy Land, in the middle of the Old Order Amish settlement.
Frost Moon. Beaver Moon. Digging Moon. Deer Rutting Moon. It arrives just about the same time as the first frost. It marks the time when the beavers are preparing their lodges for winter.
And the time when animals are foraging for nuts and digging dens. The time when bucks abandon caution, chasing after and mating with does. The time when your car might collide with that deer on the road, smashing your grill, pitching the wild animal up into the air, only to land on your vehicle, moon-cratering your hood.
But I was the only one with a car in the Kauffmans’ barnyard. A horse and cart rattled in stuffed with young Amish neighbor women, their bonnets slipped down over their prayer caps. The women had ridden several miles in the dark, their slow-moving vehicle reflector on the back of the cart, their head lamps and a lantern in the front, and the illumination of the moon.
“Hello!” The Kauffmans called, parents and four children pouring out of their side door.
Inside, the house was decorated with a big sparkly blue banner hanging on the wall that read:
H-A-P-P-Y B-I-R-T-H-D-A-Y!
My childhood birthdays were fun and celebratory. Filled with small gifts, a birthday cake, parties and games of bobbing for apples and pin the tail on the donkey.
“This is the day they gave babies away, with every pound of tea,” my mother sang every year on my birthday, and we giggled and laughed together. Even as a child, I understood the humor and irony of the dark old folk song.
But as childhood moved into adulthood and my mother’s light passed too soon into the great beyond, birthdays became quieter and more solitary. A nice walk in the woods with my dog was all the celebration I desired. But this year was a milestone birthday, and I was happy to join a family who wanted to celebrate it.
The Kauffmans’ dining table was extended, filling the room, with about 15 wooden chairs of various sizes and shapes pushed into place. A veggie train, a coupling of halved green, yellow and red peppers stuffed with carrot and celery sticks, radishes, broccoli, and dip, chugged down the center of the table, its wheels, round slices of the tillage radishes that the Kauffmans grew as cover crops in their garden, tooth-picked in place. The engine was a cucumber with two carrot stumps for smoke stacks with cauliflower florets as puffs of smoke.
We all had healthy servings of the grilled chicken that Martha Yutzy had brought in a Swahn’s insulated cooler that kept the chicken warmer than any device I’d ever experienced. The train disappeared quickly, the children rushing to dismantle the cars, popping the raw vegetables in their mouths. Then came the dessert, a rich chocolate pan cake with white frosting swirling across the top.
“Now let’s sing for Mary,” Elmer said. “What song would you like?”
The guests were surprised I knew the common Amish hymns. But there was nothing I liked more than to hear my neighbors sing. A few years before, when Bertha, the mother and grandmother of this family, had lain dying in her living room, relatives gathered around her bed every night to sing.
Connecting to the divine through song

A cappella, in four-part harmony, their voices drifted through the window screens and floated toward me across the soybean field on the humid, summer air. I sat in front of my house and listened, every word clear and resonant, carrying the very intent to soothe and console. After several months, I began to recognize the hymns and their cadences. I couldn’t always translate the German, but I became familiar with the words and their accompanying tunes.
At the Kauffmans’ home birthday party, the parents, children, and invited guests belted out the hymns, the notes, represented by shapes in their hymnals, strong and bold, but nimble enough to harmonize with the others. I sat back and absorbed it all, singing along when I knew the words. These were the same hymns sung to Bertha, but this rendition was so much more upbeat and joyful.
We cleaned up all the dishes, washing and drying them by hand, plates, glasses, cups and saucers stacked back in the cupboard.
Then I ducked. A tennis ball whizzed over my head. The Kauffman boys had donned their baseball gloves and had taken positions in an imaginary infield in the living room. The ball flew back and forth, back and forth, thumping into the pockets of their gloves. The inning finally over, Menno, the 4-year-old, disappeared into the back room.
A few minutes later, Menno returned, waving a yellow flying sky lantern, or a trance balloon. Sky lanterns are paper lights that lie flat in their wrappers, but once you ignite a flame, they billow out and can be launched like hot-air balloons.
We all stepped outside with the lantern, the light of the supermoon bouncing off the metal roof of the goat shed. I’d never seen a sky lantern before. I knew it couldn’t be environmentally correct because it would eventually turn into litter. In another drier landscape, it could even be a fire hazard. But Martha lit the flame, the lantern lifting into the air, and I was immediately entranced.
Up over the goat shed, the lantern glided in the eastern sky, over the pasture that had caught many Kauffman softballs in the pocket of its glove. Up and up and away toward the neighbor’s pond where a few deer were bedding down for the night, drifting from us, smaller and smaller, the flame sparking and beginning to burn up the paper.
“It looks like a star,” I said.
“It’s a star!” The Kauffman boys echoed.
“It’s the Star of Bethlehem!” I said.
“The Star of Bethlehem,” the boys agreed.
Then the lantern seemed to stop, a tiny speck in comparison to the huge round moon that shone brighter and brighter, its golden glow bathing us in light in one of the darkest skies in the state. The lantern hung below the blue sparkle of the Pleiades star cluster, flickering, twinkling, in the constellation of Taurus.

I imagined a horse pawing, a beaver digging in, a deer flying through the air just like the lantern. All the folklore, the mythology, the religious imagery and beliefs throughout all the cultures of the world, were present in the night sky, guiding us to the place where we were meant to be.
Quietly at first, then louder and louder, we sang:
Oh, Beautiful Star of Bethlehem
Shining afar through shadows dim,
Giving the light for those who long have gone,
Guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay
Oh, Beautiful Star of Bethlehem shine on.
Oh, Beautiful Star of Bethlehem (Star of Bethlehem,)
Shine upon us until the glory dawns.
Give us a light to guide the way
Unto the land of perfect day
Oh, Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on (shine on.)

‘They’re gonna price me out of my home’
Once his dream home, Brian Massie said after 20 years, it’s turned into a nightmare.
“I saw that the property taxes had gone up 40%,” Massie said.
The Concord Township homeowner has been frustrated with bills, ones he never thought in his nearly 80 years of life would get so high over the past two decades.
“If we stay on this path of ever-increasing property taxes, they’re gonna price me out of my home,” he said.
State lawmakers say they know it’s a problem, which is why they are cheering some brand-new laws.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has signed a slew of bills aiming to relieve property tax burdens.
DeWine says he wants to, “Fairly achieve property tax relief and at the same time, protect our schools, our police, our fire, and our essential other services.
House Bills 186 and 335 limit how much money school districts can get from rising home values — tying tax increases to inflation. These bills passed both chambers in a bipartisan fashion.
H.B. 309 allows county budget commissions to reduce property tax levies. It mainly passed along party lines, but a few Democrats joined the Republicans to pass it, while several members of the GOP voted no.
H.B. 129 implements a check on tax increases from school levies.
H.B. 124 gives county auditors greater oversight in using property tax sales information for determining property valuations.
“Property taxes in Ohio will be more understandable, and they’ll be more predictable for those taxpayers who pay property taxes,” said Pat Tiberi, the chair of the governor’s property tax working group.
But Massie isn’t impressed.
“Too little, too late,” he said. “If they can’t do anything for the seniors, that was sort of the straw that, as they say, broke the camel’s back.”
Ballot proposal
I asked Massie if he felt that Ohioans needed to take matters into their own hands because their representatives aren’t listening.
“That was basically our thought,” he said.
Massie is a part of the Committee to Abolish Ohio Property Taxes, currently collecting signatures to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot. Advocates from Citizens for Property Tax Reform, another group with the same mission, said it has collected more than 100,000 signatures already.
Lawmakers are worried, which accounts for the sudden action after years of letting taxes grow.
“I have to say that the threat of a ballot initiative is part of the thing that’s driving this,” House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said.
Those efforts are not good enough, some Ohioans have told News 5 and testified at the statehouse over the last year.
“These bills that were just signed into law, are they enough to gain your support?” I asked Massie.
“No, absolutely not,” he said.
The groups are trying to get the amendment on the November 2026 ballot.
The Committee to Abolish Ohio Property Taxes has already gotten signatures from the required 44 of 88 counties needed and has hundreds of petitioners deployed across the state, Massie said. It needs about 415,000 valid signatures and is aiming to submit about 620,000.
Education
Schools have been arguing for months now that these bills take away much-needed dollars for kids when they are already facing cuts from the state in expected funding.
“We’ll talk about [cutting] staffing, which impacts what programs we might consider to remain here at Parma and those that we might not be able to support,” Parma Schools Superintendent Dr. Scott J. Hunt told WEWS/Ohio Capital Journal. “Certainly, those things impact the quality of education we can provide for our students.”
While Massie said that schools just need to be more responsible with their money, the leaders of Citizens for Property Tax Reform have a more sympathetic outlook. Organizer Beth Blackmarr said that lawmakers have spent hundreds of millions on a stadium for the Cleveland Browns, rather than fairly funding schools or focusing on property taxes.
This summer, state lawmakers gave the Browns a $600 million performance grant for their new Brook Park stadium using unclaimed funds. Ohio’s Division of Unclaimed Funds currently oversees about $4.9 billion in funds, including forgotten bank accounts, utility deposits, uncashed checks and more.
Blackmarr said that the time spent finagling this proposal would have been better spent on problems that citizens are facing.
Districts worry that the ballot proposal will render public schools obsolete.

An Ohio judge has temporarily blocked the state from handing over $600 million to the Cleveland Browns for their new stadium.
Attorney Jeff Crossman is cheering Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Bill Sperlazzato’s ruling — a temporary restraining order (TRO) that will prohibit the state from using the cash, which comes from Ohioans, for the next two weeks.
“We’re pleased that the judge saw things the way we have been seeing them all along, which is that the state’s taking of this property is likely improper,” Crossman said after the hearing. “The process for which they’ve failed to undertake needs to be followed, and the state court judge hit the pause button to say that ‘Hey, let’s verify what they’re doing is actually constitutional.'”
This summer, state lawmakers gave the Browns a $600 million performance grant for their new Brook Park stadium using unclaimed funds. Ohio’s Division of Unclaimed Funds currently oversees about $4.9 billion in funds, including forgotten bank accounts, utility deposits, uncashed checks and more.
To check for unclaimed funds, visit unclaimedfunds.ohio.gov.
Previously, attorneys for the state argued that they are allowed to take the money, and some lawmakers claim that Crossman’s team is “forum shopping,” as a federal judge just shot down a request for a preliminary injunction.
In testimony in early December at the federal court, Unclaimed Funds Finance Director Amy Schellhammer said that they have not provided any direct notice to Ohioans, nor is it posted on their website, that $1.7-1.9 billion in unclaimed funds will be taken on Jan. 1, 2026.
A hearing for a preliminary injunction, a possible block while the case is litigated, is set for January 8.
We have reached out to the Browns for comment.

He planned to run to Columbia by Sunday.
Davis’ goal was possible for the first time this year after nonprofit Palmetto Conservation Foundation completed a 218-mile stretch of paths connecting the state’s capital to its coast. Over the next five to seven years, the nonprofit wants to finish its 30-year goal of connecting about 520 miles of trail extending across the state.
The stretch from Columbia to Awendaw marked a major piece of that. The final, 26-mile piece, named Boyd Passage after the prominent Columbia family that sponsored it, opened to the public over the summer.
400-mile Palmetto Trail gets a boost in state aid to connect, maintain the pieces

Soon after that trail opened, Davis, who has done long trail runs in the past, considered trying to run the whole thing.
“‘Hey, we’ve got a very unique section of trail here that comes right into Columbia, and that would be really cool to do,’” the 46-year-old recalled thinking.
Because of the time commitment, however, the idea seemed too far-fetched. Davis put the idea in the back of his mind for several months, until he attended a banquet for nondenominational Christian ministry Young Life and began to come up with a plan.
Touched by the stories of children the ministry helped, Davis decided to run the entire 218 miles in three days as a fundraiser to pay camp fees. People could pledge between 50 cents and $10 per mile or opt to make a single donation.
By the end of his trek, Davis raised nearly $12,000 — enough to send at least two dozen children to camp, he said.
Davis’ story
Running past palmetto trees on the fishing inlet of Awendaw, Davis set off in the middle of the night toward his home in Blythewood, just north of Columbia.
What stood out to Davis as he made his way across the state was how different the trail could be from one moment to the next.

He’d run through glades of pine trees, their needles blanketing the path, followed miles later by swampland, cypress knees jutting out of the water on either side of him. In what felt like moments, that could turn into hardwood trees, shedding their leaves for the winter.
For about 47 miles, he ran through remote swampland, where he saw not a hint of civilization until the trail neared U.S. Highway 52 near Bonneau, and he watched the cars whiz past. At other points, such as when he reached Columbia, the trail turned into sidewalks along busy streets.
“The varying terrain that you encounter along the trail, it’s a little bit of everything,” Davis said. “I think it represents South Carolina well.”
Davis made it as far as Eutawville, about 100 miles into the run, before painful blisters covering his feet forced him to stop. His goal of completing the trek in just three days turned out to be too ambitious for his body, with the rapid pace causing severe pain.
Even though he knew he wasn’t going to be able to finish the run by Sunday, Davis didn’t want to quit. So, the team of about 15 people who signed up to accompany him and bring him meals stepped in. Davis hopped in the van they’d loaded up with gear, and his team did the next 110 miles or so as a relay race, he said.
Davis met up with them again outside Columbia’s Fort Jackson. Ignoring the painful blisters on his feet, Davis ran the final seven miles with his crew behind him.
Near the end, Davis, a civil engineer and road designer, deviated from the designated path slightly to run up South Main Street toward the Statehouse. He was on the team that designed the renovations on South Main, which opened in July. With a police escort behind him, he knew this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance, he said.
“For a brief moment, all the pain went away, and it was pure joy that I was going again,” Davis said. “Shortly thereafter, reality set in, and it was a struggle. But I made it that last seven miles.”
Davis reached the Columbia Canal just before 3 p.m. Saturday. At the time, he told himself he would never try that again, but just a day later, he was already thinking about his next trip, he said.
Once the full trail is finished, Davis would like to try and run the length of the state. He acknowledged that would mean slowing down from his attempted breakneck pace, which would mean asking more from the people who volunteered to help him from his fitness group.
Any sort of extended trail run involves a lot of coordination to get food, water and other gear while on the trail. For safety reasons, Davis likes to keep a second runner with him as often as possible, especially at night.
But if he could figure out the logistics, he would do it, he said.
“I would love that, more than anything,” he said. “The biggest part of it is time.”
The Palmetto Trail
Davis’ weekend run is the sort of thing the trail’s stewards envisioned. Of course, few people are going to run the entire trail, but connecting the pieces gives people the option to enjoy it however they please, said Mary Roe, the nonprofit’s executive director.
“Whether it’s a small, 10-minute hike or a 10-mile hike, the trail is a natural resource for people in the state to enjoy,” Roe said.
The trail still has some significant gaps, Roe said. One big obstacle is the Tyger River in the Upstate, which the trail must cross for completion. That means building a bridge, which is an expensive prospect, though how much will depend on the exact plans.
For the moment, staff are focused on expanding the trail out from Columbia, past Lake Murray, and to Newberry, which is about 40 miles northwest by road, Roe said. That will give people a longer contiguous trail to hike before it eventually connects to pieces in the Upstate.
The trail reaches 410 miles in separate pieces. Over the next five to seven years, Roe hopes to see another 120 miles or so added to connect the rest of them. Those numbers could change if the routes don’t happen as planned, though she was hopeful for the trail’s future, she said.
“Will it be challenging?” Roe said. “Sure. But I can say that we’ve got a lot of good trail movement and a lot of good discussions happening.”
The nonprofit sometimes builds pieces of trail on its own and sometimes works with other organizations to designate existing trails or help with upcoming trails to add to the network.
For instance, the Saluda Grade Trail, a 31-mile stretch of abandoned train rail turned trail stretching from Inman into North Carolina, will join the Palmetto Trail when it eventually opens. Work to transform the property into a trail is underway, according to the nonprofits running the project.
Connecting the Palmetto Trail to major pathways in other states, including North Carolina, is a step closer to a major goal for Roe. Eventually, she wants to see South Carolina’s trail system integrated into larger systems, perhaps even feeding off the Appalachian Trail.
For the time being, though, the focus is on connecting the state in one long “spine” of a system, as she called it. The 218-mile stretch from Columbia to Awendaw represented a major step toward that, she said.
“I think it legitimized us,” Roe said. “We really are building the largest trail project in South Carolina.”
Although much of the nonprofit’s funding comes from donations, close to $9 million has come from the state Legislature since 2014. That included $1 million in the current budget, which runs until the end of June.
The cost to open a section of trail varies, Roe said. For the 26 miles that opened this year, the Boyd Foundation donated $1.5 million. Upkeep and maintenance also come with a cost, as volunteers repair sections of trail.
The trail is also popular, especially after outdoor recreation boomed during the COVID-19 pandemic, Roe said.
The security cameras installed at certain trailheads get almost constant pings during the day, as people stop to eat lunch, take short walks or go for long hikes. She hopes the trail will become an economic driver, too, bringing outdoorsy tourists to the state and sending people through small towns they may not have visited otherwise.
“I think it’s a really special asset for the state of South Carolina,” Roe said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_9003-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-24 10:12:32.474975

(Courtesy photos)When Kevin Thompson, 65, retired to Hurley, New Mexico, in July 2023, he wanted to stay busy and get involved in his new community, so he volunteered at area food banks and the local radio station. Then he stumbled onto the state’s Aging and Long Term Services Department Ombudsman Program, and through it began volunteering in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.
A disabled U.S. Navy veteran who grew up in New York City, Thompson first encountered the state where he’d end up about 40 years ago while changing commands and driving with his three children from San Diego, California, to Virginia Beach, Virginia. 
“We got lost coming out of Deming because there was no GPS back in 1983,” he told Source New Mexico. “I made it close to Silver City and it left an impression on me, the scenery and everything…I said ‘Man, I’m going to come back here one day.’”
Before making the move to New Mexico, Thompson wound up in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he looked after his ill mother in her last years. Margarite Whitehead was eventually moved into a hospice facility and Thompson said he would visit her as much as possible. She passed in 2021.
Thompson said he learned a lot by spending time in the facility with her, getting to know the staff and other residents. He also volunteered at a local Veterans Affairs hospital.
“I sort of formed a bond with the elderly people that were there…They felt that no one listened to them. They felt disrespected,” he said. “They were just feeling really helpless and lost. And I understand what that’s like because I’ve been in the hospital with a brain tumor and it’s the scariest thing in the world knowing that you’re by yourself and there’s no one there for you.” 
After moving to New Mexico and searching for a volunteer opportunity to keep him busy, Thompson was pointed in the direction of the Fort Bayard Medical Center in Santa Clara. There, he met an older woman who told him about her experience volunteering as an ombudsman. He connected with the Aging and Long-Term Care Department and started the online training process around August 2025.
States began operating ombudsman programs in 1972 through the Older Americans Act. ALTSD spokesperson Joey Long told Source that New Mexico’s program currently has 17 ombudsman volunteers, but expects to add several more volunteers by January 2026. The program oversees volunteers throughout the state, who visit residents of assisted living and nursing facilities on a regular basis. They are tasked with ensuring residents receive adequate care, and that any of their concerns are heard and investigated. 
Thompson started volunteering in mid-September. He said the training took several weeks and included reviewing documents and reading materials before meeting virtually with program organizers and other volunteers. After training, volunteers are sent out to various care facilities to speak with residents and record what they hear and see.
Thompson now visits three facilities in his area, volunteering about three hours a week, and hears from residents about how they’re treated by staff, the quality of food, whether they’re receiving the correct amount of therapy and other issues, like buzzers going unanswered by staff and wanting to leave the facility for a weekend home visit. He also walks around the facility and records what he sees, hears and smells, such as a group of residents working on a puzzle together or a resident’s room that smells strongly of urine.
“I’m still trying to get my footing together, but I do enjoy it,” he said. “Volunteering is in my blood. It’s just something I’ve always done.”
Thompson said the veterans ward at the Fort Bayard Medical Center is his favorite to visit because he is able to connect with the residents about similar experiences. 
“Us veterans tell the best stories. And talking with someone that understands your lingo, your jargon, your state of mind — a lot of these guys are deeply emotional because they haven’t spoken to a veteran unless it’s like some guy that’s been there as long as they are,” Thompson said. “And they’re not all elderly. Some of them are just injured to the point where they can’t live by themselves.”
He added that he tries not to talk too much to residents, but lets them lead the conversation. In Cincinnati, he said, several staff members at his mother’s facility wouldn’t take her complaints seriously until family members got involved because she was blind and had dementia.
“That really hurt my mom a lot. She felt like her words didn’t have value,” Thompson said. “These are people who have led families, who have had careers, who used to be teachers, doctors, lawyers, mothers, fathers, and in my estimation, they just don’t want to be forgotten.” 
Thompson described himself as a “middleman” and a “foot soldier” of the department – connecting people with information about ALTSD and informing the people in the department who have authority to investigate issues or complaints. 
“We can only listen, record and report to the state ombudsman who has the authority to follow through and see what they could do to help these people,” he said. “A lot of the folks, their memories are not that great. They’ll talk to you and you don’t know if what they’re saying is accurate. That’s not your job to decide if it’s accurate or not. You just listen to what they have to say.”
But that in and of itself is important, he said.
“I just know what I’m there to do, which is bring a little joy and comfort to these folks that I talk to. And the fact that I’m a good listener, and I ask simple questions, I don’t want to make it complicated and the fact that I don’t assume anything is extremely helpful,” he said. “They don’t need to pay me to tell me what my value is. Seeing the looks on these people’s faces is the best validation that I could ask for…. I just hope there’s someone there for me when it’s my turn.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ombudsman-1024x819.png,,,2025-12-24 09:56:49.662295

(Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas’ failed proof of citizenship law could serve as a cautionary tale for Congress and other states just beginning to craft similar voting restrictions, a report found.
Federal legislation reintroduced earlier this year would require voters to provide documented proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections. Kansas has been there, done that.
A report from three organizations, analyzing data from Kansas and Arizona, posits that such citizenship laws are costly, error-prone and disenfranchise voters. Plus, citizenship is already a requirement to vote nationwide.
Noncitizen voting is vanishingly rare, said Lata Nott, director of voting rights policy at the Campaign Legal Center and one of the report’s authors.
“We wrote this report to look into the actual financial costs of these laws, but, of course, there’s also the cost of — it’s a nonmonetary cost — people get disenfranchised by these laws, or you make it really hard for them to vote,” Nott said.
It was issued by Dēmos, a New York-based think tank focused on democracy; the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit legal group; and State Voices, an advocacy organization with state-based affiliates across the country.
The report used Kansas and Arizona as touchstones to illustrate the unforeseen financial costs of executing documentary proof of citizenship laws as they gain traction in Congress and statehouses nationwide.
The federal proof of citizenship law hasn’t progressed, but Indiana, New Hampshire, Ohio and Wyoming enacted legislation in 2025.
Kansas’ stint with a documentary proof of citizenship law was brief. After the passage of the Kansas Secure and Fair Elections, or SAFE, Act in 2011, every Kansan registering to vote was required to provide documentary proof of citizenship, which could include a passport or a birth certificate.
The law was implemented in 2013, and it was in effect for more than 3 years before a judge blocked its enforcement.
The report’s authors reviewed fiscal notes attached to documentary proof of citizenship legislation. Lawmakers often didn’t provide any fiscal analysis, ignore fiscal effects on local governments or provide incomplete fiscal analyses.
The report said Kansas’ fiscal note was an example of “gross underestimation” of state costs and burdens on local election officials. Lawmakers estimated a $12,500 increase in expenditures in the Secretary of State’s Office in fiscal year 2011 and a $1,000 increase in the following fiscal year.
In its first full fiscal year, the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office spent more than $192,000 to implement the act. The report hypothesizes the office spent more than $350,000 in total between the law’s passage and effective dates.
At the time, county election officials did not have access to systems that could crosscheck passport numbers or birth certificate records.
Neda Khoshkhoo, interim director of democracy at Dēmos and an author of the report, said proof of citizenship laws erect social barriers, and those barriers are tied to a chronic underfunding of this type of legislation.
“They, ultimately, are a form of voter suppression, which has a particular impact on voters of color and low-income voters and other historically marginalized groups,” Khoshkhoo said.
The disenfranchisement compounds, she said, when downstream effects of underfunding lead to incorrect implementation of a citizenship verification system, and voters are increasingly denied access to ballots.
The report said documentary proof of citizenship did not work in Kansas and came at the cost of disenfranchising thousands of voters and millions of dollars lost. 
Implementing proof of citizenship laws typically require investments in technology upgrades, staff training and data privacy, Nott said. Kansas tied its citizenship verification process to its driver’s license database.
“When you do that, you will probably run into some errors,” Nott said. “Kansas has. Arizona has. And those errors, they’re not just minor errors. They’re errors that disenfranchise people, that take away their right to vote.”
However the report identified a larger problem. Division of motor vehicles clerks in Kansas weren’t allowed, by policy, to request proof of citizenship from voters when renewing or updating their licenses. Clerks statewide also were not allowed to inform people of the new requirement. 
The report said Kansas “faced a multitude of technological, organizational and legal challenges that were a direct result of the flawed system designed by the SAFE Act and its implementing regulations and directives.”
More than 30,000 Kansans were prevented from voting and saw their registrations suspended or deemed invalid because of the state’s law.
The report said there was “a yearslong breakdown in communication and coordination between the DMV, the secretary of state, county election offices, and voters” throughout the duration of the law.
In 2018, a federal judge struck it down, ruling the law unconstitutional and in violation of the National Voter Registration Act. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judgment in 2020, concluding the law had an outsized effect on voters. It ruled that the inclusion of noncitizens on Kansas’ voter rolls could be attributed to administrative issues. A confirmed 39 noncitizens successfully registered to vote in Kansas between 1999 and 2013, making up 0.002% of voters, according to the appeals court’s opinion.
The full cost of ameliorating the state’s errors was not documented, the report said.
Proof of citizenship laws can sound like common sense policy, said Marissa Liebling, senior director of programs at State Voices. But the complications and the financial hurdles that come with enacting them amass.
Then-Secretary of State, now attorney general, Kris Kobach was an advocate of the law, billing it as a way to combat voter fraud. Instances of fraud were never proven in court.
The state ended up paying $1.9 million in attorneys’ fees to the winning parties of two lawsuits, the report said. Staff time in the Attorney General’s and Secretary of State’s offices spent on the litigation wasn’t unaccounted for in the report.
A spokesperson for the current Secretary of State’s Office said Kansas’ documentary proof of citizenship law “was a tool to help with the integrity of Kansas voter rolls.”
Secretary of State Scott Schwab, who is a Republican candidate for governor, was a member of the House at the time the citizenship law was passed. He voted in favor of passage, according to legislative records.
Liebling, Khoshkhoo and Nott expect more proof of citizenship laws in 2026.
Nott interprets their increase in popularity as “one of many signs that we’ve had in the past few years that election administration has gotten so politicized.”
What once was a domain for “wonky election nerds,” as Nott put it, has become polarized in every aspect. 
Liebling said voter education, fail-safe options for voters and proper, accurate investments are solutions to costly, error-prone election legislation. The effects of proof of citizenship laws can be acute and profound for people who have historically been excluded from electoral processes, she said, but the issue touches everyone.
“When you compound the fiscal and administrative costs with a real burden on voters in many different communities and geographies across the board,” Liebling said, “I think it really requires some rethinking as to the value of these kinds of policies.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_5361-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 09:56:49.662295

(Photo by LordHenriVoton/Getty Images)With the most wonderful — and for some, the most stressful — time of year underway, a University of Iowa researcher is working to discover pathways in the brain to help decrease the risks that come with chronic stress and promote resilience.
According to a 2023 poll conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of the American Psychological Association, more than 40% of respondents reported their stress levels increasing during the holiday season, described in the report as the time between November and January.
Jason Radley, a UI psychological and brain sciences professor who has spent a decade studying the effects of chronic stress “from the perspective of disease,” said the stress responses developed in the body to help in enduring harsh environments are triggered in modern times by things that “aren’t really immediately life threatening, like work pressure or financial problems.”
“The effects of stress on the brain and body can produce long-lasting changes in brain function and the pathways that regulate behavior,” Radley said.

Radley’s research focuses on the reaction to stress, also known as coping, and how the brain controls how the body copes. In studying the stress hormone changes and manipulating brain activity in rats, Radley said he and researchers working with him have shown that the prefrontal cortex of the brain in these lab animals is “rewired by chronic stress exposure.”
The human’s prefrontal cortex is the area of the brain “most strongly associated with higher mental functioning,” Radley said, like the ability to focus on different tasks, plan and make decisions. Seeing how rats’ brains respond to chronic stress should help in understanding how it can rewire humans’ brains as well, and increase risks of stress-related diseases and other medical issues.
Two pathways connect the prefrontal cortex to the brainstem, Radley said. Research has shown the pathways regulate what he called “active and passive coping.” Radley described active coping as “taking steps to resolve or reduce the stress,” like confronting tasks causing stress, while passive coping “can be more like withdrawing from the situation or procrastinating.”
“What we found is that if we activate this pathway that can increase active coping after chronic stress, we can reverse these physical changes and the adverse effects that we see with stress hormones and cardiovascular changes,” Radley said.
With these pathways identified, Radley said he and other stress researchers have grown more interested in resilience as a tool of decreasing risk. Radley has created a “behavioral task” for lab rats which he said is similar to training that first responders receive or soldiers go through in basic training, though on a much smaller scale, where people are exposed to milder forms of stress so they can learn to adapt in real stressful situations.
The task, which Radley said some call a “model of stress inoculation,” will hopefully unlock for researchers new pathways that they can activate in people to help mitigate risks of developing stress-related disease and promote resiliency.
How to cope with high-stress holidays
From the research Radley and others have compiled on stress and the brain and body’s interaction with it, he said something people can take away is that active coping — or facing stressors head-on rather than avoiding them — will help reduce feelings of being overwhelmed.
A June article from the Centers for Disease Control recommends caring for both mind and body to reduce stress, including taking breaks from social media, doing relaxing activities, practicing gratitude, connecting with others, getting enough sleep, moving your body and eating healthfully.
When asked whether his knowledge of stress and resiliency has led to this — traditionally tricky — time of year being any more calm or easy, Radley joked that “stress researchers are really good at alleviating stress and living stress-free” just like how “all doctors are healthy and dentists have good teeth.”
While Radley said his default behavior leans more toward procrastination and last-minute work than not, conducting his research has led him to think more about how he can actively cope in stressful situations like holiday shopping or figuring out when to take time off work when “research never rests.”
He’s gotten good at “getting things done at deadlines” after pushing things back, Radley said, but he can feel physical effects of the stress caused by his habits, especially as he gets older.
“What I’ve been trying to do since I’ve been more mindful of our research with active coping is to try to plan better, and just try to do things little bit at a time and not wait till the last minute,” Radley said.

Sockeye salmon, also known as red salmon, is among the species harvested for subsistence. (Photo provided by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)The U.S. Department of the Interior is considering whether to change Alaska’s unique system of hunting and fishing, which gives rural residents priority on federal land in Alaska.
According to a notice published Dec. 15 in the Federal Register, the Interior Department is conducting “a targeted review” of the program mandated by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.
While no specific changes were identified in the notice, it prompted the Alaska Federation of Natives to react with concern.
In a message to members, it called the new proposal “a serious threat and a major step backward” in fish and game management within Alaska, according to a report Tuesday by the Anchorage Daily News.
Federal law requires rural residents to receive a priority when subsistence hunting and fishing, but because Alaska’s constitution prohibits the state from operating a system that gives one resident priority over another, the federal government uses one set of rules for hunting and fishing on federally controlled waters and lands, and the state uses another set for state-controlled water and land.
That has frequently led to conflicts between the state and federal government over management, and several lawsuits over the issue are currently in progress in federal court.
The Daily News reported that the suggestion to revise the two-tiered program came from Safari Club International, a large sport-hunting organization that has frequently sided with the state in lawsuits against the federal government.
Information posted online by the Interior Department indicates that the agency may consider:

Changing the makeup of the board that regulates subsistence hunting and fishing on federal land;
Reconsidering the rules that determine what parts of the state are “rural” and thus eligible for preferential treatment;
And the role of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in the program.

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is taking a holiday break and will return to your inboxes on Monday, Jan. 5.
For five years, 39-year-old Sarah Jolly has been trying to start a family with her husband. After both participated in multiple tests, the Central Coast couple has yet to receive a clear-cut answer to their infertility issues. 
Throughout the ordeal, which has included three unsuccessful attempts of intrauterine insemination, Jolly said she has felt dismissed. Insurance also refused to cover any of her fertility tests or appointments, but covered her husband’s visit to a urologist. 

Jolly: “I’ve gotten a lot of comments societally, even from a lot of men, like ‘You should have kids. It’s the biggest privilege.’ But our society also doesn’t support women and getting the health care they need to be able to achieve that. It feels like a punch in the face that I wasn’t expecting.”

For Californians like Jolly who are struggling with infertility, some support is on the way. Beginning Jan. 1, certain health insurers will be required to cover fertility treatments and in vitro fertilization services, offering millions of Californians a chance to have a baby, writes CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.
The new law mandates large group health insurers — from employers with at least 100 workers — to cover fertility services, and does not apply to people who get their insurance through religious employers, federally regulated plans or Medi-Cal. The law also amends the definition of infertility to include same-sex couples and single people, opening up fertility benefits to these individuals.
In the U.S. roughly 9% of men and 11% of women of reproductive age struggle with infertility, and treatment can be costly: One cycle of in vitro fertilization costs an average of $24,000, according to a 2010 survey. For a successful pregnancy, which often takes multiple tries, the average cost was $61,000. These high price tags are the main reason people can’t access care, said Alise Powell, director of government affairs with RESOLVE: The National Fertility Association.

Powell: “Infertility is a disease and it should be covered by insurance like any other disease or ailment people have.”

Immigration fears color holiday season

Though 2025 marks the third year local organizers have put on a holiday festival in San Diego County’s San Marcos, heightened immigration enforcement activity has created an air of increased caution in the mostly low-income, Latino community, reports CalMatters’ Deborah Brennan.
Sponsored by the civic organization Universidad Popular in partnership with Restoration Abbey, a local church, the event includes a neighborhood procession, or posada, that reenacts the pilgrimage of Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem. As locals gather for the Posada Comunitaria event, however, volunteers keep watch for immigration agents — highlighting the challenges some community leaders face when planning cultural celebrations under the current Trump administration.
San Marcos appears to account for just a few of the immigration arrests in the San Diego area, but this year saw more arrests: Since September 2023, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested at least 38 people — but 20 of those arrests were between June and October 2025, according to a CalMatters’ analysis of federal data provided by ICE.
Despite the fears, organizers decided to go on with the show.

Alex Aguas, a priest with Restoration Abbey: “The practice of the Posada really invites people to think about … what does it mean to be on the margins and looking for sanctuary and shelter at this time?’ We also just get to have the opportunity to celebrate.”

(Photo courtesy of Iowa Department of Corrections)The Iowa Dental Board has reinstated the license of a Waterloo dentist convicted of being intoxicated at the state prison where he was providing dental care for inmates.
State records show that in December 2023, Paymun Bayati, also identified in board records as Payum Bayati, was arrested at Anamosa State Penitentiary shortly after completing a root canal on a patient inmate. Bayati was charged with public intoxication and was convicted in April 2024. He subsequently agreed to voluntarily surrender his license for at least one year.
Police records show that on Dec. 7, 2023, an Anamosa police officer was dispatched to the penitentiary in reference an impaired person who was trying to drive away from the prison. The officer reported arriving at the prison and meeting with the warden, the deputy warden and Bayati.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the police report, the warden said nurses reported Bayati appeared to be intoxicated and had just completed a root canal on a patient. The police officer reported Bayati’s speech was slurred and he “smelled heavily” of alcohol. Bayati then submitted to a test that allegedly indicated a blood-alcohol level of 0.158 — almost twice the legal limit for driving.
“He let me search his vehicle in the parking lot, where I located an empty flask that smelled of an alcoholic beverage,” the police officer wrote in his report.
Court records, which include the judge’s notes from the ensuing criminal trial, indicate the dental assistant who worked with Bayati testified that when she arrived for work on Dec. 7, 2023, Bayati had music playing on a computer and his head was resting on the counter. The trial notes indicate she testified that later, while doing the root canal, Bayati was swaying back and forth, closing his eyes, had trouble picking up dental instruments, and smelled of alcohol.
The judge’s notes also indicate the administrator of nursing testified that after she told Bayati he could not work and instructed him to gather his belongings, he told her he loved her and asked if he still had a job. She also testified that Bayati was staggering at one point, seemed confused and was laughing inappropriately, according to the judge’s notes.
“I don’t dispute that I was intoxicated,” Bayati testified, according to the judge’s notes. “How it came about is what I am arguing. Someone poisoned me.”
Bayati told the Iowa Capital Dispatch he doesn’t drink and believed someone, probably his dental assistant, tampered with his cup of coffee by pouring isopropyl alcohol into it after he arrived at the prison that morning.
In December 2024, six months after his license suspension took effect, Bayati sought early reinstatement of his license. After the board indicated it intended to deny that request, Bayati sought a hearing before the board.
As part of his request, Bayati provided the board with a substance abuse evaluation that didn’t recommend treatment and didn’t include a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. Bayati also informed the board that he is subject to some form of additional substance-use monitoring by virtue of his holding a commercial pilot’s license and a commercial driver’s license as part of his trucking business.
Last month, the board concluded that Bayati had demonstrated it was in the public’s best interest to have his license reinstated, subject either to enrollment in the Iowa Professional Health Program or to three years of substance monitoring by the board.
Other Iowa dentists sanctioned
Other Iowa dentists whose disciplinary cases recently came before the board include:
Deborah Cassill of Cedar Rapids – According to the board, Cassill was alleged to have allowed uncertified dental assistant trainees to take patient radiographs and perform dental work without supervision by a dentist. It was also alleged that Cassill had “rushed a patient’s dental work” and that the patient was one of her own employees.
The board, which has not disclosed when the alleged conduct took place, charged Cassill with encouraging, assisting, or enabling the unauthorized practice of dentistry, and with unprofessional conduct. To resolve the case, Cassill agreed to pay a $2,000 civil penalty and complete an “ethics program” of undefined duration.
It is the second time the board has sanctioned Cassill for improper use of staff to perform dental work.
In 1999, the board charged Cassill, then known as Deborah Trimble, with assisting or enabling the unauthorized practice of dentistry and with willfully or repeatedly violating a board rule in that she failed to protect the health of her patients by assigning unlicensed auxiliary staff duties that could not be legally delegated to them.
In that case, the board alleged Cassill regularly employed “unlicensed auxiliary staff” as dental assistants, and on many occasions allowed a dental assistant to perform procedures – including the placement and removal of temporary crowns — that constituted the practice of dentistry or dental hygiene. The case was resolved with Cassill’s license being placed on probation for five years, with the understanding that she’d complete a course on dental ethics and pay a $1,500 civil penalty.
Maria Nosworthy of Ottumwa – According to the board, it fielded a complaint about Nosworthy that expressed several areas of concern with her practice of dentistry, including “using force with patients,” an allegation on which the board didn’t elaborate.
The board alleges the complaint also expressed concern with regard to Nosworthy’s failure to meet infection-control standards, working on patients after they have asked her to stop, improper use of local anesthesia, failure to perform comprehensive patient examinations, poor communication with patients, failure to meet the expected standard of care, and unprofessionalism.
The available board documents don’t indicate when any of the alleged conduct took place.
The board charged Nosworthy with practicing dentistry in a manner that is harmful or detrimental to the public, unprofessional or unethical conduct, and failure to maintain a satisfactory standard of competency.
Without agreeing to any wrongdoing, Nosworthy recently agreed to settlement that calls for her to complete a remedial education program that deals with restorative care, ethics and recordkeeping.
No civil penalties or restrictions on Nosworthy’s license were imposed.

Maybe it was the surprise success of a book about permitting reform among liberal elites. Maybe it was just the cumulative crush of California’s unaffordability. 
Whatever the cause, 2025 was the year that California’s Democratic lawmakers finally got serious about building. 
In the summer, state lawmakers passed a law exempting most urban apartment developments from the threat of environmental litigation. A few months later, they passed a bill green-lighting apartment buildings near major public transit stops over local objections. Both bills are aimed at pushing the state to build its way out of a chronic housing shortage, both are longtime items on the “Yes in my backyard” movement’s wishlist and both were gleefully signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom. Other, less high-profile legislation aimed at speeding up construction also sailed through both chambers this year.
Let the era of abundant housing begin? Probably not. This year’s historic policy shift may push in that direction, but high interest rates, unpredictable tariffs and lofty labor costs are pushing in the other. Plus, it just takes a long time to build stuff.
Despite the boom year in pro-construction bills, it was a bit of a legislative bust for those seeking immediate help with the cost of housing. The legislative year didn’t offer much for existing renters. Nor did it take up a proposed bond measure meant to top-up one of the state’s affordable housing funds. Though affordable housing producers secured a long-sought-after boost in federal support from President Trump’s signature spending bill, the administration also aims to slash spending on permanent housing for the homeless. 
2026 outlook 
That all gives lawmakers plenty to pick back up in 2026. The question of whether to take the bond back up in time for the November election is likely to dominate the debate in January. YIMBYs aim to push forward more cost-cutting measures for development and tenant rights group will likely call again for tighter rent caps and tenant protections.

State and local governments became more aggressive in sweeping homeless encampments in 2025, among other measures. 


In 2025, we started to see the effects of a more punitive approach to homelessness from the state and local governments.
A CalMatters investigation found that the number of people arrested or cited for homelessness-related offenses soared in cities around the state. At least 50 California cities passed new ordinances targeting homeless encampments, according to an analysis by UC Berkeley Law students. That all came after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last year in Grants Pass v. Johnson, which gave cities more freedom to punish people for sleeping in public spaces.
Gov. Gavin Newsom doubled down in encouraging cities to crack down on people living outdoors. In May, he urged every local government in the state to adopt ordinances that restrict public camping. In August, he launched a new state taskforce dedicated to clearing encampments.
2025 was also the year that some California counties finally started to make progress on homelessness, which experts attributed to an influx over the past few years in state, federal and local funds for housing and services. Of the 29 places in California that reported an official homeless census, more than half saw fewer unhoused people compared to 2024, according to an analysis of point-in-time counts by the Hub for Urban Initiatives. Contra Costa, Sonoma, Santa Cruz, Ventura, San Diego and Los Angeles were among the counties that saw their numbers go down.
2026 outlook
Cuts, cuts and more cuts. Proposed federal cuts to housing and homelessness funds, as well as a shift in federal funding away from permanent housing, could derail the progress California has made in fighting homelessness. The state also is reducing the money it contributes to homeless housing and services.
At the same time, the federal administration is signalling that it will divert funds away from states, cities and organizations that support undocumented immigrants, diversity and inclusion efforts and the transgender community. Some California homeless service providers worry that could put them at risk of losing federal dollars.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/111524_Anatomy-Of-A-Sweep-JK_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-24 08:56:35.940534

A new law aims to help change that.,"In summary
In vitro fertilization costs thousands of dollars and is often too expensive for many people struggling to conceive. A new law aims to help change that. 


When Megan Meo, 36, and her husband decided to start a family, they knew they wanted two kids. They didn’t know they would have to endure multiple rounds of fertility treatment, causing much heartache and draining away thousands of dollars.
“It’s strange when my body isn’t working to do a thing it was made for,” Meo said. ”It hurts me at my core.”
Meo is among roughly 9 million Californians who will benefit from a new law requiring some insurers to pay for the diagnosis and treatment of infertility. On Jan. 1, large group health insurers in California — from employers with at least 100 workers — will be required to begin covering fertility preservation and in vitro fertilization services.
The law also redefines infertility in state statute, eliminating an exemption that prevented same-sex couples or single people from receiving fertility benefits.
The law does not apply to people who get their insurance through religious employers, federally regulated plans or Medi-Cal. Last month, a settlement in a class action lawsuit led by a Santa Clara couple required Aetna to extend fertility benefits to LGBTQ couples nationwide.
Advocates expect small group insurers will soon be required to offer the same coverage through a separate regulatory process that awaits federal approval. Once federal officials approve that process, most Californians with employer-sponsored health insurance should receive the benefit, said Sen. Caroline Menjivar, the law’s author and a Democrat from Van Nuys.
“I am so proud of this bill. I want this bill on my tombstone,” Menjivar said. “This impacts so many people from single people to heterosexual couples.”
Menjivar, who is lesbian, said the new law strikes a personal chord. For her to have children, she would have to rely on fertility treatments – and insurance companies have often excluded LGBTQ individuals from coverage for these services. One of her friends spent more than $20,000 on fertility treatments to have three children, she said.
“This brings into the fold a lot of people,” Menjivar said, tearing up. “I get emotional because I know these people. I know what this looked like for my friends.”
High cost prevents people from using IVF
In vitro fertilization, or IVF, commonly helps people struggling to conceive. About 9% of men and 11% of women of reproductive age struggle with infertility in the U.S. During a cycle of IVF, doctors retrieve eggs from the ovaries and fertilize them with sperm in a lab. The resultant embryos can then be transferred to the uterus.
The process, while simple sounding, can take months or even years before a successful pregnancy. It is also expensive. A 2010 survey on the cost for infertility treatment among 400 Northern California women found the average payment for one cycle of IVF was $24,000. The average cost for a successful pregnancy, which can take multiple cycles, was $61,000. Health care costs have grown since then. 
Before insurance coverage kicked in, Meo’s fertility clinic told her one round of IVF would cost between $30,000 and $39,000.
“The idea of spending $40,000 on something that might not work was really scary,” she said. She and her husband have been trying to start a family for two years. Her infertility is partially related to uterine scarring left by a previous miscarriage. Insurance coverage lessens the emotional and financial burden for them, Meo said. 
Alise Powell, director of government affairs with RESOLVE: The National Fertility Association, said cost is the No.1 barrier preventing people from accessing care. Congress has on multiple occasions shot down legislative efforts to require health insurers to cover fertility services, most recently in 2024. California is the 15th state to mandate coverage for state-regulated plans.
“Infertility is a disease and it should be covered by insurance like any other disease or ailment people have,” Powell said.
Jamie Falls, 44, has been trying to get pregnant for 11 years. She and her husband, who had an unsuccessful vasectomy reversal, took out a loan to afford the $13,000 it cost for one round of IVF in 2020. The procedure didn’t work. They’ve been saving since then to try another round. 
Insurance coverage offers some relief, Falls said, but after trying for so long it almost seems too good to be true. 
“I wouldn’t wish this journey on anybody. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through (but) I can’t picture myself not being a mom,” Falls said.
Health insurers who opposed the law before it was enacted have said it will raise overall insurance costs, pinching small businesses and people who buy individual policies.
Infertility often unexplained
Many people who struggle to conceive don’t know why they are unable to do so. Studies indicate around 30% are diagnosed with unexplained infertility. 
It’s a frustrating diagnosis, said Sarah Jolly, 39, who has been trying to conceive with her husband for five years. Tests to check her ovarian reserve, hormone levels and ensure there were no blockages came back normal. The couple even sought out a urologist who specializes in male infertility to run tests on Jolly’s husband only for everything to return clean.
The couple has tried intrauterine insemination — a process where sperm is inserted directly into the uterus while a woman is ovulating — three times without a pregnancy.
Jolly said she and her husband are keeping IVF on the table as a last resort, but she doesn’t want to go through with a procedure without knowing what it’s treating. 
Recently, after seeking out another specialist, Jolly learned that she had endometriosis, a chronic condition that can cause adhesions, scarring and inflammation around the reproductive organs. Multiple doctors had previously told Jolly endometriosis had nothing to do with her infertility, she said, but the specialist told her it was a common – and treatable – reason. 
Studies suggest between 30% to 50% of women with endometriosis are infertile, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. 
Jolly said throughout this process she has felt unheard and undervalued, constantly having to advocate for more testing and more answers. Insurance also refused to pay for any of her fertility tests or appointments, but covered her husband’s visit to the urologist. 
“I’ve gotten a lot of comments societally, even from a lot of men, like ‘You should have kids. It’s the biggest privilege.’ But our society also doesn’t support women and getting the health care they need to be able to achieve that,” Jolly said. “It feels like a punch in the face that I wasn’t expecting. I really thought it would be a much more supportive process medically.”

,California,2025-12-24 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Even more Cal State campuses will automatically admit eligible students under a new state law,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/12/cal-state-admission/,California State University last year launched a pilot program to attract more students to the university system and to steer some to campuses that have been struggling with enrollment declines.,"In summary
California State University last year launched a pilot program to attract more students to the university system and to steer some to campuses that have been struggling with enrollment declines. 


What’s good for Riverside County is good for the whole state: After a pilot to automatically admit high school students into the California State University system in the Inland Empire county took off last fall, lawmakers this year passed a law to greenlight a similar program statewide next fall. 
Leaders at the California State University last year launched the pilot to attract more students to the university system and to steer some to campuses that have been struggling with enrollment declines.
The pilot worked like this: University officials and high schools in Riverside County pored over student course completion and grade data to identify every county high school senior who was eligible for admission to the 10 of 22 Cal State campuses chosen for the pilot. Then the students received a brochure in the mail last fall before the Nov. 30 submission deadline, plus digital correspondence, telling them they were provisionally admitted as long as they submitted an application to one or more Cal State campuses, even those not in the pilot, and maintained their high school grades.Starting next fall, all students in California will be eligible for the automatic admissions program, which will expand the roster of participating Cal State campuses to 16. Cal State will release more information on the program’s implementation in February, its website says.
In justifying the expanded program during a legislative hearing, bill author Sen. Christopher Cabaldon, a Democrat from Napa, said college should be as seamless a transition from high school as it is for students finishing one grade and advancing to the next. “It’s entirely an invention of us, the gap between 12th grade and college. … The same gap does not exist between elementary school and junior high or junior high and high school.”The legislation, Senate Bill 640, passed without any opposition and was signed into law by the governor. The program doesn’t mean students can enter any major at the campuses they pick. Some majors may require students to show higher high school grades or tougher courses if those programs have fewer openings than student demand. For Californians, the standard minimum GPA for entry is 2.5 in a series of college-preperatory courses.Students will also be free to apply to the six other  over-enrolled Cal State campuses, though admission isn’t guaranteed. Those are Fullerton, Long Beach, Pomona, San Diego, San Jose and San Luis Obispo.
What the Riverside pilot did
High school counselors told CalMatters that the Riverside County pilot encouraged students who never considered attending a university to follow through with the automatic admissions process. Counselors also reached out to some students who were a class or two short of meeting the requirements for Cal State admission to take those, encouraging more students to apply to college who otherwise wouldn’t have. Younger students who were off the college-course taking track might be emboldened to enroll in those tougher high school courses knowing automatic admission is in the cards, the counselors said.
Silvia Morales, a senior at Heritage High School, a public Riverside County high school, got an automatic admissions letter last fall. “I was pretty set on going to community college and then transferring, because I felt like I wasn’t ready for the four-year commitment to a college,” she said. She eventually submitted her forms, encouraged by her high school counselor. 
Following the Riverside pilot, Cal State campuses saw roughly 1,500 more applicants and 1,400 more admitted students in 2025 compared to 2024, though just 136 more students enrolled. 
The data for Riverside County reviewed by CalMatters suggests that more applicants and admitted students through an automatic admissions policy doesn’t translate into more enrolled students. Colleges closely follow their “yield rates” — the percentage of admitted students who ultimately enroll. In 2024, the Cal State yield rate for Riverside County was about a third. But in 2025, it declined by a few percentage points, meaning a lower share of admitted students selected any Cal State campus.  
This suggests that the system will have to work harder to convert admitted students into ones who actually enroll, said Iwunze Ugo, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, particularly with students who would not have applied were it not for the automatic admissions program.
Automatic admissions doesn’t mean automatic enrollment
While admission to a college overcomes a major hurdle to eventually enrolling, there are numerous steps necessary before students sit down for their first college course. Accepted students must submit additional grades, put down a deposit, complete registration forms and actually show up for the fall term. Students who were less engaged in the college-going culture are more likely to “melt” during the process between acceptance and enrollment, some studies show, though researchers say this can be reversed with additional outreach to students at risk of not enrolling. 
And even with an automatic admissions program, students must still register online and complete the application, which many students under the Riverside pilot didn’t do. Cal State sent out more than 17,000 automatic admissions notices to students, and just under 12,000 formally applied to at least one Cal State campus. Those who didn’t apply may have chosen another option, such as the often more selective University of California, private campuses, community colleges, or no college at all.“I think that’ll be incumbent on the CSU to pick up some of that slack and encourage students admitted through this path to go through the rest of the process and ultimately end up at a CSU campus,” Ugo said.Cal State officials also recognize this. “Students who apply independently tend to have stronger self-directed interest, and therefore stronger intent to enroll,” said April Grommo, a senior Cal State official who oversees enrollment management. More direct engagement with students admitted through this program will be necessary, she said.
Some campuses with a recent history of declining enrollment got a tiny pick-up from the pilot. San Francisco State saw 311 more applications from Riverside County in 2025 than in 2024. That translated to 11 more enrolled students, a review of Cal State data shows.
A statewide program may steer more students to attend campuses with enrollment woes, even if the “yield rate” declines. That’s because if the rate of new students enrolling doesn’t rise as quickly as the number of students admitted, the yield rate drops.Under the expanded statewide program, Grommo said the system anticipates “enrollment growth as well, but not necessarily at the same rate as applications and admits,” she added.And as the economy shows signs of decay, the prospect of a college degree may compel more high schoolers on the fence to attend Cal State; System data show students from there earn a typical salary of $71,000 five years after graduating with a bachelor’s degree. Postsecondary enrollment tends to rise as the number of available jobs decreases, a social science phenomenon in which employers are more selective about who they hire, compelling many job-seekers to hit the books to show they’re more trained.Of course, souring economies often result in less public funding for colleges as state budgets are beleaguered, which may lead to fewer professors and staff for a growing cadre of students. “But I think generally, having more students is not a problem,” Ugo said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/050625_CSU-San-Marcos_AH_CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-24 08:56:35.940534

The Salt Lake Valley broke a record high Monday of 67 degrees and on Tuesday with 61 degrees, which surpassed the 59 degrees recorded on that date in 1933, according to the National Weather Service. On Dec. 17, the office also registered a high of 67 degrees, the warmest on record.

“We have reached 67 degrees on more than one occasion already this month in Salt Lake City,” said Alex DeSmet, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, “and that ties for the second-warmest December and also second-warmest winter temperature ever recorded.”
Monday’s minimum temperature was 59 degrees as well, DeSmet said “which broke the previous warmest overnight temperature in the winter by 7 degrees. So quite, quite significant there.”
And, the odds of having a typical snow-filled Christmas Day in the Salt Lake Valley is “basically 0%,” according to DeSmet. But, 6 to 12 inches of snow are expected on the mountains above 8,500 feet Wednesday through Thursday night.
Wednesday night through Friday night, the National Weather Service is also expecting high winds with gusts up to 50 miles per hour in western Utah and Tooele Valley, potentially impacting holiday travel, since high winds may blow dust. 
However, temperatures are expected to stop breaking records by Friday, DeSmet said.
Great Salt Lake is rising again, but it’s going to need a ‘really big’ winter to avoid concerns

The state’s ski resorts have experienced slow season beginnings, with skiers reporting soft, spring-like snow, according to ABC4. Tourists in town hoping for a powder day have also been dismayed.
The lack of snow has Utahns worried about potentially seeing worse drought levels, since about 95% of the state’s water supply comes from snowpack. Concern is especially high after a dry summer that left Great Salt Lake managers hoping for a strong winter for the basin. 
But, “there’s a lot of winter left, fortunately,” DeSmet said, and there’s time to build the snowpack on the mountains until April, which is what’s typical for the season.
While the National Weather Service estimates temperatures will remain warmer than normal through the rest of the winter, that won’t necessarily be reflected in the snowpack.
“As far as the precipitation is concerned, it’s kind of a weaker signal. It can go either way for most of the rest of the winter,” DeSmet said.

According to the KFF report, 39% of Alabama Medicaid enrollees get contraceptives at public health departments, much higher than the national average of 6%.

“In general, states in the southeastern U.S. provided contraceptive care to larger shares of female Medicaid enrollees through health departments than in other parts of the country,” the report read.
The usage of public health departments for contraceptives, the report said, is due to Alabama’s network of Title X clinics being all public health departments. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Title X clinics are federally funded family planning clinics.
The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) offers family planning services like counseling for contraceptives, pap smears for women, testing for HIV and sexually transmitted diseases and infections, according to its website. Every county has a public health department where these services are offered.
“Depending on how small the county is or the population, we might not have those services available every day in every county, but every week or every month,” Harris said.
Alabama State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said in a recent interview that public health departments help fill the gap, especially in rural areas.
“Many of our rural areas are health care deserts, and we’re one of the few providers there, along with community health centers,” Harris said. “I think those are the ones who are plugging most of the gaps.”
The county health departments are not always equipped to handle every need that comes to them, Harris said, but that is where community health centers, or federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), come in. 
According to the KFF report, 8% of Alabama Medicaid enrollees got contraceptives from community health centers in 2023. The national average for this category is 18%, according to the report. 
“Community health centers have historically served much smaller volumes of contraceptive clients, and it is estimated they would have to increase their contraceptive client caseloads by 56% to make up for the loss of Planned Parenthood clinics as a site of care for Medicaid enrollees,” the report reads. 
Those centers are operated by the federal government and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Harris said. 
Harris said he was not surprised by the make up of resources Alabama Medicaid enrollees use.
“It’s clearly a core priority for us to make sure those services are available so we have family planning programs in every county,” Harris said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Birth-control-blister-pack-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-24 08:11:41.069591

The Department of the Interior eliminated almost all the existing free-pass days listed for 2025, only keeping one of the eight designated days: Veterans Day (Nov. 11).
Instead, the Department of the Interior said that the new round of days will be “resident-only patriotic fee-free days.”
The newest line-up of fee-free days include Flag Day, June 14, which is also President Donald Trump’s birthday. It also includes former President Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday on Oct. 27.
Another change will be an increased fee system for out-of-country tourists. The fee-free days will not apply to out-of-country visitors.
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum explained the changes:
“President Trump’s leadership always puts American families first,” Burgum said in a news release. “These policies ensure that U.S. taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”
Earlier this month, a public lands group sued the Trump administration for removing a photograph of Montana’s Glacier National Park on an annual pass as it was swapped for a collage portrait of George Washington and Trump.
The Trump administration pushed back saying that the Glacier Park photograph would be used on national park passes for non-U.S. citizens, while the more common resident passes would contain Washington and Trump.

She got to engage with a world foreign to her own, she fondly recalled, playing in the fields, fishing and foraging.
“Even though I am truly a city child, every spot of countryness I could find, I gravitated towards it,” she said. 
Decades later, Bowden now owns one of the south Delta’s most well-known institutions, the Onward Store along U.S. 61, or the “blues highway,” in Sharkey County. Over the last century, the business has worn a number of hats: restaurant, gas station, post office, gift shop. The store also boasts a claim to fame most Mississippians are familiar with.

Just down the road, in 1902, then-president Theodore Roosevelt ventured on a bear hunt with Holt Collier, an esteemed marksman and former slave. After the president had little to show for the outing, Collier cornered a bear to give Roosevelt an easy shot. But, as the legend goes, Roosevelt considered the maneuver “unsportsmanlike,” and instead let the bear run free. News of the trip reached a toymaker in New York, and the popular Teddy Bear spread from there. 
Bowden retired in 2021 from her job of nearly 20 years, teaching theater to middle and high schoolers in Maryland. When the COVID-19 pandemic shrunk her usual classroom into a computer screen, her joy quickly faded, she said. 
She originally moved to Mississippi in 2023 to take care of the 320-acre farm her great grandfather bought years and years ago, located just south of Mayersville in the south Delta – or, as she described, “in the middle of nowhere.” 
But about a year later, Bowden drove past the Onward Store and saw a “for sale” sign posted outside. Right there and then, she found her new calling. 
In a rural area with scant economic growth and where it can take hours of driving to find groceries, the store is much more than a historical maker. It’s a nexus for locals and travelers to refresh, replenish and reunite.

Even more crucial for Bowden, reviving the business – which has been closed since January, 2024 – means reconnecting herself with a community her family left its mark on. 
On the same farm where her mother, aunts and uncles grew up, her grandfather, Henry Sias, hosted Civil Rights icons Fannie Lou Hamer and Stokely Carmichael, Bowden said. Sias also headed the local “colored” school. Her family, she added, took part in the 1960s Freedom Rides, and even joined Hamer when she gave her famous speech at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. Bowden’s cousin, she said, had to drive Hamer around because she couldn’t drive herself. 
“That’s part of my family history as far as I’m concerned,” she said.   
While it wasn’t the case when her family bought the property, the land is now one of the few Black-owned farms in the heavily agricultural area, Bowden added. 
The journey to reopen the Onward Store hasn’t been cheap. Even with the help of a couple of loans, buying and renovating the shop, including tearing up rotted floors, have drained her entire savings.
“I would say that I’ve bet my future on this store,” said Bowden, now 62.

Unsure how soon she’ll have her full vision of the store ready, Bowden is hoping to at least have the deli open by the end of 2025. There, she plans to serve a variety of lunch staples, especially local classics: hoop cheese, crawfish salad, egg salad, bologna salad, hogshead cheese and pimento loaf. 
But she also wants to transform the Onward Store, which she said had become somewhat of a tourist trap over the years, into something new. Bowden wants to add books and photographs showcasing the local blues culture, for instance. After all, she said, Muddy Waters grew up just around the corner. 
And in addition to selling hunting supplies and retro toys – yes, including the Teddy Bear – Bowden wants the Onward Store to serve as a vehicle for local goods, like vegetables and crafts. In an area with few jobs, she hopes her investment in the space can encourage and support other local business owners. 
Since she started repairs on the store a few months ago, visitors have constantly walked in, hoping it was finally open. Not yet, Bowden would tell them, but she would take their phone number down to let them know when it’s time to return. 
“ The community really wants to see it happen, and I want to make it happen for them,” she said. “Ever since I first started looking at this place, it’s been like a mission, and I think of it as my sacred duty to have this place where people can gather and have good food and conversation and everything. That is important.”

While it’s taken some acclimating to the rural lifestyle, Bowden said she’s found her happiness in Mississippi that went away during the pandemic. 
“We (up North) have some pretty bad opinions about (Mississippi), some of them are real, but a lot of them are not,” she said. “Beyond the notorious things about here, there is absolute beauty. I have found peace since I’ve been down here living on the family farm. That has been awesome.
“I can go out on my porch and look up in the sky and see the Milky Way at night. I could never do that in Washington, D.C. There’s such beauty here and there’s peace and there’s some good people here.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/28040314/Onward-Store-1.jpg,,,2025-12-24 08:11:41.069591

Republicans have lost all of them.
Yes, Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei was reelected every time over those years. But this is a look at competitive federal races. The Nevada 2nd congressional district Amodei represents is so safely red the Democrats didn’t even bother to run a candidate against him last year.
Nevada’s 1st congressional district, home of the fabulous Las Vegas Strip, was the mirror opposite of CD2 in 2016, 2018, and 2020, when Nevada Democratic Rep. Dina Titus easily defeated what amounted to token opposition.
But in 2022 and 2024, after Democratic legislators redistricted CD1 to buck up Democratic strength in CD3 and CD4, Titus’ district became competitive as well.
Upshot: In the last five campaign cycles from 2016 through 2024, there have been 16 competitive federal races,  four for the U.S. Senate (in 2016, 2018, 2022, and 2024) and a dozen for U.S. House seats. Republicans lost all of them.

 
One of the most formidable of those losing Republican candidates was Joe Heck, a three-term member of the U.S. House who ran against a former Nevada attorney general, Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, to succeed U.S. Sen. Harry Reid in 2016.
Heck had endorsed, if only perfunctorily, his party’s nominee for president that year, Trump. After the Access Hollywood tape, Heck, like many Republicans, recoiled in disgust, and he unendorsed Trump. It then appeared that Trump’s base was rejecting Heck because Heck had rejected Trump. Late in the campaign Heck started going wobbly on his un-endorsement of Trump, and wouldn’t say who he was voting for. In the end, Heck and Trump both lost Nevada.
Perhaps the most dramatic of all the Trump-era Republican losses for federal office in Nevada came two years later in 2018. Early in Trump’s first term, when Trump was trying to repeal Obamacare, Nevada Republican U.S. Sen. Dean Heller balked, then dithered. That led to Trump publicly humiliating him. Heller began sucking up to Trump, and voted for a so-called “skinny repeal” of Obamacare after all. And that in turn led to the campaign of Democratic candidate Jacky Rosen running ads casting Heller as an inflatable tube man blowing whichever way the wind took him (one of the best political ads of 21st century Nevada, by the way). 
Over the years, the more Trump has consolidated his command and control of the Republican Party nationally and in Nevada, the weaker and less accomplished have been the Republican candidates for federal office in the state.
And in all the competitive races for federal office that Republicans have lost, Nevada Democrats have tied those Republicans to Trump early and often.
Because it works. Nevada Democrats have a pristine track record spanning the last five campaign cycles to prove it.
Past performance, future results, etc.
An NPR/Newshour/Marist poll released last week found Trump’s approval rating on the economy is 36%, the lowest that particular poll has ever found in either of his madcap occupations of the White House. 
And that’s actually better, for Trump, than an AP/NORC poll earlier this month that found only 31% of respondents approve of his handling of the economy, similarly an all-time low for that poll. 
Those two polls echo a slew of other polls lately that find majorities of voters having roughly the same opinion of Trump that South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham expressed on the Senate floor in the wee hours of January 7, 2021: “Count me out. Enough is enough.”
Starting with  the 2016 campaign cycle, Trump’s first, Democratic candidates for federal office have benefited greatly not only by the offensiveness of Trump’s general Trumpyness. They’ve also successfully run against him, er, Nevada Republican candidates, by focusing on issues where Trump has polled poorly, usually health care.
In 2026, they’ll have health care again, as well as the infuriating cost of living. They’ll be counting on the electorate’s dissatisfaction with Trump to do much of their work for them, allowing them to navigate their way to victories running as the lesser of two evils. 
This year, Nevada Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate have responded to the threat posed by Trump’s assaults on democracy, the Constitution, and the rule of law mostly by hunkering down in mushy centrism and saying “bipartisan” a lot. That suggests the Democratic campaign playbook in 2026 will be much the same as it’s been for the last decade: try not to offend anyone (including of course donors), play it safe, and let their Republican opponents sink under the weight of the Trump’s endorsements.
In other words, Nevada Democrats, and their fellow Democrats running for Congress nationwide, might win an election about the economy in 2026 while saying nothing particularly significant about the economy except that Trump blew it. 
By letting the electorate’s dissatisfaction with Trump do their work for them, Democrats would yet again be absolving themselves of confronting a warped marketplace and K-shaped economy that, over decades and thanks in very large part to to all that aforementioned bipartisanship, has grown more unapologetically harsh and unforgivingly predatory.
In thrall to centrism, Democrats seem to believe a normalcy of some sort will eventually be restored, so their most prudent course is cautious incrementalism, despite its failure in 2024 to to energize portions of a hitherto reliable base and a Democratic Party approval rating “lower than the Dead Sea.”
And in that string of Nevada Democratic victories in federal races since Trump came down his escalator, some of those victories have been by only the slimmest of margins over patently weak Republican candidates.
What might be Democratic wishful thinking notwithstanding, the forces that coughed up Trump and Trumpism aren’t going away any time soon. The more Democrats stiff-arm ambitious reforms, the more risk that voters will embrace the wild-eyed right, or just stop voting, and the more fragile the republic’s defense against authoritarian lawlessness.
Trump may sink Republican congressional candidates in Nevada yet again in 2026. But in addition to pointing at something obvious for voters to be against, Democrats have an opportunity, even an obligation, to articulate meaningful systemic change that voters can be for.
If past performance is any indication of future results, they’ll take a pass.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/trump-in-minden-campaign-video.jpg,,,2025-12-24 08:11:41.069591

Wes Moore signed an executive order protecting gender-affirming care in Maryland on June 5, 2023. (Photo courtesy the Governor's Office)Maryland joined 18 states and the District of Columbia Tuesday in a lawsuit challenging a Health and Human Services declaration last week that health care facilities offering gender-affirming care to minors would be barred from Medicare and Medicaid.
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Oregon, claims that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. exceeded his authority with the Dec. 18 declaration, which would “effectively ban, by fiat, an entire caregory of healthcare.” It also failed to follow proper procedures for promulgating new rules, would  interfere with states’ rights to run their Medicaid programs and regulate health care and deny care to youth that need it.
“Healthcare decisions should be made by doctors and patients – not by politicians in Washington threatening to destroy providers’ careers and spreading fear among transgender youth and their families,” Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement late Tuesday night.
“This isn’t just about following the law – though HHS is clearly violating it. This is about protecting vulnerable young people who deserve the same dignity, respect, and access to medical care as anyone else,” Brown’s statement said.
For many of the 20 Democrat-led jurisdictions on Tuesday’s lawsuit, like Maryland, it was the second day in a row they had gone to an Oregon federal court to challenge Trump administration policy: A total of 22 jurisdictions sued Monday in an attempt to block the administration’s attempt to defund the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Brown compiles ‘voluminous’ record of legal challenges to Trump administration policies

Many of the states are now veterans of lawsuit against President Donald Trump and his administration. For Brown, this week’s lawsuits were the 47th and 48th against the administration and its policies since January, when Trump returned to office.
The latest lawsuit is a response to Kennedy’s declaration on the “Safety, Effectiveness, and Professional Standards of Care for Sex-Rejecting Procedures on Children and Adolescents.” That document declared that health care facilities would be barred from participating in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal programs if they provided gender-affirming care — including puberty blockers, hormonal treatments or surgery — to anyone under age 18.
Part of the declaration states that the methods “for children and adolescents are neither safe nor effective as a treatment modality for gender dysphoria, gender incongruence, or other related disorders in minors.” The declaration also says it supersedes “statewide or national standards of care.”
In a news release with the announcement, Kennedy said it was made in line with Trump’s Jan. 28 executive order “protecting children from chemical and surgical mutilation.” The release also notes that the Food and Drug Administration has issued warning letters to 12 manufacturers and retailers it says are marketing breast binders to children for treatment of gender dysphoria, and that HHS’ Office for Civil Rights is working to reverse a Biden administration policy that categorized gender dysphoria as a disability.
Tuesday’s suit claims that Kennedy’s declaration would negatively impact transgender youth, affect thousands of hospitals that offer Medicare and Medicaid programs and harm medical profession that provide necessary health care.
“The Kennedy Declaration also purports to establish a standard of care and supersede other standards of care, despite the Medicare statute’s clear prohibition against any Federal interference,” according to the suit.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The 41-page suit also discusses policies and protections for transgender youth in each of the state suing. In Maryland, it noted, the Trans Health Equity Act became law in 2023, stating that the state’s Medicaid program “shall” cover gender-affirming care that grants lower-income residents access to those procedures. The law also ensures the state provides the care with or without federal funding.
The state Department of Health reports that in 2024, Maryland Medicaid spent $1.7 million to fund more than 1,600 unique office visits for gender-affirming care services. That figure currently includes about $900,000 in federal funding.
“We’re standing up against this cruel and unlawful action because every Marylander, regardless of who they are, deserves compassionate, evidence-based healthcare from providers who won’t be punished for doing what’s right,” Brown said in his statement.

Scott’s silence fuels immigration chaos — and harms Vermonters.","This commentary is by Jill Martin Diaz, executive director of Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, director of Legal Services for Connecting Cultures/New England Survivors of Torture and Trauma and a lecturer in the University of Vermont’s social work department.



This Thanksgiving, President Trump had us primed to panic when news broke of a Winooski second grader’s violent detention by ICE.
Vermont Asylum Assistance Project (VAAP) advocates were already being inundated with new calls for legal help when tragedy struck, following Trump’s latest half-baked and blatantly illegal policy pronouncements suspending asylum, threatening extrajudicial residency revocations, and promising retraumatizing re-processing for already highly vetted refugees.

Governor Scott could have coordinated Vermont’s first response. Instead, state silence and community chaos ensued. Unsure of who to call, neighbors inundated VAAP and partners until corrective coordination precluded meaningful legal intervention. Media requests jammed channels to a halt. Attorneys scrambled. ICE benefited.
This is a pattern. Misleading United States Citizenship and Immigration Services notices pushed two students to announce their self-deportation before consulting counsel. Scott’s silence invited manufactured chaos and, again, civil society gridlock ensued.
This year brought baseless threats to birthright citizenship; status revocations threatening work permits overnight; skyrocketing filing fees pricing working people out of status renewals; and lightspeed procedural shifts obscuring process due. 
Trump knows many policies won’t survive judicial review. That’s not careless error — it’s strategy: sow chaos that states worsen into legal access gridlock and lasting fear.
In a rare written statement, Scott called it “reasonable and prudent” for Trump to investigate immigration “security concerns or vulnerabilities” after a lone Afghan national’s gun violence. In doing so, he validated Trump’s spurious premise that one person’s actions can implicate entire classes of people. Settled law rejects collective suspicion based on race, religion or nationality. Trump’s policymaking isn’t reasonable or prudent — it’s enforcement theater and unlawful discrimination that Scott just affirmed.
Scott further described gun violence as “inexplicable.” But it is also well-settled social science, recognized by Vermont law, that what drives violence is trauma. Hurt people hurt people. A federal trauma campaign does not ameliorate security concerns. It compounds community harm.
Scott’s acquiescence — and more often, his silence — worsened legal access for the roughly 850 noncitizens held in Department of Corrections (DOC) custody on ICE detainers this year.
The DOC has a documented pattern of repeatedly disrupting pro bono legal access: protracted, ultimately fruitless operations negotiations; withheld practice policies, contradictory guidance, and rule changes mid-clinic; inconsistent meeting space for confidential client interviews; excluded interpreter and paralegal volunteers; and barred language access devices.
Most recently, DOC filed a bad-faith professional responsibility complaint against an attorney who hired a paid interpreter related to their detained client, diverting her time and attention away from client-focused deportation defense.
Vermont rejected Trump by the widest margin but went on to exacerbate lawyer scarcity and hand ICE senseless victories in the vain hope of limiting fiscal fallout. But look at Vermont’s Congressional Delegation, many of our agency leaders, our history: no amount of SNAP data divulgence, “sanctuary” wordsmithing, or civil society obstruction will hide the bluest state from Trump’s violence.
Scott’s silence and acquiescence are also violence. For 2026, it’s time for a new, proactive strategy.
In the first eight weeks of our first Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund (VILDF) grant, VAAP screened 43 detained people over six legal visits to Northwest State and Chittenden Regional facilities. Timely legal interventions secured decisive judicial orders checking ICE overreach and securing client safety. We restored access to basic health and safety for medically vulnerable detainees. We secured virtual hearing access and prevented “failure to appear” removal orders when DOC could not or would not bring detainees to court. We helped people walk free to fight their removal cases from home.
VAAP was ready to ramp up detention defense back in May, buoyed by donations, state House success and the Vermont Lawyers’ March. But Scott’s DOC obstructed efforts, delayed implementation and perpetuated ICE transfer churn, needlessly increasing self-deportation pressure for hundreds of detained people.
Vermont is not acting in “the best interest of those detained” by undermining legal access, nor by selectively condemning policies targeting “vetted” Afghan “friends and neighbors” while staying silent as Haitian and Venezuelan Vermonters lose Temporary Protected Status, Somali Vermonters face racist attacks, and a Latine second grader disappears to Texas.
Vermont must stop treating human rights and due process as anything other than constitutional guarantees. Legal access to enforce those guarantees do more than mitigate irreparable harm to individuals; they hold the line on rule of law and secure decisive checks on Executive overreach.
The Mahdawi and Öztürk cases exposed how Trump’s ICE can circumvent courts and undermine state sovereignty. Public scrutiny cultivated VAAP-supported wins for Nacho and Heidi, Mohammed, Esther, Nafiou, Vilma, Alexi, Jose, Max, and others, detained people who asserted their rights in court and preserved the rule of law for all.
We celebrate these victories and mourn what we lost. Vermont could have done more, sooner, if Scott had delivered the Vermont Constitution’s Art. 7 promise of instituting state government for the “common benefit,” rather than for the “advantage of any single person” or “sets of persons.”
In 2026, Vermont needs systemic solutions for systemic problems.
Governor Scott can lead proactive myth-busting, coordinated legal referral pathways, operational DOC legal access agreements and protocols to ensure effective—not chaotic—first response. Lawmakers can advance VAAP’s legislative recommendations. Agencies can document barriers through the Act 29 Study—rather than relying on media coverage alone.
We, the people, can demand accountability from state leaders. There are no rights without remedies, and no remedies in gridlock.
We can and will take care of ourselves and each other, Vermont. Remember: there is no justice. There is just us.

(Photo by Daniella Heminghaus/New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s steep decline in medical marijuana patients continued with another 20% drop since the beginning of 2025. 
Between January and December, roughly 14,000 people let their medical marijuana registration lapse, a trend that has continued since the recreational market launched in April 2022.  
As of mid-December, 51,776 people are registered medical marijuana patients, according to the state Cannabis Regulatory Commission. In June 2022, that figure was nearly 130,000.
Medical marijuana cardholders get some benefits. Dispensaries hold patient-only hours, give patients special parking, and let them skip ahead of recreational users in line. Patients also avoid paying cannabis taxes and can purchase up to 3 ounces of cannabis per day. Before the recreational market opened, patients were the only New Jerseyans who could legally buy marijuana. 
In recent years, officials have attempted to attract people back to the medical program by dropping the price of a registration card from $200 to $10 (there’s also a free digital option). People must also obtain a card from doctors who qualify to write medical cannabis prescriptions for treatment of conditions like epilepsy, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, cancer, and more. 
The drop in enrollment has reflected the trends other states have seen when launching adult-use weed. But most other states allow people to grow their own marijuana at home, particularly medical marijuana users, while New Jersey still fully bans it.

Manger scenes displayed around Christmastime usually feature an ox and an ass beside the infant Jesus. According to the Gospel of Luke, Mary placed her child in a manger – an animal feeding bin – “because there was no room for them in the inn.”
No mere babysitters, the ox and ass harken back to the Book of Isaiah 1:3, a verse early Christians interpreted as a prophecy of the birth of Christ. In some early artwork, these beasts of burden kneel to show their reverence – recognizing this swaddled babe, who entered the world in humble circumstances, as lordly.
The canonical Gospels, the accounts of Jesus’ life included in the Bible’s New Testament, make no mention of those animals welcoming the newborn. Yet the motif was already seen in art from the fourth century. It was further popularized by the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, an apocryphal text – that is, one not included in the canon of Scripture. Pseudo-Matthew was composed by an anonymous monk, probably in the seventh century, and includes many tales about Jesus growing up.
After its account of Jesus’ birth, the Bible is almost entirely silent on his childhood. Yet legends about Jesus’ early years circulated widely in the Middle Ages – the focus of my 2017 book. While the detail of the ox and ass is quite familiar to many Christians today, few are aware of the other striking tales transmitted by the apocrypha.
 Wonder-worker


‘Christ Discovered in the Temple,’ by Simone Martini (1342). Google Cultural Institute/Walker Art Gallery via Wikimedia Commons

The Bible does include one famous scene from Jesus’ youth: the incident when 12-year-old Jesus stayed behind at the Jewish temple in Jerusalem, unbeknownst to his parents. Searching for him with great anxiety, they find him conversing with religious teachers, both asking questions and astounding them with his answers. Fourteenth-century painter Simone Martini’s “Christ Discovered in the Temple” portrays him standing before his parents with crossed arms – a stubborn youth, apparently unapologetic about making them worry for days.
The apocryphal Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew – especially versions that incorporate material from an even earlier apocryphal gospel, the Infancy Gospel of Thomas – focuses on the years of Jesus’ childhood. Like the temple story, they show the boy Jesus as sometimes difficult and having preternatural wisdom that amazes and even offends his would-be teachers. More dramatically, the apocryphal legends depict Jesus exercising divine power from a very young age.

Like the adult Jesus of the New Testament, this apocryphal Christ child often works wonders to help others in need. According to the biblical Gospel of Matthew, Mary and Joseph take the infant Jesus to Egypt after an angel warns in a dream that Herod, King of Judea, would kill the child. In Pseudo-Matthew’s elaboration of this episode, we see Jesus, not yet 2 years old, bravely stand on his feet before dragons emanating from a cave, where his family has stopped to rest.
The terrifying dragons worship him and then depart, while Jesus boldly assures those around him that he is the “perfect man” and can “tame every kind of wild beast.” He later commands a palm tree to bend down so that a weary Mary can partake of its fruits, and he miraculously shortens their journey in the desert.
At times, the Jesus of these legends is largely to blame for the troubles around him. The 14th-century Tring Tiles, now in the British Museum, depict one of Jesus’ friends imprisoned by his father in a tower. Christ pulls him out of a tiny hole, like a gallant medieval knight rescuing a maiden in distress. The father had tried to insulate his son from Jesus’ influence – understandable, considering that many legends show Jesus causing the death of his playmates or other boys who somehow irked him.
In a story summarized by one scholar as “death for a bump,” a boy runs into Jesus. He curses the child, who instantly drops down dead – though Jesus brings him back to life after a brief reprimand from Joseph.

In another tale, included in an Anglo-Norman narrative that survives in an illustrated manuscript, Jesus takes off his coat, places it upon a sunbeam and sits upon it. When the other children see this, they “thought they would do the same …. But they were too eager, and they all fell down at once. One and another jumped up quickly onto the sunbeam, but it turned out badly for them, since each one broke his neck.” Jesus heals the boys at his parents’ prompting.
Joseph admits to his neighbors that Jesus “was indeed too wild” and sends him away. The 7-year-old Jesus becomes apprenticed to a dyer, who gives him very precise directions about dyeing three pieces of cloth in three different vats. Once his master has left, Jesus ignores his instructions, throwing all the cloth into one vat – yet still achieves the desired outcome. When the master returns, he at first thinks he has been “ruined by this little rascal,” but then realizes that a wonder has occurred.

 Bond with animals

These apocryphal legends also show the boy Jesus having power over the animal world. When he enters a dreaded lion’s cave, cubs “ran about around his feet, fawning and playing with him,” while “the older lions … stood at a distance and worshipped him, and wagged their tails before him.” Jesus tells bystanders that the beasts are better than they are, because the animals “recognize and glorify their Lord.”
Indeed, these tales characterize Jesus as a rather haughty boy, conscious of his divinity and not happy with those who treat him as a mere child. At the same time, they depict him as a real child who likes to play. The boy Jesus is childlike in the way he often acts on impulse, not paying much attention to the admonitions of his elders.

His affinity for animals, too, makes him seem childlike. Strikingly, beasts in the apocrypha, beginning with the ox and ass, often seem to realize that Jesus is no ordinary child before human characters do.
The legends’ insidious insinuation that many of the Jews around Jesus were not as perceptive as the animals is part of medieval Europe’s widespread antisemitism. In one fifth-century sermon, Quodvultdeus, the bishop of Carthage, asks why the animals’ recognition of Jesus in the manger was not a sufficient sign for the Jews.

In the Bible, Jesus works his first miracle as an adult, at a wedding feast in Cana. The apocryphal tales, however, toy with the idea of the God-man revealing his power early on. The legends suggest that the childishness of Christ distracted many of those around him, preventing them from concluding that he was the Messiah. This allows the apocrypha to avoid contradicting the Bible’s reference to Jesus as simply “the carpenter’s son,” the opposite of a wonder child.
Each Christmas, modern Christians in the Western world tend to celebrate Jesus’ birthday, then quickly drop the theme of the Christ child. Medieval Christians, in contrast, were fascinated by tales about the Son of God growing up. Despite acting as a dragon tamer, physician and magician, the young Jesus of the apocrypha largely flies under the radar, cloaking his divinity with “little rascal” boyishness.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)2025 was the year that Minnesota was on the national stage for all the wrong reasons: political assassinations, a school shooting, massive fraud in public programs, the political scapegoating of Somali immigrants.
I was on the ground at several standoffs between protesters and federal immigration agents, documenting arrests and the cops’ use of force against demonstrators. (A first for me in 2025: dealing with pepper spray on the job!)
One raid, at Bro-Tex in St. Paul, wasn’t far from my home. After the agents and protesters dispersed, Nicole Neri and I decided to return to my house to file our story and photos, pepper spray still lingering on our clothes. Nicole, who has much more experience with protest coverage than I do, walked me through the process of cleaning irritants off of clothes and skin. 
Take off your outer layer of clothing before entering the home to avoid triggering your wife’s asthma. Throw everything straight into the washing machine — yes, even your coat. Wash your face, then take a shower with cold water as soon as you can — this will probably cause you to cough and gag, but it’s important. Eat once your stomach settles.
I expect to get this process down to a science in 2026, because the pushback to the Trump administration’s immigration agenda is showing no signs of slowing down.
Immigration has been front and center for me recently, but it’s just one of many impacts of the Trump administration I’ve covered this year. Here are some of the other themes from my reporting this year. 
Hunger and the government shutdown
A record-breaking federal government shutdown delayed food assistance to thousands of Minnesotans who depend on it to feed themselves and their families. 
The state pitched in $4 million to food shelves to help them meet the need, but it was a drop in the bucket. When I was visiting a food shelf in St. Paul in early November, volunteers turned away people in need for the first time.
The shutdown highlighted the importance of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is facing cuts in coming years because of the Republican mega-law passed by Congress over the summer. 
The 2026 U.S. Senate race
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith announced early this year that she will not seek re-election when her term ends, setting off a Democratic primary that will be a national signal for Democrats seeking to map out the party’s future following the disaster at the top of the ticket in 2024. 
I profiled Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Rep. Angie Craig, who offer two distinct paths for the party. Flanagan is presenting herself as a candidate with a strong ideological backbone who is willing to take on Republicans and corporations head-on. Craig to replicate her success in the 2nd District by being more of a bridge-builder and win back voters who are put off by polarization in Congress. 
A consequential legislative session
Michelle Griffith is our point person at the Capitol, but I followed a handful of important issues through the session. 
Bipartisan negotiations resulted in cuts to health care programs; the repeal of MinnesotaCare eligibility for undocumented people; and a budget that took steps towards resolving a future deficit. 
Next session is unlikely to be quite as dramatic, though the speaker of the House is running for governor.

WESTON — In the New England state that grows the most Christmas trees, the Vermont Country Store offers a seeming galaxy of ornaments and add-ons, from floor-hugging skirts to ceiling-grazing stars.
“Evergreen trees are a universal symbol of the season,” the third generation of Orton family storekeepers writes on its website.
So why has the $100 million-a-year business seen a 2-foot-tall boxed alternative become a surprise bestseller?
“When things in the world seem a little chaotic, it brings back great memories and puts a smile on your face,” merchandising manager Julie Noyes said of the Charlie Brown Christmas Tree, which debuted six decades ago and has drawn new interest from people starting up or downsizing in a chilly economy.
When Charles Schulz introduced “Peanuts” 75 years ago, the late cartoonist didn’t envision the comic strip would lead to global syndication and a series of television specials, beginning with 1965’s “A Charlie Brown Christmas.”
In that show, the title character searches for the perfect Christmas tree, only to come home with a straggly sapling.
“Gee, do they still make wooden Christmas trees?” his friend Linus asks. “Maybe it just needs a little love.”
And with the addition of a blanket around its base, the conifer is soon warming hearts.
Sixty years later, $21.95 official replicas can be found at Vermont Country Stores in Weston and Rockingham, in their mail-order catalog and on their website — and in customer homes from Connecticut to California.
“It’s precious, just precious,” Jill Charbonneau said in a call from the Rockport, Maine, home she and her husband, Paul, have shared for a half-century. “It’s so simple and says everything it’s supposed to say.”
She’s not alone in her appreciation. The tree has an average customer rating of 4.9 out of 5, according to its webpage, with nearly 100 rave reviews about its simple cost, scale and upkeep from people coast to coast.
Take the Illinois couple settling into their first home. The traveling nurse on the road. The Colorado widow living alone. The Florida shopper rebuilding after a hurricane. All agree with the comment from the North Carolina woman facing mobility issues: “This little tree is my solution.” 
“It’s neat to have an old memory right in front of ya,” a Texas man adds in his review. “Takes me back to a time when life seemed so easy.”
The Vermont Country Store, with 450 year-round workers, almost doubles its staff each December to maintain its retail shops, Manchester offices and Clarendon distribution center during the busy holiday season, Noyes says. But the merchandising manager won’t specify how many Charlie Brown Christmas Trees are sold.
“Lots,” she says. “Lots and lots.”
All embodying something small and simple.
“Less is more,” one California reviewer summed up the tree. “It is a little ray of hope.”

Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway has cast news that she is being sued by the Chinese government as a badge of honor, pointing to the lawsuit as proof that her aggressive push to collect on a roughly $25 billion court judgment tied to the COVID-19 pandemic is having an impact.
But experts in international law say the lawsuit, filed in China earlier this year and announced last week by Hanaway, is more likely to do the opposite — making an already remote chance that Missouri will ever collect that money even slimmer, while potentially exposing U.S. assets abroad to retaliation.
Hanaway said last week in a news release that China is demanding a public apology from the state in a complaint filed in the Intermediate People’s Court of Wuhan, along with damages equivalent to $50.5 billion, legal fees and the right to seek additional compensation.
“This lawsuit is a stalling tactic and tells me that we have been on the right side of this issue all along,” Hanaway said.
The suit was filed after Missouri secured a default judgment earlier this year in a federal case alleging that China hoarded personal protective equipment during the early months of the pandemic. A judge ruled for Missouri after China declined to participate in the trial, awarding the state roughly $25 billion in damages.
Hanaway has since asked the U.S. State Department to notify China that Missouri intends to pursue assets with full or partial Chinese government ownership to satisfy the judgment. Her office is also assembling a list of Chinese properties that could be targeted, focusing on assets owned outright by the Chinese government or by companies in which it has a stake.
Legal scholars say those efforts face steep, and likely insurmountable, obstacles.
Chimène Keitner, director of the U.C. Davis Center for International Law & Policy, said government-owned property is generally protected by sovereign immunity — meaning Chinese government assets in the United States are shielded from seizure, just as U.S. government property is protected abroad.
China’s countersuit, she said, also appears unlikely to result in any recovery. But it carries legal and diplomatic implications that could further complicate Missouri’s case.
International law recognizes a doctrine known as “countermeasures,” Keitner said, which allows a country to take actions it otherwise could not as a way of pressuring another country to comply with international law.
If the U.S. government were to authorize Missouri’s efforts to seize Chinese assets, she said, it could expose American property in China to reciprocal action.
“So if Missouri violates China’s sovereign immunity,” Keitner said, “China could have a good argument for doing the same thing — not just against Missouri, but against the United States as a whole.”
Missouri wants to seize Chinese assets to recover $24 billion judgment in COVID case

William Dodge, a law professor at George Washington University who specializes in international law, said neither lawsuit “has a prayer of being enforced.”
Even if Missouri were allowed to pursue assets, Dodge said, the scope would be narrow. Only property owned by the defendants named in the lawsuit — including the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China, several national agencies, provincial and local governments around Wuhan and the Wuhan Institute of Virology — could potentially be targeted.
And the state would still have to show that those specific entities were involved in hoarding personal protective equipment, he said.
Dodge agreed that China’s lawsuit further reduces the already slim likelihood that Missouri will be able to collect because it raises the risk of retaliation.
“China’s law has a reciprocity provision,” he said. “It basically says that if a foreign country gives China less immunity than Chinese law provides, China can respond by giving that foreign country less immunity. In other words: whatever the U.S. does to us, we can do to them.”
U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh initially dismissed Missouri’s lawsuit in 2022, ruling that the state could not sue China. An appeals court later allowed one claim to proceed — the allegation that China hoarded items such as respirator masks, medical gowns and gloves.
After Chinese officials failed to respond, Limbaugh accepted Missouri’s estimate of past and future damages of more than $8 billion, tripled it as federal law allows, and added 3.91% interest until the judgment is paid.
In an emailed statement last month, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said China’s pandemic response involved “acts of national sovereignty” that are not subject to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts.
China will not pay, Liu said, and “will retaliate if necessary.”
The lawsuit filed in China accuses Missouri of “fabricating enormous disinformation” and spreading “stigmatizing and discriminating slanders” that it says have damaged China’s reputation.
Hanaway scoffed at China’s criticism.
“We stand undeterred in our mission to collect on our $24 billion judgment that was lawfully handed down in federal court,” she said.
Neither side’s claims are likely to result in any tangible recovery, Keitner said, leaving the dispute largely symbolic.
“Unfortunately, this all seems to be a lot of unhelpful political theater,” she said, “with no clear off-ramp for either side to save face.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54921771475_e3916f919a_c.jpg,,,2025-12-24 06:57:54.242719

The Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations announced that the minimum wage is set to increase by $1.25 beginning in 2026. The minimum wage rate will be in effect for all non-exempt employers.
Missouri’s HB 567, signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe into law on July 10, repealed statewide earned paid sick time while simultaneously modifying the state’s minimum wage law.
It eliminated the automatic inflation adjustments that were set to begin in 2027 and kept the $15 per hour rate for public employers. However, it is also removing voter-approved worker protections for businesses as of Aug. 28.
Lily Roberts is the managing director of economic policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan economic policy institute. She said conversations about adjusting the minimum wage reflect rising prices that have increased in recent years.
“Everybody can tell you about inflation, and everybody can tell you about the cost of rent or groceries or childcare being really expensive, but the flip side of that is wages,” Roberts said. “There are many folks who are worse off and less able to keep up with those raising prices because a major pillar of how we make wage policy hasn’t been changed since 2009.”
The federal minimum wage is $7.25 and it hasn’t been adjusted since 2009, which Roberts said is the longest it’s gone unchanged since the introduction of minimum wage in 1938.
“$7.25 is so unbelievably low that many people don’t even believe that it’s still that low,” Roberts said.
In Missouri, employers who are involved in retail or service businesses and have an annual gross income less than $500,000 are exempt from having to pay the state minimum wage rate. Instead, those employers can pay their workers any wage at their discretion, according to the Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations.
Roberts said Missouri is unique in the fact that it raised its minimum wage to reflect inflation numbers, but when the state implements a $15 an hour minimum wage, it is no longer required to factor in inflation.
Between 2015 and 2019, Missouri’s minimum wage rose just under a dollar, from $7.65 to $8.60. Since 2019, the increase has been at least $0.75 annually every year except for 2023. The $1.25 jump will be the second straight year that the minimum wage has increased by more than a dollar.
Missouri is one of 34 U.S. states, territories and districts that has a higher minimum wage than the federal requirement.
Roberts said Missouri is in line with nearby states, such as South Dakota, Nebraska and Arkansas. All of those states, plus Missouri, have consistently been working on increasing their respective minimum wages.
“Some of them are doing it gradually over time to get to ($15 an hour) and others are passing individual laws,” Roberts said. “These longer-term predictable changes are really the trend right now, where you give businesses and employees a sense of how their wages will grow over time, and it means that it’s easier to predict and easier for employers to budget for.”
She said business owners are often fighting for higher wages, contrary to popular belief, because they need to be able to compete.
“The higher your wages that you pay, in general, the lower your turnover is,” Roberts said. “So businesses that pay really small dollars tend to have a lot of turnover. It actually gets really counterproductive and expensive very quickly because the business owner has to spend all of their time hiring, training and trying to retain folks.”

A judge ruled Tuesday that 37 untabulated ballots in Hamtramck’s disputed municipal election should not be counted, affirming Adam Alharbi’s controversial and narrow victory in the race for mayor.
However, the decision is likely only the starting gun for a legal race against the clock before the city’s new mayor is sworn in at the beginning of January.
In her written decision Tuesday, Judge Patricia Perez Fresard of the Third Judicial Circuit of Michigan said that the Wayne County Board of Canvassers “exercised its discretion” when declining to count the 37 ballots after the city clerk “failed to comply with mandatory requirements imposed to protect the integrity of ballots.”
Fresard had initially ordered the parties to meet to see if they could come to a resolution. That failed, attorneys said, leading to just over 20 minutes of courtroom debate Tuesday, primarily between lawyers for Alharbi and his opponent in the mayoral race, City Council member Muhith Mahmood, who finished 11 votes behind.
Mark Brewer, representing Mahmood as well as the 37 disenfranchised voters, said that to not count the votes would be to violate a number of election-related constitutional protections. Nabih Ayad, representing Alharbi, argued that there was “absolutely no viable path” to count the ballots, and that doing so would effectively disenfranchise other voters.
“The arguments of both counsel are that the court should protect voter rights,” Fresard said Tuesday morning at the end of the hearing. “In some circumstances, it’s very difficult to protect the rights of every single individual voter.”
The dispute has brought weeks of uncertainty to Hamtramck and its nearly 28,000 residents. It all started when, due to human error, 37 absentee ballots were left in their envelopes and went uncounted on election night. Election officials discovered them a few days later and immediately delivered them to Wayne County officials.
But at some point between the end of election night and when the ballots were discovered, a number of unauthorized city officials had walked into the office where the ballots had been, breaking the chain of custody. That led county officials to question whether they should be counted, and the Wayne County Board of Canvassers ultimately deadlocked on whether to include them in the final tally. That meant that the ballots would not be counted, and Alharbi was certified as the winner by just six votes; a recount later determined his actual winning margin was 11 votes.
Mahmood then sued to have the 37 mishandled ballots counted. Brewer argued Tuesday that, otherwise, the 37 unnamed voters’ constitutional right to vote was being invalidated.
“Plaintiffs have no other remedy, other than to have their votes counted, as is their right,” he told the court. Allowing those voters to cast a new ballot would also be sufficient, he said.
But Fresard disagreed. Michigan law “does not support … that the City had a clear legal duty to tabulate the 37 votes,” she wrote. State law requires absentee votes to be tabulated according to the law, she wrote, but the board has the discretion to not count ballots it has questions about.
Brewer, in an email before the decision came down Tuesday, said he would be appealing “immediately” to the Michigan Court of Appeals “and on to the Michigan Supreme Court if necessary.”
Tuesday evening, he confirmed they had already appealed.
Hamtramck has been embroiled in election-related scandals for much of 2025. City Clerk Rana Faraj was put on leave shortly after the election, which Amer Ghalib, the city’s outgoing mayor, said was partially because her office mishandled the 37 ballots. Earlier this month, Faraj sued the city and several of its officials, alleging she was being retaliated against for reporting election fraud.
Two City Council members were charged in August with forging signatures on absentee ballots during the 2023 council race. Four others, including two other council members and an incoming council member, were named in an April document from Attorney General Dana Nessel seeking a special prosecutor for the case. No one else has been charged.

Senate Bill 235 took effect this year to offer 50% matching funds for Grow Your Own Educator initiatives, which provide tuition or loan repayment assistance for school district employees pursuing an undergraduate teaching degree.
“These matching funds are really important because they’re going to allow the schools to market this to a wider audience, increase their pipeline, and the ultimate goal is to turn existing support staff and (paraprofessionals) and teachers’ aides into certified classroom teachers once they matriculate through this process,” the bill’s author, Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, said. “And so, there is an urgency to this for our schools.”

Editor’s note: This story is part of Oklahoma Voice’s end-of-year series that provides updates to some stories that captured the interest of Oklahomans in 2025.

The Oklahoma State Department of Education opened a portal in late November for districts or their affiliated nonprofits to apply for the matching funds, Pugh said.

The Education Department was slow to launch the program in the months after the bill was signed into law in May, Pugh said, but progress started to accelerate once new state Superintendent Lindel Fields took over the agency in October.
The agency has had contact with 25 districts about the program and held meetings with the Oklahoma City Public Schools Foundation, representatives of Altus schools and Tulsa Public Schools’ Tulsa Teacher Corps program, department spokesperson Bailey Woolsey said. Seven other districts have applied, but none met the required criteria.
Once an application is approved, it should take about two to three weeks for a district to receive its funds, Woolsey said.
Pugh estimated 40 districts have some version of a Grow Your Own Educator program. 
The law matches closely with the Teacher Pipeline Program at the OKCPS Foundation. President and CEO Kendra Horn said the foundation has started the process of submitting documents to apply for state Grow Your Own funds.
State funding will match half of what districts or their foundations spend for school support staff to attend state-accredited teacher preparation programs at colleges and universities.
Horn estimated the OKCPS Foundation would qualify for $80,000 to $90,000 a year in state support. That’s half the amount the foundation pays to send district paraprofessionals to the University of Central Oklahoma.
The foundation also helps program participants complete initial credits at Oklahoma City Community College and Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City before they finish their degrees at UCO.
Now in its 10th year, the OKCPS Foundation program is the “largest and most proven” of its kind in Oklahoma, Horn said.

By this spring, the program will have helped 50 classroom paraprofessionals graduate with a teaching degree, she said. Each candidate has to work as a classroom aide while completing their college credits, and they must pledge to teach in the Oklahoma City district for three years after graduation.
The foundation covers the full cost of their college tuition, fees and books. Horn said the paraprofessionals effectively double their income once they start earning a teacher’s salary.
“It’s changing their future and their kids’ future,” she said. “That’s what it’s doing. I could be really practical and talk to you about the numbers, but ultimately this is changing lives and they’re going on to change the lives of hundreds and maybe eventually thousands of kids.”
Extra funding from the state could enable the program to expand in the future, and it frees up money for the foundation to better support the current candidates, like providing them transportation to their classes, Horn said.
Along with combatting Oklahoma’s decade-long teacher shortage, the pipeline program initially was designed to bring more bilingual and racially diverse teachers into OKCPS, a district where the vast majority of students are non-white and where 46% are learning English as their non-native language. Now, it’s open to district paraprofessionals of any background, Horn said.
“I think this is the most established and successful Grow Your Own program in the state of Oklahoma right now,” she said. “I hope that more come along and that we continue to get support because education is the one thing that can determine whether or not we attract more people to this state, whether there are quality jobs and whether we all have a chance to succeed.”

From the Wyoming Freedom Caucus and rowdy town halls to legal battles over election laws and abortion restrictions, here’s a recap of the year in politics. 
The post Year in review: Wyoming’s top political stories for 2025 appeared first on WyoFile .","It may not have been an election year in Wyoming, but 2025 still had plenty of standout political moments and events. 
From rowdy town halls to a new group of Republicans rising to power in the statehouse to legal battles over election laws and abortion restrictions, here’s a look back at some of those stories. 
Wyoming Freedom Caucus takes the wheel
In January, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus pitched a new legislative era of “bold policies” guided by “godly principles.”
The group of hard-line Republicans won control of the House in 2024 and this year’s general session marked their first time at the statehouse helm.

The caucus wielded that power in Cheyenne by prioritizing certain bills, pushing back on gubernatorial budget vetoes from the year prior, accusing the governor and other lawmakers of breaking the law and using the House speaker’s “drawer” to unilaterally squash 95 bills.
Meantime, other lawmakers pushed back against the caucus, perhaps most notably when the Senate announced it would not pass a supplemental budget — an unprecedented action in Wyoming. 
In the legislative off-season, known as the interim, the Freedom Caucus announced its plans to take inspiration from the Trump administration’s efforts to cut federal jobs and spending by “DOGE-ing” the state budget. 
From there, the caucus used the Management Audit Committee to subpoena several local officials and formed a subcommittee to scrutinize the Department of Health, which regularly has the largest budget of any state agency. 
More recently, the caucus has pledged to cut spending, citing “pre-pandemic spending levels” as a general target. 
Election laws and litigation 
Lawmakers filed a whopping 45 bills to remake Wyoming’s elections, accounting for about 8% of all legislation in both the House and the Senate this year. 
Just eight of those bills survived to Gov. Mark Gordon’s desk, including one to require residents to provide proof of citizenship and residency when registering to vote. That particular bill, which became law with Gordon’s signature, spurred a federal lawsuit that drew in high-profile attorneys, the Republican National Committee, a coalition of 25 states and Guam and the Trump administration. 
A federal court dismissed the case in July, siding with Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who was named as a defendant in his official capacity alongside the state’s 23 county clerks.

In August, Gray and the Freedom Caucus backed the Trump administration’s plans to stop states from using voting machines and mail-in ballots. The exact details of Trump’s plans remain to be seen since no executive order has been issued yet. 
In the meantime, lawmakers charged ahead — again — with election reform. Between two committees, legislators voted to sponsor 14 bills tied to elections. Some of those bills were inspired by the upheaval surrounding the Weston County clerk and an initial miscount and subsequent audit in the 2024 general election. 
Abortion
Early in the year, lawmakers passed new abortion laws, including one to require a transvaginal ultrasound before taking abortion medication, another to restrict the state’s sole facility that provides in-clinic abortions. 
Gordon vetoed the ultrasound bill before lawmakers doubled down and voted to override his veto. However, a state judge halted enforcement of the two new laws in April. Two months later, another judge blocked a third new law that dealt with off-label medications. 
At the crux of each of those legal challenges is a 2012 amendment to the Wyoming Constitution, which protects people’s rights to make their own health care decisions. 
Whether that amendment makes banning abortion unconstitutional is the central question in litigation related to the state’s two abortion bans, which the Wyoming Supreme Court considered in April. Justices grilled attorneys, but a decision in the case has yet to be published.

Chief Justice Lynne Boomgaarden told WyoFile in October that a ruling would not be expected until the year’s end. 
Property taxes
It was another big year for lawmakers seeking to cut residential property taxes. But the House and the Senate didn’t always see eye to eye. 
While firefighters, sheriffs, community colleges and special districts appeared at the Capitol in protest of blanket property tax cuts during the legislative session, the two chambers squared off. 
First, the Senate rejected House amendments to a proposal to create a two-year tax break for homeowners, partly on account of confusion over what exactly the lower chamber’s changes did to the bill. And after a deal was allegedly struck, it fell apart with Senate leadership accusing their House counterparts of backing out of an agreement. 
Lawmakers ultimately settled on a deal to cut residential property taxes by 25%, resulting in reduced local services in certain parts of the state. Separately, it will be up to voters in next year’s election to decide whether to approve an additional 50% cut. 
In June, Sen. Bob Ide, R-Casper, asked legislators to consider an even more sweeping proposal — to amend the Wyoming Constitution to abolish property taxes altogether. 
That prompted about two dozen Casper homeowners to attend a legislative committee meeting in August urging lawmakers against further cuts.

In November, the Joint Revenue Committee voted to sponsor one bill to eliminate residential property taxes, another to raise sales taxes to replace the resulting revenue loss. 
The measures will be up for consideration by the entire Legislature next year. 
In memoriam
In September, the assassination of Charlie Kirk shocked the state, including those in Wyoming who helped the commentator get his start and those who credit him with inspiring their political lives. Kirk’s death also sparked disputes about free speech. 
Wyoming also mourned the passing of many who served in elected office, including former U.S. Senator Alan Simpson, former Secretary of State Kathy Karpan, former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, state Rep. John Eklund and former Superintendent of Public Instruction Judy Catchpole.

The heavily redacted tranche of documents violates the public's right to know, writes columnist Rod Miller. 
The post Opaque transparency, the Epstein files and you appeared first on WyoFile .","Bad stuff always happens when our government cloaks itself in secrecy and doesn’t tell us what it is doing in our name. We get into wars and people die. Our money is stolen from us and assholes get rich. Our elected leaders break our laws with impunity, violate our trust and we are left with an impotent system. Bad stuff.

Opinion

A democratic society such as ours can only thrive in the bright sunlight of transparency. It only works as intended when the citizens know what their government is doing on their behalf.
When government keeps secrets from the people, that system cannot be called free. It is by definition something else entirely.
Take the Epstein files, for instance. The seedy nexus between a convicted sex offender and powerful politicians and celebrities has been fertile ground for conjecture for years. Our Department of Justice has investigated that nexus thoroughly and compiled hundreds of thousands of documents and photographs as evidence. But the DOJ has long kept those files embargoed from the public, leaving us to assume that powerful politicians are being protected by government secrecy.
Conspiracy theories have sprouted like mushrooms in all that darkness.
The burning question is not which rich, powerful men were canoodling with teenage girls on Epstein’s private seraglio island, but rather why our government, particularly the DOJ, refuses to release the information. This issue is best viewed not through a lens of titillating scandal among elites or partisan one-upsmanship, but rather through the clear lens of the public’s right to know.
To quell the supposition over the files and quench the conspiracy theories, Congress passed a bespoke law to force the DOJ to release the information by a certain date. House Resolution 4405, “The Epstein Files Transparency Act,” was passed by Congress and signed by President Trump on Nov. 19. It mandated that ALL Epstein files be released within 30 days.
The law also strictly limited what information could be redacted from the files. It specified that no information contained in the files could be withheld or redacted to protect politicians or other powerful people from embarrassment. Here is the pertinent section of the law: “No record shall be withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.”
The only redactions allowed by law are to protect the privacy of victims or for purposes of national security. I think we can all agree that Epstein and his cronies were not on the island to discuss our military order of battle in the Mideast, the names of our spies on foreign soil or our plans to annex Greenland. National security was not the reason they were cavorting with middle school cheerleaders.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)

Yet, despite the specificity of the law, the DOJ barely beat the deadline and released only a fraction of the Epstein files to the public. And the tranche that was released was heavily redacted.
That means the U.S. Department of Justice, the nation’s highest law enforcement organization, defied both the president and Congress and broke the law. And they did so to keep hidden from the American people information that the executive and legislative branches of government ordered to be revealed.
Think, for a moment, about the lawlessness of that behavior by the DOJ. About the cynicism and hubris. If the top law enforcement agency in our government breaks the law to protect powerful elites, how can we call ourselves a nation under law?
It doesn’t matter one rat’s ass whose names are in the Epstein files, or to what party they belong. The law states that those names must be revealed to the public as a matter of transparency.
For DOJ bureaucrats to defy the law and keep secrets from us should piss us all off!
Trump can provide that transparency, if he wants to, with a phone call or the stroke of his pen. He can order Attorney General Pam Bondi to comply with the law. If she refuses, he can fire her and replace her with someone who will follow orders. Nixon proved, with his Saturday Night Massacre, that a president has that power.
The ball is in Trump’s court.
Among all the gripes we have about government — taxes, immigration, woke policies, ICE, National Guardsmen in our streets, blowing up Venezuelan “drug” boats, DEI and so many other legitimate complaints — government not trusting citizens enough to tell us the truth should outweigh them all.
Telling citizens the truth is, in my estimation, the most important job of government. Without that, we cannot be a free people. As Jesus said, in John 8:32, “Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”

Contractors recently completed a 29-acre fuels reduction project in Virgil Phillips Farm Park, near Moscow, that should make the park more resilient to wildfires.
The project is a partnership between the Latah Soil and Water Conservation District and Latah County. The farm and park, donated to the City of Moscow many years ago, is managed by Latah County. It’s located about five miles north of town on the northwest shoulder of Moscow Mountain, west of U.S. Highway 95.


For more information, go to https://www.latahswcd.org/.


“The conservation district got us moving on the project,” said Tom Lamar, a Latah County commissioner. “It seems like it turned out really well.”
The 160-acre park is popular with locals. It features a number of hiking trails that lead through a variety habitats including forested lands, open fields and wetlands. The park includes several intermittent streams and two ponds. It is home to a variety of wildlife species such as moose, elk, deer, black bear, birds and amphibians. Visitors can enjoy historic and newly planted orchards in the park as well.
Latah County recently completed an updated Community Wildfire Protection Plan in 2023, which identified high fire risk areas in the county and strategies to improve resilience. Forested areas in the Urban-Rural Interface were identified as being especially vulnerable to wildfires. With recent population growth, more people are interested in finding rural homes in the Moscow Mountain area. 
“Recent relatively large fire events clearly illustrate the mounting urban-interface issue facing Latah County,” the Community Wildfire Protection Plan said. “Population growth rates have been greatest in the western part of the County around Moscow, Viola, and Potlatch. Agricultural land is being subdivided and people are moving to the more rural parts of the County.
“The growing appreciation for seclusion has led to significant development in many of the lower elevation forests. Frequently, this development is in the dry ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir, forest types where grass, needles, and brush surface litter create forest fuel conditions that are at a high propensity for fire occurrence,” the Community Wildfire Protection Plan report said.

That type of forest eco-type is exactly the kind of environment found at the Virgil Phillips Farm Park.
“Wildfires are always a concern,” said Ryan Lawrence, district manager of the Latah Soil and Water Conservation District. “The Clearwater Complex fires were really a wake-up call. Our summers are getting hotter and drier. You always wonder, where will the next fire be?” 
The Clearwater complex fires in 2015 were lightning-caused events that destroyed 48 homes and 70 outbuildings and consumed 68,127 acres of private, state and federal land. A number of other fires have occurred between 2015 and 2021 in the county, according to the Community Wildfire Protection Plan report.
There were two fires that occurred in Latah County in 2025 – the 80-acre Lamb Fire near Troy and the White Pine Fire near the Giant White Pine campground in September. 
Out of the recent fires that have occurred, most were caused by either humans or lightning, the report said. The historical frequency of fires in the local area ranges from once every 35 years to 200 years, depending on elevation. 
By completing the Community Wildfire Protection Plan report, Latah County became eligible for grant funding for fuel-reduction projects, said Mauri Knott, senior planner for the county. “It’s been years since we got funding for fire prevention projects,” she said. “The Phillips Farm project created an opportunity to do some fuel-reduction work, education outreach and create some momentum for future projects.”
The Latah SWCD applied for $70,000 in funding from Avista Corporation and Title 3 federal funds to cover the project costs. With the money in hand, Latah County hired Northwest Management to create a detailed forest management plan for the park. The fuels-reduction work was completed in Fall 2025. 
In a fact sheet about the project, the Latah District said, “The Virgil Phillips Farm has been designated as a priority area for fuels-reduction treatment due to the timbered borders along the wildlife-urban interface, where small acreage developments and public access significantly elevate the threat of wildfires. 
“Phillips Farm and adjacent private lands will be treated through vegetation removal to slow the spread of a fire, create fire breaks to improve access for firefighters to respond, improve forest health and protect homes.”
The following practices were implemented: 

Forest thinning by removing trees of poor quality, those infested with insects or disease, and small-diameter conifer trees to maintain an open forest structure and avoid crown fires. 
Removing ladder fuels through limbing lower branches to reduce the spread of ground fire into the canopy.
Masticate understory growth and slash resulting from tree and limb removal. 

Officials with Northwest Management said they thought the project went well. 
“I think we hit the objectives,” said Tucker Flaten, a forester for Northwest Management, based in Moscow. “Our main concern was the fuel conditions. We wanted to create opportunities for fire crews to break up fuel continuity.”
They also looked at the spacing between trees to ensure that if there were a fire in the area and a tanker plane was flying overhead to drop retardant on the blaze, the retardant could reach the ground,” he said. 
The treatments mainly took out trees less than 10” in diameter and a lot of brush, he said.

Latah Commissioner Lamar was worried that too much brush and ground vegetation would be removed, potentially harming smaller critters that depend on that habitat for survival. But after touring the property, he thought things looked A-OK. 
“My biggest question was about the impact to the ecosystem that relies on the understory for survival – the habitat on the forest floor,” he said. “But in touring the property, I realized that they weren’t doing 100 percent of the brushing treatment and mastication across the landscape. They were leaving some of that low-lying habitat for edge effect for wildlife.
“They did a good job. Tucker was great – he understood how to do the fuels-reduction treatments so they would reduce the fire hazard keep doing more projects,” Lawrence said. 
He sees the Virgil Phillips Farm Park project as a “demonstration” project that will help educate the local community about the need for fuels-reduction projects. Two public tours of the farm project have given local residents a chance to see the results. Information signage will be placed in the park to inform visitors about the benefits of fuels reduction work and forest health.

Ahmed Jallow: “I’m selecting the piece on mental health support in Black churches and barbershops as my story of the year. It’s a favorite of mine because it’s truly solutions-oriented, showcasing how these community-run spaces are creating their own networks of support where they’re needed most.”
On a Tuesday afternoon in July, inside The Bar Ber Shop in Raleigh, Reggie Winston, 41, talks about a subject many of his young clients rarely discuss anywhere else: mental health. 
Winston, who is trained in mental health first aid and suicide prevention, remembers battling depression in high school without realizing it. “I had no clue what I was experiencing was depression,” he said. It wasn’t until he heard someone else’s story that he recognized his own, a realization that led him to therapy and, eventually, a mission.  
After the COVID-19 pandemic, Winston expanded the community work he’d started years earlier with free blood pressure screenings in his shop. This time, he turned to mental health, founding Grooming Resources and Opportunities, a nonprofit that trains barbers to spot signs of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. 
His method begins with seemingly casual questions when someone climbs into his barber chair. Instead “How are you?” he’ll ask, “What time did you wake up? What are your plans today?” As he snips and shapes, his clients reveal pieces of their lives they rarely share anywhere else.
Slowly, in the safety of his barber chair, these simple inquiries allow clients to reveal what’s really happening in their lives, Winston said.  
“Once they get comfortable and start trusting you with their haircut,” Winston said, “they start trusting you with their mind and their heart.” 
From 2013 to 2022, 377 Black North Carolinians ages 10 to 24 died by suicide, according to data. Nearly 17% of Black high school students said they had seriously considered suicide. Among middle schoolers, more than a third reported the same. The numbers peak at age 24 — and are especially stark for Black girls questioning their sexual orientation, who now report the highest rates of suicide attempts in schools statewide. 
“The myth that Black people don’t die by suicide has been dangerous,” said Bettie Murchison, a longtime advocate who runs the Village of C.A.R.E. in Wake County. “We’ve had to fight against that in our families, in our churches, and in our schools.”

Winston’s effort is a key part of North Carolina’s response to rising suicide rates among Black youth. This year, the state health department launched the Black Youth Suicide Prevention Action Plan, a five-year initiative that leans on trusted community spaces, including barbershops and churches, to expand support and prevent suicide among Black youth and young adults. Unlike the state’s broader suicide-prevention strategy, this plan focuses on the unique needs of Black youth.  
Dr. Sonyia Richardson, a UNC Chapel Hill researcher and one of the plan’s architects, said it was built on listening sessions with young people and their communities. “This is not a top-down plan,” she said. “It’s community-led, community-driven, community-implemented.” 
One of its guiding principles: young people in crisis often turn not to doctors, but to trusted adults in familiar places — coaches, pastors, aunties, barbers. 
“We’re meeting the needs of communities where youth are more likely to seek support. From local YMCAs, churches, and community centers rather than traditional mental health providers,” Richardson said. 
Barbershops and churches 
That’s where Winston and his longtime friend, counselor Rodney Harris, come in. This year alone, he and Harris have trained more than a dozen barbers in mental health first aid training. These programs teach them to spot warning signs of mental distress and suicide, as well as how to safely talk with clients about limiting access to firearms and other deadly means. They’ve trained barbers across Raleigh, Wake Forest and Durham. Soon they’ll be in Rocky Mount. 
“Barbers often know more about their clients’ lives than anyone else,” Harris said. “When a clinician approaches, youth might be skeptical. But when a barber speaks, they listen.” 
Barbershops have become hubs for this work well beyond North Carolina. The Confess Project, for example, has trained barbers across the country in mental health advocacy. 
What’s different with GRO is that they train barbers to become community leaders themselves, Harris said. “What we saw as a gap in the research is to make the barbers trainers and then have them go into the community, offer additional trainings, and then they can also offer recruitment,” Harris said. That work, he added, includes expanding mental health first aid and counseling on access to lethal means, known as CALM.
The same approach is playing out in churches. Through Murchison’s Village of C.A.R.E. program, she trains pastors and faith leaders to act as first responders. “If we can get them to understand this is as much a part of their ministry as teaching the Bible,” she said, “we can reach a generation of youth who don’t see a therapist as their first line of defense.”

 Building trust beyond the shop

State officials have identified 17 counties in North Carolina that are in urgent need of suicide prevention efforts. These counties, which range from major metropolitan areas like Durham, Wake, and Mecklenburg to smaller, rural communities such as Edgecombe, Halifax and Hoke, have the highest rates of Black youth suicides and the highest volume of 988 crisis calls. In each of these communities, Black residents make up at least 25% of the population. 
Still, many young people don’t trust the 988 Lifeline. Black youth are underrepresented among callers, even though they show up disproportionately in emergency room visits for self-injury. Officials say building confidence in the hotline is essential to reaching young people before a crisis escalates.  
Kelly Crosbie, director of the state’s Division of Mental Health, said fear and mistrust keep many from using the hotline. “There’s just personal shame, not knowing who’s on the other end, and what’s going to happen,” she said. Some families worry that calling could trigger involuntary hospitalization or even police involvement. “Some of these young folks, their families have already experienced trauma when they’ve tried to engage with treatment systems or government systems,” she added. 










Once they get comfortable and start trusting you with their haircut,” Winston said, “they start trusting you with their mind and their heart.

Mistrust can run even deeper for LGBTQ youth. In North Carolina, Black girls who are questioning their sexual orientation now report the highest rates of suicide attempts in schools statewide. At the same time, the federal government eliminated funding for the 988 “Press 3” option, which connected LGBTQ and transgender callers to specialized counselors. Advocates warn the loss strips away a culturally competent lifeline that has reached more than a million young people nationwide. 
State officials say they have begun training local crisis counselors to handle calls from that population and are working with communities to ensure that 988 operators are equipped with inclusive, culturally aware training. “We’re losing that specialized national line,” Crosbie told NC Health News last month, “but we are making sure our 988 here is well-trained and ready.” 
The state has also launched a youth-led awareness campaign, called “Stronger Together” initiative. Messaging, visuals, and formats are being created by Black youth themselves to make the hotline feel credible and relatable. “We need to get the messaging straight from young people,” Crosbie said. The effort includes training peers and trusted community figures—like pastors, coaches, and barbers—to recognize warning signs and encourage youth to seek help. 
Current data shows texting and chat are the most utilized 988 services among North Carolina youth. Crosbie said that makes it even more important to meet young people where they are—whether that’s on their phones, in churches, or in barbershops. “We need to make sure the help is in places and spaces that people trust,” she said. 
In addition to breaking cultural stigmas surrounding mental health discussions, other strategies include reducing access to lethal means and providing gun locks, and hosting community trainings. 
The first Black youth suicide prevention conference is scheduled for September in Rocky Mount, which is one of the high need areas. Richardson hopes the plan will serve as a national model for suicide prevention among diverse populations. “We are focusing on those populations most impacted in our state… and I think this also provides a blueprint for how to create [prevention strategies] across the state.”
Back at The Bar Ber Shop, Winston says he sees that trust forming every day. Kids sit in his chair for a haircut and end up sharing the things they don’t tell teachers or parents. 
“Barbers are the bridge for people to get the help they need,” Winston said. “We are the trusted few.”

(Photo courtesy of Karlene Ferrante)As counties across Wisconsin sell off publicly-owned nursing homes to private companies, communities worry that privatization will bring understaffing, declining quality of care, and more regulatory violations, driving many residents to fight back.
After Karlene Ferrante broke her femur, she underwent major surgery and was transferred to a skilled nursing facility to recover. She spent a little over two months at the county-owned Portage County Health Care Center in Stevens Point, Wisconsin.
“​​I lucked out and got sent to the Portage County Healthcare Center. They took wonderful care of me for that whole summer and until I was able to go home,” Ferrante said. “Because of that great care that I got, I am able to walk. I have my leg. I didn’t get an infection and I didn’t fall. They were adequately staffed and they provided really good care.”
There are only two skilled nursing facilities in Stevens Point. The publicly-owned Portage County Health Care Center, which has served the community for nearly a century and has a five-star rating from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the privately-owned Stevens Points Health Services, which has a one-star rating from CMS. Ferrante was relieved to get into the county-owned facility, but the relief faded when she returned home and learned that the county was considering selling Portage County Health Care Center to a private company.
“When I found out that they were trying to privatize it, I decided then that I’m going to work on this,” Ferrante said. “I’m not going to let that happen, because other people should be able to get the same kind of care that I got.”
Across Wisconsin, County Boards have been voting to sell their skilled nursing facilities as local communities fight the sales, especially in rural counties. In Portage County, retired professor Ferrante, a two-time patient at the Portage County Health Care Center, has joined the Save the Portage County Health Care Center group, which opposes the privatization of the county facility.
“We are the only five-star skilled nursing facility in Portage County,” said Nancy Roppe, a lifelong resident of Portage County and one of the group’s organizers. “The quality of care is stellar… people clamor to get their care here, because they know when they press the call button, somebody will respond.”
In 2018, Portage County residents approved a four-year, $5.6 million referendum to support the facility’s operations. Then, in 2022, they passed another measure authorizing tax increases to fund the construction of a new facility.
Roppe said the referendums signaled public strong support for Portage County Health Care Center, but Portage County is trying to sell the health care center to The Ensign Group, a private company which has purchased other nursing facilities in the state.

In Lincoln County, Wisconsin, the County Board voted over the summer to sell the county-owned Pine Crest Nursing Home, which had been serving the county for over 70 years, to Ensign. Just a few months after the transition from county to corporate ownership, members of the Lincoln County community have seen noticeable changes in the quality of care.
“We are already seeing the changes,” said Pastor Mike Southcombe, the senior pastor at St. Stephen’s United Church of Christ in Merrill, the county seat of Lincoln County. “The staffing is less than it was when the county ran it.”
Research consistently shows that publicly-owned facilities not only maintain higher staffing and care standards but also serve as essential safety nets for vulnerable populations, ensuring access to long-term care for residents who might otherwise be turned away by for-profit operators.
A 2022 report by the Center for Medicare Advocacy warned that privatizing county-owned nursing homes often led to lower staffing levels and diminished quality of care, as for-profit operators prioritized revenue over residents’ needs. The report found that promised cost savings rarely materialized, while accountability and public oversight were significantly reduced.
An academic study also found that privatizing county-owned nursing homes increased regulatory violations and reduced residents’ quality of care and quality of life, while failing to improve access for Medicaid recipients.
Working Class Storytelling reported that during a February town hall in Lincoln County, data presented by LeadingAge Wisconsin indicated that publicly-owned nursing homes in the state provide higher-quality care than private or nonprofit facilities.
While some Lincoln County officials said that the county did not have adequate funding to continue the operation of Pine Crest, Eileen Guthrie, a retired accountant who lives in Lincoln County and regularly volunteered at Pine Crest, crunched the numbers and found that Pine Crest was bringing in a profit.
“I started looking at all of the public records, whether they were from the finance committee or the county board, or online… I kept digging and digging,” said Guthrie, who was an active member with People for Pine Crest. When she looked through all the 2023 and 2024 financial statements, she found that Pine Crest had a positive balance upwards of $400,000 in 2023 and a positive balance above $550,000 in 2024. Guthrie said part of this positive balance was due to the state’s Medicaid reimbursement policies.

Lincoln County officials said the sale of Pine Crest would help relieve the county’s deficit, though they did not clarify what expenses were driving that deficit.
“I know not everybody’s happy about it. I understand that all of us, most of us, have people in Pine Crest, and I understand that, but I’m comfortable with Ensign, that they’ll be here and they’re going to serve the community properly,” said County Supervisor Greg Hartwig at a July County Board meeting, according to WXPR.
As the county pushed forward with the sale, many residents felt their voices were ignored. Among them was Scott Doerr, a Lincoln County resident who had worked in local factories for more than 30 years before retiring. Frustrated by the way local officials handled the Pine Crest sale, he filed paperwork to run for County Board Supervisor.
“I just felt that the county board wasn’t listening to the citizens,” Doerr said. “I’m probably going to be campaigning on giving the voice back to the people.”
The sale has raised deeper concerns about the future of the facility.
“Being county-owned was a comfort and now we have to wonder, year to year, if they’re going to sell it for profit and make things worse instead of better.” Doerr said.
That concern about the future of nursing care is shared by others who see the facility as more than just a business, but as a vital community resource.
“People have been paying taxes on [Pine Crest], volunteering at it, supporting it, all those years, with the expectation that it would be around for them when they needed it, or be around for family members when they needed it,” Southcombe said. “The population up here, as it is everywhere, is aging. The elementary schools are shrinking. The need for nursing homes in home care and just general health services is just going to increase. And we’re also going to need people to work at those places.”

For Guthrie, the sale of Pine Crest is not necessarily the end of the fight for better community services.
“The loss was significant, but there is a win in there,” Guthrie said. “All of these people worked together for the good of the community, for the good of the employees and the residents. And maybe that’ll be enough to say, okay, yeah, we lost, but there are other things that we can do, so I’m hoping that there will be more to come.”
As the Save the Portage County Health Care Center group has watched other sales, like those in Lincoln County, happen, they are working to get creative about spreading the word across the county ahead of deciding votes. They have started sharing information in newspaper ads, billboards, and online videos.
“We’ve had to go and reinvent the wheel. We’ve come up with new ways to reach the public. And how does the public react when they know? They are angry,” Ferrante said. “They’re surprised. After voting twice to support the referendums and paying the taxes to have the nursing home continue and be rebuilt, people have been shocked to learn that the current administration in the county is just selling it.”
With the county’s vote looming this week, local community advocates said the stakes feel like a matter of life and death, and they aren’t slowing down.
“Where do we find the energy to fight [for Portage County Health Care Center]? For me, I feel like I owe them,” Ferrante said. “They kind of saved my life.”

(Getty Images)People without health insurance are human, and they still get sick. When they get very sick, they go to emergency rooms, like everyone else. Without Medicaid expansion, the cost of their care falls on the hospitals. 
Doctors make lots of money, so that’s fine, right? Wrong. Most hospitals are nonprofits, and rural hospitals are running on a shoestring budget. It’s no secret that Idaho is experiencing significant health care worker shortages. When funding for health care gets cut, Idaho loses medical professionals. 
 The Medicaid expansion issue

The Idaho Legislature may consider ending Medicaid expansion in 2026, which covers roughly 90,000 people in Idaho. This is despite legislation that was passed as a compromise to ending the program — legislation that hasn’t even taken effect yet. 
When Medicaid expansion started, the Legislature did away with the old way of funding indigent medical care through the county and state programs. If cut, there are no options for Idahoans who lose their coverage. 
If Medicaid expansion ends, it would recreate a coverage gap. Meaning Idahoans that make up to 100% of the federal poverty line ($15,650 for an individual) would not qualify for Medicaid or a tax credit on the state-based exchange that makes health insurance affordable for low-income families. 
Who pays their medical bills when they get sick? The rural hospitals that cannot legally nor morally deny an ill person care. Until that rural hospital is so overwhelmed that it’s forced to close its doors. Ultimately resulting in longer drives to get an emergency room in Idaho’s massive state, that covers 44 counties and stretches across more than 83,000 square miles. 
How far do you want to drive to get to an ER doctor?
 The return on investment

Why else should we keep Medicaid expansion? The return on investment is indisputable. For every $1 of state investment, Idaho receives $9 in federal investment. By keeping Medicaid expansion in place, Idaho sees approximately $1 billion invested into the health care economy. 
In state fiscal year 2025, Medicaid expansion only accounted for 1.6% of general fund expenditures.
Medicaid is also the largest payer for behavioral health services in Idaho with one in three on Medicaid expansion having a mental illness. 
Because of Medicaid expansion, we can receive a 90/10 match from the federal government to cover new moms who qualify for Medicaid during the 12 months postpartum, saving state dollars. Idaho currently covers approximately 30% of births through Medicaid.
 Economic benefits

Let’s talk money. Medicaid expansion has created a massive benefit to our economy.

For every federal dollar invested in Medicaid, Idaho sees an increase in $1.82 in gross economic activity. For fiscal year 2025, that equates to approximately $1.587 billion dollars invested in our economy.
Medicaid expansion produces an additional 9,362 jobs throughout the state.
Over $35 million in general fund revenue and $12 million in property taxes generated annually as a result of expansion.

It’s time we acknowledged the role that Medicaid plays in our health care infrastructure and economy. In no other industry would we consider taking away $1 billion out of our infrastructure that provides this level of economic benefit. 
Report: Federal funds for Idaho Medicaid expansion spurs $1.5 billion in economic output

Repealing Medicaid expansion is a step backward that leaves Idahoans in a worse place than they were in 2018, when Idaho voters initially passed the initiative by a ballot measure with 61% of the vote. 
At least then there were indigent funds available, that while imperfect, helped prevent shifting the cost burden to hospitals and taxpayers’ private insurance company premiums. 
Medicaid expansion is simply something Idaho cannot afford to lose.

BRUCETON MILLS, W.Va. — A fierce gust of wind whips through the trees in Bruceton Mills on a chilly fall morning. Three energetic dogs run through the gravel and fading blades of grass despite the cold weather. The front door to a miniature cabin swings open and out steps James Prutilapac, the owner of more than 40 acres of relatively untouched Preston County natural beauty.
The West Virginian observes his property on the frosty mountain morning of Nov. 5, 2025, and there are no power lines to be seen in the skies. Instead, the occasional bird or falling leaf. That view will change if the proposed route of NextEra’s MARL transmission lines comes to fruition, which may impact Prutilapac’s view, as well as land in four other counties.

“No one I have talked to has been in favor of the project,” Prutilapac said. “There are different levels of antagonism toward [MARL], but I haven’t spoken to any locals who are in support of it.”
NextEra Energy Transmission proposed the MidAtlantic Resiliency Link (MARL) transmission line, a 500-kilovolt entity that would run more than 107 miles from Pennsylvania to Virginia. The primary purpose of the line, according to NextEra’s website, is to “strengthen the power grid, and help power what matters most — our homes, our businesses and our way of life.”
NextEra’s MARL transmission line project has not yet been approved by the state’s public service commission, as of Nov. 17, 2025. A decision on the final route is expected by spring 2027, according to NextEra.


Prutilapac is one of more than a thousand members of the Facebook group “WATI — West Virginians Against Transmission Line Injustice,” a grassroots organization fighting against the addition of transmission lines such as MARL. The organization is based in Fort Ashby, a town roughly an hour east of Bruceton Mills.
The sentiment remains relatively the same among the group despite the miles and mountains between its members: The proposed lines would benefit surrounding states, but not the state most impacted by their presence.
“It’s a project going from a power station in Pennsylvania to feed data centers in Northern Virginia,” Prutilapac said of the proposed MARL project. “It’s not as though it’s a project that they’re adding the lines because there are underserved communities 10 minutes down the road.”
WATI Secretary Sara Evans shared a similar sentiment.
“Electricity is nice, but I don’t want [transmission lines] destroying the view and the memories just to give electricity through to someplace else,” Evans said.
The addition of transmission lines is partly due to the rapidly growing need for more power in the age of artificial intelligence and increased data use.
“We have a lot of demand growth in the region and across the country,” said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies. “Power demand was flat for 25 years, and now, suddenly, it’s like 3% per year, which is a lot in terms of the gigawatts of power that we need to add.”
Internet use among adults steadily increased between 2000 and 2024, rising from 52% to 96% during that period, according to a study conducted by the Pew Research Center. That statistic combined with the rise of AI shows how much power is needed to fuel the country’s demand.
Prutilapac is more focused on conserving the wildlife and nature on his land as well as the quiet life it provides him and less on the frenetic pace of power growth.
“Environmentally, the [proposed transmission line] is going to be taking out a lot of trees, which I don’t want to see that happen,” Prutilapac said. “There’s a lot of wildlife up here. We regularly have black bear, red and grey fox, fisher, coyote, and then obviously deer, raccoon, opossum, things that are everywhere in West Virginia.”
The transmission company has land agents in contact with potentially impacted residents to sign easements as the process moves forward. These transmission routes are not set in stone and according to Rob Gramlich, they often deal with rerouted plans.
“Reroutes are a normal part of a transmission line’s life and there are a lot of factors,” said Gramlich, the president of Grid Strategies. “Looking at land issues and river and creek crossings, and how many people are going to actually see [lines] and what the communities actually think, so it is a normal part of the [routing] process.”
WVU engineering professor and energy expert Professor Anurag Srivastava said routes that directly impact people are only approved when there is a great need.
“If [the transmission route] is going through a part of the town, or especially if it will impact the people that are living there, well I guess in most cases, then it does not happen,” Srivastava said. “Unless the benefit is a lot, then they have to compensate people to move from that land to other land, and so it will cost the transmission line builder more money.”
The proposed MARL plan, if successful, would require compensation to residents like Prutilapac due to the invasive nature of the route. Agents have already made offers, according to the Bruceton Mills landowner.

“We’ve had a guy from NextEra that has contacted us, and he’s kind of been in regular contact; he’s obviously trying to get us to sign contracts and whatnot, but no one has contacted us from any state agency or anything,” Prutilapac said.
Those opposed to the transmission line say the fight will continue despite potential monetary compensation.

(Photo: Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent.) A new state audit has identified flaws in the way the Department of Human Services investigates complaints against child care centers in Tennessee, potentially placing children at risk.
The department investigates approximately 6,000 allegations of child abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation made each year against legally and illegally operating childcare providers across the state.
The Tennessee Comptroller found some of these investigations lacked required documentation, including proof inspectors had visited the childcare center, incomplete “action plans” holding child care operators responsible for improvements and misclassified forms.
Some investigations into allegations of misconduct inside childcare centers weren’t initiated or concluded in the legally required timeframe, the audit found. 
One complaint against an illegal child care operator lacked a temporary restraining order to shut it down that was “essential when conditions present an immediate threat to children’s health or safety,” the audit found.

“Without stronger oversight and accountability measures, the department cannot fully assure the public that it consistently protects children in Tennessee’s childcare system,” the audit said.
Commissioner Clarence Carter acknowledged the ongoing problems with child care center investigations to lawmakers last week. 
Carter pledged to “strengthen our processes to ensure our investigation process is timely and properly documented at DHS.” 
“We are committed to promoting early childhood environments that are safe, healthy and developmentally rich and appropriate,” he told lawmakers sitting on a legislative subcommittee reviewing the audit on Dec. 16. 
The department has also provided more training to staff and updated its child care licensing technology systems, he said. 
The audit did not note any child had been directly harmed as a result of the investigation lapses it identified.
The Department of Human Services oversees approximately 2,000 licensed agencies that serve 200,000 children statewide. It also oversees 354 childcare centers that aren’t required to get a license because they serve fewer than five unrelated children. 
The audit reviewed the department’s operations between  2021 and 2025. Failures to properly investigate child care center complaints were also identified in a prior audit.

(Photo provided, Santos Port Authority)From the docks of the Port of Santos, a 58-terminal complex covering an area the size of 1,500 American football fields, ships loaded with soybeans prepare to set sail for China. 
Less than 45 miles from São Paulo, the port services nearly a quarter of Brazil’s soybean exports. For decades, U.S. agribusiness giants like Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill have operated facilities at the port. 
Today, they share space with COFCO International, China’s state-owned food conglomerate, which has invested around $285 million in recent years. The expansion will make it the port’s largest dry bulk terminal.

And Santos isn’t alone. In the west, the Port of Chancay is rising on Peru’s central coast.
COSCO Shipping, a state-owned Chinese company, is investing at least $3.5 billion to construct 15 berths, logistics facilities, and a 1.1-mile tunnel, enabling cargo to be channelled directly from the port to nearby highways.
Once fully operational, Chancay will function as a regional redistribution hub for exports from Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador and Colombia: from copper and lithium to soybeans and other agricultural products. Upon completion around 2035, it is expected to become the region’s third-largest port.
These and other recent investments across the region have positioned China to source more agricultural products from Latin America as it pivots away from U.S. farmers in response to President Trump’s higher tariffs. 
China first began that pivot in 2018, when Trump’s first-term tariff hikes ignited a global trade war. But since returning to office, the president has renewed that strategy, and China’s investments signal a generational shift that may not reverse if and when the trade war subsides. 
“What are the signs that China’s here to stay [in Latin America]? Really, the infrastructure,” said Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow with the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a U.S. nonprofit policy research organization that reports 23 ports across Latin America have some degree of Chinese investment.  
“Ports, railways, roads, bridges, metro lines, energy, power plants are probably the best signs that China has a long-term commitment … These are long-term projects.”
Daniel Munch, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation, said that when a country gains control over ports that make trade faster, cheaper and more reliable, such as the Port of Chancay, trade flows tend to “lock in.” Reversing that trend, he warned, would require the United States to narrow its efficiency gap, noting that none of its container ports rank among the world’s top 50.
“It could entrench patterns,” Munch said.
This is bad news for American farmers, particularly soybean growers. 
Soybeans are a cornerstone of American agriculture, particularly in the Midwest. Nationwide, more than 270,000 farms grow the crop, according to the latest Census of Agriculture. In Illinois, nearly half of all farms depend on soybean production, and in Iowa and Minnesota, about four in 10 do.

In 2024, more than 40% of U.S. soybean production was exported, with about half going to China.
But tensions between the United States and China have risen this year – Trump has increased tariffs and recently threatened a 157% tax on all Chinese imports, while China responded by reducing U.S. soybean imports to near zero for six months. 
A trade deal announced in November ends the suspension and includes commitments for China to buy 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans in the final two months of 2025 and at least 25 million metric tons annually through 2028, according to Purdue University and farmdoc Daily. 
Brazil has stepped in as China’s biggest supplier of soybeans, which are used to feed livestock to support protein demand. 
China has become one of the two main export markets for at least 10 nations, most of them in South America, according to the International Trade Outlook for Latin America and the Caribbean 2023 report by the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC).
From 2010 to 2022, the region accounted for nearly one-third of China’s food imports. Brazil alone supplied about 21% of those imports over the same period.

“In recent years, there has been significant growth in telecommunications projects and across all areas of transportation – including airports, ports, roads, railways, and subways – as well as in sanitation and urban mobility. These sectors account for nearly 60% of the total number of projects,” said José Manuel Salazar-Xirinachs, executive secretary of ECLAC, who highlighted the scale of China’s involvement during the 2024 International Seminar on Contemporary China Studies in Costa Rica.
China has viewed Brazil as a strategic partner for several years, primarily because of its soybean supply, and has responded with infrastructure investments, according to Fernando Bastiani, a researcher with ESALQ-LOG, the Group of Research and Extension in Agroindustrial Logistics at the University of São Paulo.
“Today, COFCO has direct access to farmers, purchases soybeans, and oversees the entire commercialization chain, including storage and transport to China,” Bastiani said. “In recent years, [COFCO] has also realized it needs to control logistics systems and infrastructure, because that’s a key part.”
In Brazil, Bastiani explained, logistics costs account for 20% to 25% of the final soybean price, mainly due to the long distances between farms and ports and the high cost of trucking. “China understood that by investing in infrastructure, it could help make Brazil more competitive,” he said.
In May, the two countries signed new agreements to deepen their agricultural trade ties, granting Brazil authorization to export meat and ethanol byproducts. 
“Amid the changing and turbulent international landscape, China and Brazil should remain committed to the original aspiration of contributing to human progress and global development,” said President Xi Jinping during the meeting.
China’s pullback squeezes U.S. port volumes  
While Latin America has seen growth, many U.S. ports have experienced a significant decline in business.
At the New Orleans District — a dominant grain corridor — soybean exports grew by less than 3% between September 2024 and September 2025, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Shipments through the Los Angeles District fell almost 15%, while the steepest drop came in the Seattle District, where exports plunged 81%.
Nearly half of all U.S. corn, soybean and wheat exports move through the Mississippi River system, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation’s Market Intel report.

This major inland trade artery connects the Midwest’s farming regions to the Gulf of Mexico, carrying an average of 65 million metric tons annually of bulk agricultural products by barge over the past five years to export terminals near New Orleans, where shipments depart for international markets.
“The facilities that purchase soybeans from farmers extend to our freight railroads, where they don’t have as much volume that they’ve been moving, at least for soybeans,” said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition. 
Steenhoek noted that corn exports have remained strong, which has helped sustain some port activity — but it hasn’t solved the underlying problem: “China imports more U.S. soybeans than all of our other international customers combined,” he said.
At the Port of Los Angeles, the largest container port in the Western Hemisphere, agricultural exports have also weakened as trade with China cools.
“Exports in general have been very soft and we attributed it to the retaliatory tariffs that have been put in place by China,” said Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles. “Our single biggest export sector is agriculture … of that, soybeans are the number one export commodity.”
Before the first tariffs were introduced in 2018, China accounted for about 60% of the port’s business. Today, it’s closer to 40% and falling, as trade flows and sourcing shift toward countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand. 
“We’ve been very aggressive in finding cargo out of other countries,” Seroka said. “But there is no doubt in my mind that we are concerned every day that these policies could impact the amount of cargo that comes to Los Angeles.”
The decrease in exports is not just a hit to farmers, but also to port workers; each four containers handled at the port generates one job, according to Seroka.
“In Southern California, one in nine people has a job related to this port,” said Seroka, referring to dockworkers, truck drivers, brokers and warehouse employees. “It truly is a conversation of national significance.”
U.S. port traffic isn’t poised for a quick rebound despite a recent trade agreement that ends China’s suspension of U.S. soybean imports. After six months of near-zero shipments due to retaliatory trade measures, Beijing in November agreed to purchase 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans in the final two months of 2025 and to commit to annual purchases of at least 25 million tons through 2028.

A recent analysis from Purdue University’s Center for Commercial Agriculture and farmdoc Daily said the announcement offered some relief to U.S. farmers at the tail end of harvest, but overall exports to China this year are still on track to be the weakest since 2018, when trade tensions during the first Trump administration slashed volumes to 8 million tons.
“It is very difficult to take a market [China] of over a billion people and replace that,” said John Bartman, a soybean farmer from Marengo, Illinois.
By October, Brazil had exported a record 79 million metric tons of soybeans to China, nearly 80% of its total soybean shipments during the period, according to a farmdoc Daily analysis of data from Brazil’s Foreign Trade Secretariat. Brazil’s total soybean exports reached about 100 million tons between January and October, already surpassing the country’s full-year total for 2024, which was just under 99 million tons.
“U.S. soybean farmers are standing at a trade and financial precipice,” Caleb Ragland, president of the American Soybean Association, wrote in a statement. 
US trade strategy remains unsettled as China moves ahead
While China builds long-term infrastructure to secure its supply chains, Washington is still struggling to define its trade strategy and to contain the political fallout of renewed tariffs.
In mid-September, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives moved to block Congress from influencing Trump’s tariff policy, even as Senate Democrats prepared to force votes challenging his trade war, The New York Times reported. The maneuver effectively stripped lawmakers of the ability to advance measures to lift tariffs until March 31, 2026, extending a prohibition first imposed in the spring to spare members from taking a politically difficult vote.
“Tariffs not only cause farmers to pay more for their inputs, but they have also seen tariffs reduce markets for U.S. farm products,” said U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, during an October session.

If the November soybean agreement between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping holds, Beijing’s purchases would still fall short of recent norms. Even if China buys at least 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually over the next three years, that volume would remain about 14% below the five-year average shipped to China from 2020 to 2024, according to an analysis from Purdue University’s Center for Commercial Agriculture and farmdoc daily.
Some purchases have started rolling in. But April Hemmes, an Iowa soybean farmer who has promoted increased trade with China, said the agreement would be difficult to fulfill, noting that delivering 12 million metric tons of soybeans by early next year is “not very realistic.”  
As China establishes new trade routes across Latin America, every new port or shipping lane makes a future recovery for U.S. farmers more challenging.
Despite the tensions, Hemmes still views China as an essential market. 
“I don’t think our relationship with China has been damaged,” the Iowa soybean farmer said. “China is a low-cost buyer and will need soybeans from the U.S. for a long time. But we will never be their number one source.”
For her, the changing politics and policies have made the United States an “unreliable trading partner.”
“The only way that we become their top choice would be if our soybeans were far cheaper than South America’s.”

Tennessee House Republican leaders will push forward a plan in 2026 to install a Memphis-Shelby County schools oversight panel that would seize significant decision-making authority from the locally elected school board.
House Speaker Cameron Sexton and education committee Chairman Mark White confirmed this month they are committed to working with the Senate to pass a form of takeover legislation in the 2026 legislative session.
Republicans in the two chambers failed to find a compromise after passing differing versions of the bill earlier this year amid ongoing frustrations with school board governance and academic performance issues. If lawmakers can agree this year, change could come quickly to Memphis-Shelby County schools, which is already primed for major upheaval in 2026.
White’s plan would essentially install a governing oversight board with the authority to veto part or all of the local school board’s budget, the largest single decision the school board is responsible for.
White argued the oversight board must have the “teeth” to make significant district decisions, compared to the 2025 Senate version of the plan that would operate as an advisory board.










I don’t believe an elected school board can fix decades of bureaucracy.


– Rep. Mark White, R-Memphis


The oversight board under White’s plan would also have approval authority for any contracts or expenses larger than $50,000 and essentially control final charter decisions in the district. White’s proposal would institute the board for three years, with the potential for another three-year extension.
“Putting a board in place that has no authority to do anything is a waste of time,” Sexton said. “It does nothing. If you’re going to put it in, then you’ve got to trust them to make the decisions.”
Sen. Brent Taylor, a Memphis Republican carrying the Senate version of the bill, did not respond to a request for comment.
The Senate and House passed differing versions of the legislation in 2025, with the two chambers at odds over details of oversight board authority.
If Senate and House leaders can come to a compromise on the legislation when the General Assembly reconvenes in mid-January, it could quickly be passed into law. Because the bills are still live, the chambers could hash out any changes in conference without reverting back to a lengthy legislative committee process.
Potential oversight changes would be one of several significant changes on the horizon for Memphis schools.
The early 2025 firing of former Superintendent Marie Feagins ignited long-simmering dissatisfaction with the school board and triggered both local and state backlash. Now, all nine seats on the board are up for election in 2026, meaning Memphis voters may go to the primary ballot box this spring to vote for a board whose governing power could soon be greatly diminished under the legislative plan.
The board must also make a decision on the interim superintendent’s contract sometime in 2026.
White said he will move “full speed ahead” to enact “drastic” changes.
“I don’t believe an elected school board can fix decades of bureaucracy. I’m not putting blame on any past or present school board,” White said.
Legislative Democrats and Memphis-Shelby County school leaders have sharply criticized the takeover effort as political overreach, pointing to previous state takeover failures in the Achievement School District and incremental progress the district has made recently.
“State intervention in Memphis schools has historically failed to improve outcomes,” Memphis-Shelby County schools interim Superintendent Roderick Richmond said during a fall community meeting.
Launched a decade ago, the Achievement School District took control of low-performing schools and often turned them over to the charter operators. But the state intervention model led to no meaningful long-term improvements for students, research showed, and often sparked community backlash for takeovers in low-income neighborhoods.
Memphis schools have had some growth in recent years. This year, MSCS students outpaced the state average for academic growth in reading and math. More Memphis schools also earned top marks in Tennessee’s report card system for the 2024-2025 school year.
Tennessee lawmakers file Memphis Shelby Schools “hostile takeover” at last minute

Yet the district continues to lag significantly in academic achievement, with less than 25% of MSCS students meeting grade level benchmarks in reading and math on state tests.
Sexton suggested any improvement is too little, too late after decades of underperformance in the state’s largest school district.
Republicans are also eyeing an ongoing state financial audit of the district, though both Sexton and White said the takeover legislation would move ahead regardless of those findings.
White has denied that the legislation amounts to a state takeover, given that members of the governing board must be residents of Shelby County. White says he, along with other Memphis natives, believe “we have to have local intervention.”
But under White’s 2025 bill, the appointing power for the oversight board would sit in state government and, by extension, give the Republican Party governing authority of local schools in a majority Democratic county.
Under the House bill, the Tennessee governor would appoint five members, and the House and Senate speakers would receive two appointments each.
Critics of the legislation have also warned the measure could have ripple effects beyond Memphis and encroach on local control in other areas of the state, though the legislation currently only applies to Shelby County. White’s 2025 legislation could trigger an oversight board in a local district if:

50% or more of enrolled students did not meet state testing grade level expectations.
30% or more of schools in a district receive a D or F state letter grade.
25% or more of students enrolled were chronically absent in the most recent school year.
One or more schools have been identified as a priority school by the state education department.
And the local legislative body of the county approves a resolution of no confidence in the local school board.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Attorneys at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin are pushing for the release of Jaciel Cirrus Rojas, who has been held in immigration detention since June. Rojas, a Mexican-born man who has lived in the U.S. since 2018, has no criminal record, Urban Milwaukee reported, and was arrested by immigration officers despite not being the target of their operation. 
An immigration judge ordered  Cirrus Rojas  released on  bond in July. But the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appealed his release and Cirrus Rojas remains in the Dodge County Jail. 
The judge’s order was vacated by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), followed by the denial of a federal court petition challenging the legality of Cirrus Rojas’ detention. Cirrus Rojas has had no contact with his wife and infant daughter for the 200 days during  which he has been detained. 
ACLU attorneys working for his release, say  Cirrus Rojas has a pending asylum claim and is  at risk of being tortured if deported to his home country. The hearing for Cirrus Rojas’ asylum claim has been rescheduled. Earlier this month, ACLU attorney Jennifer Bizzotto filed an emergency motion in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals pushing to overturn previous denials to release Rojas. 
“We have seen hundreds of cases nationwide in which federal judges have ruled that [immigration enforcement] cannot hold people in Cirrus Rojas’ position without bond hearings, and that has not deterred [immigration enforcement] from continuing to lock up people while flagrantly violating the law,” ACLU staff attorney Hannah Schwarz said in a statement.

An ever larger portion of ICE arrests involve people like Cirrus Rojas  who have no   criminal record

This year, with some help from anonymous elves, we start in Frankfort and move on to Washington.
Gov. Andy Beshear: Two weeks in California, to better understand Gov. Gavin Newsom, perhaps his leading rival for Democrats’ 2028 presidential nomination. I always thought a smart-ass such as Newsom couldn’t be elected president, but Donald Trump has lowered the bar for presidential behavior.
Secretary of State Michael Adams: In rejecting Justice Department demands for private data on Kentucky voters, the Republican qualified for a JFK Profile in Courage Award, but he got that one for real last year, so he gets a knock-off of the Heisman Trophy for giving Trumpers a stiff arm.
Former attorney general Daniel Cameron, U.S. Senate candidate: A copy of “Fundraising for Dummies.” Cameron’s no dummy, and has led in polls, but has had trouble raising money.
Businessman Nate Morris: A Trump Casino Hotel bag, to signify baggage that he (or any winner of the Republican Senate primary) may carry if the president keeps spiraling downward in so many ways.
U.S. Rep. Andy Barr of the 6th District, the primary’s betting favorite: A bottle of Canadian whiskey, which seems to have overtaken bourbon as Canadians’ drink of choice due to Trump’s tariffs, which Barr supported “100%” in April.
Fifth District Rep. Hal Rogers, who is running for a 24th term, will turn 88 Dec. 31, and votes pretty much the way his Trumpy district wants though he’s long been in the Chowder and Marching Club of Republican traditionalists: A framed photo of the late Sen. John Sherman Cooper, his fellow Somerset townsman, to remind him of his roots.
Fourth District Rep. Thomas Massie: A good-luck charm in his primary race with Trump-endorsed Ed Gallrein of Shelbyville. Massie gives voters of all stripes plenty to disagree with, but is perhaps the greatest example of independence from the executive branch that we need in Congress to maintain our democratic republic. His libertarian soulmate, Sen. Rand Paul, has done much of that, too.
Third District Rep. Morgan McGarvey: A holiday gift basket to pass along to his former colleagues in the state legislature, who seem to have resisted pressure from the Trump White House to carve up the Louisville district of the only Democrat in the state’s congressional delegation, like Tennessee gerrymandered Nashville.
Second District Rep. Brett Guthrie: A model of a Ford F-150 Lightning, which the company will stop making as it cuts its losses on electric vehicles and its huge new battery plant in Guthrie’s district. Beshear, looking to shift blame for a bad bet, pointed at Guthrie and Trump, citing Guthrie’s vote for the Trump bill that passed the House by one vote and cut EV subsidies. Guthrie replied, “Mandating everybody buy an electric car is not what the American people want.” That was a mandate in Europe, not the U.S.; Joe Biden did allow such a mandate in California, which has great market influence.
First District Rep. James Comer: An Autopen signature machine, like the one he accused the Biden White House of misusing, so he can get more familiar with the device as he aims toward his 2027 goal of becoming governor — an office in which the Autopen is frequently used.
Sen. Mitch McConnell: As he and wife Elaine Chao contemplate retirement, a cannabis sativa plant to practice the horticulture needed to keep it under 0.3 percent THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. That’s the limit set for hemp products by his 2018 legislation, which opened a loophole for producers of concentrated cannabinoid products — which McConnell and others closed recently, while delaying the change for a year to allow the issue to be fully lobbied and negotiated.
All members of Kentucky’s delegation: A district-by-district, county-by-county list of the numbers of Kentuckians (more than 100,000 overall) who have used extra Biden-era premium subsidies to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and the impact of their expiration. Comer, whose district would be hit hardest, has said the subsidies should be extended a year or two, but Guthrie, chairman of the House committee that handles health care, has been quiet.

(Photo by Gary Cifers/Getty Images)It’s late afternoon, the last workday before Christmas break at the headquarters of Virginia’s Alcoholic Beverage Commission. Its chairman and head honcho, Tim Hugo, is tidying up his office and about to grab his coat and head home when the intercom on his desk phone buzzes.
“Mr. Hugo, a Mr. Schneiderman from Dewey, Screwum & Howe on line two for you,” says a woman’s voice with a sweet Southside lilt.
Not the start to the holiday season the chairman hoped for. There were parties to attend. Celebrations to be had. The boss was ready to start a jolly, relaxing winter respite. This call from a notorious litigation firm could not bring good tidings of great joy. It would be a total buzzkill after a buoyant month for Virginia’s state-run distilled spirits monopoly.
A couple of days after Thanksgiving, a masked bandit had broken into the ABC’s Ashland store one night and ransacked it, treating himself to a legendary bender before passing out next to the store’s commode from the booze he had plundered. Because the burglar was a cuddly, furry raccoon, pictures and videos of the crime and its adorable perpetrator went viral online and generated global press coverage, giving the ABC an unprecedented marketing bonanza that money couldn’t buy.
Or could it?
“Can this wait?” Hugo asked the receptionist.
“He says it’s a pressing matter concerning the misappropriation of someone’s likeness, Tim.”
Hugo sighs and rolls his eyes. Lawyers, am I right? He lifted the receiver and pressed the blinking button for line two.
“Season’s greetings, Mr. Hugo, and here’s wishing us all a prosperous new year,” Schneiderman said.
“Us?” Hugo said.
“Sure. You. Me. The ABC. The state treasury. And, as of a couple of hours ago, my client — Mr. Rupert D. Raccoon, whose name, image and likeness you and/or your designees, among others, have gratuitously exploited for crass commercial gain without Mr. Raccoon’s knowledge or consent,” Schneiderman sneered. “And then, he’s given this defamatory nickname: ‘Trashed Panda!’ Do you know how offensive it is to raccoons to be called pandas?”
Hugo muttered something unprintable under his breath. How, he wondered, had something so perfect turned so rancid so fast? There would be no merry neighborhood wassailing this frosty night.
In a hollow tree in a wooded buffer abutting an affluent residential subdivision in the Richmond suburb of Hanover County, Rupert D. Raccoon was regaling a gaze of his closest masked, ring-tailed friends and kin with tales of his late Ashland adventure.
“Y’all brag about your legendary college parties, but answer me this: How many of you broke into a liquor store — Mission Impossible-style! — drank half its inventory and passed out on the concrete floor inches from the commode?” Rupert said.
It was no rhetorical question. Rupert was serious. Newly enrolled in a 12-step program, yes, but darn serious! They looked at him, spellbound and wide-eyed.
“So, you dropped in from the ceiling, then what? — just started chugging bottles of Patron tequila? Glenlivet scotch? Blanton’s bourbon?” asked Oscar, Rupert’s first cousin.
“Nah. That’s top-shelf stuff. Not that I didn’t try. In my advanced inebriation, the only bottles I could knock over, break and slurp off the floor were lower-shelf brands — rail liquor at a bar,” Rupert said. “Couldn’t beat the price, though.”
That evoked a round of snickers and titters.
“How’d you like the drunk tank, rookie?” scoffed Karla, a tattooed, hard-partying sow who called herself “the Godzilla of Tequila Shots.” All the boars knew better than to challenge her.
“I woke up behind bars starving, my head’s pounding, and everybody in there was howling or barking super loud,” Rupert said. “One of my captors sees me looking like death warmed over, snatches me up and stuffs me in a county truck. I’m begging him for a chalupa and Diet Coke from the Taco Bell drive-thru, but no! A few miles later, he pulls over, turns me loose on the side of the road and warns me to stay out of Ashland.”
Felix, one of the more youthful and inquisitive of Rupert’s crew, had scaled a five-foot wooden privacy fence and nestled himself on one of the support posts to see what was playing on the 75-inch flat screen that covered most of one wall in some suburban family’s Florida room. It was tuned to “Inside Edition,” and what Felix saw stunned him.
“Rupe!” Felix yelled over his shoulder. “You’re gonna wanna see this.”
Rupert joined Felix on the fence line in time to glimpse a photo of himself passed out belly-down on a restroom floor between a toilet and a waste can, his four legs splayed helplessly in varied directions. Grainy, monochrome security camera footage showed Rupert reeling and lurching, hither and yon, after hours in the ABC store amid $250 or more worth of spilled hootch from shattered bottles. 
Then the image shifted to a winsome AI rendering of Rupert’s face hawking various ABC liquor deals and cocktail recipes. They were selling T-shirts and other swag bearing his caricature. The chyron in the screen’s bottom third read “‘Trashed Panda’ Nets $180K for Va. Animal Shelter.”
“What the (censored)?” Rupert said. “Where’s my cut?”

Harvey Schneiderman had been browbeating and trying to intimidate Hugo for nearly 30 minutes. He told Hugo that his client, Rupert, had rights! He would not be involuntarily used as some monopoly agency’s unpaid marketing pitchcritter!
“He’s a freakin’ raccoon, Harvey! A small, carnivorous, largely nocturnal creature of the wild!” Chairman Hugo said, his patience wearing thin.
“Yeah and just a few years ago, colleges and the NCAA told ballplayers they had no right to share in the hundreds of millions of bucks EA Sports and Nintendo raked in from depicting those players in video games, right down to their jersey numbers and tattoos, until a unanimous Supreme Court saw it differently,” Schneiderman countered.
“You can’t plausibly compare a wild animal to Heisman Trophy candidates,” Hugo protested, his face reddening.
“Let’s see what a jury says,” Schneiderman shot back. “Mr. Raccoon may be a small woodland dweller who feeds largely on frogs, freshwater crustaceans, the occasional discarded chalupa or whatever he can scavenge from trash cans, but look at that sweet little face splashed all over your merch and advertising. It’s a face a jury would love, Mr. Hugo. Maybe a face worth six or even seven figures if we go to court.”
“OK, Harvey,” an exasperated Chairman Hugo said. “Fax me your settlement offer. We’ll be in touch early next year.”
“No, you’ll be in touch now or we file tomorrow because I know that after January 17th, the Republican governor who appointed you leaves office, a Democrat takes over, and … well, I don’t have to tell you about political spoils,” Schneiderman said.
Hugo tried to speak calmly through his clenched teeth. “OK, your client gets a handle of Ancient Age whiskey a month and free chalupas for life — our best and final.”
“Toss in a subscription to Animal Planet and we’ve got a deal,” the wily litigator said.
Hugo grunted his grudging assent and hung up. Lawyers! Bah! Humbug!

Whitney Downard came to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star from our sister outlet in Indiana, starting the day before the November election. 
I thought with only two months of Whitney’s work to choose from, picking a favorite would be simple. That’s not the case, but I settled on this great article about an Allegheny County couple, Jaime and Carrie Wright, who are already juggling copays and debt to pay for Jaime’s cancer treatment regimen.
Juggling will turn into struggling next year when the Wrights’ health insurance premium increases by 265% as a result of Congress not renewing Affordable Care Act tax credits that reduce the cost of health insurance purchased through the state exchange, Pennie.
The Wrights’ story is one that shows how political and policy decisions at the highest levels of government affect people that we as journalists strive to tell. In this case, the Washington, D.C., lawmakers’ decision not to extend the tax credits will upend the personal finances of 500,000 people across the commonwealth who rely on Pennie to afford health insurance.

Emily Previti also joined the Capital-Star this year, bringing years of experience as a journalist for print and public media organizations.
In this article, Emily examines the state of the decades-long effort by Pennsylvania advocates and lawmakers to establish a system to compensate people who have been released from prison after being wrongfully convicted of a crime. 
While many states have a mechanism to provide monetary compensation for lost years behind bars, Pennsylvania does not. But the proposal introduced this year contains a phrase that could present an insurmountable legal barrier for those entitled to compensation.
While a conviction can be reversed on the basis of new evidence that creates reasonable doubt about a person’s culpability for a crime, the compensation bill now under consideration requires proof of actual innocence, which would put redress beyond the reach of many exonerees.
This is an issue that I’ve covered in the past and Emily’s story shows that more work needs to be done by lawmakers’ to reach a workable solution.

Pennsylvania’s wrongful conviction bill could leave many behind


Ian Karbal wrote about a $5 million Easter egg in the state budget for William Penn School District in Delaware County, which is represented in the state House by Democratic Speaker Joanna McClinton.
By asking questions, Ian revealed that the extra money was a result of direct advocacy by members of the school board. 
William Penn was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against the state that led to the historic court ruling that Pennsylvania’s reliance on real estate tax to fund schools unconstitutionally deprives students in the least wealthy districts of educational opportunities.
The district was among those forced to borrow money to sustain operations as a result of this year’s five-month budget impasse. 
It was also reeling from the discovery of a $9.2 million bookkeeping error that forced district officials to consider cutting staff, including administrators and academic interventionists who work one-on-one with struggling students.
The story shows how the budget process sometimes comes down to asking the right person for money and that the state’s least funded school districts are still fighting to stabilize their finances two years after winning a judgment against the commonwealth.

(Photo by Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)The conservation group Wild Virginia has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, alleging the agency failed to protect Virginia’s rivers and streams from PFAS, commonly known as “forever chemicals.”
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are harmful chemicals linked to manufacturing runoff, fire fighting materials, and everyday consumer products such as water resistant clothing and nonstick cookware. Exposure to PFAS has been associated with serious health risks, including cancer and reduced fertility in women.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Eastern District Court of Virginia, challenges the EPA’s approval of the state’s 2024 water quality report. Wild Virginia argues that the federal agency should have intervened after concluding that Virginia did not do enough to address contaminated waterways. State data shows that several rivers and streams are polluted with PFAS, including the Middle Chickahominy River, which has been under PFAS investigation since 2021. 
The EPA has kept National Primary Drinking Water Regulations in place for several PFAS chemicals, establishing limits for what is considered safe in drinking water. However, there are thousands of different PFAS compounds, and regulations often lag behind emerging contamination, leaving many chemicals unregulated. 
The complaint points to six years of PFAS data collected by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality that identified multiple streams with elevated levels of the chemicals. Despite those findings, the lawsuit alleges, some waterways were not classified as “impaired” in the state’s water quality report. 
In one case, PFAS levels were so high in the Chichahominy River and White Oak Swamp that DEQ issued a fish tissue consumption advisory in May 2025. The lawsuit claims that despite those warnings, the waters were not listed as impaired in the final report submitted to the EPA.
“There are many other waters around the state where they have data showing PFAS contamination in the surface waters themselves,” said David Sligh, the water quality program director for Wild Virginia. “They mentioned PFAs in their report, they really didn’t do any analysis as to what that means or how those are related to their own water quality standards.”
The EPA finalized its rule on PFAS exposure in drinking water in April 2024.
In its report, the Virginia DEQ wrote: “In December 2024, EPA published draft recommended water quality criteria protective of human health for PFOA, PFOS, and PFBS. These criteria are designed specifically to protect public water supplies and fish consumption and reflect a lifetime exposure duration of 70 years. These criteria will not be considered for adoption in Virginia’s water quality standards regulation until they are finalized by EPA. Once effective they would be used to assess waters in subsequent integrated reports.”
Sligh said that the EPA was “required to acknowledge, assess and designate waters that are impaired if their narrative water quality criteria are violated, those criteria say if there are pollutants that are causing toxic or harmful conditions for humans or wildlife, then they’re supposed to count those as standards violations. And so that hasn’t changed, and they didn’t need to wait on anything from the EPA.” 
The EPA approved Virginia’s water quality report in July 2025. According to Wild Virginia, the agency acknowledged the state’s PFAS contamination but declined to take enforcement action. 
The group argues in its lawsuit that the decision will delay required pollution controls while residents of the commonwealth will continue to be exposed to the chemicals. 
The complaint further alleges that the EPA’s inaction violates the federal Clean Water Act. The lawsuit seeks a court order requiring the agency to identify the PFAS-impaired waters so that pollution reduction plans can be developed and implemented.
In 2024, the Virginia General Assembly passed a law intended to create a statewide plan to  address elevated PFAS levels in waterways and identify pollution sources through self reporting requirements.

For years, a team of experts has traveled from tiny town to tiny town in New Hampshire, helping the communities plan and execute clean energy strategies. Now the idea has secured federal funding to expand nationwide — a notable win as the Trump administration claws back billions of dollars for decarbonization policy.






The $3 million in funding was included in the fiscal 2026 agriculture spending package that President Donald Trump signed into law last month as part of the bill that reopened the government after the shutdown this fall. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from the Granite State, led the push for the pilots, which could help municipalities not only cut greenhouse gas emissions but save money as energy costs rise nationwide.


“It’s very exciting to us that Sen. Shaheen saw what we were doing and saw the potential,” said Sarah Brock, director of the New Hampshire program, dubbed Energy Circuit Rider. ​“It would be amazing to have versions of this program scattered across the country to help communities understand and find solutions to whatever their energy challenges are.”


Shaheen’s office hopes to get the program — which will be administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Utilities Service — up and running within the next year. Because it is a pilot, it does not have to go through the same extensive regulatory processes as other programs, which should allow a relatively timely implementation, a Senate aide said.


Shaheen originally proposed a national version of the program with an annual budget of $25 million in standalone legislation in 2023, and again in June 2025, before pushing to include the smaller pilot in November’s spending bill.


“The commonsense energy circuit riders pilot is an important and effective way for communities to get the tools they need to take on clean energy and energy efficiency projects that lower costs,” Shaheen said in a statement to Canary Media.


The seeds of New Hampshire’s program were planted roughly a decade ago, as towns and cities across the state formed energy committees tasked with lowering power bills and emissions, Brock said. Clean energy advocates began talking about how to support these groups, which were made up of volunteers with widely varying levels of expertise, and which often served small towns without the resources to hire staff focused on energy issues.


The conversation turned to the idea of hiring a ​“circuit rider,” a position modeled on the traveling preachers, judges, and doctors of centuries past, who provided their services to communities along their route. In 2018, the Neil and Louise Tillotson Fund, a foundation that supports causes in New Hampshire’s rural north, funded a position for a full-time clean energy expert who would provide knowledge and support to any town in the region at no cost. Nonprofit Clean Energy New Hampshire agreed to host the new hire.







The first energy circuit rider, Melissa Elander, had a mission statement but no real guidance on how to do her new job. She spent her first year introducing herself to towns throughout the region, offering her services as a researcher, consultant, and grant writer, and she slowly began to rack up some wins, Brock said. The first initiative she supported was an energy-efficient lighting project for the town of Whitefield, population 2,500.














“As word of those successes spread, more and more communities were interested,” Brock said. ​“It was clear to us there was something here.”


Today, the program has six energy circuit riders on staff, including Elander. It has expanded to cover all of the state’s 234 municipalities — 138 of which the program has provided support for — as well as small businesses. The team has helped towns navigate a wide range of projects, including weatherization of public buildings, solar installations, and planning for fleet electrification. Clean Energy New Hampshire does not have complete data, but estimates that just 41% of completed projects have yielded $4.26 million in total savings for municipalities.


The program was vital to the successful completion of an all-electric, solar-powered library in the community of Barrington, said Cynthia Hoisington, chair of the town’s energy committee. The municipality worked with an energy circuit rider to manage the process of accepting bids and choosing a vendor for the solar installation.


“You need a trusted expert in these special-knowledge situations when you want to make sure you’re doing what’s right for your town,” Hoisington said. ​“The bottom line is a lot of this never would’ve gotten done without their help.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)GOP reversals in this year’s elections, especially in some urban and immigrant communities, are setting off alarm bells for Republicans using redistricting to try to keep control of Congress in next year’s midterms.
Redistricting plans demanded by President Donald Trump in states such as Texas and Missouri — meant to capitalize on his stronger showing among certain urban voters in the 2024 election — could backfire, as cities in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia returned to Democratic voting patterns in off-year elections this past November.
Experts see the shift as a sign of possible souring on the administration’s immigration enforcement agenda, combined with disappointment in economic conditions.
An ever-larger share of ICE’s arrested immigrants have no criminal record

Paul Brace, an emeritus political science professor of legal studies at Rice University in Houston, said Texas Republicans are likely to gain less than they imagine from new maps designed to pick up five additional seats for the party. He said minority voters’ interest in Trump was “temporary” and that he had underperformed on the economy.
“Trump’s redistricting efforts are facing headwinds and, even in Texas, may not yield all he had hoped,” Brace said.
Redistricting efforts in Texas spawned a retaliatory plan in California aimed at getting five more Democratic seats. Other states have leapt into the fray, with Republicans claiming an overall edge of three potential seats in proposed maps.
Cuban-born Jose Arango, chair of the Hudson County Republican Party in New Jersey, said immigration enforcement has gone too far and caused a backlash at the polls.
“There are people in the administration who frankly don’t know what the hell is going on,” Arango said. “If you arrest criminals, God bless you. We don’t want criminals in our streets. But then you deport people who have been here 30 years, 20 years, and have contributed to society, have been good people for the United States. You go into any business in agriculture, the hospitality business, even the guy who cuts the grass — they’re all undocumented. Who’s going to pick our tomatoes?”
As immigration arrests increase this year, a growing share of those detained have no criminal convictions.
New Jersey’s 9th Congressional District, which includes urban Paterson, went from a surprising Trump win last year to a lopsided victory this year for Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill. Trump won the district last year by 3 percentage points and Sherrill won by 16 points. The district is majority-minority and 39% immigrant.
There was a similar turnaround in Miami, a majority-immigrant city that elected a Democratic mayor for the first time in almost 30 years. Parts of immigrant-rich Northern Virginia also shifted in the governor’s race there.











There is an element of Trump-curious minority voters staying home this year.


– J. Miles Coleman, an associate editor at the University of Virginia Center for Politics



In the New Jersey district, Billy Prempeh, a Republican whose parents emigrated from Ghana, lost a surprisingly close 2024 race for U.S. House to Democrat Nellie Pou, of Puerto Rican descent, who became the first Latina from New Jersey to serve in Congress.
Prempeh this year launched another campaign for the seat, but withdrew after Sherrill won the governor’s race, telling Stateline that any Republican who runs for that seat “is going to get slaughtered.”
Prempeh doesn’t blame Trump or more aggressive immigration enforcement for the shift. He said his parents and their family waited years to get here legally, and he objects to people being allowed to stay for court dates after they crossed the border with Mexico.
“We aren’t deporting enough people. Not everybody agrees with me on that,” Prempeh said.
Parts of Virginia saw similar voting pattern changes. Prince William County, south of Washington, D.C., saw support for Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger jump to 67% compared with 57% for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris last year. The county is about 26% immigrant and 27% Hispanic.
Asian American and Hispanic voters shifted more Democratic this year in both New Jersey and Virginia, said J. Miles Coleman, an associate editor at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, expanding on a November post on the subject.
However, some of those Virginia voters might have sat out the governor’s race, Coleman said.
“I do think there is an element of Trump-curious minority voters staying home this year,” Coleman said. “There were many heavily Asian and Hispanic precincts in Northern Virginia that saw this huge percentage swing from Harris to Spanberger, but also saw relatively weak turnout.”
The pattern is “hard to extrapolate” to Texas or other states with new maps, Coleman said, “but Democrats are probably liking what they saw in this year’s elections.”
He said one of the redrawn districts in Texas is now likely to go to Democrats: the majority-Hispanic 28th Congressional District, which includes parts of San Antonio and South Texas. And the nearby 34th Congressional District is now a tossup instead of leaning Republican, according to new Center for Politics projections.
More industries want Trump’s help hiring immigrant labor after farms get a break

The pattern in New Jersey’s 9th Congressional District this year was consistent in Hispanic areas statewide, according to an analysis provided to Stateline by Michael Foley, elections coordinator of State Navigate, a Virginia-based nonprofit that analyzes state election data.
New Jersey Hispanic precincts “swung heavily” toward Sherrill compared with their 2024 vote for Harris, Foley said in an email. He noted that New Jersey and Florida Hispanic populations are largely from the Caribbean and may not reflect patterns elsewhere, such as Texas where the Hispanic population is heavily Mexican American.
Pou, who won the New Jersey seat, said economics played a part in this year’s electoral shift.
“The President made a promise to my constituents that he’d lower costs and instead he’s made the problem worse with his tariffs that raised costs across the board,” Pou said in a statement to Stateline.
Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, said immigration and pocketbook issues both played a role in places like the 9th District, as did an influx of Democratic campaign money.
“The biggest reason is a sense of letdown in President Trump,” Rasmussen said. “There were many urban voters who decided they liked what Trump was saying, they liked the Hispanic outreach, they bought into his economic message. And just one year later, they’re equally disillusioned.”

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderState officials have introduced a $1.4 billion plan to improve rural health outcomes over the next five years under the federal Rural Health Transformation Program created as part of this summer’s budget reconciliation bill.
In a 96-page application, officials from the state’s Department of Community Health requested funds to improve access to primary and specialty care in rural areas, strengthen telehealth infrastructure and recruit more health care providers across the state’s dozens of rural counties.
“Our broader vision is that rural populations are healthier, live longer, have an improved quality of life, and can both live and work in the communities they love,” said Stuart Portman, Georgia’s Medicaid director, during the Board of Community Health meeting this month.
Georgia’s rural counties face higher rates of poverty, heart disease and cancer than their urban counterparts, according to the state’s application for the program. Rural counties are also less likely to have pediatricians or OB/GYNs, and have lower rates of employee-sponsored health insurance.
There are limits to how Georgia can use the money, however. Funding must be allocated according to the program’s guidelines and will be subject to strict oversight by the federal government, Portman explained to the committee. The portion of money that goes to payments for health care providers, for instance, cannot exceed 15% of the total funds.
“We could not do things that created ongoing obligations for the state or the federal government,” Portman said. “Importantly, there’s a strong desire to not include things that create a [financial] cliff.”
There were also a few rules that echo larger priorities of President Donald Trump and his administration. Funds cannot be used toward gender-affirming care for children or adults and largely cannot be used to cover abortion care. Hospitals may also be required to collect information on patients’ immigration status to be eligible for reimbursement under the program.
All 50 states submitted applications for the program, which were due in early November. Half of the annual $10 billion in federal funding will be divided evenly among states with approved plans across a five-year period, and the rest will be awarded based on need, program design and federal scoring criteria. 
Officials at the Georgia Department of Community Health said the funds for the first year could be delivered by the end of the year.
How would Georgia’s rural health funding be allocated?
Georgia’s program, which state officials have named Georgia Rural Enhancement And Transformation of Health, or GREAT Health, would invest funds from the Rural Health Transformation Program across 29 separate projects, which fall into five major categories.


If approved, the largest bucket of funding, encompassing over $428 million, will be used to help up to 86 eligible hospitals transition to a program known as Achieving Healthcare Efficiency through Accountable Design, or the AHEAD Model. The program, which was created by the federal CMS Innovation Center, is designed to limit the growth of health care spending, in part by emphasizing primary and preventative care.
The program would also allocate $175 million toward improving hospital infrastructure in rural areas. The proposal would help fund electrical grid improvements, water and air quality assessments and other upgrades to ensure that facilities can weather severe storms and natural disasters without endangering patients or disrupting their care.
A proposed $148 million would go toward recruiting and retaining health care providers in rural areas by establishing 75 new residency slots each year in fields like family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics, as well as establishing a new rural recruitment incentive grant program for certain providers who agree to practice in rural areas for at least five years.
A few private organizations, including the Georgia Alliance of Community Hospitals and the Georgia Hospital Association, also submitted letters as part of the state’s application for the program, alongside letters from state officials like Gov. Brian Kemp and Department of Public Health Commissioner Kathleen Toomey.
HomeTown Health CEO Jimmy Lewis, who also signed onto the state’s application for the program, said he was glad to see such a comprehensive interest in rural health at the state and federal levels.
The funds, he added, “could help us offset some of the years-ago losses” that some of the rural hospitals in his network are facing.
H.R. 1 fallout
For proponents of the Rural Health Transformation Program, the estimated $1.4 billion in rural health funding comes as a much-needed reprieve for struggling providers.
But critics say the program won’t make up for drastic Medicaid funding cuts enshrined in the “one big, beautiful bill” that Trump signed into law over the summer. According to a new report from the Georgia Health Initiative, the state will lose an estimated $5.4 billion in Medicaid funding over the next 10 years as a result of the legislation, and 460,000 people will become uninsured.
Leah Chan, director of health justice at Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said that higher rates of uninsured Georgians could spell disaster for rural hospitals, many of which receive the vast majority of their funding from Medicaid payments. If that Medicaid funding is diminished, hospitals may be required to provide emergency care without any compensation.
“We know that many of those rural safety net hospitals are already under substantial pressure due in part to high uncompensated care costs,” Chan said. “The loss of the supplementary federal funds basically adds fuel to what is already a smoldering fire for us in terms of our health care system.”
Though some congressional Republicans billed the Rural Health Transformation Program as a solution to Medicaid funding cuts, Chan argued that the funds will not address the biggest issue facing rural hospitals.
“What we can see from the application is, in fact, these rural health transformation funds do not address the loss of these federal provider payments,” she said. “So essentially, our state is left to pick up the tab.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/hospital-sign.jpg,,,2025-12-24 05:12:06.188775

For members of the diaspora, each piece is personal.","An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things

Lubow Wolynetz has served as a curator with the Ukrainian Museum and Library in Stamford for over four decades. Many of the items in the collection were passed down, over generations and across continents, and they hold deep meaning, she said.
They are bits of the national identity Ukrainians are fighting to keep alive.
“We have duplicates and triplicates, but we save them so that when Ukraine — when they’re finally free — [we can] send it there,” she said.
Wolynetz said she believes the current war, and the hardships that have come with it, has elevated the art’s significance.

Among the variety of folk art showcased in the museum is row after row of colorful vyshyvankas — embroidered shirts made by artisans across Ukraine, from the Carpathian Mountains in the west to the rivers in the east, each with distinct patterns and styles.
“The Ukrainians were always a nation that was overpowered by a stronger nation. So most of the populace had to learn how to survive within the oppression of the powers,” Wolynetz said. “The way they did it is that they would stick to their traditions. And one of these traditions would be their outfits and the way they dress, the way they created things around them.”

Oleksandra Storchai, a senior research associate at the Ivan Honchar Museum in Kyiv, said Ukrainian history “has many tragic pages,” when it was taken over by outside interests. “Traditional folk culture was the only thing that helped to keep the identity,” she said.
Vyshyvankas have held a particular strength in that regard. According to the tradition, the embroidered patterns and designs serve as amulets meant to protect the wearer. 
“It has an inner meaning,” Storchai said. 
“It’s a much wider picture than just stitching,” Wolynetz said. “It’s one of the basic identities that we have.”

Threading old and new worlds
In West Hartford, retiree and artist Yelena Kirshon is working on curating her 12th Ukrainian art exhibition, set to take place in April. Kirshon, who grew up in Ukraine, also teaches folk art classes — focused on the Eastern painting style of Petrykivka — and sells handmade jewelry. 
Proceeds from those endeavors have been supporting the Fastiv School of Folk Crafts, in Fastiv, Ukraine — a town about 40 miles southwest of Kyiv, where Kirshon’s niece, Oksana Zuienko, is the director.

The school seeks to revive Ukrainian folk craft traditions, ranging from woodwork to embroidery, Zuienko said. Over 500 children attend its afterschool classes, and several former students have been recognized nationally for their work. (Kirshon is one of those former students — the school is where she learned Petrykivka painting.)
“Children delve into the roots of our past,” Zuienko said. “They know our customs and rituals. They know our symbolism.”
Of the school’s 18 teachers, most have a partner or relative on the frontline. The war’s impact on the school, however, doesn’t end there.

In early December, Fastiv suffered three consecutive nights of drone strikes. Explosions ripped through the approximately 45,000-person town, decimating the train station and train depot. At the Fastiv School of Folk Crafts, just half a mile from the impact, the blasts knocked canvases down from the walls. 
But the sleepless nights and the threat of more attacks failed to deter the school’s staff or students. On the day following the three-day strike, students dutifully filed into their classes after school. 
In one room, 7-year-old Nadiia honed her beading technique. In another, two young boys worked with clay, surrounded by the ceramic creations of their predecessors.
The money that Kirshon has raised in Connecticut made it possible for the school to add a toilet, which allowed younger children to enroll.

In the school’s main room, which doubles as a museum, sisters Alisa and Diana watched in a corner as their teachers assembled wheat in a typical holiday sheaf known as didukh. Around them, nearly every surface was adorned with embroidery, traditional easter eggs and paintings in the Petrykivka style.
Around 5 p.m., Fastiv went dark. Power cuts have become a daily occurrence in Ukraine, as Russia has targeted the nation’s energy infrastructure during cold months. Unable to continue teaching in the darkness, teachers sent the students home early. 
The neighborhood was submerged in darkness. Car headlights lit the streets, which were suffused with the hum of generators and the faint smell of gas.

Stitching together a community
Driving through the east side of Stamford, the grandeur of the stone manor at 161 Glenbrook Road stands out amidst rows of multi-family homes. The ornately decorated Stamford estate, which now serves as home to the Ukrainian Museum and Library, was purchased by Bishop Constantine Bohachevsky in 1933 with the intention of establishing a cultural institution. 
The collection sits beyond iron gates, down a winding driveway and through a heavy wooden door. Dozens of models and cases dispersed through wood-paneled rooms display colorful stitching from across Ukraine.
For Wolynetz, the vyshyvankas, in particular, hold deep personal significance. 
She first encountered embroidery as a displaced person living in Germany in the 1940s after fleeing her hometown in Western Ukraine during the Dnieper-Carpathian offensive. Growing up in a camp for displaced people, she observed as her mother and other women would gather to stitch clothing with distinct patterns from their hometowns. 
She recalled that her embroidery teacher in Germany would “pull up an old suitcase” to show the class examples of the craft. “And when I saw that, I just said, ‘When I grow up, I’m going to have the same kind of [suitcase.]”
Now in her 80s, Wolynetz teaches workshops in Ukrainian embroidery techniques in Connecticut and New York. And she proudly carries her own suitcase to class.
One series of those workshops recently took place this autumn at the Ukrainian Museum in New York, on the lower level of a building where traditional Ukrainian easter eggs, paintings and other art adorn the halls. Every week, over a dozen students gather to learn embroidery from Wolynetz. 

Patterns and colored threads spilled onto the table as she unzipped her suitcase at the start of the session. She was met with a mix of friendly chatter and technical questions from the students. Mostly women, with backgrounds ranging from Puerto Rican to Italian-American to Ukrainian, the students shared bits of their personal lives with each other amidst their triumphs and struggles with the craft.
“It’s one of those social groups that you wish was around more,” Wolynetz said.
One student, Jo Ann Radioli, said she found the class after joining an initiative to embroider amulets for soldiers fighting on the Ukrainian frontline. 
The samples that were mailed to her to replicate seemed daunting. “It was like jumping off the end of a diving board,” Radioli said. “Because I found Lubow, I felt I could do it.”
In the past, soldiers would go to war, return, and stop wearing embroidery. This practice was especially common after the first and second World Wars, where Ukrainians were forbidden from wearing vyshyvanka, and embroidered items were seized or destroyed.

(Paramount)Along with millions of others, I’ll soon be taking 2 hours and 10 minutes out of my busy holiday schedule to sit down and watch a movie I’ve seen countless times before: Frank Capra’s “It’s a Wonderful Life,” which tells the story of a man’s existential crisis one Christmas Eve in the fictional town of Bedford Falls.

There are lots of reasons why this eight-decade-old film still resonates, from its nostalgic pleasures to its cultural critiques.
But when I watch it this year, the sequence where Bedford Falls transforms into the dark and dystopian “Pottersville” will resonate the most.
In the film, protagonist George Bailey, who’s played by Jimmy Stewart, is on the brink of suicide. He seems to have achieved the hallmarks of the American dream: He’s taken over his father’s loan business, married the love of his life and fathered four excessively adorable children. But George feels stifled and beaten down. His Uncle Billy has misplaced US$8,000 of the company’s money, and the town’s resident tyrant, Mr. Potter, is using the mishap to try to ruin George, who’s his last remaining business competitor.
An angel named Clarence is tasked with pulling George back from the brink. To stop him from attempting suicide, Clarence decides to show George what life would have been like if he’d never been born. In this alternate reality, Bedford Falls is called Pottersville, a place Mr. Potter runs as a ruthless banker and slumlord.

Having previously written about “It’s a Wonderful Life” in my book on literary and film censorship, I can’t help but see parallels between Pottersville and the U.S. today.
Think about it:
In Pottersville, one man hoards all the financial profits and political power.
In Pottersville, greed, corruption, and cynicism reign supreme.
In Pottersville, hard-working immigrants like Giuseppe Martini who were able to build a life and run a business in Bedford Falls have vanished.
In Pottersville, homeless addicts like Mr. Gower and nonconformist “pixies” like Clarence are scorned and ostracized, then booted out of the local watering hole.
In Pottersville, cops arrest people like Violet Bick while they’re at work and haul them away, kicking and screaming.
Violet Bick gets dragged away by the Pottersville police as George looks on. (Paramount)
But what horrifies George the most about Pottersville is how desensitized the people living in it seem to be to its harshness and cruelty – how they treat him like he’s the crazy, deranged one for wanting and expecting things to be different and better.
This is what the current political moment feels like to me. There are days when the latest headlines feel so jarringly unprecedented that I find myself thinking, “Can this be happening? Can this be real?”
If you think these comparisons are a bit of a stretch, consider when “It’s a Wonderful Life” was made, and the frame of mind Capra was in when he made it.
Frank Capra, anti-fascist
In 1946, Capra was just returning to Hollywood filmmaking after serving for four years in the U.S. Army, where the Office of War Information had tasked him with producing a series of documentary films about World War II and the lead-up to it. Even though Capra hadn’t been on the front lines, he’d been immersed in the sounds and images of war for years on end, and he had become acutely familiar with Germany, Italy and Japan’s respective rises to fascism.

When deciding on his first postwar film, Capra recalled in his autobiography that he specifically “knew one thing – it would not be about war.” Instead, he chose to adapt a short story by Philip Van Doren Stern, “The Greatest Gift,” that Stern had originally sent to friends and family as a Christmas card in 1943.
Stern’s story is certainly not about war. But it’s not exactly about Christmas, either.
As Stern writes in his opening lines:
“The little town straggling up the hill was bright with colored Christmas lights. But George Pratt did not see them. He was leaning over the railing of the iron bridge, staring down moodily at the black water.”
The protagonist contemplates suicide because he’s “sick of everything” in the small-town “mudhole” he’s stuck in – until, that is, a “strange little man” gives him the chance to see what life would be like if he’d never been born.
It was Capra and his team of screenwriters who added the sinister Henry F. Potter to Stern’s short, simple tale. The Potter subplot encapsulates the film’s most trenchant, still-resonant themes: the unfairness of socioeconomic injustices; the pervasiveness of corporate and political corruption; the threat of monopolized power; the need for affordable housing.
These themes had, of course, run through many of Capra’s prewar films as well: “Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,” “You Can’t Take It with You,” “Meet John Doe” and “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,” the last of which also starred Jimmy Stewart.
But they take on a different kind of weight in “It’s a Wonderful Life” – a weight that’s especially visible on the weathered face of Stewart, who himself had just returned from a harrowing four-year tour of duty as a bomber pilot in Europe.
The idealistic vigor with which Stewart had fought crooked politicians and oligarchs as Mr. Smith is replaced by the bitterness, exhaustion, frustration and desperation with which he battles against Mr. Potter as George Bailey.

Life after Pottersville
By the time George has begged and pleaded his way out of Pottersville, the lost $8,000 is no longer top of mind. He’s mainly just relieved to find Bedford Falls as he had left it, warts and all.
And yet, the Bedford Falls that George returns to isn’t quite the same as the one he left behind.
In this Bedford Falls, the community rallies together to figure out a way to recoup George’s missing money. Their pre-digital version of a GoFundMe page saves George from what he’d feared most: bankruptcy, scandal and prison.
And even though his wife, Mary, tries to attribute this sudden wave of collectivist, activist energy to some sort of divine intervention – “George, it’s a miracle; it’s a miracle!” – Uncle Billy points out that it really came about through more earthly organizing means: “Mary did it, George; Mary did it! She told some people you were in trouble, and they scattered all over town collecting money!”
The residents of Bedford Falls come together to save George from financial ruin. (Paramount)
But the question of whether George actually wins his battle against Potter is a murky one.
While the typical Capra protagonist triumphs by defeating vice and exposing subterfuge, George never even realizes that Potter is the one who got hold of his money and tried to ruin his life. Potter is never held accountable for his crimes.
On the other hand, George is able to learn, from his time in Pottersville, what a crucial role he plays in his community. George’s victory over Potter, then, lies not in some grand final act of retribution, but in the incremental ways he has stood up to Potter throughout his life: not capitulating to Potter’s bullying or intimidation tactics; speaking truth to power; and running a community-centered business rather than one guided by greed and exploitation.
In recent months, there have been similar acts of protest, large and small, in the form of rallies, boycotts, immigrant aid efforts, subscription cancellations, food bank donations and more.
That doesn’t mean the U.S. has made it out of Pottersville, however.
Each day, more head-spinning headlines appear, whether they’re about masked agents terrorizing immigrant communities, the dismantling of anti-corruption oversights, the consolidation of executive power or the naked display of political grift.
Zuzu’s petals are still missing. Clarence still hasn’t gotten his wings.
But this holiday season, I’m hoping it will feel helpfully cathartic to go with George Bailey, for the umpteenth time, through the dark abyss of his dystopian nightmare – and come out with him, stronger and wiser, on the other side.

One drawback of working in the word business is that reading becomes just another part of the job. If you spend eight hours a day reading other people‘s writing, editing other people’s writing, or creating and editing your own writing, you might find it difficult to rouse yourself for other types of literature. Maybe you just want to watch “The Golden Girls.”
In essence, I read news and commentary pieces seven days a week, 365 days a year. Some of that writing amuses and diverts me. Some of it enrages me. A relatively small amount carries lasting aesthetic qualities.
I want to read other things. Yet even a nonfiction book can look like a daunting obstacle when the onrush of daily content piles up outside your door, a snowdrift of content that you then have to dig out with your eyes.
The struggle continues.
When I lived in New Hampshire, I was part of a book club that read an array of interesting modern fiction and nonfiction. We worked through “The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle” by Haruki Murakami, “Pale Fire” by Vladimir Nabokov, “Special Topics in Calamity Physics” by Marisha Pessl, “Dune” by Frank Herbert and many others.
More recently, my work on a volume for the University Press of Kansas about historic opinion writers has required leafing through dozens of old volumes. However, most of the time I use indexes and skimming to find useful nuggets.
After I finished writing the book, more or less, in September, I turned once again to reading fiction. I’ve stocked up on books I want to read but haven’t managed yet — “Catch-22” by Joseph Heller, “Beloved” by Toni Morrison, “The Sound and the Fury” by William Faulkner, “The Talented Mr. Ripley” by Patricia Highsmith.
Sure, I own the books now. But am I reading them?
Partially! My challenge can be illustrated by an even earlier weekend when I began with the best of intentions to read Faulkner — but ended up tearing through Ramin Setoodeh’s gossipy “Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Inside Story of “The View.”
I mean, you can read the work of a Nobel Prize winner in literature, or you can read about how Barbara Walters battled Rosie O’Donnell.
That’s the joy and terror of reading, when separated from work. So many books tower on all sides of us, important, silly, smart, ludicrous and just plain incomprehensible. Picking one means ignoring all those others, at least for the time being. We only enjoy so much time, and only so much of that time can be spent tracing our eyes through the letters and sentences and paragraphs that adorn a page.
We can never read all the books, despite our hopes to the contrary. So we pick up one volume after another, reading into the future.
Or we consume another think piece about Bari Weiss and “60 Minutes.”

Officials warn: ""Get out of the way."" Evacuations are underway.","In summary
Atmospheric river threatens to unleash deadly debris flows through LA’s wildfire scars. Officials warn: “Get out of the way.” Evacuations are underway.


This story originally published Nov. 14 has been updated after Governor Gavin Newsom announced the state would mobilize resources in advance of winter storms. A dangerous atmospheric river is poised to deliver “excessive rainfall” across Southern California, raising fears that the rain could unleash a threat that has been lingering in the burn scars of wildfires that ravaged Los Angeles communities in recent years.
Called debris flows, these fast-moving slurries of floodwater and sediment can hurtle down slopes carrying cars, trees and even boulders with them.
They’re like “a flood on steroids,” said Jason Kean, a research hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey’s landslide hazards program. “It’s really hard to stop these things. The best thing to do is get out of the way.” 
Northern California is already reeling from the atmospheric river that unleashed catastrophic flash flooding in Redding over the weekend, killing a 74-year-old man who became trapped in his pickup truck on a flooded roadway. 
Now, another storm is expected to reach coastal Northern California this evening, with strong winds and especially heavy rainfall expected to push into southern California by Wednesday. 
Forecasters warn that the rain “will cause life-threatening flash flooding, along with landslides, rockfalls, and/or mudslides,” particularly for areas along Southern California’s Transverse Ranges, including the San Bernardino, San Gabriel, and Sierra Madre mountains. “Urban flooding in the greater Los Angeles metro area is likely.” 
Burn scars — slicked by fire and stripped of plants — are especially dangerous during heavy rains. A storm after the Thomas Fire in 2018 spurred debris flows in Montecito that killed 23 people. And in February, a debris flow in the Palisades Fire burn zone swept a Los Angeles Fire Department member and his SUV into the Pacific Ocean. 
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works warns that there’s a risk of moderate debris and mudflows capable of blocking roadways and endangering some structures in the burn scars of more than a dozen fires — including January’s Eaton, Hurst and Palisades fires. 
The county has issued evacuation warnings in and around recent burn scars, and urged those who may take longer to evacuate to consider leaving now. Officials also announced some targeted evacuation orders for specific properties “at higher risk for mud and debris flows impacts.”
“Recent burn areas, including those impacted by the January wildfires, remain highly susceptible to mud and debris flows,” county officials warned Monday. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday that more than 225 personnel and resources including 45 fire engines, 10 swiftwater rescue teams, helicopters and more have been pre-deployed to a dozen northern and southern California counties. 
Meteorologists are discussing it as a “one in every five years type of storm,” said Lisa Phillips with the National Weather Service. “There’s going to be problems everywhere. We have a lot of canyon roads and mountain roads, and things will fall down.” 
Phillips said she expects to see mudslides, landslides, sinkholes – even after the rains have ended, and urged people to stay off the roads if they can. 
“There’s going to be issues outside of the burn scars too, and flooding,” Phillips said. “We want everyone to stay at home, stay safe and don’t get yourself into any trouble unnecessarily.” 
We spoke with the U.S. Geological Survey’s Kean, an expert on debris flows after wildfires, last month about what to expect when storms strike burn scars. This conversation has been edited and condensed.
As this storm really takes hold in LA and Southern California, I’m hearing a lot of concern about it hitting areas that burned this past year, including in the Eaton and Palisades fires. Why is this such a big concern? What could happen?
Last January those fires removed much of the vegetation on really steep slopes, and that made those slopes really vulnerable to erosion during intense rainfall. That protective blanket of vegetation is gone, and heavy rain can rapidly make a flash flood. And that flood, in some cases, can pick up material and turn into what we call a debris flow — which is like a flood on steroids.

These burn areas are still vulnerable, even though it’s now many months after the fire and there have been flows already. There’s still plenty of material that could be mobilized. So the threat’s still there. And so we know they’re bad actors, and we’re concerned they could be bad actors again. 
I’m hearing a lot of different terms: mudslide, debris flows, landslide. What are the differences, and which ones are the burn scars at risk for? 
Landslide is an umbrella term that captures all kinds of mass movements, from rock falls to debris flows — these floods on steroids — to big, slow movers. The type of flow that we’re most concerned about in a recent burn area is a debris flow. It’s also called a mudslide. But geologists don’t like to use the word mudslide as much because it sounds like there’s some mud on your driveway — not a big issue, not something that could kill you. And these things, if you’re in the wrong spot at the wrong time, they can cause serious damage.
You called it a flood on steroids. What happens in a debris flow? 
Flash floods are bad, and they can cause lots of problems, too. They can get even worse if they pick up enough sediment to turn into the consistency of wet concrete. But it’s worse than just concrete, because it can contain boulders the size of cars. And, very close to the mountain front, it can move very quickly — faster than you can run. And when it gets all bulked up with debris, the rocks, the gravel, the mud, trees, the flow can be a lot bigger. It just turns into a different animal. 
Now, debris flows pack a bigger punch than floods, but thankfully, they don’t have as long of reach. So usually, the debris flows are confined really close to the mountain fronts. That’s where they put those debris basins to catch them. But if there isn’t one protection like that, then they can travel downslope and impact neighborhoods, and then flooding can extend even further down. 
Is there something about Southern California that makes it higher risk?
Southern California’s kind of the world capital for these kinds of events. It’s got this combination of very steep topography, like the San Gabriel Mountains that just shoot right up, Santa Monica mountains, Santa Ynez — very steep topography. It burns fairly frequently. And then there are a lot of people living very close to the mountain front, so that’s what puts the risk up. 
The thing about a burn area is it takes much less rainfall to cause a problem than it would in unburned conditions. So we’ve now made the slopes really vulnerable. They’re extra steep. There’s a lot of people there. That’s why the risk is so high. 
We’ve seen debris flows in Northern California burn areas as well. It’s not just a Southern California problem, and it’s not just a California problem. 
Is there anything that could have been done to reduce this risk? Anything that should be done now? 
Not long after the fires, in particular the Palisades Fire, (there were) a number of fairly widespread debris flows that disrupted the roads. There were also, in the Eaton fire, floods and debris flows there. Thankfully there’s a dense network of LA County debris basins, which are designed to catch the material before it enters neighborhoods, and those largely saved the day. 
Planners have planned ahead and put in these debris basins — these big, giant holes in the ground — designed to catch the material. That’s the best defense against these. They’re not everywhere, but there is a good network of protection. Other than that, it’s really hard to stop these things. 
What should people who live near the recent burn scars know? What should they do now, as the rain starts? 
The best thing you could do is, if you’re really close to a drainage in one of these burn areas, is to get out of the way. You’re going to get a heads up from the National Weather Service, who’s closely monitoring the rainstorms. They know how much rain it’s going to take to cause a problem, and they’ll get out warnings, and local authorities will reach out to get people out of the way. So there’s a lot of eyes on the situation. And so at this point, the best thing to do is listen to the weather service, listen to local authorities. 
If they ask you to get out of the way, take their advice. These things can happen really fast if there is an intense burst of rain, a flash flood, where debris flow can start within minutes. 
So there is no escaping a debris flow once it starts? 
It’s pretty difficult. If you have a two-story home and you happen to be there at the wrong time, get up to that second floor for sure. Fight like heck if you get trapped in one. But best to be out of the way.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021425-EatonFireMudslides-JAJ-10.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-24 02:56:39.944165

San Marcos residents celebrated the holiday tradition of posadas together while navigating fear and tension caused by increased ICE enforcement.


On Friday night, organizers of a community holiday festival in San Marcos were busy planning a neighborhood procession and readying trays of tamales for guests.
At the same time, they were preparing security to watch for ICE activity in the largely low-income, Latino area of North County San Diego.
“We rely on the community,” said San Marcos Councilmember Maria Nuñez, who represents San Marcos’ District 1, where 55% of the voting age population is Hispanic. “People are on high alert. If they see anything, hear anything, if ICE is in the area, they’ll let us know.”
Universidad Popular, a civic organization in North County San Diego, sponsored the event, called the Posada Comunitaria, with a local church, Restoration Abbey. It’s the third time they’ve held the event in San Marcos, but this year the festivities took place against a backdrop of apprehension as immigration enforcement has ramped up under the Trump administration.
The procession, or posada, traditionally reenacts the pilgrimage of Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem before the birth of Christ. In San Marcos, residents and organizers filed through the neighborhood, where affordable housing complexes are home to many immigrant families.
The event places the advent story in a modern context, said Alex Aguas, a priest with Restoration Abbey, which assists asylum seekers.
“The practice of the Posada really invites people to think about ‘what does it mean to be rejected?’” he said. “Or ‘what does it mean to be on the margins and looking for sanctuary and shelter at this time?’ We also just get to have the opportunity to celebrate.”
As guests arrived and sipped cups of coffee and apple cider, security volunteers in hot pink vests huddled to discuss how to manage traffic control and watch for immigration agents.

“All of our teams, all of our pink vests here, have been trained in immigration response,” said Arcela Nuñez, co-director of Universidad Popular, and Maria Nuñez’ sister.  “We have people watching all points in this neighborhood.”
San Marcos, a city of 94,000 in North County San Diego, appears to account for just a few of the immigration arrests in the San Diego area. But government data suggests the numbers have ticked up this year, and organizers said they have seen more immigration activity recently.
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has arrested at least 38 people in San Marcos since September 2023, with 20 of those arrests between June and October of this year, according to federal data provided by ICE in response to a FOIA request, processed by the Deportation Data Project, and analyzed by CalMatters. CalMatters contacted ICE, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to confirm the numbers, and has not heard back. 
The escalating enforcement, and a change in policy that permits immigration enforcement at areas such as churches and schools that were previously off limits, has created a chilling effect on some community activities. Arcela Nuñez said her organization debated whether to hold the event this year in light of those concerns. They decided to go ahead, but to proceed with caution.

Organizers were particularly attuned to possible reports of ICE activity at the San Marcos Home Depot, less than a mile away, where other immigration raids have taken place this year. Home Depot stores where immigrant day laborers gather to seek work, have been a target for enforcement in Pomona, Los Angeles and Sacramento this year. 
In October U.S. Customs and Border Patrol arrested 22 people with criminal records at Home Depot locations in San Marcos and Encinitas, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Jason Givens said.
“If anything happens, look for experienced security,” Flower Alvarez-Lopez, co-director of Universidad Popular, told about two dozen volunteers gathered in a circle. “We will be able to help you.”
Volunteers distributed candles to participants, who lined up to march through the courtyard of a neighboring apartment building.  Musicians strummed guitars as several hundred singers serenaded residents with songs such as “Noche de Paz” and “Letania para pedir posada,” which translates to a litany requesting lodging.
Their next stop was El Palenque Taco Shop around the corner on San Marcos Boulevard. Organizers waved flashlights to direct the marchers, and steered cars around the crowd in the parking lot, before leading the group a few doors down to La Michoacana Ice Cream.
Carolers made one more stop at an apartment complex before returning to the church, where families lined up for plates heaped with rice and beans, tamales, pizza slices and conchas, a Mexican sweet bread.
The San Marcos event  proceeded without incident, but illustrates the tension that community leaders face trying to plan cultural celebrations while maintaining vigilance about potential immigration operations.
Ines Delgado, an immigration advocate with the North County LGBTQ Resource Center in neighboring Oceanside, volunteered at the posada, after hosting a celebration for International Migrants Day a day earlier, on Thursday evening. On Friday morning she said some clients showed up for a food distribution at the center, but confided that they had been too nervous to attend festivities the night before. 
“Many said they were afraid to come out,” she said. “It might be the focus on immigration, but also being out at night.”

At the Universidad Popular offices in San Marcos, a sign on the door states “Notice: private property and establishment,” warning immigration agents or other law enforcement officers that a judicial warrant is required to enter non-public areas.
Inside, pink signs embellished with flowers remind clients of their rights to remain silent in the case of arrest, and to ask officers if they are being detained.
“A lot of our community partners are doing signage like this,” Arcela Nuñez said. “So if ICE were to show up, we don’t want them to come in and we want people to feel safe.”
Behind their office, the group wrapped up the night with a pair of industrial-strength, star-shaped pinatas. Dozens of children labored to smack them open and then scrambled to collect the candy after they burst. 
Although the organization and church host the posada and other community festivals annually, this year’s neighborhood pilgrimage particularly highlighted the plight of “strangers seeking welcome,” Aguas said. 
“Based on the changing political climate, that work takes on different meaning and resonance.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s largest public employees union filed a series of unfair labor practice complaints Tuesday, claiming state administrators have violated rules on employee surveillance at work and unilaterally changed agreed-upon policies on telework eligibility and shift differentials.
The complaints by members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Council 3 came as part of a broader appeal to Gov. Wes Moore (D) and state lawmakers for better pay and working conditions at a time when the state, and state agencies, are under stress.
“We’re at a critical time in Maryland when we have an administration in Washington that has made it their mission to go after the public services millions rely on,” said Council 3 President Patrick Moran. backed by more than two dozen state workers at a Baltimore news conference.
“We need a state government and state leadership that are standing up to those threats and charting a different course. Standing with public employees means not committing unfair labor practices,” he said.
A spokesperson for the governor said Tuesday afternoon that the Moore administration has continued to support public servants while also managing a “historic budget crisis as Maryland continues to face unprecedented attacks from the federal administration.”
“From day one, Gov. Moore has consistently stood up for Maryland’s workers, making clear that supporting labor and protecting our workforce are central to this administration’s work,” said Rhyan Lake, the spokesperson.

“Each year, he has reaffirmed that commitment to public servants and organized labor, despite ongoing budget constraints, the state and the union have reached agreements to continue annual increases. The governor will continue to work with our labor partners to ensure our workers are protected,” Lake said.
But in separate filings with the state’s Public Employee Labor Relations Board filed Tuesday, the union said the administration has fallen short in several areas.
The first complaint claims the Department of Budget and Management violated shift differential language in the the union’s current collective bargaining agreement, which runs through Dec. 31, 2026. The union said that agreement requires the state to pay an additional $1 an hour to any union member who works an overnight shift, but that the department last week that it had developed a list of job classifications that would qualify for the differential.
“The announcement reveals DBM’s intention to – contrary to the agreement – selectively award shift differential pay to only certain classifications and employees in its discretion,” read the complaint.
The second complaint, also filed against DBM, claims the department is refusing to provide a list of union members wh0 are eligible for telework — as it has in the past — or track those who are taking it, making it impossible for the union to continue to negotiate the issue. The agency also said telework “agreements are a management right,” according to the complaint and the existing telework agreement”only requires OPSB [the Office of Personnel Services and Benefits] meet and discuss telework designations” with the union.
Finally, the union complained that the collective bargaining agreement makes clear that video surveillance in the workplace may be used “solely for security purposes,” but that the Maryland Department of Health is using it to track “employees in the moment-to-moment performance of their duties.”
The complaint cites cases where nurses and other workers at the Thomas B. Finan Center in Cumberland were monitored as they prepared and delivered medications, to see how long they washed their hands or if they were using personal protective equipment. In one case, a supervisor texted workers to shift their positions in a room so the camera could better see their performance.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Such monitoring also “pervades” at Springfield Hospital Center in Eldersburg, Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center in Jessup, Eastern Shore Hospital Center in Cambridge, the RICA-Baltimore in the city and Spring Grove Hospital Center in Catonsville, the complaint said.
All three complaints were filed with the state’s Public Employees Relations Board. Union members said these types of filings are “very rare.”
The charges come at a time when “state services are in crisis,” according to union members, who pointed to a lack of beds at local hospitals, assaults on staff at correctional facilities and staffing shortages that affect the overall quality of work.
Moran said average turnover in state government reached 409 employees per month in August. And the state’s “voluntary separation program” announced this summer exacerbated staffing and public service challenges.
Union members have expressed concerns about working conditions at least since last year, after Legionella bacteria were discovered in the water at State Center. Earlier this year, AFSCME and other labor unions, along with family and friends of slain Parole Officer Davis Martinez pushed for stronger worker protections, which were enacted in May in the Davis Martinez Public Employee Safety and Health Act.
On Tuesday, union members called on state officials to work with the union to assess cost-saving measures that will not only hire and retain workers, but also keep them and the public safe.
“We are ready, and we have been ready, to partner with the state on how to cut costs in a real, sustainable way that doesn’t harm state employees, state services and Maryland’s working families,” said Cherrish Vick, a family services case worker for 17 years and AFSCME Maryland’s secretary treasurer. “We cannot do our work if our government does not have our back, and that looks like acting as a partner, working with us on cost savings and paying state workers what we deserve.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Patrick-Moran-with-AFSCME-Council-3-12-23-2025-1024x665.jpg,,,2025-12-24 00:11:56.984869

Yet federal research funding bears almost no relationship to that burden.,"A disease that may cost the United States as much as $362 billion a year in medical expenses and lost productivity receives about $13 million in annual research funding from the National Institutes of Health. I am one of the millions of Americans living in that gap.
Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS, is a complex disease that attacks multiple systems in the body. Because of the overlap with Long Covid —studies estimate that about half of Long COVID patients meet the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS— researchers now believe as many as 9 million Americans may now be living with it. Roughly a quarter are housebound or bedbound.

Elizabeth Ansell

For patients, daily life is ruled by a cruel equation: spend too much energy, pay later. A shower, a phone call, or walking to the mailbox can trigger what’s known as a “crash” —a delayed collapse of symptoms that can last for days, weeks, or months. In those stretches, people can become unable to sit upright, tolerate light or sound, or even speak more than a few words at a time. There is no diagnostic test, no FDA-approved treatment, and far too few clinicians who know how to recognize or manage the disease.
The economic consequences are enormous. Many people with ME/CFS can no longer work at all; others can work only a few hours a week. Researchers estimate that lost productivity alone costs the U.S. tens of billions of dollars each year, on top of billions more in medical spending. For individuals, the average combined hit from lost income and out-of-pocket costs has been estimated at $20,000 to $23,000 per year. Families often lose a second income when a spouse or parent becomes a full-time caregiver.
Yet federal research funding bears almost no relationship to that burden. NIH spends roughly $13 million a year on ME/CFS —far less than it devotes to other serious chronic illnesses with comparable or lower estimated costs, such as HIV/AIDS and breast cancer. Experts have suggested that ME/CFS funding would need to rise roughly fortyfold to match the disease’s impact.
In 2024, NIH approved the first-ever ME/CFS Research Roadmap, a plan developed with scientists, clinicians, and people living with the disease. It lays out a clear sequence: first, give doctors reliable tools to diagnose ME/CFS early and consistently, especially its hallmark delayed crash after exertion. Second, build the core infrastructure modern research depends on —a national patient registry, shared biobanks, and a data hub so researchers can compare results and identify subgroups. Third, create a trial network built around the realities of this disease, with home-based or low-burden participation and the ability to test promising therapies in small, careful studies and then quickly scale up what works.
This isn’t an open-ended wish list. It’s a practical blueprint for unlocking treatments in a disease that has been ignored for decades, and for building tools that can also serve Long COVID and other infection-related conditions. But a roadmap without fuel goes nowhere. The plan does not yet have dedicated funding, specific timelines, or clear benchmarks for success.
Congress has started to stir. A recent Senate spending report recognized the urgency of ME/CFS, praised NIH for approving the roadmap, and asked the agency to explain how it will carry it out. That is better than silence. But patients have learned that report language and memos do not, by themselves, build registries, run trials, or bring new therapies into clinics.
I know the cost of delay in my own life. Ten years ago, I was an active professional, building a career and a future. ME/CFS stripped away my job, my independence, and many of the small rituals that make a life feel like it’s mine. At my worst, I would lay in a dark room unable to speak or move, saving up what little energy I had for four days just so I could whisper “help.”
Even now, talking too long on the phone, brushing my hair, or transferring to a wheelchair can trigger a crash that sets me back for days or weeks. My family has become my care team. My friends have become advocates. Their dedication keeps me afloat, but it cannot substitute for a functioning research system.
Congress can change this. Lawmakers should direct NIH to dedicate a multi-year funding stream to the ME/CFS Roadmap, require clear milestones and annual progress reports, and ensure that the new research infrastructure also serves Long Covid and related conditions.
This is not only a moral question. It is a fiscal one. Every year that ME/CFS remains under- researched, more people fall out of the workforce, more families burn through savings, and more costs quietly accrue to disability programs and health systems. For a fraction of what the disease already costs the country, we could build the scientific foundation needed to prevent some of that loss.
Millions of Americans are waiting. I am one of them. We do not need another decade of hearings or essays documenting neglect. We need Congress to give NIH a funded, accountable mandate to follow the map it has already drawn—and to judge success by whether fewer people are forced out of work and out of their lives.
NIH has the roadmap. It’s up to Congress to decide whether it leads anywhere.

(File photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Specia to the SC Daily Gazette)Three Republican candidates sailed to victory in special elections two days before Christmas, winning two seats in the South Carolina state House and one in the Senate.
In the only contested race, Midlands pastor John Lastinger won 62% of the vote; he will now represent the House district formerly held by the former leader of the ultra-right Freedom Caucus, RJ May. 
May resigned in August after a federal grand jury indicted him on child sexual material charges. He has since pleaded guilty to five counts for distributing videos of children being sexually abused.
A judge is scheduled to sentence May on Jan. 14, 2026. He faces up to 20 years in prison.
Lastinger’s opponent for the state House seat spanning the area between Cayce, Red Bank and Gaston, Democrat and retired Army colonel J. Chuck Hightower, took just 38% of the 2,683 total votes cast in the low-turnout election Tuesday, according to unofficial results from the South Carolina Election Commission. 
Lastinger could not be reached for comment.
In the last general election for that seat, May, the only candidate on the ballot, won 92% of 14,124 votes cast. Republicans have held the ruby-red district since former state Rep. Lenoir Sturkie took office in February 1984. 
Ahead of the Tuesday elections, state Democratic Party Chair Christale Spain in an email blast called the contests a chance for Democrats to “show real power,” but the callout to voters made little difference.
The other two elections had only one candidate on the ballot. 
Firebrand Republican Lee Bright will return to a Senate district that spans parts of Greenville and Spartanburg counties. He held the seat for two previous terms before losing a primary runoff in 2016. He handily beat a write-in candidate supported by state Democratic Party leaders, earning 67% percent of 5,249 votes.
Dianne Mitchell, a former teacher with the backing of the state’s House Freedom Caucus, easily won her district in Greenville county with 70% percent of 2,124 votes against a write-in candidate. 
Lastinger and Mitchell will take office in time for the start of the Legislative Session in January and serve until the seats are up for re-election in November. 
Bright will finish out the second half of his predecessors’ term in the Senate. The seat will be on the ballot again in 2028. 
One more special election, for a state House district representing Dorchester County, will pit two Air Force veterans against each other: Republican Greg Ford and Democrat Sonja Ogletree-Satani. 
A week after that race, the 2026 session is set to open with all 170 Statehouse seats filled.

(Getty Images)The new $900 billion military spending law signed by President Donald Trump last week includes special benefits for soldiers and Coast Guardsmen in Alaska, hundreds of millions in new construction within the state, and a continued push to reactivate the U.S. Navy base at Adak.
“It’s safe to say that this is the biggest bill that Congress does every year,” said Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, in an interview this week.
The National Defense Authorization Act, as it is formally known, is normally a must-pass piece of legislation for members of Congress, and despite deadlocks on other key issues, it sailed through the U.S. House on a 312-112 bipartisan vote and through the Senate on a 77-20 vote.
Before final passage, the bill picked up plenty of additions, including the annual Coast Guard funding measure. 
“It’s a train leaving the station, and a lot of people want to jump on,” Sullivan said.
The bill raises military base pay by 3.8% nationwide, but soldiers and active-duty members of the Coast Guard in Alaska will receive a special bonus: A round-trip flight home each year.
“That’s not going to change the world. That’s not going to change the balance of power between the Russians and Chinese and America. But these are the kind of things that you can get in this bill that matter if you care and take it seriously,” Sullivan said.
Murkowski said the flight program was inspired by surveys conducted after a wave of deaths by suicide at Alaska military bases.
“We asked some of the enlisted: ‘What would make a difference to you?’ And we heard really simple things like, ‘I would love to be able to fly back home as a single enlisted just once a year, to go see my mom, be there for Christmas, be there for my nephew’s birthday,’” she said.
In a written statement, Begich said the pay increase provisions, “as well as the Commander-in-Chief’s announced year-end military pay bonus” demonstrate “sustained investment and support for our men and women in uniform.”
Sitting in her office in Anchorage and looking out at the snow-covered mountains, Murkowski noted that the bill contains millions for additional cold-weather gear and vehicles for soldiers deployed in Alaska. 
For years, Sullivan has pushed the Department of Defense to reactivate the U.S. Navy’s base at Adak, which formally closed in 1997. The land has since been transferred to the Aleut Corporation.
In July, Sullivan briefly blocked a confirmation vote for the U.S. Navy’s top officer. That got him a meeting with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who committed to creating a task force that would look at reopening Adak, Sullivan said.
“This task force was set up. They were actually supposed to have their recommendations to the Secretary of War mid-December. That deadline slipped, and trust me, I am conducting — I would call it vigorous oversight of this issue,” Sullivan said, using the title proposed by the Trump administration that would replace “secretary of defense,” which has not yet been approved by Congress.
Earlier this year, the Republican-backed Big Beautiful Bill Act included $115 million for “exploration and development of existing Arctic infrastructure.”
The new military spending law requires reports every 90 days on how that money is being spent and “an assessment of the feasibility of any viable infrastructure options in the Arctic region.”
That’s targeted language for Adak, Sullivan said.
“I hope we are getting Adak reopened,” he said. “That is going to be hugely strategic.”
Murkowski has a different vision.
“I think Sen. Sullivan has made it very, very clear from the hearings where he’s brought military leadership in, that Adak is what he’s focusing on. But you also have other other infrastructure in what is defined as the Alaska Arctic. You’ve got Eareckson out there in Shemya. You’ve got Nome, where we’re trying to build out a port. So it’s a little bit nuanced,” she said.
The law also instructs the military’s industrial office to boost Alaska mining and energy projects to the extent possible. Its text says the office should prioritize “the clearance of mining and energy project applications … likely to experience significant temporal impact due to seasonal Arctic climate conditions.”
That office has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars on mines and factories in the United States and Canada.
Statistics provided by Sullivan’s office show $284 million in construction at Fort Wainwright, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson and Eielson Air Force Base combined. There’s also millions for new missile defense construction at Fort Greely and elsewhere, and the bill includes instructions to develop a Coast Guard base on St. Paul Island to cover the Bering Sea.
The Coast Guard will also have to analyze the risks of increased shipping traffic through the Bering Strait and come up with a plan to address those risks.
Between the Big Beautiful Bill Act, the law to reopen the government after the extended shutdown and now the military spending law, “Alaska is getting well north of $1 billion in military and Coast Guard infrastructure,” Sullivan said. “I’m not sure we’ve ever done that.”
That matters because military construction means work for Alaskans in the construction industry and Alaskans who sell things to support construction.
“North of a billion — that’s really good for national security for America, but that’s also going to be really good for jobs,” Sullivan said. “That is a big stimulus to our economy.”

Bob Ferguson made a splash Tuesday with his full-throated endorsement of taxing the earnings of millionaires.
The surprise declaration from the first-term Democratic governor nearly drowned out his newly released plan to erase a multibillion-dollar shortfall in the current state budget.
He made “super clear” that if Washington taxes millionaires, the money won’t start flowing into state coffers until 2029 at the earliest. In the meantime, he said, the state must deal with the immediate problem of the $2.3 billion budget hole.
Ferguson proposes to patch it by trimming $800 million in spending, withdrawing $1 billion from the state’s rainy day fund, and making an unprecedented use of nearly $600 million in revenues from the state’s auctions of air pollution allowances.
The proposal also contains $1.2 billion of increased spending to cover costs of inflation in existing programs, greater demand for public services and complying with new federal requirements under Republicans’ so-called “Big Beautiful Bill.”
The budget plan is balanced through June 30, 2027 and does not raise taxes, keeping a pledge Ferguson made earlier this month. The plan does eliminate tax breaks related to data centers and prescription drug wholesalers.
“We are facing falling revenue, rising costs, and budget cuts and chaos coming from the Trump administration,” he said. “I’m providing a road map for the Legislature. This is, of course, the first step in a conversation about how best to balance our budget.”
Nitty gritty
The spending plan released Tuesday makes adjustments to the two-year budget Ferguson signed in May and that took effect July 1.
It is the third and final piece of the budget package Ferguson will send to lawmakers for their consideration in the 60-day session that begins Jan. 12.
Last week, he proposed pumping an additional $244 million into housing development programs through the capital budget, and $3 billion into preserving highways and bridges and building three new ferries through the transportation budget. Those sums would largely come from borrowing money through the bond market.
The current operating budget called for $77.8 billion in spending over two years across government. It relied on about $4 billion from new taxes and transfers from other accounts into the general fund, the central pot of money used to pay for most state spending. It projected the state would end the fiscal cycle with $225 million in cash reserves and $2 billion in its emergency, or rainy day, fund.

What Ferguson proposed Tuesday lifts total spending to nearly $79 billion while leaving the state with $140 million in cash reserves and $1 billion in emergency savings at the end of the budget cycle in mid-2027.
While Ferguson’s embrace of a millionaire’s tax will please progressives, his avoidance of new revenue streams to close the current gap will not, as some are pressing ahead with legislation to impose new and higher taxes on large corporations.
Overall, Ferguson’s plan does boost state spending. Of the total, $165 million is to deal with the effects of H.R. 1, the major federal legislation, which imposes new and stricter eligibility rules for food assistance and Medicaid programs.
For example, nearly $50 million will be spent to provide an estimated 30,000 refugees, asylees, and other immigrants with state-funded food assistance after they were cut from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
The single largest new sum in Ferguson’s plan confronts the state’s growing lawsuit payouts. The premiums state agencies pay into a liability account haven’t kept pace with these legal expenses. 
Without a permanent fix, the state Department of Enterprise Services, which oversees the self-insurance fund, has warned the gap could grow to more than $1.3 billion by mid-2027, and increase further from there.
Ferguson commits $955 million to resolving the problem, with a portion penciled in for use in the next budget. 
In other areas, the budget would invest $55 million to maintain subsidies for health care premiums for the Cascade Care program. It would also restore $2.9 million in funding for Capitol Campus Security and $8.5 million pared from the Abortion Access Project.
And Ferguson funds new contracts for 5,300 general government and higher education workers represented by the Washington Public Employees Association. These workers did not ratify a contract in time to be included in the budget approved this year. 
State government employees would get a 3% pay hike retroactive to July 1, 2025 and a 2% increase on July 1, 2026. Under their deal, community college employees working on July 1, 2026 would receive both increases.
Erasing the shortfall
One of the biggest — and controversial — maneuvers is Ferguson’s redirecting of $569 million of proceeds from carbon auctions under the Climate Commitment Act into the Working Families Tax Credit program, an idea first pushed by Senate Republicans last session.
The program provides credits ranging from $325 to $1,290 to low- to moderate-income families.  It has historically been funded out of the general fund. Ferguson said this one-time move would free up general fund dollars for other uses. 
This move is explicitly allowed under the 2021 law.
House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, an architect of the Climate Commitment Act, said the state needs to spend the money to make the state more resilient to climate damage.
“He had difficult choices in drafting this budget,” he said. “We have difficult choices ahead of us to pass a budget.”
Meanwhile, the governor’s budget slices spending throughout the state government.
For example, he calls for across-the-board cuts of 3% to the University of Washington and Washington State University, and 1.5% to the other regional universities and community and technical colleges.
He also halts a planned increase in per-pupil funding for school districts that struggle to raise money from local levies due to lower property values. And he proposes capping signups for the Working Connections child care program and removing 1,816 slots for the Transition to Kindergarten program starting in the 2026-27 school year.
The hits to education drew fire from Larry Delaney, president of the Washington Education Association, which is the state’s largest union for public school employees, and Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal.
“Schools and colleges are currently underfunded; our students have extensive unmet needs and additional cuts to the Local Assistance Program, Transition to Kindergarten, and more exacerbate the situation,” Delaney said.
Republican alternative
Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, the lead Republican budget writer in the House, said he thought Ferguson’s proposal was a “prank.”
“Instead of fixing the problem, this budget relies on accounting tricks, raids dedicated accounts, shifts school construction money to paper over holes, and keeps using one-time cash to pay for permanent programs. Meanwhile, it cuts back child care help, delays care for seniors, shortchanges schools, caps support for working families, and ends tax breaks,” he said
Last week, Couture put out his own plan that he says will trim state spending by $3.7 billion over the next three years while protecting core services and avoiding cuts to public schools.
He said his “Affordability First” plan would restore funding for programs cut or underfunded in the current budget, including Medicaid services, hospitals, food assistance, wildfire prevention, medical care for drug-exposed newborns, and law enforcement hiring.
It would also reimpose voter-backed spending limits tied to inflation and population growth and require what’s known as zero-based budgeting for agencies. To save money, it would end free health care for immigrants in the country without legal status, trim management payrolls in community colleges and universities and require public employees to pay a greater share of their benefits.
The budget problem is a result of the state spending more than it collects, Couture said. Democrats’ passage of $12 billion of new and higher taxes last session between the operating and transportation budgets “didn’t solve it, so we’re right back where we were,” he said.

William Lindstedt will move to the state Senate to take the seat formerly occupied by Colorado state Sen. Faith Winter, who died in a car crash in November. 
Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat, won a vote during a vacancy committee election Tuesday. The committee comprised Democratic voters from Senate District 25. Lindstedt beat one other candidate, Tom Klenow. Senate District 25 covers north Westminster, part of Broomfield, and Northglenn. 
“These are not the circumstances I anticipated pursuing a seat in the state Senate, and I know this loss has been devastating for our community, and for many of us very personally,” Lindstedt said about Winter’s death. “At the same time, with the legislative session rapidly approaching, the work of serving our community in the state Senate has to continue.”

Lindstedt filed paperwork with the secretary of state’s office in June declaring his intent to run for the Senate District 25 seat in 2026. Klenow also filed paperwork declaring his intent to run for the seat in 2026. 
In the House this year, Lindstedt chaired the House Finance Committee and the Legislative Audit Committee. He said he has worked on “some of the toughest fiscal and oversight decisions facing our state” on those committees. He served as a member of Broomfield City Council before he was elected to the Legislature. 
Lindstedt said he would work to prioritize protecting public benefits like Medicaid and Colorado’s paid family leave, clean air and water, and funding for K-12 education.
U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, a Lafayette Democrat, nominated Lindstedt in the vacancy committee meeting. 
“No one can fill Faith’s incredibly large shoes, but I am convinced that William Lindstedt will be an incredible, incredible public servant for the people of Colorado Senate District 25,” Neguse said. 
Lindstedt is subject to a state ethics complaint alleging he and other moderate Democrats in the Colorado Legislature accepted payment for luxury resort expenses at an October gathering with lobbyists in Vail. 
Winter, a Broomfield Democrat, died during a multi-vehicle car crash on Interstate 25 south of Denver on Nov. 26. Winter was the only one in her car, and her blood alcohol level was above the legal limit when she died. 
Another vacancy committee will need to convene to select a replacement for Lindstedt in House District 33, which is centered in Broomfield. 
The Legislature will convene for its 2026 session on Jan. 14.

(Photo courtesy Lanny Hartmann)Maryland is delaying a new inspection fee for electric vehicle chargers that was set to take effect next week, amid concerns that the payments could slow chargers’ rollout in the state.
The Maryland Department of Agriculture, which is planning to inspect public chargers for functionality and accuracy, announced Tuesday that it won’t require charger owners to pay the fee of $150 per port until July 1 — as opposed to Jan. 1 was originally planned.
Electric vehicle advocates have argued that the fee could compel Maryland businesses to install fewer chargers — or even rip out existing chargers to avoid incurring the fees. They worry in particular about chargers installed at housing complexes around the state, which are mainly intended for residents’ use and often do not generate anywhere near the same profit as a fast charger installed along a busy highway corridor.
The Agriculture Department has argued that because the chargers are public, and charge consumers a fee, they ought to be regulated just like any others. And the state says the fee is set at $150 per port because testing EV chargers comes at a fairly high cost: Inspectors plan to use an expensive piece of equipment called a “standard,” and they have to pay for the power they consume during testing.
Maryland’s EV charger inspection program rolls on, despite consumer, industry pushback

But the department issued a number of clarifications in its news release Tuesday, adding that multi-unit dwellings can receive exemptions if they meet a number of conditions. Equipment, for example, must be exclusively designated for residents of the complex, and cannot be accessible to members of the public. It must have signage stating as such, and it cannot be advertised on public websites as an available charging location.
Chargers located at workplaces can also be exempt if they are designated only for employees and located in areas restricted to employees. Chargers at private residences and free chargers are automatically exempt.
“The decision to extend the registration deadline to July 1, 2026, will allow the department to facilitate more extensive and meaningful dialogue with the electric vehicle charging industry, local governments, and the community at large,” Maryland Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks said in a news release.
“This extended timeline will allow us to incorporate critical feedback and make the necessary formal amendments to the program’s structure and regulations, ensuring the program is effective, fair, and supportive of the state’s electric vehicle adoption goals while meeting the practical needs of all stakeholders,” his statement said.
Some in the EV charging industry, though, remain concerned that the new fee will be prohibitive, and stymie the state’s effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through greater use of electric vehicles.
Robert Borkowski, owner of Plug IO, an EV-charging company focused on installations at housing and condo complexes, said he recently received an exemption for chargers he is installing in Frederick. But he’s concerned that many multi-unit dwellings won’t be able to meet the requirements to become exempt. It may be difficult for the complexes to prevent members of the public from using their chargers, for example.
“The requirements are extremely restrictive,” Borkowski said in an email.
Borkowski also argued that complexes should be allowed to list chargers on their websites.
“How else would potential residents learn about the property’s EV charging infrastructure?” Borkowski said. “Why penalize MUDs [multi-unit dwellings] for promoting their forward-thinking properties and supporting Maryland’s goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?”

The imperiled bird has been “screwed over” in the last decade, critics say, but Wyoming’s grouse leader says conservation remains intact despite feds' changes.
The post Greater sage grouse advocates blast new federal plan endorsed by Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","Conservationists blasted a federal rewrite of a sage grouse protection plan endorsed by Wyoming, saying it strips safeguards from Wyoming’s fabled Golden Triangle, site of the world’s largest breeding ground for the imperiled bird.
The Bureau of Land Management on Monday released its rewrite of plans governing the use and development of about 50 million acres of public land in eight Western states, including 26.6 million acres in Wyoming. The framework for Equality State management spans 66 pages, not counting maps and appendices, and applies to an area larger than Kentucky.
Conservationists criticized the rewrite as “reckless” and “a holiday gift to private industry,” while promising to sue the Trump administration.
“We’re not letting these dancing birds go without a fight, so we’ll see Trump in court.” Randi Spivak
“Every president starting with Obama has screwed over these iconic Western birds,” Randi Spivak, public lands policy director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “We’ll keep fighting until these beautiful dancing birds and the places they live get the protection they deserve.”
The new plan for Wyoming reflects updated scientific information, changing land uses and local habitat, Wyoming’s acting BLM director Kristina Kirby wrote in the document’s introduction. The regulations meet the BLM’s multiple-use mandate, conserve grouse, avoid endangered-species listing and minimize regulatory burdens, she wrote.
Bob Budd, chairman of Wyoming’s Sage Grouse Implementation Team, said he feels good about the federal plan and Wyoming’s own gubernatorial sage grouse core-area order. “Protections are still there,” Budd said. “The commitment to manage [for conservation] is as strong as it’s ever been.”
In revising the plans, the BLM deferred to states, including Wyoming, which started addressing grouse conservation decades ago. “The BLM accepted the State of Wyoming’s recommendation to use their existing adaptive management approach,” she wrote.
The state with the most
Wyoming possesses the highest concentrations of greater sage grouse in the world. It is home to almost 40% of the bird’s population. Because of long-term declines — down nearly 80% between 1968 and 2023, according to the Center for Biological Diversity — the grouse were eligible for federal protection under the Endangered Species Act in the early 2010s.
To save the species, the government employed BLM management plans instead of a more sweeping ESA listing. But, “many protective measures from the 2015 plans were never implemented and the plans were again revised and further weakened in 2018 and in 2024,” the Center for Biological Diversity said in a statement.

Conservation groups say safeguards are now further undermined. “Endangered Species Act protection for the bird will probably be necessary,” Eric Molvar, executive director of Western Watersheds Project, said in a statement.
The groups say reductions in required “hiding cover” — standards that require seven inches of grass in nesting areas — is one shortcoming.
“Science-based grass-height standards for grazing management have been eliminated, potentially allowing livestock to remove the tall grasses and shrubs that provide essential concealment during nesting season,” WildEarth Guardians’ Endangered Species Advocate Joanna Zhang said in a statement.
Under the new plan, the Golden Triangle would no longer be designated as an “area of critical environmental concern.” That swath of sagebrush sea northeast of Farson that’s about 40 miles on each side is home to the largest sage grouse breeding ground or lek in the world.
BLM protections in the previous management plan covering the Golden Triangle were one factor that led the agency last week to reject a nomination to develop a 2,194-acre parcel there. An oil and gas prospector sought rights to lease the plot that’s within two miles of the Divide Lek.
The plan also removes a development prohibition called “no surface occupancy” from key sage grouse habitat, critics say. That opens the landscape to potential “surface disturbance” — the bulldozing of sagebrush for roads, pipelines and drilling rigs.
“This will result in emptying public lands of sage grouse and other sensitive wildlife,” Molvar said.
“We’re not letting these dancing birds go without a fight,” Spivak added. “So we’ll see Trump in court.”
Core-area strategy remains
Gov. Mark Gordon said the plan acknowledges six decades of Wyoming conservation — leadership spanning three gubernatorial terms. “We will continue to invest in sage-grouse conservation alongside responsible development,” he said in a statement.
Budd further defined Wyoming’s protections and how they will conserve greater sage grouse. Regarding the 7-inch hiding cover, he said that’s not something that can be attained everywhere every year.
The 7-inch standard creates “a false narrative that can’t be met,” Budd said.
Instead, “what you manage for is healthy ecosystems,” he said. “That’s now what we have in the new version.”
The Golden Triangle remains protected as part of Wyoming’s core-area strategy, Budd said. Removing “no-surface occupancy” restrictions doesn’t mean drilling rigs will move in, he said. The new plan “still allows an NSO, if that’s the best way to protect grouse.”
He couldn’t say whether the new plan would prohibit leasing the recently rejected Golden Triangle parcel. Wyoming’s executive order and core area strategy would not allow a drilling rig “right on top” of the potential lease site, he said.
Directional drilling technology has advanced so it’s possible to access oil and gas from miles away, he said. Drilling remotely might be permitted with various seasonal restrictions, he suggested.
“We wanted to be strategic, surgical and correct things,” Budd said of the state’s involvement in the new rewrite. The adopted changes “addressed the reality that’s out there.”

Delbert Hosemann asked the state Board of Election Commissioners on Friday to file for a stay on a federal judge’s ruling that would lead to special elections for two seats on the Mississippi Supreme Court next year. 
Hosemann, a Republican, made the request in a letter to Gov. Tate Reeves, Attorney General Lynn Fitch and Secretary of State Michael Watson, fellow Republicans who comprise the election board. The request follows a Dec. 19 ruling by Mississippi Northern District federal Judge Sharion Aycock, which gave the Republican-controlled state Legislature until the end of its 2026 regular session to draw new Supreme Court district boundaries.
The ruling should be challenged, Hosemann said, because it could allow the federal court to redraw the boundaries to the court’s “liking,” an outcome that could favor candidates supported by Democrats. 
That’s what happened after a federal three-judge panel last year ordered lawmakers to redraw their districts in three areas of the state to give Black voters a fairer shot at electing candidates of their choice, Hosemann said. He said that was a mistake he doesn’t want repeated 
“Previously, this Board did not request a stay of a similar order to redistrict the Senate and the House districts, allowing the Senate and the House to effectively be redrawn by unconstitutional federal mandates on issues currently before the U.S. Supreme Court brought by other states,” Hosemann said in his letter. “But here we are again.”
Fitch’s office also appealed that ruling and asked the U.S. Supreme Court to sharply curtail the federal Voting Rights Act by declaring private voters cannot sue to prevent discrimination at the ballot box. 
If the U.S. Supreme Court rules in Mississippi’s favor, it would mean only the Department of Justice could sue to enforce the Voting Rights Act. 
With respect to the the ongoing legal battle over the state Supreme Court, the matter stems from a 2022 lawsuit filed by a group of Black voters and candidates. The group in 2022 sued state officials, alleging that Black candidates face unfair difficulties getting elected to the state’s high court.
 In a 105-page ruling in August, Aycock, a President George W. Bush appointee, found that the three Supreme Court districts were drawn in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act. Aycock asked the Legislature to redraw those districts in the future to give Black voters a fair shot at electing candidates of their choice.   
The plaintiffs had requested special elections for seats held by Justice Kenny Griffis and Justice Jenifer Branning. Griffis’s term ends in Jan. 2030, while Branning’s runs through Jan. 2033.
Last year, Branning, a white candidate who described herself as a “constitutional conservative” and was backed by the Republican Party, defeated longtime Justice Jim Kitchens, a white man widely viewed as a candidate supported by Black voters. 
No Black person has ever been elected to the Mississippi Supreme Court without first obtaining an interim appointment from the governor, and no Black person from either of the two other districts has ever served on the state’s high court. 
Hosemann said the federal court ruling could have far-reaching consequences for several elected offices beyond the state Supreme Court. 
“Even ignoring the facts of the ballot box and the inherent constitutional right for the Legislature to draw districts, this case goes even further,” Hosemann said. “It refused to restrict any potential special elections to the two Mississippi Supreme Court districts at issue in favor of ordering the Legislature to redistrict and then the federal court will review the Legislature’s efforts.”
The federal court under this tack could also compel special elections for the Public Service and Mississippi Department of Transportation commissions, Hosemann said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/30121809/Mississippi-Economic-Council-annual-Hobnob16A.jpg,,,2025-12-23 18:58:23.587422

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A Rusk County community that more than two years ago rejected the use of electronic voting machines has agreed to provide them so people with disabilities can vote in federal elections.
The agreement, signed in federal court in Madison earlier this month, ends a lingering legal dispute over voter access in the northern Wisconsin town of Thornapple that prompted a federal investigation.
The case underscores the importance of provisions in the federal Help America Vote Act, enacted in 2002, which includes voting rights guarantees for people with disabilities, according to Lisa Hasenstab, public policy manager for Disability Rights Wisconsin.
“Access to accessible voting is something that is not always a top priority in the mix of everything that has to happen for elections,” Hasenstab told the Wisconsin Examiner on Tuesday. “But it is the law. It’s federal law. and state law as well, that accessible means of voting be provided at every polling place. If at even one polling place that option is not provided, that is a violation of voters’ rights.”
Hasenstab said a variety of voting machine systems include provisions tailored to people with disabilities who have difficulty marking paper ballots. Systems also include headphones for voters who can’t see, so they can  listen to the names of candidates on their ballots.
The Help America Vote Act requires every polling place to include such machines for people who need them, and any voter is able to use them, Hasenstab said.
Thornapple Town Chairman Tom Zelm declined to tell the Wisconsin Examiner in a phone conversation Tuesday why the town had stopped using voting machines and said he would have no comment on the settlement that the town and the U.S. Department of Justice signed in federal court on Dec. 12.
According to a May 13, 2024, report in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the  Thornapple town board voted in June 2023 to stop using electronic voting machines and use only paper ballots.
That same summer, Douglas Frank — profiled in the Los Angeles Times as a purveyor of “baseless claims about suspicious voting trends and secret algorithms used to steal elections” — visited the area, giving talks that stoked conspiracy theories about voting machines, according to several published reports.
After the April 2024 Wisconsin presidential preference primary, a local Democratic Party activist called another town board member to complain about the absence of voting machines that could be used by some people with disabilities. She recorded the call, in which the board member repeated false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump and blamed voting machines. The activist then posted the recording on YouTube.
DOJ lawyers wrote to the town’s chief election officer on May 7, 2024, referring to reports received by the department that the town board “may have voted to remove all electronic voting machines in all elections,” including presidential primary.
The DOJ letter stated that some voters with disabilities had reported their requests to use accessible voting machines in the primary election were not granted. It quoted the Help America Vote Act’s requirement for all polling places to include systems that enable voters with disabilities to cast their ballots.
The Lawrence Town Board in Brown County also passed a measure in 2023 to stop using voting machines. Lawrence reversed its decision Sept. 9, 2024, according to DOJ, and signed an agreement with the feds to comply with HAVA.
Thornapple did not reverse its voting machine ban, and DOJ sued the town. That October a federal judge issued an injunction, requiring the town to use accessible voting machines in the November 2024 election.
Separately, the Wisconsin Elections Commission ordered the town and its elections clerk to “take affirmative steps” and comply with Wisconsin’s law that also requires accessible electronic voting equipment at polling places to accommodate people with disabilities.
The town appealed the federal court injunction, losing before the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in July.
Under the Dec. 12 settlement, Thornapple and the town’s election officials “will ensure their voting systems are accessible to people with disabilities as required by HAVA.” The deal requires the town to use an electronic voting system “or other voting system equipped for individuals with disabilities at each polling place in the state, for each election for federal office.”
Town officials are also required to be trained on how to implement accessible voting systems that comply with HAVA, to keep the equipment in working order and provide all software and other updates. The deal also requires them to certify after every federal primary and general election that they have complied with the agreement.
Because the cases was originally pursued by the DOJ in the last year of President Joe Biden’s term, Hasenstab acknowledged that voting rights advocates watched the progress of the case with some concern after President Donald Trump took office and began reversing many Biden administration policies.
“We did have some nervousness that they wouldn’t pursue a final resolution to the case,” Hasenstab said Tuesday. “We’re pleasantly surprised that an agreement ended up being reached and that the Department of Justice stuck with that case.”

(Getty Images)A former nursing home owner pardoned by President Donald Trump asked a judge Tuesday for a delay before he has to report to an Arkansas prison to serve his state sentence, citing concerns that the state would be unable to meet his religious dietary needs.
Attorneys for Joseph Schwartz asked a judge for an extension to her order that he report to the Arkansas Department of Corrections by December 29. 
Schwartz, of New York, was three months into a three-year federal sentence for tax fraud when President Donald Trump pardoned him in November. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Karen Whatley last week ordered Schwartz to report to the Ouachita River Correctional Unit to serve out the remainder of his one-year sentence for his state conviction on Medicaid fraud and tax evasion charges.
Attorney General Tim Griffin earlier this month filed a petition seeking that Schwartz serve out the rest of his state sentence. 
Schwartz’s one-year Arkansas sentence was to run concurrently with his federal sentence, according to his plea deal with the state. Whatley had rejected Schwartz’s argument that the three months he served in federal prison made him immediately eligible for state parole.
In Tuesday’s filing, Schwartz’s attorneys said as a rabbi, he must adhere to a strict kosher diet. 
He’s restricted to a stricter form of kosher meat, not just from eating pork, according to the court filing.
“Schwartz does not believe the Arkansas Department of Corrections is sufficiently prepared to care for him and meet his religious and dietary needs while in custody,” Schwartz’s attorneys said in the filing.
Griffin’s office dismissed the motion as a delay tactic and said they would oppose the motion.
“Joseph Schwartz’s motion is a baseless attempt to delay completing his sentence,” spokesman Jeff LeMaster said in an email. “We have confirmed that the Department of Corrections has a kosher kitchen ready to meet Schwartz’s dietary needs.”
Schwartz pleaded guilty last year in federal court for his role in a $38 million tax fraud scheme involving nursing homes he owned across the country. He was pardoned by Trump in November.

Officials will also start using the map to assess fees on property owners in high-risk areas to help conduct assessments meant to minimize risk. 
Statewide, about 60,000 structures in Utah have been deemed “high risk” for wildfires. That’s according to a new online map the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands released last week. 
By plugging in their addresses to the tool called the Utah Wildfire Risk Explorer, Utahns can generate a report on how likely it is that their homes could be impacted by a wildfire. The site also suggests actions homeowners can take to better protect their property.

“Our goal is to empower homeowners, communities, fire departments, and municipalities to act in reducing their vulnerability to wildfire by giving them the necessary tools to identify and understand their wildfire risk,” the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands says on the website. 
State officials were required to build the tool after the 2025 Utah Legislature passed HB48, a law meant to increase wildfire risk awareness and encourage property owners to “share the responsibility of reducing that risk” in wildland urban interface areas, or areas where homes or other structures border or mingle with undeveloped wildlands. 
The Utah Legislature passed the law as wildfires in the West have increased in frequency and severity. Insurers have also raised premiums and created stricter eligibility requirements. 
Utah’s record-breaking fire year, in numbers

“Insurance availability and affordability are concerns for property owners in Utah, and many are already experiencing increased premiums or losing coverage as insurers respond to wildfire risk,” the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire & State Lands says on its website.
Under the law, which takes effect Jan. 1, property insurers are required to use the map to determine a property’s wildfire risk. 
“If an insurer raises rates by 20% or more, or drops coverage due to wildfire risk, it must provide notice and justification based on the facts underlying the decision, if requested by the property owner,” according to the division.
The new law also requires the state to assess property fees within the high-risk wildland urban interface boundary to help support risk assessments. Utahns will only be charged a fee if they own a taxable structure within the map’s High Risk Wildland Urban Interface boundary. 
Starting in 2026 and 2027, the fee will range from $20 to $100 per structure, based on square footage of taxable structures on the property, according to the division’s frequently asked questions page on HB48. 
If property owners take actions to reduce their wildfire risk, the fee may be reduced, the website says.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson on Tuesday threw his support behind a proposed income tax on residents earning more than $1 million annually, and said he’s prepared to sign the policy into law next year. 
Some legislative Democrats are eyeing a 9.9% “millionaires tax” on adjusted annual gross income over $1 million. Ferguson endorsed this version of the proposal. Less than 0.5% of Washingtonians would be subject to the tax, and it’s expected to raise $3 billion per year. 
The revenue wouldn’t hit state coffers until 2029, Ferguson said. On Tuesday, the governor also released a spending proposal for the remainder of the current two-year budget cycle, which seeks to address a shortfall his office pegs at $2.3 billion through mid-2027. 
To have Ferguson’s support, he said the new tax must be used to increase eligibility and payments under the state’s Working Families Tax Credit, which is open to low- and middle-income households. It also has to allow for tax relief for the state’s small businesses. And he wants it to bolster K-12 education and reduce sales taxes.
Ferguson, a Democrat, said it’s too soon to know if adding the income tax would put the state on a sustainable budget path that diminishes the need for further cuts or tax hikes like those approved earlier this year.
He said he is “optimistic” the Legislature will approve the tax next year. 
But the work won’t be done at that point. 
“When we’re here for a bill signing, hopefully here in a couple months, it’s inevitable that two things will happen,” he said in a press conference at the state Capitol. “There will be a court challenge, for sure, right? And ultimately it’ll go before the voters.”
Ferguson, a former three-term state attorney general, said he’s confident courts would uphold the new levy, even though the state Supreme Court has ruled that income taxes are unconstitutional. 
Less than two years ago, the Legislature approved an initiative to prohibit an income tax. And voters have repeatedly rejected income taxes over the years.
Republicans are opposed. 
Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, called the income tax idea a “nonstarter” given legal precedent and the 2024 initiative. He also said the proposal avoids “doing the hard work of stopping the spending addiction in Olympia.” And he fears lawmakers would later apply the tax more widely.
“People don’t want an income tax,” said Couture, the lead budget voice among House Republicans.
Ferguson said he’s open to an amendment to the state constitution codifying the $1 million threshold for the income tax, while setting it to rise with inflation.
“I want to be clear that I will not support an income tax for people who make less than $1 million in a year,” he added.
Progressives have been clamoring for an income tax on higher earners. They see it as a way to reduce the tax burden on lower-income households and to avoid further cuts to services.
“He’s looking at the same numbers we are and realizes we have to do something,” said House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle.
Ferguson’s position is a shift from a couple months ago when he said he was “skeptical” of additional revenue measures after signing off on billions of dollars in new taxes in May to fill a budget shortfall. 
If the tax is adopted, Ferguson said he wants to explore limiting sales taxes on personal hygiene products, like shampoo, deodorant and toothpaste, as well as eliminating the levies on baby products, like formula and diapers, and “essential and affordable clothing items.”
“Progressive tax reform cannot just mean increasing contributions from those who can afford it,” Ferguson said. “We must use the gains from the millionaires tax to return money directly to working families and small business owners who have been hit hard by the affordability crisis.”
Fitzgibbon said while his caucus has “a lot of enthusiasm” for the tax, he doesn’t think his colleagues would confine the tax to the uses the governor outlined.
Couture has filed a bill ahead of the legislative session that would require the state to reduce its sales tax commensurate with any tax on income.

Ferguson also said his position hasn’t changed on the so-called wealth tax that progressives have pushed for. Earlier this year, he rejected the idea when legislative Democrats backed it to balance their budget proposals. The governor warned it was untested and could get held up in court without delivering needed revenue. 
At the time, he left the door open to a scaled-back version bringing in no more than $100 million per year to see if it would survive challenges. 
He also said Tuesday he’s “not a big fan” of a statewide tax modeled on the city of Seattle’s payroll levy on companies. Progressives have identified that as another option for raising more state revenue and reducing financial pressures on lower earners. 
Lawmakers will convene for a 60-day legislative session beginning Jan. 12.

Eagle Nest Lake State Park’s Polar Bear Plunge is a free annual event sponsored by the volunteers at Friends of Eagle Nest Lake and Cimarron Canyon State Parks that invites people to brave the freezing temperatures and jump into the lake. The event is part of America’s State Parks First Day Hikes, an event that encourages people to kick off the new year by spending time outdoors enjoying the various landscapes. 
According to the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, all 35 New Mexico state parks participate in the First Day Hikes with various activities. For example, Storrie Lake State Park in Las Vegas also hosts a Polar Bear Plunge and the Rio Grande Nature Center State Park offers a New Year’s Day Nature Walk.

Gail Tate has plunged into Eagle Nest Lake two years in a row and was preparing to take her third plunge in just a few days. However, she told Source New Mexico that because the season has been warmer than usual, there’s no ice in the water. Still, she’s looking forward to taking part in the tradition, calling it a “polar run” this year.
“I had always wanted to do [a plunge]. It was on my bucket list,” Tate said. “But I had envisioned jumping into a swimming pool…. I thought one of those days I would do it, and then finding out that Eagle Nest does it every year, I thought, ‘I’m going to do that, I’m going to take the plunge, no pun intended.’”
Participants register the day of and must wear shoes as they prepare to hop in two-at-a-time into the popular fishing lake. Tate said the water comes up to about her shoulders. Plungers are quickly directed to a nearby ladder by safety personnel so they can climb out and step into towels and robes to warm back up. Participants can also bring a partner or make a friend while they’re there to hold their belongings while they’re in the water.
As a seasoned plunger and now a member of the Friends board, Tate encourages everyone she comes across to try it out for themselves and join in the “jovial” mood.
“It’s just the courage and the willingness to go out there and do it,” she said. “[The first time] was such a spiritual experience. I came out and I stood around and watched all the other plungers and cheered them on. I was totally warm because again, I got my robe on, I put my towel around my neck. It was so exhilarating. I can’t describe it, I mean, it’s just beyond.”

People of all ages take the plunge year-to-year, with some traveling to the scenic village from around the state. Tate said about 50 people participate each year, but there are many more locals and visitors who join to cheer on the plungers and enjoy hot cocoa and treats by the park’s wood-burning fireplace.
“These events bring people together and remind us why our state parks matter,” New Mexico State Parks Director Toby Velásquez said in a statement. “New Mexico’s landscapes inspire resilience and adventure, and there’s no better way to begin the year than by experiencing them firsthand.”
People can also join in a Polar Stomp hike near Eagle Nest Lake State Park earlier in the day, before taking a plunge. Other events can be found on the EMNRD event calendar.
“These traditions remind us that our parks are more than destinations,” Velásquez said. “They’re part of who we are as New Mexicans, nuestra gente, nuestras familias, y nuestra historia. We invite everyone to join us, take care of these places and make new memories for the new year ahead.
Regular entree and parking fees still apply for New Year’s Day events.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3721.jpg,,,2025-12-23 18:12:02.432606
